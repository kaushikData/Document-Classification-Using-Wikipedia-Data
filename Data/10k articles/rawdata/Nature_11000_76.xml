'''Ambwene Allen Yessayah''', better known by his stage name as '''A.Y.''', is a Tanzanian [[bongo flava]] artist. He was born on July 5, 1981, in [[Mtwara]], Southern part of [[Tanzania]]. He began his career with the group S.O.G. in 1996. He decided to go solo in 2002. AY is among the first bongo flava artists to commercialize [[hip hop]]. He was member of the musical group known as East Coast Army, but now he's no longer part of the group. He is still releasing songs and albums collaborating most with an ex-coast artist MwanaFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most selling local Hip Hop artiste|url=http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10587|publisher=This Day|accessdate=8 August 2014|date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor Satellite''', or '''ACRIMSAT''' is a defunct satellite and instrument that was one of the 21 observational components of [[NASA]]'s [[Earth Observing System]] program. The instrument followed upon the ACRIM1 and ACRIM2 instruments that were also launched on multi-instrument satellite platforms. ACRIMSAT was launched on 20 December 1999 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] as the secondary payload on the [[Taurus rocket]] that launched [[KOMPSAT]]. It was placed into a high inclination, 700&amp;nbsp;km. [[sun-synchronous orbit]] from which the ACRIM3 instrument monitored total solar irradiance (TSI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://acrim.com/TSI%20Monitoring.htm Composite TSI Time Series]&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with the satellite was lost on 14 December 2013.&lt;ref name="JPL"&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4252 "Sun sets for a NASA solar monitoring spacecraft."] ''Jet Propulsion Laboratory.'' Retrieved: 9 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ACRIM3 made measurements of the [[Solar irradiance|TSI]] since the start of its mission in April 2000. It extended the TSI measurement database begun by earlier ACRIM instruments on the NASA [[Solar Maximum Mission]] (ACRIM1: 1980–1989) and [[Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite]] (ACRIM2: 1991–2001).&lt;ref&gt;[https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/active-cavity-radiometer-irradiance-monitor-satellite "Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor Satellite (ACRIMSAT)."] ''NASA's Earth Observing System.'' Retrieved: 12 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

ACRIMSAT/ACRIM3 tracked TSI during a 2004 [[transit of Venus]] and measured the 0.1% reduction in the solar intensity caused by the planet's shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?doi=10.1086/500427.html |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |issue=641 |pp=565–571 |date=2006 |last1=Schneider |first1=G. |first2=J. M. |last2=Pasachoff |first3=Richard C. |last3=Willson |title=The Effect of the Transit of Venus on ACRIM's Total Solar Irradiance Measurements: Implications for Transit Studies of Extrasolar Planets |doi=10.1086/500427|arxiv=astro-ph/0512251 |bibcode=2006ApJ...641..565S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also recorded data for the [[Transit of Venus, 2012|2012 Transit of Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15820|title=Catalog Page for PIA15820|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2013, ACRIMSAT went silent, with attempts to reestablish contact proving unsuccessful. The mostly likely cause has been attributed to the failure of aging batteries. The defunct spacecraft will remain in orbit for approximately 64 years before returning to Earth.&lt;ref name="JPL"/&gt;

== Team ==
Richard C. Willson was the principal investigator and led the science team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACRIM Staff Information|url = http://acrim.com/staff.htm|website = acrim.com|accessdate = 2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willson designed the [[active cavity radiometer]] type of sensor used by self-calibrating satellite TSI monitoring experiments. The ACRIM3 instrument was a collaboration between Willson, original JPL/ACRIMSAT Project Manager Ronald Zenone and ACRIM3 Instrument Scientist Roger Helizon. The Mission was controlled using the ACRIMSAT tracking station at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|Jet Propulsion Labs]] (JPL) Table Mountain Observatory in Southern California. Co-Investigators were: [[Nicola Scafetta]] (climate impact of solar variability), Hugh Hudson (solar physics)and Alexander Mordvinov (solar physics).

== Technology ==
ACRIMSAT was a spin-stabilized, single-purpose satellite constructed by [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]]. Its total cost, including the instrument, launch, ground station, operations and science team activities during its 14-year mission was less than $50 million.

'''Adakites''' are [[volcanic rock]]s of [[Intermediate composition|intermediate]] to [[felsic]] composition that have [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] characteristics of [[magma]] thought to have formed by [[partial melting]] of altered [[basalt]] that is [[Subduction|subducted]] below [[volcanic arc]]s.&lt;ref name="Defant"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/EHaz/ConvergentPlatesClass/macpherson/defand_drummond_1990.pdf | title=Derivation of some modern arc magmas by melting of young subducted lithosphere |author1=Defant M.J. |author2=Drummond M.S. | journal=Nature | year=1990 | volume=347 | pages=662–665 | doi=10.1038/347662a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=August 2018}} Most magmas derived in subduction zones come from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] above the subducting plate when hydrous fluids are released from minerals that break down in the [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]] basalt, rise into the mantle, and initiate partial melting.  However, Defant and Drummond recognized that when young [[oceanic crust]] (less than 25 million years old) is subducted, adakites are typically produced in the arc.  They postulated that when young oceanic crust is subducted it is "warmer" (closer to the [[mid-ocean ridge]] where it formed) than crust that is typically subducted.  The warmer crust enables melting of the metamorphosed subducted basalt rather than the mantle above.  Experimental work by several researchers has verified the geochemical characteristics of "slab melts" and the contention that melts can form from young and therefore warmer crust in subduction zones.&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://petrology.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/4/891.short | title=Dehydration Melting of Metabasalt at 8–32 kbar: Implications for Continental Growth and Crust-Mantle Recycling |author1=Rapp R.P. |author2=Watson E.B. | journal=Journal of Petrology | year=1995 | volume=36 | issue=4 | pages=891–931 | doi=10.1093/petrology/36.4.891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] characteristics Defant and Drummond gave for adakites are: 
*[[Silica|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] greater than 56 wt %
*[[Alumina|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] greater than or equal to 15 wt %
*[[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] normally less than 3 wt %
*[[Strontium|Sr]] greater than 400 [[Parts per million|ppm]]
*[[Yttrium|Y]] less than 18 ppm
*[[Ytterbium|Yb]] less than 1.9 ppm
*[[Isotopes of strontium|&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Sr/&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]] usually less than 0.7045

Later Defant and Kepezhinskas reviewed the topic in some detail pointing out that adakites are found associated with many [[mineral deposit]]s including [[gold]] and [[copper]].&lt;ref name="Defant_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/01EO00038/abstract | title=Evidence suggests slab melting in arc magmas |author1=Defant M.J. |author2=Kepezhinskas P. | journal=Eos | year=2001 | volume=82 | issue=6 | pages=65–69 | doi=10.1029/01EO00038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Defant noted that [[Archean]] [[trondhjemite]]s (which make up most of the ancient crust of continents) have similar geochemical characteristics to adakites.&lt;ref name="Drummond"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB095iB13p21503/abstract | title=A model for Trondhjemite-Tonalite-Dacite Genesis and crustal growth via slab melting: Archean to modern comparisons |author1=Drummond M.S. |author2=Defant M.J. | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth | year=1990 | volume=95 | issue=B13 | pages=21503–21521 | doi=10.1029/JB095iB13p21503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that the entire Archean crust may have been derived from the partial melting of subducted oceanic crust during the Archean (&gt; 2.5 billion years ago) because during early earth the temperature of the mantle was much hotter and more oceanic crust was generated and subducted younger.  The proposal has been controversial and is still being argued among the scientific community.  The alternative interpretation is that the [[continental crust]] was derived from the partial melting of lower crustal basalts.  The same idea has also been postulated for the generation of adakites.  However, this hypothesis does not explain the correlation between subducted young crust and adakite eruptions nor the fact that the lower Yb and Y in adakites suggest that [[garnet]] is stable in the source.  Garnet forms only under high pressures within the earth and would not be stable in lower crust below some island arcs that erupt adakites.  See Martin et al. for a more recent summary.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/EHaz/ConvergentPlatesClass/macpherson/martin_etal_2005.pdf | title=An overview of adakite, tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG), and sanukitoid: relationships and some implications for crustal evolution |author1=Martin H. |author2=Smithies R.H. |author3=Rapp R. |author4=Moyen J.-F. |author5=Champion D. | journal= [[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]] | year=2005 | volume=79 | pages=1–24 | doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2004.04.048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low [[magnesium]] adakites may be representative of relatively pure partial melting of a subducting basalt, whereas high magnesium adakite or high magnesium [[andesite]]s may represent melt contamination with the [[peridotite]]s of the overlying [[mantle wedge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.the-conference.com/JConfAbs/1/497.html |title=R.

The '''Air Quality Health Index'''  or  ('''AQHI''') is a scale designed in [[Canada]] to help understand the impact of [[air quality]] on health. It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution. The Air Quality Health Index also provides advice on how to improve air quality by proposing behavioral change to reduce the [[environmental footprint]]. This index pays particular attention to people who are sensitive to air pollution. It  provides them with advice on how to protect their health during air quality levels associated with low, moderate, high and very high health risks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=065BE995-1 |title=Environment Canada - Air - About the Air Quality Health Index |publisher=Ec.gc.ca |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Air quality in [[Canada]] has been historically been reported by the [[Air quality index#United States|USA's Air Quality Index]] in various provinces.  Significantly, AQI values reflect air quality management objectives, which are based on the lowest achievable emissions rate, and not exclusively concern for human health.  The AQHI was created with a different goal - to report on the specific health risks posed by air pollution.  As such, the AQHI represents a paradigm shift in communicating air quality information to the public.

The Air Quality Health Index or "AQHI" is a federal program jointly coordinated by [[Health Canada]] and [[Environment Canada]].  However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities and NGOs.   From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation.

The AQHI has been rolled out across Canada and has replaced the AQI as the public face of air quality information.

Originally launched as a pilot project in the [[British Columbia Interior]] and [[Nova Scotia]] in 2005, it is currently implemented in 103 communities across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=450C1129-1 |title=Environment Canada - Air - National Map |publisher=Ec.gc.ca |date=2016-06-08 |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ''Air Quality Health Index'' provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice.

As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as ‘low’, ‘moderate’, ‘high’ or ‘very high’, and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Formula inputs==
The formulation of the national AQHI is based on the observed relationship of [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ground-level [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|fine particulate matter]] (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) with mortality from an analysis of several Canadian cities. Significantly, all three of these pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially among those with pre-existing health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= A new multipollutant, no-threshold air quality health index based on short-term associations observed in daily time-series analyses|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=18376646 | volume=58 |journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc |pages=435–50 | last1 = Stieb | first1 = DM | last2 = Burnett | first2 = RT | last3 = Smith-Doiron | first3 = M | last4 = Brion | first4 = O | last5 = Shin | first5 = HH | last6 = Economou | first6 = V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing the AQHI, Health Canada’s original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants: airborne particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation.

The AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, [[pollen]], dust, heat or humidity.

==Calculation==
The national AQHI is based on three-hour average concentrations of ground-level ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).  O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are measured in parts per billion (ppb) while PM2.5 is measured in micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

The AQHI is calculated on a community basis (each community may have one or more monitoring stations).

First, the average concentration of the 3 substances (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PM2.5) is calculated at each station within a community for the 3 preceding hours.  This is considered valid only if at least 2 out of 3 hours are available at the station.  If more than 1 of the preceding 3 hours is missing the station average is set to "Not Available".  This part of the process results in three "station parameter averages" for each station.

Second, the 3 hour "community average" for each parameter is calculated from the 3 hour substance averages at the available stations.  If no stations are available for a parameter, that parameter is set to "Not Available".  This part of the process results in 3 community parameter averages.

Third, if all three community parameter averages are available, a community AQHI is calculated.  The formula is:

&lt;math&gt;AQHI=(\frac{1000}{10.4})\times[(e^{0.000537\times O_3}-1)+(e^{0.000871\times NO_2}-1)+(e^{0.000487\times PM_{2.5}}-1)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stieb|first=David M.|last2=Burnett|first2=Richard T.|last3=Smith-Doiron|first3=Marc|last4=Brion|first4=Orly|last5=Shin|first5=Hwashin Hyun|last6=Economou|first6=Vanita|date=24 Jan 2012|title=A New Multipollutant, No-Threshold Air Quality Health Index Based on Short-Term Associations Observed in Daily Time-Series Analyses|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3155/1047-3289.58.3.435|journal=Journal of the Air &amp; Waste Management Association|volume=58|pages=435–450|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result is then rounded to the nearest positive integer; a calculation less than 0.5 is rounded up to 1.

==Alberta calculation and reporting differences==
[[Alberta]] has modified AQHI reporting to better suit the needs of the Province. Because of Alberta's energy based economy other pollutants are also considered when reporting the AQHI.

Alberta also has rapidly changing air quality conditions quite often (for example during wildfire season) so, Alberta’s AQHI needs to be more responsive than the national AQHI, which is based on a three-hour average.

In order to meet these needs, the individual pollutant concentrations are compared to Alberta’s Ambient Air Quality Objectives (AAQOs). The national AQHI is used most of the time; however, if hourly air pollutant concentrations are higher than Alberta’s AAQOs, the AQHI value is replaced (overridden) with the appropriate “High” or “Very High” risk value. This can occur for the following pollutants (when they exceed the noted concentrations):
* 80 micrograms per cubic metre for fine particulate matter
* 82 parts per billion for ozone
* 159 parts per billion for nitrogen dioxide
* 172 parts per billion for sulphur dioxide
* 13 parts per million for carbon monoxide
* 1 part per million for hydrogen sulphide and total reduced sulphur&lt;ref name="alberta1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.alberta.ca/03603.html |title=How is AQHI Reporting Enhanced in Alberta? – Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development |publisher=Environment.alberta.ca |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925202706/http://environment.alberta.ca/03603.html |archivedate=2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alberta, special community messaging is used when the level of specific pollutants is higher than specified odour or visibility thresholds but the AQHI is rated as “Low” or “Moderate” risk. This messaging is used for the following pollutants (when they exceed the noted concentrations):
* 25 micrograms per cubic metre for fine particulate matter (based on visibility)
* 100 parts per billion for sulphur dioxide (based on odour)
* 10 parts per billion for hydrogen sulphide or total reduced sulphur (based on odour)&lt;ref name="alberta1"/&gt;
This odour/visibility messaging appears as below:

Alberta has developed its own AQHI website at http://airquality.alberta.ca.

==Persons at risk==
The ''AQHI'' is aimed towards two populations: 1. The “general” population; and 2. The “at-risk” populations.  The later consists of children, the elderly and people with existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, such as those with [[asthma]], and people suffering from [[diabetes]], [[heart disease]] or [[lung disease]].

Children are more vulnerable to air pollution: they have less-developed respiratory and defense systems. Because of their size, they inhale more air per kilogram of body weight than adults. Their elevated metabolic rate and young defense systems make them more susceptible to air pollution.

Seniors are also at a higher risk because of the weakening of the heart, lungs and immune system and increased likelihood of health problems such as heart and lung disease.

Exposure to air pollutants can cause a range of symptoms. People with lung or heart disease may experience increased frequency and/or severity of symptoms, and increased medication requirements. It is recommended that those susceptive should take greater precautions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=8727DF6F-1 |title=Environment Canada - Air - Are you at risk? |publisher=Ec.gc.ca |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle==
[[Environment Canada]] recommends looking for outdoor air quality by checking the ''AQHI'' in your community before heading off to work or play as well as to use the forecasts to plan activities, whether over the next hour or the next day. Seniors, parents, those with asthma, and people suffering from diabetes, heart or lung disease, can use the ''AQHI'' to assess the immediate risk air pollution poses on their health and take steps to lessen that risk.  The ''AQHI'' is also recommended for healthy, fit and active people to consult to decide when it is best to exercise or work outdoor.

The best way for someone to use the ''AQHI'' is to regularly check the current index value, to pay attention to personal symptoms and self-calibrate to the reported current ''AQHI'' value. For example, if symptoms are experienced when the index is a 6, then precaution should be taken when the index is at a 6 or higher by following the corresponding health messages. Then, when an individual knows what number triggers health symptoms, to get in the habit of checking the maximum forecast to plan activities ahead of time.

The ''AQHI'' is easily accessible via the web:  At http://www.airhealth.ca and http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e.html.  The AQHI is also available for download as a desktop widget for Windows and Mac, and iPhone app, http://mirtchovski.com/code/AQHI.html.  There are several news feeds and blogs dedicated to the AQHI: http://www.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=C7B2359F-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25183">The '''eastern savannas of the United States''' covered large portions of the southeast side of the continent until the early 20th century.  These were in a [[fire ecology]] of open grassland and forests with low ground cover of herbs and grasses.
[[File:Grand Bay NOAA Nerr0754.jpg|thumb|Maritime slash pine savanna]]

The frequent fires which maintained the [[savanna]]s were started by the region's many [[thunderstorm]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, with most fires burning the forest understory and not affecting the mature trees above.

In the southern pine savanna, each area burned about every 1–4 years; after settlers arrived burning happened about every 1–3 years.  In [[oak]]–[[hickory]] areas, estimates range from 3 to 14 years, although trails were kept open with fire.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;

== Prehistoric southeastern flora ==
Of all the United States, southeastern flora has been least changed in composition during the last 20,000 years. During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] about 18,000 years ago, when the glacial front extended south to the approximate location of the [[Ohio River]], preexisting natural communities in the Southeast remained largely intact. As a result, the Southeast contains a high level of endemism and genetic diversity as would be expected of an old flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Predicting Pleistocene climate from vegetation in North America |journal=  Climate of the Past  |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=109-118 |url=http://www.clim-past.net/3/109/2007/cp-3-109-2007.pdf |first1=C. |last1=Loehle |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Temperate deciduous forest]]s dominated from about 33° to 30° N. latitude, including most of the glacial Gulf Coast from about 84° W. longitude.  The coastline later changed during glacial melt, both in the Mississippi River valley and [[sea level rise]] of {{Convert|130|meters|}}. Regional climate was similar to or slightly drier than modern conditions. Oak, hickory, [[American chestnut|chestnut]], and southern pine species were abundant. [[Walnut]]s, [[Fagus grandifolia|beech]], [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweetgum]], [[alder]], [[birch]], [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]], [[elm]]s, [[hornbeam]]s, [[tilia]]s, and others that are generally common in modern southern deciduous forests were also common then.  [[Poaceae|Grass]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s, and [[Asteraceae|sunflower]]s were also common.  Extensive [[Mesophyte|mesophytic]] forest communities, similar to modern lowland and bottomland forests, occurred along major river drainages, especially the Mississippi embayment, the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa Basin, the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin, and the [[Savannah River]] Basin.&lt;ref name="Owen2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/sustain/report/terra2/terra2.htm|title=Chapter 2 (TERRA–2): The History of Native Plant Communities in the South|last=Owen|first=Wayne|year=2002|work=Southern Forest Resource Assessment Final Report|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station|accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans arrived as five thousand years passed following the retreat of the glaciers, while deciduous forests expanded northward throughout the region.  Pockets of boreal elements remained only at high elevations in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and in a few other refuges.  Broadleaf evergreen and pine forests occupied an extent similar to their current one, primarily in the [[Atlantic coastal plain|Atlantic Coastal Plain]].  Mesophytic and bottomland forest communities continued to occupy the major river drainages of the region.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;

Although the major modern community types were flourishing in the Southeast by 10,000 years BP, and the climate was similar to that today, the understory flora had not yet come to resemble modern herbaceous floras. Mixed hardwood forests dominated the majority of the upper Coastal Plains, [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], and lower mountain regions. southern pine communities dominated the middle and lower Coastal Plains, whereas evergreens and some remnant boreal elements occupied higher elevation sites. There were few canopy openings in the mixed hardwood and high-elevation forest.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;

Warming and drying during the [[Holocene climatic optimum]] began about 9,000 years ago and affected the vegetation of the Southeast.  Extensive expansions of prairies and savannas occurred throughout the region, and xeric oak and oak-hickory forest types proliferated.  Cooler-climate species migrated northward and upward in elevation; many vanished from the region during this period while others were limited to isolated refuges.  This retreat caused a proportional increase in pine-dominated forests in the Appalachians. The grasslands and savannas of the time expanded and were also linked to the great interior plains grasslands to the west of the region.  As a result, elements of the prairie flora became established throughout the region, first by simple migration, but then also by invading disjunct openings (including glades and barrens) that were forming in the canopy of more mesic forests.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;

During most of the climatic shifts of the last 100,000 years, most plant migration in Eastern North America occurred along a more or less north-south axis. The climate optimum was significant because it made conditions favorable for the invasion and establishment of species from the center of the continent.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;

After the end of the optimum about 5,000 years BP, as the climate cooled and precipitation increased, species migrated so that communities were reassembled in new forms in which all of the components of the modern southern forests were in place.  The boreal forests of the early [[Quaternary]] enjoyed a modest expansion.  Riparian, bottomland, and wetland plant communities expanded.  Grasslands and savannas contracted and retracted westward.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;

[[File:Prescribed fire GWJNF Steven Q Croy USDAFS 1995.jpg|thumb|Prescribed fire in Virginia, 1995. Many eastern ridgetops were burned by American Indians.]]
At about 4,000 years BP, the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] Indian cultures began practicing agriculture throughout the region.  Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common, and the small-scale felling of trees became feasible.  Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a widespread manner in large portions of the region. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;

{{cquote|For reasons that are unclear, approximately 500 years ago, aboriginal populations declined significantly throughout Eastern North America and more broadly throughout the Americas. … Thus, by the time the first European observers were reporting the nature of the vegetation of the region, it is likely to have changed significantly since the regional peak of Indian influence.

A myth has developed that prior to European culture the New World was a pristine wilderness. In fact, the vegetation conditions that the European settlers observed were changing rapidly because of aboriginal depopulation. As a result, canopy closure and forest tree density were increasing throughout the region.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;}}

== Recent history ==

[[File:Georgia Anonymous Map of 1779.gif|thumb|Pine savanna (pine land) extended to the Atlantic plain (1779 map).]]
The oak-hickory forest of the Northeast was primarily burned by Native Americans, resulting in "oak openings", "barrens", and prairies in the Northeast and the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] of North Carolina.  There was nearly annual burning throughout the Northeast.&lt;ref name=thompson1971&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Daniel Q.|author2=Ralph H. Smith|year=1971|title=The Forest Primeval in the Northeast - A Great Myth?|journal=Proceedings Annual Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference|publisher=Tall Timbers Research Station|location=Tallahassee, Florida|volume=10|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the death of 90% of the native population around 500 years ago, grasslands, savanna, and woodlands succeeded to closed forest.  After European settlement of the region the burning frequency was 2–10 years, with many sites burned annually.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thompson1971 /&gt;  The practice was so common that a North Carolina law in the early 18th century required annual burning of pastures and rangelands every March.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;

In the southeast, [[longleaf pine]] dominated the savanna and open-floored forests which once covered {{convert|92000000|acre|km2}} from Virginia to Texas.  These covered 36% of the region's land and 52% of the upland areas.  Of this, less than 1% of the unaltered forest still stands.&lt;ref name=PIF2001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/plan/pl_03_10.pdf |title=Partners in Flight Bird Conservation Plan for The South Atlantic Coastal Plain (Physiographic Area 03) |last=Hunter |first=William C. |author2=Lori H.

Savannas typically contained grasses that were {{Convert|3–6|feet|4=0}} high.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;

The southeast also had the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]] prairie region, within which was the [[blackland prairie]], a type of [[tallgrass prairie]].&lt;ref name=PIF2001 /&gt;  Much of the Black Belt region was open space. As late as the 1830s, about 11% of the Black Belt region was covered with prairies.&lt;ref name="Barone2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Barone|first=John A.|date=2005-09-20|title=Historical Presence and Distribution of Prairies in the Black Belt of Mississippi and Alabama|journal=Castanea|publisher=Southern Appalachian Botanical Society|volume=70|issue=3|pages=170–183|issn=0008-7475|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4060/is_200509/ai_n15666103/pg_1|accessdate=2008-07-20|doi=10.2179/04-25.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Savanna elimination ==

The English colonists harvested the longleaf pine lumber, finding many uses for it.  The slow-maturing tall straight trees were particularly suitable for shipbuilding and masts, although the lumber and pitch were widely used.  The keel of {{USS|Constitution}} was made from a single longleaf pine log.  [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] decreed that straight pines over {{convert|24|in|mm}} in diameter were the king's property, but the colonists protested by tarring and feathering the official surveyors.  However, harvesting was rather limited until 1900.&lt;ref name=GOBER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.state.al.us/publication/TF_publications/tffall99/products_of_the_longleaf_pine.pdf |title=Products of the Longleaf Pine |last=GOBER |first=JIM R. |accessdate=2008-07-20 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007170731/http://www.forestry.state.al.us/publication/TF_publications/tffall99/products_of_the_longleaf_pine.pdf |archivedate=October 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 20th century, heavy cutover of the southern pine forest, combined with longleaf pine seedling destruction by foraging livestock, eliminated pine regeneration.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GOBER /&gt;  As reflected by the 1924 federal [[Clarke–McNary Act]], fire suppression began to be practiced.  The [[American Forestry Association]]'s "Dixie Crusaders" told the South that burning woods were bad.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biswell|first=Harold|author2=James Agee|title=Prescribed Burning in California Wildlands Vegetation Management |publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|page=86|isbn=0-520-21945-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper industry encouraged growth of loblolly and slash pines.  The probability of catastrophic high-intensity fire increased as dead fuels increased on the forest floor.  Overgrowth shades and stunts longleaf pine seedlings, undergrowth increases, and succession creates the southern mixed hardwood forest where savanna used to be.  Intentional use of fire to manage vegetation began to be accepted again after World War II, and at present about {{convert|6000000|acre|km2}} a year are burned.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;

'''''"En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt..."''''' ("A Friendly Green Does Richly Dress..."), also called '''Sommarpsalm''' ("Summer Hymn"), is a popular 1889 Swedish summer [[hymn]] by the civil servant [[Carl David af Wirsén]], and his only well-known work.

==Summer hymn==
[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Slottsbacken-07 edit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|The summer hymn was sung for the Swedish royal wedding in June 2010.]]

''En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt'' is one of Sweden's best loved summer hymns, whether sung in unison or in parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCos-vDQrvEC&amp;pg=PA252 | title=Strong Experiences with Music | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2011 | accessdate=May 22, 2012 | author=Gabrielsson, Alf. Translated by Rod Bradbury| page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden]] chose the hymn for her [[Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling|wedding]] to Daniel Westling in June 2010.&lt;ref name=SN&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=5503 | title=Stockholm News | work=Crown Princess Couple married | date=19 June 2010 | accessdate=21 May 2012 | author=Jonasson, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the hymn reached the Swedish pop music charts in a recording by [[The Real Group]] on the 2002 album ''{{ill|Stämning|sv|Stämning (album)}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/001553642|title=Stämning|publisher=Svensk mediedatabas|language=Swedish|date=2002|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring a [[Svensktoppen]] hit for six weeks between 15 June and 13 July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/p4/svetop/2002/020615sv.htm|title=Svensktoppen 15 juni 2002|publisher=Sveriges radio|language=Swedish|date=15 June 2002|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/p4/svetop/2002/020720sv.htm|title=Svensktoppen 20 juli 2002|publisher=Sveriges radio|language=Swedish|date=20 July 2002|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Swedish hymnbook to include the hymn was ''{{ill|Nya psalmer 1921|sv}}'', where it was number 644. The melody was composed by S. Gastorius in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;'' Koralbok till Nya psalmer, av konungen medgivna att användas tillsammans med 1819 års psalmbok.'' Nordisk Nodestik- og Tryckkeri, Copenhagen, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; The melody used in most later hymnbooks is from a 1933 choral composition by Waldemar Åhlén (1894–1982).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realgroup.se/attachments/098_stamning_alla_texter.pdf ''En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt'' (Sommarpsalm)(#201)]. Retrieved 22 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evl.fi/psalmbok.nsf/nr/539?OpenDocument Evangelisk-lutherska kyrkan i Finland: Psalmbok (1986)]. (All five verses) Retrieved 22 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016-2017 the melody was used in a [[Länsförsäkringar]] TV commercial film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://markbladet.se/?artikel=201704260827371816|title=Varför psalmen?|publisher=Markbladet|language=Swedish|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Cordelia Edvardson, writing in ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', identifies the hymn as a beloved example of popular poetry, part of the Swedish people's cultural heritage. So for example, she writes, in verse two "the dizzy birds" (''de yra fåglarna'') express the joy of summertime.&lt;ref name=SvD&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/berova-inte-svenska-folket-deras-kulturarv_1463981.svd | title=Svenska Dagbladet: Nyheter | work=Beröva inte svenska folket deras kulturarv | date=16 July 2008 | accessdate=21 May 2012 | author=Edvardson, Cordelia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlhåkan Larsén, reviewing Per Rydén's book about Carl David af Wirsén in ''[[Sydsvenskan]]'', describes Wirsén as a loser on the dark side of literary history, only one of whose poems still survives: the summer hymn, ''En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt''.&lt;ref name=SydSv&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2010-06-08/allt-om-en-loser |title=Sydsvenskan: Kultur &amp; Nöjen |work=Allt om en loser |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=21 May 2012 |author=Larsén, Carlhåkan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Holmberg, writing in ''[[Kristianstadsbladet]]'', notes that the hymn is part of Sweden's summer repertoire, and that people usually sing "only the first three verses, which are a hymn of praise to summer."&lt;ref name=Kristianstadsbladet&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/kultur/article851675/Fraringn-lovsaringng-till-foumlrgaumlngelse.html | title=Kristianstadsbladet: Kultur | work=Från lovsång till förgängelse | date=5 July 2010 | origyear=2004| accessdate=21 May 2012 | author=Holmberg, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, observes Holmberg, the remaining verses are quite different: they give a feeling of decay, with the biblical phrase "[[All flesh is grass]]". The hymn, writes Holmberg, switches repeatedly between life and praise on the one hand, and death and decay on the other. ''En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt'' can be and is used both as a summer hymn and for funerals: but, remarks Holmberg, "I find it hard to imagine an occasion when the hymn is sung in its entirety".&lt;ref name=Kristianstadsbladet/&gt; In fact, Holmberg concludes, while Wirsén is now derided as a dusty permanent secretary to the [[Swedish Academy]], he was actually too bold for us to follow nowadays.&lt;ref name=Kristianstadsbladet/&gt;

==Development of energy policies==
Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1975–1976, creating [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA)]], the country's state-run oil and natural gas company. Along with being Venezuela's largest employer, PdVSA accounts for about one-third of the country's GDP, 50% of the government's revenue and 80% of Venezuela’s exports earnings.

The policy changed in the 1990s, when Venezuela introduced a new oil policy known as Apertura Petrolera, which opened its [[Upstream (oil industry)|upstream oil sector]] to private investments. This facilitated the creation of 32 operating service agreements with 22 separate foreign oil companies, including international oil majors like Chevron, BP, Total, and Repsol-YPF. The role of PdVSA in making national oil policy increased significantly.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]] |url=http://www.oxfordenergy.org/comment.php?9904 |author=Bernard Mommer |title=Changing Venezuelan Oil Policy |date=April 1999 |accessdate=10 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626013542/http://www.oxfordenergy.org/comment.php?9904 |archivedate=26 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, Venezuela adopted the Gas Hydrocarbons Law, which opened all aspects of the sector to private investment.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt;

This policy changed after [[Hugo Chávez]] took the presidential post in 1999. In recent years the Venezuelan government has reduced PdVSA’s previous autonomy and amended the rules regulating the country’s hydrocarbons sector. In 2001, Venezuela passed a new Hydrocarbons Law that superseded the previous 1943 Hydrocarbons Law and 1975 Nationalization Law. Under the 2001 law, royalties paid by private companies increased from 1-17% to 20-30%.&lt;ref name=eia&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Energy Information Agency | url = http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Venezuela/pdf.pdf | title = Country Analysis Briefs.

The ownership separation of power generation, transmission, distribution and supply functions was required by 2003 but still not enforced.

Venezuela's new energy policy implemented by President Chávez in 2005 includes six major projects:
* Magna Reserve;
* Orinoco Project;
* Delta-Caribbean Project;
* Refining Project;
* Infrastructure Project;
* Integration Project.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Business Wire | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_August_7/ai_n16609764 | title = PDVSA to Build Three New Refineries in Venezuela, and Industrial Info News Alert | date = 7 August 2006 | accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Chávez announced the nationalization of the oil industry.&lt;ref name=turkish&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Turkish Weekly |author=Rovshan Ibrahimov |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/comments.php?id=2515 |title=Nationalization Of Oil Sector In Venezuela: Action Or Reaction? |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=10 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824220417/http://www.turkishweekly.net/comments.php?id=2515 |archivedate=24 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreign oil companies were forced to sign agreements giving majority control of hydrocarbons projects to PdVSA. Projects owned by companies like [[ConocoPhillips]] and [[ExxonMobil]], who failed to sign these agreements, were taken over by PdVSA.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Financial Times | author = Benedict Mande | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/776105b8-2417-11dc-8ee2-000b5df10621.html | title = Venezuela takes over US oil projects | date = 26 June 2007 | accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela's oil production has fallen by a quarter since President Chávez took office and falling oil prices have affected the government budget severely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, since 2009, oil prices have surged, and more nations around the world are turning to Venezuela's large oil reserves to boost tight energy supplies: Italy’s [[Eni SpA]], [[Petrovietnam]] and Japanese companies including [[Itochu|Itochu Corp]]. and [[Marubeni|Marubeni Corp]]. have signed on to, or are in negotiations to sign on to, joint-ventures with [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|PdVSA]].&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Cancel|first=Daniel|title=Venezuela Pares China Debt With $20 Billion Oil Accord|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-05/venezuela-cuts-20-billion-china-debt-with-200-000-barrel-shipments-of-oil.html|accessdate=23 June 2011|date=5 August 2010|author2=Corina Rodrigez Pons|agency=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[China National Petroleum Corp]]., or CNPC, also signed a $16.3 billion joint-venture agreement for a project that will eventually pump an additional {{convert|1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} for Asian refineries. Separately, Venezuela has been exporting {{convert|200000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude to China to repay $20 billion of loans extended by the [[China Development Bank|China Development Bank Corp.]] in April 2010 to finance much-needed infrastructure projects in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt;  PdVSA is selling oil at market prices to repay the 10-year loan. Shipments to repay the debt represent half Venezuela’s daily crude exports to China.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt;

==Primary energy sources==

===Oil===
Venezuela has been producing oil for nearly a century and was an [[OPEC]] founder-member. In 2005, Venezuela produced 162 million tons of oil, which is 4.1% of world's total production. By the oil production Venezuela ranks seventh in the world.&lt;ref name=iea&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Energy Agency]] |url=http://www.iea.org/dbtw-wpd/Textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf |title=Key World Energy Statistics &amp;ndash; 2006 Edition |format=PDF |year=2006 |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709212140/http://www.iea.org/dbtw-wpd/Textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela is the world's eight oil exporter and fifth largest net exporter.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt; In 2012, 11 percent of US oil imports came from Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_wimpc_s1_4.htm US imports by country of origin], accessed 8 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, when the heavy oil from the Orinoco Belt was considered to be economically recoverable, Venezuela has had the largest proved reserves of petroleum in the world, about 298 billion barrels.&lt;ref&gt;OPEC, [http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/XL/T31.HTM Proved petroleum reserves], accessed 8 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil accounts for about half of total government revenues. The leading oil company is [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA)]], which according to Venezuelan authorities produces {{convert|3.3|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  However, oil industry analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration believe it to be only 2.8-{{convert|2.9|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}. Venezuela's main oil fields are located at four major sedimentary basins: [[Maracaibo Basin|Maracaibo]], Falcon, [[Apure]], and Oriental. PdVSA has {{convert|1.28|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude oil refining capacity. The major facilities are the [[Paraguaná Peninsula|Paraguaná Refining Center]], [[Puerto la Cruz|Puerto de la Cruz]], and El Palito.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt;

===Natural gas===
[[File:Venezuela Gas Production.png|thumb|Venezuela natural gas production (OPEC)]]

As of 2013, Venezuela has the eighth-largest proved gas reserves in the world and the largest in South America. Proved reserves were estimated at 5.5 trillion cubic meters (tcm).&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, International statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, inadequate transportation and distribution infrastructure has prevented it from making the most of its resources. More than 70% of domestic gas production is consumed by the petroleum industry.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Nearly 35% of gross natural gas output are re-injected in order to boost or maintain reservoir pressures, while smaller
amounts (5%) are vented or flared. About 10% of production volumes are subject to shrinkage as a result of the extraction of NGLs.&lt;ref name=wec2/&gt; The 2010 estimate is {{convert|176|e12cuft|km3}}, and the nation reportedly produced about {{convert|848|e9cuft|m3}} in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;History, “Venezuela,” A&amp;E Television Networks, {{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/venezuela |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308202139/http://www.history.com/topics/venezuela |archivedate=8 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading gas company is PdVSA. The largest private natural gas producer is [[Repsol-YPF]], who supplies 80-megawatt (MW) power station in [[Portuguesa (state)|Portuguesa]], and plans to develop a 450-MW power plant in Obispos.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt;

===Tar sands and heavy oils===
Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, [[bitumen]] and [[tar sands]]) at {{convert|1200|Goilbbl|m3}} approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil. About {{convert|267|Goilbbl|m3}} of this may be producible at current prices using current technology.&lt;ref name=wec/&gt;  The main deposits are located in the [[Orinoco Belt]] in central Venezuela ([[Orinoco tar sands]]), some deposits are also found in the Maracaibo Basin and [[Lake Guanoco]], near the Caribbean coast.&lt;ref name=wec2&gt;{{cite journal|title=Survey of energy resources |publisher=World Energy Council |year=2004 |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2004.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925194158/http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2004.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
Venezuela has recoverable coal reserves of approximately 528 million short tons (Mmst), most of which is bituminous.
Coal production was at 9.254 million short tons as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, “Country Analysis Briefs: Venezuela,” US Energy Information Administration, {{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Venezuela/Full.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024050725/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Venezuela/Full.html |archivedate=24 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most coal exports go to Latin American countries, the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt;

The main coal company in Venezuelas is [[Carbozulia]], a former subsidiary of PdVSA, which is controlled by Venezuela’s state development agency [[Corpozulia]]. The major coal producing region in Venezuela is the Guasare Basin, which is located near the Colombian border. The coal industry development plans include the construction of a railway linking coal mines to the coast and a new deepwater port.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt;

==Electricity==
{{Main article|Electricity sector in Venezuela}}

The main electricity source is hydropower, which accounts for 71% in 2004.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt; A gross theoretical capability of hydropower is 320 TWh per annum, of which 130 TWh per annum is considered as economically feasible.&lt;ref name=wec2/&gt; In 2004, Venezuela produced 70 TWh of hydropower, which accounts 2.5% of world's total.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt; At the end of 2002, total installed hydroelectric generating capacity accounted 13.76 GW with additional 4.5 GW under construction and 7.4 GW of planned capacity.&lt;ref name=wec2/&gt;

Hydroelectricity production is concentrated on the [[Caroní River]] in [[Guayana Region]]. Today it has 4 different dams. The largest hydroplant is the [[Guri Dam|Guri dam]] with 10,200 MW of installed capacity, which makes it the third-largest hydroelectric plant in the world.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Other facilities on the Caroní are [[Caruachi Dam|Caruachi]], [[Macagua I]], [[Macagua II]] and [[Macagua III]], with a total of 15.910 MW of installed capacity in 2003. New dams, [[Tocoma Dam|Tocoma]] (2 160 MW) and Tayucay (2 450 MW), are currently under construction between Guri and Caruachi. With a projected installed capacity for the whole Hydroelectric Complex (upstream Caroni River and downstream Caroni River), between 17.250 and 20.000 MW in 2010.

The largest power companies are state-owned CVG Electrificación del Caroní (EDELCA), a subsidiary of the mining company [[Corporación Venezolana de Guayana|Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG)]], and Compania Anonima de Administracion y Fomento Electrico (CADAFE) accounting respectively for approximately 63% and 18% of generating capacities. Other state-owned power companies are ENELBAR and ENELVEN-ENELCO (approximately 8% of capacities). In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of [[Electricidad de Caracas]] (EDC) from [[AES Corporation]] as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad-hoc-news.de/fitch-downgrades-c-a-la-electricidad-de-caracas-edc-idrs--/de/Unternehmensnachrichten/19938006]&lt;/ref&gt; EDC has 11% of Venezuelan capacity, and owns the majority of conventional thermal power plants.&lt;ref name=iern&gt;{{cite web|publisher=International energy regulation network |url=http://www.iern.net/country_factsheets/market-venezuela.htm |title=Venezuela |date=July 2006 |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929165102/http://www.iern.net/country_factsheets/market-venezuela.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wec3&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Energy Council |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/wec-geis/congress/papers/acostam0904.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081003105819/http://www.worldenergy.org/includes/404.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 October 2008 |author=Manuel Augusto Acosta Pérez |author2=Juan José Rios Sanchez |title=The electric business in Venezuela:restructuring and investment opportunities |date=5 September 2004 |accessdate=10 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the power production is owned by private companies.

The national transmission system (Sistema Inrterconectado Nacional- SIN) is composed by four interconnected regional transmission systems operated by EDELCA, CADAFE, EDC and ENELVEN-ENELCO. Oficina de Operacion de Sistema Interconectados (OPSIS), jointly owned by the four vertical integrated electric companies, operate the SIN under an RTPA regime.&lt;ref name=iern/&gt;

==Environmental issues==
Prolonged oil production has resulted in significant oil pollution along the Caribbean coast. Hydrocarbons extraction has resulted also in the subsiding of the eastern shore of [[Lake Maracaibo]], South America's largest lake. Venezuela is also the region's top emitter of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Regional cooperation==
Venezuela has pushed the creation of [[Petrocaribe|regional oil initiatives for the Caribbean (Petrocaribe)]], the Andean region (Petroandino), and South America (Petrosur), and Latin America (Petroamerica). The initiatives include assistance for oil developments, investments in refining capacity, and preferential oil pricing. The most developed of these three is the Petrocaribe initiative, with 13 nations signed agreement in 2005. Under Petrocaribe, Venezuela will offer crude oil and petroleum products to Caribbean nations under preferential terms and prices. The payment system allows for a few nations to buy oil on [[market value]] but only a certain amount is needed up front; the remainder can be paid through a 25-year financing agreement on 1% interest. The deal allows for the Caribbean nations to purchase up to {{convert|185|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil per day on these terms. In addition it allows for nations to pay part of the cost with other products provided to Venezuela, such as bananas, rice, and sugar.

In 2000, Venezuela and Cuba signed an agreement, which grants Venezuelan oil supplies to Cuba.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt;

In 2006, the construction of the [[Trans-Caribbean gas pipeline]], which will connect Venezuela and [[Colombia]] with extension to [[Panama]] (and probably to [[Nicaragua]]) began. The pipeline will pump [[gas]] from [[Colombia]] to [[Venezuela]] and, after 7 years, from Venezuela to Colombia.&lt;ref name=efe&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Granma International |url=http://news.notiemail.com/noticia.asp?nt=9796101&amp;cty=200 |title=Construction starts on Colombia-Venezuela natural gas pipeline |date=8 July 2006 |accessdate=3 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928062503/http://news.notiemail.com/noticia.asp?nt=9796101&amp;cty=200 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela has also proposed the project of [[Gran Gasoducto del Sur]], which would connect Venezuela with [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=2006ipcr&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal |url=http://www.oildompublishing.com/PGJ/pgj_archive/August06/pipelineconstreport.pdf |title=2006 International Pipeline Construction Report |format=PDF |date=August 2006 |accessdate=12 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928213017/http://www.oildompublishing.com/PGJ/pgj_archive/August06/pipelineconstreport.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some discussion about constructing an oil pipeline to Colombia along the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt;

Venezuela also exports electricity to neighboring countries. Santa Elena/Boa Vista Interconnector permits electricity export to Brazil, and Cuatricenternario/Cuestecitas Interconnector and EI Corozo/San Mateo Interconnector to Colombia.&lt;ref name=iern/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16888">'''Episodic tremor and slip''' ('''ETS''') is a [[seismology|seismological]] phenomenon observed in some [[subduction|subduction zones]] that is characterized by non-[[earthquake]] seismic rumbling, or tremor, and [[slow earthquake|slow slip]] along the plate interface.  Slow slip events are distinguished from earthquakes by their propagation speed and [[hypocenter|focus]]. In slow slip events, there is an apparent reversal of crustal motion, although the fault motion remains consistent with the direction of subduction. ETS events themselves are imperceptible to human beings and do not cause damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Episodic Tremor and Slip beneath Vancouver Island |url=http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/pprs-pprp/re/ETS-eng.php |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100326235707/http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/pprs-pprp/re/ETS-eng.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 March 2010 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |accessdate=17 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[Image:Cascadia earthquake sources.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Structure of the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. The [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] is subducting northeastward under the [[North American Plate]].]]

Nonvolcanic, episodic tremor was first identified in southwest Japan in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obara |first1=Kazushige |last2= |first2= |year=2002 |title=Nonvolcanic Deep Tremor Associated with Subduction in Southwest Japan |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue= |pages=1679–1681 |publisher= |doi= 10.1126/science.1070378|url= |pmid=12040191|bibcode=2002Sci...296.1679O}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after, the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] coined the term "episodic tremor and slip" to characterize observations of [[Global Positioning Satellite|GPS]] measurements in the [[Vancouver Island]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geodynamics – Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS)|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geodyn/ets_e.php|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] – [[Geological Survey of Canada]]|accessdate=17 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604150421/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geodyn/ets_e.php|archivedate=4 June 2011|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver Island]] lies in the eastern, North American region of the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. ETS events in Cascadia were observed to reoccur cyclically with a period of approximately 14 months.&lt;ref name="Rogers2003"&gt;Rogers, G., and H. Dragert (2003), "Episodic tremor and slip on the Cascadia subduction zone: the chatter of silent slip", ''Science'', ''300'' (5627), 1942, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1084783 doi:10.1126/science.1084783].
&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of measurements led to the successful prediction of ETS events in following years (e.g., 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007).  In Cascadia, these events are marked by about two weeks of 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;Hz seismic trembling and non-earthquake ("aseismic") slip on the plate boundary equivalent to a [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 7 earthquake. (Tremor is a weak seismological signal only detectable by very sensitive seismometers.) Recent episodes of tremor and slip in the Cascadia region have occurred [[strike and dip|down-dip]] of the region ruptured in the [[1700 Cascadia earthquake]].

Since the initial discovery of this seismic mode in the Cascadia region, slow slip and tremor have been detected in other subduction zones around the world, including Japan and Mexico.&lt;ref name="Liu2009"&gt;Liu, Y., and J. Rice (2009), Slow slip predictions based on granite and gabbro friction data compared to GPS measurements in Northern Cascadia, ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'', ''114'', B09,407, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JB006142 doi:10.1029/2008JB006142].&lt;/ref&gt;
Slow slip is not accompanied by tremor in the [[Hikurangi Trench|Hikurangi Subduction Zone]].&lt;ref name="Delahaye2009"&gt;Delahaye, E., J. Townend, M. Reyners, and G. Rogers (2009), "Microseismicity but no tremor accompanying slow slip in the Hikurangi subduction zone, New Zealand", ''[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]'', ''277'' (1–2), 21–28, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2008.09.038 doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2008.09.038].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Every five years a year-long quake of this type occurs beneath the [[New Zealand]] capital, [[Wellington]]. It was first measured in 2003, and has reappeared in 2008 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Silent-quake-gently-rocks-Wellington/tabid/1160/articleID/299393/Default.aspx|work=[[3 News NZ]] |title= 'Silent' quake gently rocks Wellington| date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Slip  behaviour===
[[File:Displacement of Albert Head GPS Station, Victoria, British Columbia, 2005-2012.svg|thumb|upright=2|right|GPS measurements from [[Victoria, British Columbia]] show periodic reversals in crustal deformation in the North American region of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.]]

In the Cascadia subduction zone, the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]], a relic of the ancient [[Farallon Plate]], is actively subducting eastward underneath the [[North American Plate]]. The boundary between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates is generally "locked" due to interplate friction.  A GPS marker on the surface of the North American plate above the locked region will trend eastward as it is dragged by the subduction process. [[Geodesy|Geodetic]] measurements show periodic reversals in the motion (i.e., westward movement) of the overthrusting North American Plate.&lt;ref name="Rogers2003" /&gt; During these reversals, the GPS marker will be displaced to the west over a period of days to weeks. Because these events occur over a much longer duration than earthquakes, they are termed "slow slip events".

Slow slip events have been observed to occur in the Cascadia, Japan, and Mexico subduction zones.&lt;ref name="Liu2009" /&gt; Unique characteristics of slow slip events include periodicity on timescales of months to years, [[hypocentre|focus]] near or [[Strike and dip|down-dip]] of the locked zone, and [[Strike and dip|along-strike]] propagation of 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;km/d.&lt;ref name="Liu2009" /&gt; In contrast, a typical earthquake rupture velocity is 70 to 90% of the [[S-wave]] velocity, or approximately 3.5&amp;nbsp;km/s.

Because slow slip events occur in subduction zones, their relationship to [[megathrust]] earthquakes is of economic, human, and scientific importance. The seismic hazard posed by ETS events is dependent on their focus. If the slow slip event extends into the [[Shear zone#General introduction|seismogenic zone]], accumulated stress would be released, decreasing the risk of a catastrophic earthquake.&lt;ref name="Rubinstein2010"&gt;Rubinstein, J., Shelly, D., Ellsworth, W.

(2007), "Slow slip transients along the Oaxaca subduction segment from 1993 to 2007", ''[[Geophysical Journal International]]'', ''171'' (2), 523–538, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03542.x doi:10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03542.x].&lt;/ref&gt; The probability of a great earthquake ([[moment magnitude scale]] &lt;math&gt;M_w \geq 8.0&lt;/math&gt;) occurring has been suggested to be 30 times greater during an ETS event than otherwise,&lt;ref name="Mazotti2004"&gt;Mazzoti, S. and J. Adams (2004), "Variability of near-term probability for the next great earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone", ''Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America'', ''94'', 1954–1959, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1785/012004032 doi:10.1785/012004032].&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent observations have shown this theory to be simplistic.&lt;ref name="Beroza2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beroza | first1 = G.

===Tremor===
Slow slip events are frequently linked to non-volcanic seismological "rumbling", or tremor. Tremor is distinguished from earthquakes in several key respects: frequency, duration, and origin. [[Seismic wave]]s generated by earthquakes are high-frequency and short-lived. These characteristics allow seismologists to determine the [[hypocentre]] of an earthquake using [[Seismic wave#Usefulness of P and S waves in locating an event|first-arrival methods]]. In contrast, tremor signals are weak and extended in duration.&lt;ref name="Shelly2007"&gt;Shelly, D., Berozal, G. and Ide, S (2007), "Non-volcanic tremor and low-frequency earthquake swarms", ''Nature'', ''446'', 305–307, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05666 doi:10.1038/nature05666].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while earthquakes are caused by the rupture of [[Fault (geology)|faults]], tremor is generally attributed to underground movement of fluids (magmatic or hydrothermal).&lt;ref name="Schwartz2007"&gt;Schwartz, S., and J. Rokosky (2007), "Slow slip events and seismic tremor at circum-Pacific subduction zones", ''Reviews of Geophysics'', ''45'' (3), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006RG000208 doi:10.1029/2006RG000208].&lt;/ref&gt; As well as in subduction zones, tremor has been detected in transform faults such as the [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]].&lt;ref name="Nadeau2004"&gt;Nadeau, R. and Dolenc, D. (2004), "Nonvolcanic Tremors Deep Beneath the San Andreas Fault", ''Science'', ''307'' (5708), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1107142 doi:10.1126/science.1107142].&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the Cascadia and [[Nankai Trough|Nankai]] subduction zones, slow slip events are directly associated with tremor.&lt;ref name="Rogers2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Obara2004"&gt;Obara, K., H. Hirose, F. Yamamizu, and K. Kasahara (2004), "Episodic slow slip events accompanied by non-volcanic tremors in southwest Japan subduction zone", ''Geophysical Research Letters'', ''31'' (23), L23,602, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004GL020848 doi:10.1029/2004GL020848].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Cascadia subduction zone, slip events and seismological tremor signals are spatially and temporally coincident,&lt;ref name="Bartlow2011"&gt;Bartlow, N. M., S. Miyazaki, A. M. Bradley, and P. Segall (2011), "Space-time correlation of slip and tremor during the 2009 Cascadia slow slip event", ''Geophysical Research Letters'', ''38'', L18309, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011GL048714 doi:10.1029/2011GL048714]&lt;/ref&gt; but this relationship does not extend to the Mexican subduction zone.&lt;ref name="Payero2008"&gt;Payero, J., V. Kostoglodov, N. Shapiro, T. Mikumo, A. Iglesias, X. Pérez-Campos, and R. Clayton (2008), "Nonvolcanic tremor observed in the Mexican subduction zone", ''Geophysical Research Letters'', ''35'' (7), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL032877  doi:10.1029/2007GL032877]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this association is not an intrinsic characteristic of slow slip events. In the [[Hikurangi Trough|Hikurangi Subduction Zone]], New Zealand, episodic slip events are associated with distinct, [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|reverse-faulted]] microearthquakes.&lt;ref name="Delahaye2009" /&gt;

Two types of tremor have been identified: one associated with geodetic deformation (as described above), and one associated with 5 to 10 second bursts excited by distant earthquakes. The second type of tremor has been detected worldwide; for example, it has been triggered in the San Andreas Fault by the [[2002 Denali earthquake]] and in Taiwan by the [[2001 Kunlun earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Peng2008a"&gt;Peng, Z., Vidale, J., Creager, K., Rubinstein, J., Gomberg, J., and Bodin, P. (2008), "Strong tremor near Parkfield, CA, excited by the 2002 Denali Fault earthquake", ''Geophysical Research Letters'', ''35'', L23305,5, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GL036080 doi:10.1029/2008GL036080].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peng2008b"&gt;Peng, Z., Chao, K.

Tremor is commonly associated with the underground movement of magmatic or hydrothermal fluids.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2007" /&gt; As a plate is subducted into the mantle, it loses water from its [[Porosity|porespace]] and due to phase changes of hydrous minerals (such as [[amphibole]]). It has been proposed that this liberation of water generates a [[supercritical fluid]] at the plate interface, lubricating plate motion.&lt;ref name="Obara2002"&gt;Obara, K. (2002), "Nonvolcanic deep tremor associated with subduction in southwest Japan", ''Science'', ''296'' (5573), 1679, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1070378 doi:10.1126/science.1070378].&lt;/ref&gt; This supercritical fluid may open fractures in the surrounding rock, and that tremor is the seismological signal of this process.&lt;ref name="Obara2002" /&gt; Mathematical modelling has successfully reproduced the periodicity of episodic tremor and slip in the Cascadia region by incorporating this dehydration effect.&lt;ref name="Liu2007"&gt;Liu, Y., and J. Rice (2007), "Spontaneous and triggered aseismic deformation transients in a subduction fault model", ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', ''112'' (10.1029) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JB004930 doi:10.1029/2007JB004930].&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation, tremor may be enhanced where the subducting oceanic crust is young, hot, and wet as opposed to older and colder.

However, alternative models have also been proposed. Tremor has been demonstrated to be influenced by tides or variable fluid flow through a fixed volume.&lt;ref name="Rubinstein2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watanabe2007"&gt;Watanabe, T., Y. Hiramatsu, and K. Obara (2007), "Scaling relationship between the duration and the amplitude of non-volcanic deep low-frequency tremors", ''Geophysical Research Letters'', ''34'' (7) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL029391 doi:10.1029/2007GL029391].&lt;/ref&gt; Tremor has also been attributed to shear slip at the plate interface.&lt;ref name="Rogers2003" /&gt; Recent contributions in mathematical modelling reproduce the sequences of Cascadia and Hikurangi (New Zealand), and suggest in-situ dehydration as the cause for the episodic tremor and slip events.&lt;ref name="Alevizos2014"&gt;Alevizos, S., T.

The '''first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth''' took place from August 1803 to August 1806. It was sponsored by Count [[Nikolay Rumyantsev]], funded by the [[Russian-American Company]], and was headed by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Krusenstern, Adam Ivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its exploratory goals, the expedition was also meant to help establish diplomatic and economic relations between Russia and Japan, for which the party included a large diplomatic delegation headed by Court Chamberlain and Ambassador [[Nikolai Rezanov]].

==Events==
[[File:Rumyan.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Nikolay Rumyantsev]], Russian statesman who sponsored the expedition.]]
[[File:Nadezhda krusenstern.jpg|thumb|The [[sloop]] ''Nadezhda'']]
[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|right|The sloop ''Neva'' visits [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]].]]
After publishing a paper pointing out the advantages of direct communication between Russia and [[China]] by [[Cape Horn]] or the [[Cape of Good Hope]], Krusenstern was appointed by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to make a voyage to the east coast of Asia to endeavour to carry out the project.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Under the patronage of the Tsar, Krusenstern and Rezanov co-led the first Russian [[circumnavigation]] of the world. The purpose of the two-ship expedition was to establish trade with China and [[Japan]], introduce Rezanov as first Russian ambassador to Japan, facilitate trade in [[South America]], and examine [[California]] for a possible colony.

Two ships, ''[[Nadezhda (1802 Russian ship)|Nadezhda]]'' ("Hope", formerly ''Leander'') under the command of Krusenstern, and ''[[Neva (1802 Russian ship)|Neva]]'' (formerly ''Thames'') under the command of Captain-Lieutenant [[Yuri F. Lisianski]] took part in the voyage. Starting from [[Kronstadt]], both ships took a route across the [[Baltic Sea]] and the Atlantic Ocean, past the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Brazil]], after which the ships rounded [[Cape Horn]] and set across the Pacific Ocean towards Japan, making stops at the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands]], and also at [[Kamchatka]]. However, after leaving Hawaii the ships split, and Lisianski headed to [[Russian America|Russian America (Alaska)]].

The visit to Japan was a diplomatic failure, even if as a gesture of good will the Russians brought with them valuable gifts and several Japanese castaways rescued years before in the Russian North Pacific territories (these sailors thus became the first Japanese to circumnavigate the world). Nikolai Rezanov had to cancel his embassy as Japan reaffirmed once more the isolationist ''[[sakoku]]'' ("closed country") policy.

After visiting Japan, ''Nadezhda'' set off towards [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Alaska]], sailed past China and [[Macao]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], then rounded Africa and came back across the Baltic Sea to Kronstadt. The voyage lasted a total of more than three years, from 7 August 1803 to 19 August 19 1806.

In 1804 ''Neva'' visited [[Easter Island]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Katherine Routledge]] refers to page 58 of his book - Voyage round the world in the Ship ''Neva'' Lisiansky, London 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year, was essential in defeating the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] in the [[Battle of Sitka]], Alaska. In 1805 Lisianski met Krusenstern again in [[Macau]], but they soon separated. Also in 1805, he was the first to describe the [[Hawaiian monk seal]] on the [[Lisianski Island|island]] which now bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monachus-guardian.org/factfiles/hawai01.htm Monachus Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Neva'' returned to Kronstadt on 22 July 1806, almost a month before ''Nadezhda''.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Lisyanski received multiple rewards for his circumnavigate, including the [[Order of Saint Vladimir]] of 3rd degree. Both [[Sea explorer|seafarers]] made maps and detailed recordings of their voyages.

Upon his return, Krusenstern wrote a detailed report, ''Reise um die Welt in den Jahren 1803, 1804, 1805 und 1806 auf Befehl Seiner Kaiserliche Majestät Alexanders des Ersten auf den Schiffen Nadeschda und Newa'' (Journey around the World in the Years 1803, 1804, 1805, and 1806 at the Command of his Imperial Majesty Alexander I in the Ships Nadezhda and Neva) published in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1810. It was published in 1811-1812 in [[Berlin]]; this was followed by an English translation, published in [[London]] in 1813, and subsequently by French, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, and Italian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">The '''Gaunt factor''' (or '''Kramers-Gaunt factor''') is used as a multiplicative correction to the continuous absorption or emission results when calculated using [[classical physics]] techniques. In cases where classical physics provides a close approximation, the Gaunt factor can be set to 1.0. It varies from this value in cases where [[quantum mechanics]] becomes important.&lt;ref name=dopita_sutherland2003/&gt;

The Gaunt factor was named after the physicist [[John Arthur Gaunt]], based on his work on the quantum mechanics of continuous absorption.&lt;ref name=baas25_934/&gt; Gaunt used
a 'g' function in his 1930 work, which Chandrasekhar named the 'Gaunt factor' in 1939.&lt;ref name=chandrasekhar1958/&gt; It is sometimes named the Kramers-Gaunt factor as Gaunt incorporated the work of [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5500">A '''hidden state of matter''' is a [[state of matter]] which cannot be reached under [[ergodic]] conditions, and is therefore distinct from known thermodynamic phases of the material.,&lt;ref&gt;Ichikawa, H. et al. Transient photoinduced ‘hidden’ phase in a manganite. Nature Materials 10, 101–105 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stojchevska 2014"&gt;Stojchevska et al., Ultrafast switching to a stable hidden quantum state in an electronic crystal, Science 344, 177, (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples exist in condensed matter systems, and are typically reached by the non-ergodic conditions created through laser photo excitation.&lt;ref name="Tokura"&gt;Tokura, Y. Photoinduced Phase Transition: A Tool for Generating a Hidden State of Matter. J. Phys. Soc. Jpn 75, 011001 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasu"&gt;Nasu, K. Photoinduced phase transitions. World Scientific, Singapore (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Short-lived hidden states of matter have also been reported in crystals using lasers. Recently a persistent hidden state was discovered in a crystal of [[Tantalum(IV) sulfide]] (TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), where the state is stable at low temperatures.&lt;ref name="Stojchevska 2014"/&gt; 
A hidden state of matter is not to be confused with [[hidden order]], which exists in equilibrium, but is not immediately apparent or easily observed.

Using ultrashort [[laser]] pulses impinging on solid state matter,&lt;ref name="Tokura"/&gt; the system may be knocked out of equilibrium so that not only are the individual subsystems out of equilibrium with each other but also internally. Under such conditions, new states of matter may be created which are not otherwise reachable under equilibrium, ergodic system evolution. 
Such states are usually unstable and decay very rapidly, typically in nanoseconds or less.&lt;ref name="Nasu"/&gt;  The difficulty is in distinguishing a genuine hidden state from one which is simply out of thermal equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Miyano, K., Tanaka, T., Tomioka, Y. &amp; Tokura, Y. Photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition in a perovskite manganite. Phys Rev Lett 78, 4257–4260 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the first instance of a photoinduced state is described for the organic molecular compound TTF-CA, which turns from neutral to ionic species as a result of excitation by laser pulses.&lt;ref  name="Nasu" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Koshihara"&gt;Koshihara, S., Tokura, Y., Mitani, T., Saito, G. &amp; Koda, T. Photoinduced valence instability in the organic molecular compound tetrathiafulvalene-p-chloranil (TTF-CA). Phys. Rev. B 42, 6853–6856 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okamoto, H. et al. Photoinduced phase transition in tetrathiafulvalene-p-chloranil observed in femtosecond reflection spectroscopy. Phys Rev B 70, 165202 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar transformation is also possible by the application of pressure, so strictly speaking the photoinduced transition is not to a hidden state under the definition given in the introductory paragraph. A few further examples are given in ref.&lt;ref  name="Nasu" /&gt;
Photoexcitation has been shown to produce persistent states in vanadates&lt;ref&gt;Cavalleri, A. et al. Femtosecond Structural Dynamics in VO_ {2} during an Ultrafast Solid-Solid Phase Transition. Phys Rev Lett 87, 237401 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomimoto, S., Miyasaka, S., Ogasawara, T., Okamoto, H. &amp; Tokura, Y.

Nature Materials 15, 956-960 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; leading to filamentary paths of a modified charge ordered phase which is sustained by a passing current.

== A photoexcited transition to an H state ==

A hypothetical schematic diagram for the transition to an H state by photo excitation is shown in the Figure (After &lt;ref name="Nasu"/&gt;). An absorbed photon causes an electron from the ground state G to an excited state E (red arrow). State E rapidly relaxes via [[Frank-Condon]] relaxation to an intermediate locally reordered state I. Through interactions with others of its kind, this state collectively orders to form a macroscopically ordered metastable state H, further lowering its energy as a result. The new state has a broken symmetry with respect to the G or E state, and may also involve further relaxation compared to the I state. The barrier E&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; prevents state H from reverting to the ground state G. If the barrier is sufficiently large compared to thermal energy k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T, where k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], the H state can be stable indefinitely.

Ice sheets are bigger than [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] or alpine [[glacier]]s. Masses of ice covering less than 50,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are termed an [[ice cap]]. An ice cap will typically feed a series of glaciers around its periphery.

Although the surface is cold, the base of an ice sheet is generally warmer due to [[geothermal]] heat. In places, melting occurs and the melt-water lubricates the ice sheet so that it flows more rapidly. This process produces fast-flowing channels in the ice sheet&amp;nbsp;— these are [[ice stream]]s.

The present-day polar ice sheets are relatively young in geological terms. The Antarctic Ice Sheet first formed as a small ice cap (maybe several) in the early [[Oligocene]], but retreating and advancing many times until the [[Pliocene]], when it came to occupy almost all of Antarctica. The Greenland ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed ''very rapidly'' with the first continental [[glaciation]]. This had the unusual effect of allowing [[fossil]]s of [[plant]]s that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet.

==Antarctic ice sheet==
{{main|Antarctic ice sheet}}

The [[Antarctic ice sheet]] is the largest single mass of ice on [[Earth]]. It covers an area of almost 14 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and contains 30 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ice. Around 90% of the Earth's ice mass is in Antarctica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycleice.html|title=Ice and Glaciers -The Water Cycle-USGS Water-Science School|website=water.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, if melted, would cause sea levels to rise by 58 meters.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; The continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is positive and significant at &gt;0.05&amp;nbsp;°C/decade since 1957.&lt;ref name="SteigSchneider2009"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature07669| last1 = Steig | first1 = E.

The Antarctic ice sheet is divided by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] into two unequal sections called the [[East Antarctic ice sheet]] (EAIS) and the smaller [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but the bed of the WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below [[sea level]]. It would be [[seabed]] if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the [[Ronne Ice Shelf]], and outlet glaciers that drain into the [[Amundsen Sea]].

==Greenland ice sheet==
{{main|Greenland ice sheet}}
[[File:Greenland map.svg|thumb|Map of Greenland&lt;ref&gt;The map of Greenland is ''not'' on the same scale as the map of Antarctica; Greenland's area is approximately 15% of Antarctica's.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Greenland ice sheet]] occupies about 82% of the surface of [[Greenland]], and if melted would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2 metres.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/412.htm |title=''Some physical characteristics of ice on Earth'', Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis.

Realclimate.org 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements came from [[NASA]]'s [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite, launched in 2002, as reported by BBC News in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4783199.stm|title=Greenland melt 'speeding up'|date=11 August 2006|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice sheet dynamics==
{{main|Ice sheet dynamics}}
Ice movement is dominated by the motion of [[glaciers]], whose activity is determined by a number of processes.&lt;ref name="GreveBlatter2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greve, R. |author2=Blatter, H. |year=2009|title=Dynamics of Ice Sheets and Glaciers|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-03415-2|isbn=978-3-642-03414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their motion is the result of cyclic surges interspersed with longer periods of inactivity, on both hourly and [[wikt:centennial|centennial]] time scales.

==Predicted effects of global warming==

{{main|Physical impacts of climate change}}
The Greenland, and possibly the Antarctic, ice sheets have been losing mass recently, because losses by ablation including outlet glaciers exceed accumulation of snowfall. According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), loss of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet mass contributed, respectively, about 0.21 ± 0.35 and 0.21 ± 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm/year to [[sea level rise]] between 1993 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf Richard B. Alley et al.:''Summary for Policymakers'', A report of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC projects that ice mass loss from melting of the Greenland ice sheet will continue to outpace accumulation of snowfall. Accumulation of snowfall on the Antarctic ice sheet is projected to outpace losses from melting. However, in the words of the IPCC, ''"Dynamical processes related to ice flow not included in current [[ice sheet model|models]] but suggested by recent observations could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to warming, increasing future sea level rise. Understanding of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude."'' More research work is therefore required to improve the reliability of predictions of ice-sheet response on [[global warming]]. In 2018, scientists discovered channels between the East and West Antarctic ice sheets that may allow melted ice to flow more quickly to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schlanger|first1=Zoë|title=Scientists discovered massive hidden canyons in Antarctica that could spell bad news for the rest of the planet|url=https://qz.com/1288699/scientists-discovered-massive-hidden-canyons-in-antarctica-that-could-spell-bad-news-for-the-rest-of-the-planet/|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Quartz|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects on ice sheets due to increasing temperature may accelerate, but as documented by the IPCC the effects are not easily projected accurately and in the case of the Antarctic, may trigger an accumulation of additional ice mass. If an ice sheet were ablated down to bare ground, less light from the sun would be reflected back into space and more would be absorbed by the land. The Greenland Ice Sheet covers 84% of the island and the Antarctic Ice Sheet covers approximately 98% of the continent. Due to the significant thickness of these ice sheets, global warming analysis typically focuses on the loss of ice mass from the ice sheets increasing sea level rise, and not on a reduction in the surface area of the ice sheets.

A '''lithosphere''' ({{lang-grc|λίθος}} [''lithos''] for "rocky", and {{lang|grc|σφαίρα}} [''sphaira''] for "sphere") is the rigid,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.J. &amp; Porter, S.C.: ''Physical Geology'', page 17, chapt. ''The Earth: Inside and Out'', 1987, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-05668-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; outermost shell of a [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial-type planet]], or [[natural satellite]], that is defined by its rigid mechanical properties. On [[Earth]], it is composed of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the portion of the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that behaves elastically on time scales of thousands of years or greater. The outermost shell of a rocky planet, the crust, is defined on the basis of its chemistry and mineralogy.

The study of past and current formations of landscapes is called [[geomorphology]].

== Earth's lithosphere ==

Earth's lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitute the hard and rigid outer layer of the Earth. The lithosphere is subdivided into [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. The uppermost part of the lithosphere that chemically reacts to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]] and [[biosphere]] through the [[Pedogenesis|soil forming process]] is called the [[pedosphere]]. The lithosphere is underlain by the [[asthenosphere]] which is the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle. The [[Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary]] is defined by a difference in response to stress: the lithosphere remains rigid for very long periods of geologic time in which it deforms elastically and through brittle failure, while the asthenosphere deforms viscously and accommodates strain through plastic deformation.

=== History of the concept ===
The concept of the lithosphere as Earth’s strong outer layer was described by [[Augustus Edward Hough Love|A.E.H. Love]] in his 1911 monograph "Some problems of Geodynamics" and further developed by [[Joseph Barrell]], who wrote a series of papers about the concept and introduced the term "lithosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30056401|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages= 289–314|doi=10.1086/622155|issue=4|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..289B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30067162|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages=441–468|doi=10.1086/622163|issue=5|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..441B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30060774|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages=655–683|doi=10.1086/622181|issue=7|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..655B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30067883|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages=537–555|doi=10.1086/622170|issue=6|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..537B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was based on the presence of significant gravity anomalies over continental crust, from which he inferred that there must exist a strong, solid upper layer (which he called the lithosphere) above a weaker layer which could flow (which he called the asthenosphere). These ideas were expanded by [[Reginald Aldworth Daly]] in 1940 with his seminal work "Strength and Structure of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Daly, R. (1940) ''Strength and structure of the Earth''. New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been broadly accepted by geologists and geophysicists.  These concepts of a strong lithosphere resting on a weak asthenosphere are essential to the theory of [[plate tectonics]].

=== Types ===
[[File:Subduction-en.svg|left|thumb|400px|Different types of lithosphere]]
There are two types of lithosphere:
* Oceanic lithosphere, which is associated with [[oceanic crust]] and exists in the [[ocean basin]]s (mean density of about 2.9 grams per cubic centimeter)
* Continental  lithosphere, which is associated with [[continental crust]] (mean density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter)

The thickness of the lithosphere is considered to be the depth to the isotherm associated with the transition between brittle and viscous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parsons, B.  |author2=McKenzie, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes|date=1978|title= Mantle Convection and the thermal structure of the plates|journal= Journal of Geophysical Research|url=http://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/~johne/teaching/pdfs/parsons-mckenzie78.pdf|volume=83|issue=B9|page=4485|bibcode = 1978JGR....83.4485P |doi = 10.1029/JB083iB09p04485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature at which [[olivine]] begins to deform viscously (~1000&amp;nbsp;°C) is often used to set this isotherm because olivine is generally the weakest mineral in the upper mantle. Oceanic lithosphere is typically about 50–140&amp;nbsp;km thick &lt;ref name="lithothick"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pasyanos M. E.|date=2008-05-15|title=Lithospheric Thickness Modeled from Long Period Surface Wave Dispersion|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/361453.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;(but beneath the [[mid-ocean ridge]]s is no thicker than the crust), while continental lithosphere has a range in thickness from about 40&amp;nbsp;km to perhaps 280&amp;nbsp;km;&lt;ref name="lithothick" /&gt; the upper ~30 to ~50&amp;nbsp;km of typical continental lithosphere is crust. The mantle part of the lithosphere consists largely of [[peridotite]]. The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the [[Moho discontinuity]].

==== Oceanic lithosphere ====

Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of [[mafic]] crust and [[ultramafic]] mantle (peridotite) and is denser than continental lithosphere, for which the mantle is associated with crust made of [[felsic]] rocks. Oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly thick and dense with age. In fact, oceanic lithosphere is a thermal boundary layer for the [[mantle convection|convection]]&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Turcotte, Gerald Schubert, Geodynamics. Cambridge University Press, 25 mar 2002 - 456&lt;/ref&gt; in the mantle.  The thickness of the mantle part of the oceanic lithosphere can be approximated as a thermal boundary layer that thickens as the square root of time.
::&lt;math&gt; \, h \, \sim \, 2\, \sqrt{ \kappa t } \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the oceanic mantle lithosphere, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal diffusivity (approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s) for silicate rocks, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the age of the given part of the lithosphere. The age is often equal to L/V, where L is the distance from the spreading centre of [[mid-oceanic ridge]], and V is velocity of the lithospheric plate.

Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. This is because the chemically differentiated oceanic crust is lighter than asthenosphere, but [[thermal contraction]] of the mantle lithosphere makes it more dense than the asthenosphere. The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at [[subduction zone]]s, oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. The oldest parts of continental lithosphere underlie [[craton]]s, and the mantle lithosphere there is thicker and less dense than typical; the relatively low density of such mantle "roots of cratons" helps to stabilize these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/274544a0|title=Composition and development of the continental tectosphere|date=1978|last1=Jordan|first1=Thomas H.|journal=Nature|volume=274|issue=5671|pages=544|bibcode = 1978Natur.274..544J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doilithos"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2009.04.028|title=Ultradeep continental roots and their oceanic remnants: A solution to the geochemical "mantle reservoir" problem?|date=2009|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Suzanne Y.|last2=Zhang|first2=Ming|last3=Griffin|first3=William L.|last4=Begg|first4=Graham|last5=Hronsky|first5=Jon|journal=[[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]]|volume=112|pages=1043|bibcode = 2009Litho.112.1043O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subducted lithosphere ====
Geophysical studies in the early 21st century posit that large pieces of the lithosphere have been subducted into the mantle as deep as 2900&amp;nbsp;km to near the core-mantle boundary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.09.015|title=Derivation of Large Igneous Provinces of the past 200 million years from long-term heterogeneities in the deep mantle|date=2004|last1=Burke|first1=Kevin|last2=Torsvik|first2=Trond H.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=227|issue=3–4|pages=531|bibcode = 2004E&amp;PSL.227..531B }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others "float" in the upper mantle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(04)00070-6|title=4-D evolution of SE Asia's mantle from geological reconstructions and seismic tomography|date=2004|last1=Replumaz|first1=Anne|last2=Kárason|first2=Hrafnkell|last3=Van Der Hilst|first3=Rob D|last4=Besse|first4=Jean|last5=Tapponnier|first5=Paul|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=221|pages=103|bibcode = 2004E&amp;PSL.221..103R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2007GC001806|title=A new global model for P wave speed variations in Earth's mantle|date=2008|last1=Li|first1=Chang|last2=Van Der Hilst|first2=Robert D.|last3=Engdahl|first3=E.

Geoscientists can directly study the nature of the subcontinental mantle by examining mantle [[xenolith]]s&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, P.H. (1987) ''Mantle xenoliths'' J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 844 p. {{ISBN|0-471-91209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought up in [[kimberlite]], [[lamproite]], and other [[volcanic pipe]]s. The histories of these xenoliths have been investigated by many methods, including analyses of abundances of isotopes of [[osmium]] and [[rhenium]]. Such studies have confirmed that mantle lithospheres below some cratons have persisted for periods in excess of 3 billion years, despite the mantle flow that accompanies plate tectonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2004RG000156|url=http://earth.usc.edu/downloads/tjordan/copenhagenreadings/c6-carlsonetalrevgeoph2005.pdf|title=Physical, chemical, and chronological characteristics of continental mantle|date=2005|last1=Carlson|first1=Richard W.|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=43|pages=RG1001|bibcode=2005RvGeo..43.1001C|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122125314/http://earth.usc.edu/downloads/tjordan/copenhagenreadings/c6-carlsonetalrevgeoph2005.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search''' ('''LONEOS''') was a project designed to discover [[asteroids]] and [[comets]] that orbit near the Earth. The project, funded by [[NASA]], was directed by astronomer [[Ted Bowell]] of [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]. The LONEOS project began in 1993 and ran until the end of February 2008.

== Hardware ==

LONEOS, in its final configuration, used a 0.6-meter f/1.8 [[Schmidt telescope]], acquired from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1990, and a Lowell-built 16 [[megapixel]] [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] detector. This combination of instruments provided a field of view of 2.88 by 2.88 degrees (8.3 square degrees). It had a maximum nightly scan area of about 1,000 square degrees (covered four times). The instrument could cover the entire accessible dark sky in about a month. The CCD has detected asteroids as faint as [[visual magnitude]] 19.8 but its typical limiting visual magnitude was 19.3. The instrument is located at Lowell Observatory's dark sky site, [[Anderson Mesa Station]], near Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.

Four computers were used. Two were used for frame reductions, one for telescope pointing control and one for camera control. The camera control software had scripting capability and could control all the other computers.

== Technique ==

Asteroids were found by obtaining four pictures (frames) of the same region of sky, each frame temporally separated by 15 to 30 minutes. The set of four frames were then submitted to reduction software which located all star-like sources on the frame and identified sources that moved with asteroid-like motion. The observer visually examined all asteroid detections that had motion different from a typical main-belt asteroid. Human examination was required because most putative NEO detections were not real but some kind of imaging artifact.

All asteroid positions were converted to [[equatorial coordinates]]. Various USNO star catalogs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofs.navy.mil/data/fchpix/ USNO Image and Catalogue Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; were used for this conversion until 2007. Then the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] catalog was used, along with supplemental information from the Carlsberg Catalog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~dwe/SRF/cmc14.html CMC14&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2MASS]] catalog. Asteroid brightness was converted to standard [[visual magnitude]]. These data, along with the time of the observations, were sent to the [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) from which they were distributed to the scientific community. Potential near-Earth objects were handled expeditiously so that other observers could locate the asteroid on the same night and make further observations.

Telescope operation was automated to the extent that the survey could be run all night without observer intervention. However, the telescope was seldom operated in the automatic mode because an observer was required to reduce data promptly and to correct any malfunctions that might have occurred.

As of 2017, LONEOS is credited by the [[Minor Planet Center]] with the discovery of 22,077 [[minor planet]]s between 1998 and 2008. The discoveries include [[main-belt asteroid]]s, [[near-Earth Object]]s (NEO) and [[Mars-crosser]]s.&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt; During the period of LONEOS operation, several other NASA funded NEO searches were underway (number of discoveries in parenthesis):&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;
* [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] (148,287)
* [[Spacewatch]] (135,705)
* [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] (54,542)
* [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (41,092)
* and [[Catalina Sky Survey]] (26,294)

Amateur observers made a significant contribution during this time with independent NEO discoveries and by performing follow-up observations of recent discoveries made by the NASA sponsored surveys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/mpml/messages Yahoo Groups&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NEO-discovery statistics ===

The table below lists the number of discoveries made by LONEOS each year of operation. Asteroids thought to be larger than one kilometer in diameter were used as benchmarks in assessing survey completeness. Hence, some table elements have two numbers separated by a slash. The second number represents the number of discoveries larger than one kilometer. The column labeled "Asteroid Observations" is the number of observations sent to the Minor Planet Center. Each asteroid was typically observed four times (once per frame) each night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/YearlyBreakdown.html Summary of PHA and NEA Discoveries by Discoverers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25226">'''Luminous efficacy''' is a measure of how well a light source produces visible light. It is the ratio of [[luminous flux]] to [[power (physics)|power]], measured in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]] per [[watt]] in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). Depending on context, the power can be either the [[radiant flux]] of the source's output, or it can be the total power (electric power, chemical energy, or others) consumed by the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Allen Stimson |title=Photometry and Radiometry for Engineers |publisher=Wiley and Son |location=New York |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Optical Radiation Measurements, Vol 1 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |author1=Franc Grum |author2=Richard Becherer |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Radiometry and the Detection of Optical Radiation |publisher=Wiley and Son |location=New York |author=Robert Boyd |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Which sense of the term is intended must usually be inferred from the context, and is sometimes unclear. The former sense is sometimes called '''luminous efficacy of radiation''', and the latter '''luminous efficacy of a source''' or '''overall luminous efficacy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Photovoltaic systems engineering |edition=2 |author1=Roger A. Messenger |author2=Jerry Ventre |publisher=CRC Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8493-1793-4 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Color imaging: fundamentals and applications |author1=Erik Reinhard |author2=Erum Arif Khan |author3=Ahmet Oğuz Akyüz |author4=Garrett Johnson |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-56881-344-8 |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all wavelengths of light are equally visible, or equally effective at stimulating human vision, due to the [[spectral sensitivity]] of the [[human eye]]; radiation in the [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] parts of the spectrum is useless for illumination. The luminous efficacy of a source is the product of how well it converts energy to electromagnetic radiation, and how well the emitted radiation is detected by the human eye.

==Efficacy and efficiency==&lt;!--Luminous coefficient redirects here--&gt;
Luminous efficacy can be normalized by the maximum possible luminous efficacy to a [[dimensionless]] quantity called '''luminous efficiency'''. The distinction between ''efficacy'' and ''efficiency'' is not always carefully maintained in published sources, so it is not uncommon to see "efficiencies" expressed in lumens per watt, or "efficacies" expressed as a percentage.

==Luminous efficacy of radiation==

===Explanation===
[[File:CIE 1931 Luminosity.png|right|thumb|The [[Luminosity function|response of a typical human eye to light]], as standardized by the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] in 1924. The horizontal axis is wavelength in nm]]

[[Wavelength]]s of light outside of the [[visible spectrum]] are not useful for illumination because they cannot be seen by the [[human eye]]. Furthermore, the eye responds more to some wavelengths of light than others, even within the visible spectrum. This response of the eye is represented by the [[luminosity function]]. This is a standardized function which represents the response of a "typical" eye under bright conditions ([[photopic vision]]). One can also define a similar curve for dim conditions ([[scotopic vision]]). When neither is specified, photopic conditions are generally assumed.

Luminous efficacy of radiation measures the fraction of electromagnetic power which is useful for lighting. It is obtained by dividing the [[luminous flux]] by the [[radiant flux]]. Light with wavelengths outside the [[visible spectrum]] reduces luminous efficacy, because it contributes to the radiant flux while the luminous flux of such light is zero. Wavelengths near the peak of the eye's response contribute more strongly than those near the edges.

Photopic luminous efficacy of radiation has a maximum possible value of {{nowrap|683 lm/W}}, for the case of monochromatic light at a wavelength of {{nowrap|555 nm}} (green). Scotopic luminous efficacy of radiation reaches a maximum of {{nowrap|1700 lm/W}} for monochromatic light at a wavelength of {{nowrap|507 nm}}.

===Mathematical definition===
'''Luminous efficacy''', denoted ''K'', is defined as&lt;ref name="CIE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/730|title=Luminous efficacy (of radiation)|publisher=[[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]]|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{\Phi_\mathrm{v}}{\Phi_\mathrm{e}} = \frac{\int_0^\infty K(\lambda) \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}\,\mathrm{d}\lambda}{\int_0^\infty \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}\,\mathrm{d}\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;

where
* Φ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[luminous flux]];
* Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[radiant flux]];
* Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[radiant flux|spectral radiant flux]];
* {{nowrap|1=''K''(''λ'') = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''V''(''λ'')}} is the [[luminosity function|spectral luminous efficacy]].

==Lighting efficiency== &lt;!--Many terms redirect to this section--&gt;
{{main|Wall-plug efficiency}}
Artificial light sources are usually evaluated in terms of luminous efficacy of the source, also sometimes called ''wall-plug efficacy''. This is the ratio between the total luminous flux emitted by a device and the total amount of input power (electrical, etc.) it consumes. The luminous efficacy of the source is a measure of the efficiency of the device with the output adjusted to account for the spectral response curve (the luminosity function). When expressed in dimensionless form (for example, as a fraction of the maximum possible luminous efficacy), this value may be called ''luminous efficiency of a source'', ''overall luminous efficiency'' or ''lighting efficiency''.

The main difference between the luminous efficacy of radiation and the luminous efficacy of a source is that the latter accounts for input energy that is lost as [[heat]] or otherwise exits the source as something other than electromagnetic radiation. Luminous efficacy of radiation is a property of the radiation emitted by a source. Luminous efficacy of a source is a property of the source as a whole.

===Examples===
The following table lists luminous efficacy of a source and efficiency for various light sources. Note that all lamps requiring [[Electrical ballast|electrical/electronic ballast]] are unless noted (see also voltage) listed without [[Electrical efficiency|losses]] for that, reducing total efficiency.

Sources that depend on thermal emission from a solid filament, such as [[incandescent light bulb]]s, tend to have low overall efficacy because, as explained by Donald L. Klipstein, "An ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around 6300&amp;nbsp;°C (6600&amp;nbsp;K or 11,500&amp;nbsp;°F). Even at this high temperature, a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet, and the theoretical luminous [efficacy] is 95 lumens per watt. No substance is solid and usable as a light bulb filament at temperatures anywhere close to this. The surface of the sun is not quite that hot."&lt;ref name="bulbguide" /&gt; At temperatures where the [[tungsten]] filament of an ordinary light bulb remains solid (below 3683 kelvin), most of its emission is in the [[infrared]].&lt;ref name="bulbguide" /&gt;

'''Mass wasting''', also known as '''slope movement''' or '''mass movement''', is the [[geomorphology|geomorphic]] process by which [[soil]], [[sand]], [[regolith]], and [[rock (geology)|rock]] move downslope typically as a solid, continuous or discontinuous mass, largely under the force of [[gravity]], but frequently with characteristics of a flow as in [[debris flow]]s and [[mudflow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/368257/mass-movement Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Types of mass wasting include [[Downhill creep|creep]], slides, flows, topples, and falls, each with its own characteristic features, and taking place over timescales from seconds to hundreds of years. Mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], and Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

When the gravitational force acting on a slope exceeds its resisting force, slope failure (mass wasting) occurs. The slope material's strength and [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] and the amount of [[internal friction]] between material help maintain the slope's stability and are known collectively as the slope's [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]]. The steepest angle that a cohesionless slope can maintain without losing its stability is known as its [[angle of repose]]. When a slope made of loose material possesses this angle, its shear strength perfectly counterbalances the force of gravity acting upon it.

Mass wasting may occur at a very slow rate, particularly in areas that are very dry or those areas that receive sufficient rainfall such that vegetation has stabilized the surface. It may also occur at very high speed, such as in [[rockslide]]s or [[landslides]], with disastrous consequences, both immediate and delayed, e.g., resulting from the formation of [[landslide dam]]s.

Factors that change the potential of mass wasting include: change in slope angle, weakening of material by [[weathering]], increased water content; changes in [[vegetation]] cover, and overloading.

Volcano flanks can become over-steep resulting in instability and mass wasting. This is now a recognised part of the growth of all active volcanoes. It is seen on submarine as well as surface volcanoes: [[Loihi]] in the Hawaiian volcanic chain and [[Kick 'em Jenny]] in the Caribbean volcanic arc are two submarine volcanoes that are known to undergo mass wasting. The failure of the northern flank of [[Mount St Helens]] in 1980 showed how rapidly volcanic flanks can deform and fail.

==The importance of water in mass wasting==
Water can increase or decrease the stability of a slope depending on the amount present.  Small amounts of water can strengthen soils because the surface tension of water increases soil cohesion.  This allows the soil to resist erosion better than if it were dry.  If too much water is present the water may act to increase the pore pressure, reducing friction, and accelerating the erosion process and resulting in different types of mass wasting (i.e. mudflows, landslides, etc.).  A good example of this is to think of a [[sand castle]].  Water must be mixed with sand in order for the castle to keep its shape.  If too much water is added the sand washes away, if not enough water is added the sand falls and cannot keep its shape. Water also increases the mass of the soil, this is important because an increase in mass means that there will be an increase in velocity if mass wasting is triggered.
Saturated water, however, eases the process of mass wasting in that the rock and soil debris are easily washed down-slope.

==Types of mass wasting==
Based on how the soil, regolith or rock moves downslope as a whole, mass movements can be broadly classified as creeps and landslides.

===Creeps===
[[Soil creep]] is a slow and long term mass movement. The combination of small movements of soil or rock in different directions over time are directed by gravity gradually downslope. The steeper the slope, the faster the creep. The creep makes trees and shrubs curve to maintain their perpendicularity, and they can trigger landslides if they lose their root footing. The surface soil can migrate under the influence of cycles of freezing and thawing, or hot and cold temperatures, inching its way towards the bottom of the slope forming [[terracettes]].  

===Landslides===
A [[landslide]], also called a landslip, is a slow or rapid movement of a large mass of earth and rocks down a hill or a mountainside. Little or no flowage of the materials occurs on a given slope until heavy rain and resultant lubrication by the same rainwater facilitate the movement of the materials, causing a landslide to occur. 

In particular, if the main feature of the movement is a slide along a planar or curved surface, the landslide is termed slump, earth slide, debris slide or rock slide, depending on the prevailing material.

Movement of soil and regolith that more resembles fluid behavior is called a flow. These include [[avalanche]]s, [[mudflow]]s, [[debris flow]]s, [[earth flow]], [[lahars]] and [[sturzstrom]]s. Water, air and ice are often involved in enabling fluid-like motion of the material.

A fall, including [[rockfall]] and debris fall, occurs where regolith cascades down a slope, but is not of sufficient volume or viscosity to behave as a flow. Falls are promoted in rocks which are characterized by the presence of vertical cracks. Falls can also result from undercutting by running water as well as by waves. They usually occur at very steep slopes such as a cliff face. The rock material may be loosened by earthquakes, rain, plant-root wedging, and expanding ice, among other things. The accumulation of rock material that has fallen and resides at the base of the structure is known as [[Scree|talus]].

==Triggers of mass wasting==
Soil and regolith remain on a hillslope only while the gravitational forces are unable to overcome the frictional forces keeping the material in place (see [[slope stability]]). Some factors that reduce the frictional resistance relative to the downslope forces, and thus can trigger slope movement, can include:
* [[earthquake]]s
* increased overburden from structures
* increased soil moisture
* reduction of roots holding the soil to bedrock
* undercutting of the slope by [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] or erosion
* weathering by [[frost heave]] or chemical dissolution
* [[bioturbation]]

==Reducing the impacts of mass wasting==
* [[Afforestation]]
* Re-Afforestation
* [[Terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] steps on slopes or, more generally, re-modeling its shape
* [[Slope stabilization]]

'''Maurice Burton''' (28 March 1898 – 9 September 1992) was a British [[zoologist]] and popular science author, who produced many [[natural history]] encyclopedias and books including a skeptical treatment of the [[Loch Ness Monster]].

==Life==
Burton was born in [[Hornsey]], [[London]] on 28 March 1898,  attended [[Holloway School]]&lt;ref name=camdenians&gt;[http://www.oldcamdenians.info/school  The Old Camdenians Club]. Retrieved 31  January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and studied [[zoology]] at [[King's College, London]] under [[Arthur Dendy]], then became a schoolteacher, before joining the staff of the [[Natural History Museum, London]] in 1926 where he remained for the rest if his career until his retirement in 1958.  He married Margaret Maclean (d. 1990) in 1929 and they had two sons and a daughter.  He died in [[Albury, Surrey]], on 9 September 1992.&lt;ref name=Indy&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-maurice-burton-1553125.html Obituary: Maurice Burton], ''The Independent'', 23 September 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/library/archives/catalogue/ Natural History Museum] Museum Archives Online Catalogue: Burton, Maurice&lt;/ref&gt; The Albury History Society has some details of Burton's life in Albury along with several sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alburyhistory.org.uk|title=Albury History Society - All about Albury - Homepage|website=alburyhistory.org.uk|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
He was Curator of [[Sponge]]s at the [[British Museum of Natural History]] from 1927 to 1948, and Deputy Keeper of Zoology in the same institution from 1949 to 1958.&lt;ref name=Indy/&gt;  His popular science writing included major work on Encyclopedias, and acting as Science Editor for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' and Nature Correspondent for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Indy/&gt;  In 1961 he published a book called ''The Elusive Monster'' reviewing the evidence for the Loch Ness Monster in the light of his professional knowledge and concluding that it was unlikely that such creatures were living in [[Loch Ness]].&lt;ref name=Elusive&gt;Burton, M. (1961), ''The Elusive Monster - An analysis of the evidence from Loch Ness'', (Hart-Davies).&lt;/ref&gt;  He also commented further on this topic in the ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;Burton, Maurice (1982), ''The Loch Ness Saga'', New Scientist 06-24: p. 872. 07-01: pp. 41–42 07-08: pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Burton's books were aimed at a juvenile audience. Some of his later books or revised editions were published with his son, Robert Burton (born 1941) also trained as a zoologist and who published many natural history books himself. Robert also took over his father's Nature  Notes column in the ''Daily Telegraph''.&lt;ref name=DK&gt;[http://us.dk.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000033164,00.html dk.com authors] Robert Burton.&lt;/ref&gt;  His daughter Jane Burton (1933–2007) illustrated many of the books and pursued a career as a wildlife photographer.

'''Meribah''' or "'''Mirabah'''" ({{lang-he|מְרִיבָה}}) is one of the locations which the [[Torah]] identifies as having been travelled through by the [[Israelites]], during [[the Exodus]],&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|17:7"&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|17:7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the continuous [[stations list|list of visited stations]] in the [[Book of Numbers]] does not mention it.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|33|}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Exodus]], ''Meribah'' is mentioned at the same time as ''[[Massah]]'', in a context which suggests that ''Massah'' is the same location as ''Meribah'', but other biblical mentions of ''Massah'' and ''Meribah'', such as that in the [[Blessing of Moses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|33:8|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massah and Meribah are also referenced in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|32|}}, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47|}}, and {{bibleverse||Psalms|81|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalms|95|}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Psalms|106|}}&lt;/ref&gt; seem to imply that they are distinct.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]].''{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}

==Events==

The Biblical text mentions two very similar episodes that both occur at a place named ''Meribah''. The episode recounted by the Book of Exodus features the Israelites quarreling with [[Moses]] about the lack of water, and Moses rebuking the Israelites for testing [[Yahweh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|17:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the text states that it was on this account that the place gained the name ''Massah'',&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|17:7"/&gt; meaning ''testing'', and the name ''Meribah'',&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|17:7"/&gt; meaning ''quarreling''. The narrative in the Book of Exodus states that, on account of their thirst, the Israelites grumbled against Moses,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|17:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Moses, in fear for his life, appeals to Yahweh;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|17:4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the narrative continues with Yahweh telling Moses to walk ahead of the others, and strike the rock at [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]] with his rod,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|17:5-6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when Moses does this, it causes the rock to expel water.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|17:6|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode recounted by the Book of Numbers features the Israelites quarreling with Moses ''and [[Aaron]]'' about the lack of water ''and food crops'';&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:2-5|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the text states that Moses and Aaron responded by consulting Yahweh at the [[Tabernacle]] door, while [[prostration|prostrating]] themselves, and that Yahweh told them to take the rod, and speak to a particular rock while the people are gathered together in view of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:6-8|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative continues with Moses following the instructions to take Aaron's staff and to gather the Israelites,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:9-10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead of speaking to the rock, which Yahweh had stated would result in water flowing from it,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:8|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses speaks to the ''crowd'' and strikes the rock, doing so twice, resulting in a strong flow of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:11|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Textual criticism|Some textual scholars]] regard the two accounts as different versions of the same events at Meribah, with the version in the Book of Exodus being from the [[JE]] source, and the version in the Book of Numbers being from the [[Priestly Source]];&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who Wrote the Bible?''{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"&gt;''Peake's commentary on the Bible''.{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}} the latter account, like the Priestly Source in general, is considered to be an attempt to supplant the JE version of the narrative, which doesn't treat [[Aaron]] as being as important as the [[Aaronid]] writer of the Priestly Source would have liked.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

According to these textual scholars, the JE account in Exodus of the events at Massah and Meribah is spliced together from two earlier source texts, namely the [[Jahwist]] and [[Elohist]] texts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Richard Elliott Friedman, ''Who Wrote the Bible?''{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}} Textual scholars regard the [[Jahwist]] text and [[Elohist]] text as both having an account of the naming of Massah, and both having an account of provision of water, but with the accounts being spliced together in a non-straightforward manner; where the combined text reports events at ''Massah and Meribah'',&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; textual scholars believe that the mention of a quarrel, the testing of Yahweh, and the naming of Massah, are all part of the [[Jahwist]] text, while the extraction of water from a stone, and the naming of Meribah, are part of the [[Elohist]] text.&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Elohist account of water being provided at ''Meribah'' (מריבה) is seen by [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] as a parallel of the Jahwist's account of the provision of water at [[Marah (Bible)|Marah]] (מרה);&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; in the Marah narrative is mention of Yahweh testing the Israelites, which textual scholars attribute to the Elohist account,&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}} and regard as the parallel of the Jahwist's account of the naming of ''Massah'' after the testing of Yahweh by the Israelites.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The Death of Moses and Aaron===

In the account in the Book of Numbers, but not the account in the Book of Exodus, after the water is produced, Yahweh tells Moses and Aaron that they did not trust him sufficiently to honour him, and as a consequence both Moses and Aaron would die before entering [[Canaan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what, exactly, merited their punishment, though the text does make clear that it was Moses alone who spoke to the people and struck the rock; biblical scholars regard this as an example of the Priestly Source's usual subtle denigration of Moses, the hero of the [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]] priesthood (which rivaled the Aaronids). One possible reason for the punishment is that Moses had struck the rock twice, rather than just speaking to it as he had been told to do;&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}} another possibility is that he had rashly addressed the Israelites by the phrase ''you rebels''.&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}} Yet another reason may be that Moses attributes the miracle to his own power and fails to mention the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Milgrom, ''The JPS Torah Commentary: Numbers'', pp. 351-2. See Excursus 50 for a detailed discussion of the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Deuteronomy]], which textual scholars [[Deuteronomist|attribute to a writer]] who was pro-Moses and anti-Aaron,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; the punishment was due to the lack of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] in Yahweh that had been exhibited by the Israelites, rather than by Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|1:32-37|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historicity===

Some [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] see the narrative about Massah and Meribah as having originated as [[Aetiology|aetiological myths]] seeking to justify their names.&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}

==Location==

According to the Book of Exodus, Meribah was a location in [[Rephidim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|17:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt; while according to the Book of Numbers, Meribah was located at [[Kadesh-Barnea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholars attribute the difference to the different sources from which these passages derive,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; and regard both mentions of Meribah as referring to the same place.&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}} The [[Septuagint]], [[Targum]]s, and the [[Vulgate]] deal with the issue by regarding the ''Meribah'' in the Book of Numbers as simply being a [[common noun]], rather than a place-name, rendering ''Me Meribath-Kadesh'' as ''the waters of strife in Kadesh'' rather than as ''the waters of Meribah in Kadesh''.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

The identification of Rephidim is heavily dependent on the identification of the [[Biblical Mount Sinai]], which the biblical narrative portrays the Israelites as having reached shortly after they had left Rephidim. Traditionally, Sinai was equated with one of the mountains at the south of the [[Sinai Peninsula]] leading to the identification of Rephidim as the ''[[Wadi Refayid]]'', a location roughly 8 miles south from [[Mount Sinai|Jebel Musa]];&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;{{full|date=October 2016}} this would make it quite difficult to equate the Meribah in Rephidim with the Meribah near Kadesh-Barnea. However, the majority of both scholars and religious authorities believe that this traditional identification of Sinai is inaccurate, with the suggested alternatives being in the north and centre of the Sinai peninsula, in the [[Hejaz]], and in the north eastern [[Arabah]]; these identifications would fit with the situation that both biblical narratives of Meribah referring to a place in the vicinity of Kedesh-Barnea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6386">'''Monga''' is a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] term referring to the yearly cyclical phenomenon of poverty and hunger in [[Bangladesh]].  It is also called "mora Kartik," which means "months of death and disaster." It refers to two times per year, from September–November (after the ''aman'' crop is planted) and from March–April (after the ''boro'' crop is planted).&lt;ref name="UN OCHA"/&gt; These natural phenomena lead to fewer available job opportunities for rural workers, resulting in the workers becoming migrant and moving to towns.  Those who cannot migrate can face [[malnutrition]] and [[starvation]]. The public awareness of Monga has risen with media focus in the 2000s. It was cited in Bangladesh’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and has been the subject of [[NGO]] aid programs.&lt;ref name="zug1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://homeweb4.unifr.ch/Zugs/Pub/S.Zug_SeasonalFoodsecurityBD_Journal_of_Social_Studies.pdf|last=Zug|first=Sebastian|year=2006|title=Monga – Seasonal Food Insecurity in Bangladesh – Bringing the Information Together|journal=The Journal of Social Studies|location=Dhaka|volume=111|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Risk and vulnerability==
The risk of monga is identified by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] as resulting from/being:&lt;ref name="ODI"&gt;Rebecca Holmes, John Farrington, Taifur Rahman and Rachel Slater (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1586&amp;title=extreme-poverty-bangladesh-protecting-promoting-rural-livelihoods Extreme poverty in Bangladesh: Protecting and promoting rural livelihoods] London: Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;
* external shocks (e.g.  an earthquake or financial crisis)
* stresses – predictable events that form part of the family life-cycle (e.g. old age or weddings)
* idiosyncratic
* covariate (large areas affected by one phenomenon such as drought)
* acute (e.g. an epidemic)
* chronic (e.g. degeneration of resource productivity under increasing population pressure)
Vulnerability is also a complex combination of the following:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
* Physical: areas prone to natural disasters such as floods or cyclones
* Economic: caused by factors such as indebtedness and low, seasonal or unreliable income.
* Social: e.g. gender inequality and lack of social capital and/or networks.
There are many negative coping strategies employed and this can have both a short-term impact (e.g. reducing food consumption), but it also threatens households' long term ability to help themselves out of the crisis as they are forced to sell productive assets.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

==Preventing monga in Bangladesh==
Preventing monga requires addressing the following issues:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# reduce risk by protecting assets and household consumption/income;
# prevent negative coping strategies (e.g. selling productive assets);
# promote investment in livelihoods and productive assets;
# increase voice and access to information.

In earlier years, efforts to counteract the effects of monga were made through Government test relief and other programmes, and by rural infrastructure `cash-for-work' interventions by long established NGOs such as RDRS Bangladesh which also carried out skills training and crop diversification from the mid-1970s.  The spread of irrigation has reduced the impact of the early season monga (March, April) but is still a major factor in the September–October period before the amon rice harvest

=== Government action ===
The [[Politics of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] has been trying to assist the victims of monga by providing a US$295 million program which provides employment for two million heads of families for 75 days during the monga season. This also can be a big fail sometimes.&lt;ref name="UN OCHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=80898|title= BANGLADESH: Initiatives to tackle monga  |date=2008-10-14|publisher=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The BRAC programme ===
This involves the transfer of productive assets worth 8,000 to 13,000 Taka to the poorest households in northern Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Furthermore, it provides intensive training and support on how to manage these assets, as well as a daily stipend until the assets start producing an income (approximately 300 Taka per month).&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; In this way, the assets transferred are not sold as a coping strategy before those assets have started producing an income and securing the household from such an extreme measure (see [[Cash transfers]]).&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The programme also subsidises health and legal services, water and sanitation provision and the development of supportive community networks.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

=== The Chars Livelihoods Programme (CLP) ===
The poorest households in the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] Chars region, an low-lying area prone to floods and erosion in northern Bangladesh, are provided with income generating assets worth approximately 13,000 Taka.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; This livelihoods intervention support includes a monthly stipend for 18 months of 300 Taka per month, infrastructure development, social development training, seasonal work and promotes entrepreneurship in the agricultural and non-farm sectors.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

=== The Vulnerable Group Development programme (VGD) ===
A national programme integrating [[food security]] and nutrition issues with development and income generating activities for poor households in food insecure areas.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; For two years this programme transfers monthly food rations, as well as  services such as income generating skills training.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The programme also works with [[micro-credit]] service providers.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

=== The Programmed Initiatives for Monga Eradication (PRIME) ===
This is the initiative of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), a micro-finance institution, in northern Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The PKSF provide employment opportunities for the monga season, emergency credit for households with a slightly higher income, consumption loans, remittance services and a carefully designed flexible credit support system.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The aim is to build beneficiaries’ coping capacity, and their skills and resources to secure their own futures.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

'''Mount Buzhou''' was an ancient Chinese mythological mountain which according to old texts lay to the northwest of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], in a location today referred to as the [[Pamir Mountains]]. It is the mountain said to have supported the heavens, against which the Chinese water god [[Gonggong]] smashed his head in a fit of anger, requiring the goddess [[Nüwa]] to [[Nüwa Mends the Heavens|repair the sky]]. Nevertheless, once the spacer between the Earth and Sky was damaged, ever after the land of China permanently tilted to the southeast, causing the rivers all to flow in that same direction.

==Pronunciation==
Modern Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of "bùzhòu" (步骤). Female voice. Speaker from Liaoning, China:
[[File:Zh-bùzhòu.ogg]]

==In mythology==
The world was conceived as being divided into eight directional divisions, at each of which a mountain pillar supported the sky. Bu-zhou was the northwest one (Hawkes, 1985 (2011): 94-95, 135-136, 323).

In mythological geography, Buzhou Mountain a was located near [[Jade Mountain (mythology)|Jade Mountain]] (Yang ''et al'' 2005:161-162, 206)

==In poetry==
The mountain is mentioned in the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' and is a location mentioned by [[Qu Yuan]] in his classic poem ''[[Li Sao]]'', one of the ''[[Chu Ci|Songs of Chu]]'' (line 355), which the poet visits during a shamanic, spiritual journey. [[Li Bai|Li Bo]] and other poets also make allusions or references to Buzhou. Former Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] also refers to Mount Buzhou in his 1931 poem "[[Poetry of Mao Zedong#Against the First "Encirclement" Campaign (1931)|Against the First Encirclement Campaign]]".

The '''mountain beaver''' (''Aplodontia rufa'')&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Other names include mountain boomer, ground bear, giant mole, gehalis, sewellel, suwellel, showhurll, showtl, and showte, as well as a number of [[Chinookan]] and other Native American terms; "mountain boomer" is a misnomer, and the animal does not make the characteristic tail slapping sound of the true beaver species.  See Carraway and Verts, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; is a North American [[rodent]].  It is the only living member of its genus, '''''Aplodontia''''', and family, '''Aplodontiidae'''.&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Aplodontiidae | id = 12300004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with true [[North American beaver|North American]] and [[Eurasian beaver]]s, to which it is not closely related.&lt;ref&gt;"Beavers" in ''The New Encyclopedia of Mammals''.

== Characteristics ==
Mountain beavers are gray or brown, but their fur can range from slightly more reddish to more blackish depending on subspecies, with a light patch under each ear. The animals have distinctively short tails. Adults weigh about {{convert|500|-|900|g|abbr=on}}, with a few specimens topping {{convert|1000|g|abbr=on}}. Total length is about {{convert|30|-|50|cm|abbr=on}}, with a tail length of {{convert|1|-|4|cm|abbr=on}}. Their superficial similarity with true beavers reflects only their relatively large size (for rodents), strong odor, preference for living in extremely watery / moist habitats, and propensity to consume tree seedlings as food &amp;ndash; mountain beavers do not fell adult trees (though such trees may be killed by "[[girdling]]"), build dams, live in lodges, or communicate by tail slappings. They are predominantly nocturnal in above ground activities.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, A. J. 1964. A review of the literature on the mountain beaver. USDI, Fish and Wildlife Serv., Washington, D.C. Spec. Sci. Rep. Wildl. No. 78. 52 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to climb trees a few meters to acquire food in the form of branches and leaves, but otherwise their diet consists mostly of ferns, especially species which are toxic to other animals.&lt;ref name=carraway&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Aplodontia rufa''|date=23 April 1993|journal=Mamm Species|number=432|pages=1–10|publisher=The American Society of Mammalogists|author1=Leslie N.

The [[skull]] is [[protrogomorphous]];&lt;ref&gt;Druzinsky, Robert E. "[http://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/284931 Functional anatomy of incisal biting in Aplodontia rufa and sciuromorph rodents–Part 1: masticatory muscles, skull shape and digging]." Cells Tissues Organs 191.6 (2010): 510-522.&lt;/ref&gt; it has no specialized attachments for the [[masseter muscle]]s as seen in other rodents. It is flattened and lacks a [[postorbital process]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The [[baculum]] is thin and distinctly forked.&lt;ref name="Carraway"&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; The [[penis]] is about {{convert|4.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length. The male does not have a true [[scrotum]], but the [[testes]] move into a position called semiscrotal during the [[breeding season]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Mountain beavers have an unusual projection on each [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] and [[premolar]] tooth, which is unique among mammals and allows for easy identification of teeth. This projection points toward the cheek on the upper tooth row, but points toward the tongue on the [[mandible|lower]]. The cheek teeth lack the complex folds of other rodents and instead consist of single basins. They are [[hypsodont]] and ever-growing. Two upper and one lower premolars are present, along with all the molars, giving a [[dentition|dental formula]] of {{DentalFormula|upper=1.0.2.3|lower=1.0.1.3}}&lt;ref name="Carraway"/&gt;

Mountain beavers cannot produce [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|concentrated]] urine. They are thought to be physiologically restricted to the [[temperate rain forest]] regions of the North American Pacific coast and moist microenvironments inland due to their inability to obtain sufficient water in more arid environments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Their [[karyotype]] is 2&lt;big&gt;''n''&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;46.

== Habits and distribution ==
Mountain beavers are found in the [[Cascade Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]] and southward to include the rest of the [[Cascade Range]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Mammals Macdonald 2001"/&gt; the [[Olympic Mountains]] and Coast Ranges of Washington and Oregon,&lt;ref name=mathews&gt;{{cite book|last=Mathews|first=Daniel|title=Cascade-Olympic Natural History|year=1994|publisher=Audubon Society of Portland/Raven Editions|location=Portland, Oregon|isbn=0-9620782-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus the [[Siskiyou Mountains|Siskiyous]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range, [[Point Arena, California|Point Arena]] and [[Point Reyes|Pt. Reyes]] of [[California]] and extreme western [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Mammals Macdonald 2001"&gt;"Mountain Beaver" in ''The New Encyclopedia of Mammals''. David MacDonald (ed). Oxford University Press, 2001. Pages&amp;nbsp;596–597.&lt;/ref&gt; They range from sea level to the [[tree line]].&lt;ref name="Mammals Macdonald 2001"/&gt;  They can be found in both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests, but throughout most of the range appear to prefer the former. These animals appear to be physiologically limited to moist microenvironments, with most subspecies occurring only in regions with minimal snowfall and cool winters. They do not appear to be able to conserve body heat or warmth as efficiently as other rodents.,&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=MacDonald, D.|author= Evans, James|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 610–611|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor do they [[Hibernation|hibernate]].

Mountain beavers are asocial and do not live in shared burrows.  Burrows usually consist of a network of underground tunnels built in deep soil.  The entrances to these borrows often contain clumps of wilted vegetation which the animal likely uses as a kind of food cache as well as a source of nesting material.  Mountain beavers seldom travel more than a few meters from their burrow entrances, taking advantage of the protection such burrows offer from predators such as mountain lions and owls (though skunks and weasels that also occupy mountain beaver burrows and tunnels may take nestlings as food).&lt;ref name=carraway/&gt;

[[Fern]]s probably make up the bulk of their diets.  They appear to be strictly [[herbivorous]].&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Their consumption of seedling trees has led some to consider them as pests.

The breeding season is between January and March, with two or three young born February to April. The young are born hairless, pink, and blind.  [[Longevity|Lifespans]] are 5&amp;nbsp;to 10&amp;nbsp;years – fairly long for rodents. They are not social, though home ranges can overlap.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

Their [[thumb]]s are slightly [[opposable thumb|opposable]] and the animals will sit on their hindquarters and manipulate food with their fore limbs and incisors.

== Spelling and etymology ==
[[File:Immature mountain beaver.jpg|thumb|right|Immature mountain beaver]]
Most references use the spelling Aplodontidae for the family name. This has been deemed incorrect due to the technical rules of converting a genus name into a family name. The proper conversion of ''Aplodontia'' to a family name is to drop the -a only and add -{{not a typo|idae}}. Thus, Aplodontiidae is technically correct. This spelling is gaining acceptance in modern texts and is the standard spelling currently recognized by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System.

Alternate spellings of the genus name have also been reported, with as many as 30&amp;nbsp;variants historically. These include '''''Haplodontia''''', '''''Haplodon''''', '''''Aploodontia''''', '''''Apluodontia''''', and '''''Aplodontie''''', among others. The name ''Aplodontia'' ("simple tooth") is in reference to the single large basin comprising the bulk of each [[cheek tooth]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]], ''rufa'' means red or reddish.

== Subspecies ==
At present, seven [[subspecies]] of ''Aplodontia rufa'' are recognized:

*''A. r. californica'' &lt;small&gt;(Peters, 1864)&lt;/small&gt;: distributed throughout the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in [[Northern California]] and extreme western [[Nevada]]
*''A. r. humboldtiana'' &lt;small&gt;Taylor, 1916&lt;/small&gt;: restricted to the far northwestern coast of [[California]]
*''A. r. nigra'' &lt;small&gt;Taylor, 1914&lt;/small&gt;: restricted to a small region in southern [[Mendocino County, California]]
*''A. r. pacifica'' &lt;small&gt;Merriam, 1899&lt;/small&gt;: distributed across coastal [[Oregon]]
*''A. r. phaea'' &lt;small&gt;Merriam, 1899&lt;/small&gt;: found in a small pocket just northwest of [[San Francisco, California]]
*''A. r. rainieri'' &lt;small&gt;Merriam, 1899&lt;/small&gt;: found across the [[Cascade Range]] from southern [[British Columbia]] to northern California
*''A. r. rufa'' &lt;small&gt;(Rafinesque, 1817)&lt;/small&gt;: found along coastal [[Washington (state)|Washington]], particularly on the [[Olympic Peninsula]]

== Closest relatives ==
[[File:Aplodontia rufa (Harvard University).JPG|thumb|''Aplodontia rufa'' specimen at [[Harvard University]]]]
The mountain beaver is considered a [[living fossil]], due to the presence of a host of [[plesiomorphy|primitive]] characteristics, particularly the [[protrogomorphous]] [[zygomasseteric system]]. This condition is similar to what is found in most mammal groups, such as [[rabbit]]s, where no extreme specialization of the [[masseter muscle]] has evolved. In the protrogomorphous condition, the masseter muscle does not pass through the [[infraorbital foramen]] as it does in [[guinea pig]]s and [[mouse|mice]]. Likewise, the medial masseter muscle attaches to the base of the [[zygomatic arch]] and does not extend to the region in front of the eye as is seen in [[squirrel]]s and mice.

The mountain beaver is the only living rodent with this primitive cranial and muscular feature (except perhaps the [[blesmol]]s, which clearly evolved protrogomorphy from a [[hystricomorphous]] ancestor). The mountain beaver was once thought to be related to the earliest protrogomorphous rodents, such as the ischyromyids (''[[Paramys]]''). Both [[molecular phylogeny|molecular]] and morphological [[phylogenetics|phylogeneticists]] have recently suggested a more distant relationship to these animals.

Molecular results have consistently produced a sister relationship between the mountain beaver and the [[squirrel]]s (family Sciuridae). This [[clade]] is referred to as [[Sciuroidea]], [[Sciuromorpha]] (not to be confused with the [[sciuromorphous]] zygomasseteric system), or [[Sciurida]], depending on the author.

According to the [[fossil]] record, the Aplodontioidea split from the squirrels in the Middle or Late [[Eocene]] as indicated by the extinct genera ''[[Spurimus]]'' and ''[[Prosciurus]]''. The fossil record for the genus ''Aplodontia''  extends only to the Late [[Pleistocene]] of North America.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Nana''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|n|ə}} ({{lang-grc-gre|Νάνα}}) was a daughter of the [[Phrygia]]n [[water deity|river-god]] [[Sangarius (mythology)|Sangarius]], identified with the river [[Sakarya River|Sakarya]] located in present-day [[Turkey]].

She became pregnant when an [[almond]] from an almond tree fell on her lap. The almond tree had sprung from the spot where the hermaphroditic [[Agdistis]] was castrated, becoming [[Cybele]], the Mother of the Gods.

Nana abandoned the baby boy, who was tended by a [[He-goat#Religion.2C mythology.2C and folklore|he-goat]]. The baby, [[Attis]], grew up to become Cybele's consort and lover.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Nicaea''' or '''Nikaia''' was a [[naiad]] [[nymph]] ("the Astakid nymph", as referred to by [[Nonnus]]) of the springs or fountain of the Greek colony of Nikaia in Bithynia (northwestern Anatolia) or else the goddess of the adjacent lake Askanios (Ascanius). She was the daughter of the river-god [[Sangarius (mythology)|Sangarius]] and [[Cybele]]. By the god of wine, [[Dionysus]], she mothered [[Telete]] (consecration)

== Mythography ==
She was a devotee of the goddess [[Artemis]]. When a shepherd, Hymen, pursued Nicaea, she killed him with an arrow to the heart. This enraged [[Eros]], who inspired Dionysus to fall in love with her. Dionysus pursued her for a long while. When she continued to spurn his advances, Dionysus intoxicated her and then raped her while she slept (the god of wine aided by [[Hypnos]], god of sleep.

Nicaea conceived Telete from this union; after her daughter's birth, Nicaea attempted to hang herself. Although surviving stories do not tell if she made any further suicide attempts, she did live to see [[Aura (mythology)|Aura]], another nymph raped and impregnated by Dionysus in the same manner, going into labor and giving birth to [[Iacchus]], as described in [[Nonnus]]’s ''Dionysiaca''.

Dionysus named the city [[Nicaea]] after her.

=== Nonnus' Account ===
The following excerpts recounts the story of Nicaea and her rape by Dionysus, also included was the unfortunate plight of Aura from the same god:

Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 567 ff (translated Rouse) (Greek epic c. 5th AD) :
{{quote|He [Dionysos] remembered the bed of the Astakid Nymphe [i.e. Nikaia (Nicaea)] long before, how he had wooed the lovely Nymphe with a cunning potion and made sleep his guide to intoxicated bridals.}}
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 811 ff :
{{quote|'''Nikaia''' (Nicaea), the leader of the rites of [[Layios|Lyaios]]&lt;nowiki&gt; (Lyaeus) [Dionysos], seeing the pain and disgrace of distracted Aura [who was pregnant after her violation by Dionysos], spoke to her thus in secret pity : 'Aura, I have suffered as you have [i.e. Nikaia had also been violated by Dionysos in a drunken sleep], and you too lament you your maidenhood. But since you carry in your womb the burden of painful childbirth, endure after the bed to have the pangs of delivery, endure to give your untaught breast to babes. Why did you also drink wine, which robbed me of my girdle? Why did you also drink wine, Aura, until you were with child? You also suffered what I suffered, you enemy of marriage; then you also have to blame a deceitful sleep sent by the &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Erotes]] (Loves), who are friends of the marriage. One fraud fitted marriage on us both, one husband was Aura's and made virgin Nikaia the mother of children. No more have I a beast-slaying bow, no longer as once, I draw my bowstring and my arrows; I am a poor woman working at the loom, and no longer a wild [[Amazons|Amazon]]. She spoke, pitying Aura's labour to accomplish the birth, as one who herself had felt the pangs of labour.}}
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 865 ff :
{{quote|Dionysos called '''Nikaia''' (Nicaea), his own Kybeleid (Cybelid) Nymphe, and smiling pointed to Aura still unbraiding her childbed; proud of his late union with the lonely girl, he said : 'Now at last, Nikaia, you have found consolation for your love. Now again Dionysos has stolen a marriage bed, and ravished another maiden: woodland Aura in the mountains, who shrank once from the very name of love, has seen a marriage the image of yours. Not you alone had sweet sleep as a guide to love, not you alone drank deceitful wine which stole your maiden girdle; but once more a fountain of nuptial wine has burst from a new opening rock unrecognized, and Aura drank. You who have learnt the throes of childbirth in hard necessity, by Telete (Consecration) your dance weaving daughter I beseech you, hasten to lift up my son, that my desperate Aura may not destroy him with daring hands for I know she will kill one of the two baby boys in her intolerable frenzy, but do you help Iakkhos (Iacchus): guard the better boy, that your Telete may be the servant of son and father both.' With this appeal Bakkhos (Bacchus) departed, triumphant and proud of his two Phrygian marriages, with the elder wife and the younger bride . . . [Artemis rescued one of the sons of Aura before she could kill both her newborns and delivered him to Dionysos.] The father gave charge of his son [Iakkhos] to Nikaia the Nymphe as a nurse. She took him, and fed the boy, pressing out the life giving juice of her child nursing breasts from her teat, until he grew up.}}

'''''Oceans''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Océans'''}}) is a 2009 French [[nature documentary]] film directed, produced, co-written, and narrated by [[Jacques Perrin]], with Jacques Cluzaud as co-director. The film, produced in association with the [[Census of Marine Life]], explores the [[Marine biology|marine species]] of [[Earth]]'s five [[ocean]]s and reflects on the [[Environmental issue|negative aspects of human activity on the environment]], with Perrin ([[Pierce Brosnan]] in English) providing narration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=See a Movie, Save the Oceans |author=Scott Weber |periodical=NBC Los Angeles |date=8 February 2010 |url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/around-town/events/See-a-Movie-Save-the-Oceans-83837247.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budgeted at around $80 million, it was filmed in over 50 different places and took four years to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france-priorities_1/cinema_2/dossiers_6962/the-film-oceans-hymn-to-the-world-of-the-sea-january-2010_13547.html |title=The film "Oceans", a hymn to the world of the sea |publisher=France-Diplomatie |date=January 2010 |accessdate=14 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the film was distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] under their [[Disneynature]] label, who cut 20 minutes mostly depicting violent massacres of sea animals (recreated through visual effects) in order to aim it at a younger audience.

==Plot==
''Oceans'' presents details and facts about the journey of the ocean. The film begins on a beach and there are boys and one of them wonders what the ocean is. The scene cuts to the Galapagos where a clan of [[marine iguana]]s and [[horseshoe crab]]s wander.

Then at night a rocket takes off and surprises the two clans. Meanwhile, the rocket takes off to outer space. Then goes to the trench where the larvae of [[sea urchin]] and the crustacean egg lie. Then comes to a swarm of moon [[jellyfish]].

Then at day a different type of jellyfish float along the current. Later at the coast of South Africa, a hungry mob of common [[dolphin]]s, [[gannet]]s, [[bronze whaler shark]]s, and [[brydes whale]]s hunt [[sardine]]s. After the feast, [[manta ray]]s gobble down a few sardines. moments later a [[blanket octopus]] swims quietly along the current. Meanwhile, the sardines start making odd shapes. At a beach [[sea lion]]s rest in the sun. In deeper water, a [[humpback whale]] and her calf start to flipper slap, spyhop, and breach. Meanwhile, the sea lions start hunting. the others on the beach watch sally lightfoot [[crab]]s crawl on the sand. The hunting sea lions are returning home, but some are eaten by a [[great white shark]] and a [[killer whale]]. In the deeper waters, a [[blue whale]] feasts on some [[krill]]. At twilight, birds are flying back to their nests. At night carnivores are out to hunt on the reef including the [[mantis shrimp]] who kills a crab in the movie. In Australia, a [[Spanish dancer]] comes out of its home. At day, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s are leaping on the waves. Meanwhile, a [[dugong]] and green [[sea turtle]] are feasting on [[sea grass]]. On the beach, baby sea turtles have to make it to the ocean without being eaten by [[frigatebird]]s, which only one baby turtle survives. In the sea, [[sailfish]] are feasting on fish.

At a [[coral reef]], creatures are minding their own business Beyond the reef a [[cuttlefish]] is eating crabs. After that, [[garden eel]]s and [[Centriscidae|razorfish]] act really smooth. After that, [[spider crabs]] start war. Meanwhile, [[humpback whales]], blue whales, [[Molidae|sunfish]], [[blue shark]]s, [[sperm whale]]s and [[whale shark]]s migrate. Then a bunch of [[spinner dolphin]]s, [[yellowfin tuna]], and [[manta ray]]s swim for a long time. Far away, an [[Asian sheepshead wrasse]] is mating. Miles away, a [[sea otter]] is smashing [[clam]]s. In Alaska, the humpback whales have made it to the feeding grounds. The scene cuts to netted sea animals including tuna, whale sharks, sailfish, sea turtles, and sunfish. Along the way the fishing boat has a hard time fighting the waves. Then a satellite shows the trash in the ocean. Underwater tons of trash is destroying a [[fur seal]]'s home. The scene cuts to the 2 polar regions Arctic and Antarctica. Then, divers are discovering the ocean, and one of them swims with a great white shark. At the end, the narrator says we shouldn't ask what exactly is the ocean, we should ask what exactly are we.

==Production==

===Filming===
The documentary was produced in collaboration with scientists from the [[Census of Marine Life]] and employed technologies including stabilized cameras for rough seas, an electric mini-helicopter to approach and film marine animals without noise, and submerged cameras both towed and on poles over the side of vessels, resulting in film of over 200 species at more than 50 global locations.&lt;ref&gt;Snelgrove, Paul V. R. 2010. Discoveries of the Census of Marine Life: Making Ocean Life Count. Cambridge University Press, 270 pp. ISBN: 9780521165129 (paperback), 9781107000131 (hardback) (pp. 76-77).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[Demi Lovato]] and [[Joe Jonas]] recorded a special duet for Disney's North American release titled, "[[Disney's Friends for Change#Make a Wave|Make a Wave]]". The documentary was accompanied by a score composed by [[Bruno Coulais]], performed by the Paris Philharmonic Orchestra. The score features Coulais' trademark instrumentation and musical style, combining solo players, electronic enhancement effects and other unusual musical elements. Three themes are featured within the score, one of them adapted into a song entitled "Océan Will Be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/oceans.html|title=Filmtracks: Oceans (Bruno Coulais)|website=www.filmtracks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film has received positive reviews from critics. At The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the movie has received an 81% fresh rating from overall critics from 62 reviews.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10011268-oceans/ | title=Oceans - Trailers - Movie Reviews | publisher=''[[Flixster]], Inc'' | work=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its consenus states "''Oceans'' adds another visually stunning chapter to the Disney Nature library." &lt;ref name="rt" /&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] from 0-100 of top reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 79% based on 20 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/oceans2010 | title=Oceans reviews at Metacritic.com | work=Metacritic | publisher=''[[CBS Interactive]] Inc'' | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The world version of the film received much more praise than the USA and Canada version.
  
The film opened briefly at #1, grossing $2,466,530 from 1,206 theaters on opening day; an excellent number in documentary standards, despite being far from the opening day total of its predecessor, ''[[Earth (2007 film)|Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&amp;id=oceans.htm | title=Oceans (2010) - Daily Box Office Results | publisher=''[[IMDB]].com, Inc'' | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film was overshadowed by its competition with ''[[The Back-Up Plan]]'' and ''[[The Losers (film)|The Losers]]'' as well as continued success from ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' and ''[[Date Night]]''. The film grossed $6 million over the Friday-Sunday period, reaching eighth place at the box office, and taking somewhat less than ''Earth''{{'}}s $8.8 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2737&amp;p=.htm | title='Dragons' Dominate by Default | author=Gray, Brandon | publisher=''[[IMDB]].com, Inc'' | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but taking more than ''[[March of the Penguins]]''. It was the third highest-grossing opening for a documentary film. Despite grossing an additional $4 million over the week, the film collapsed 57% in its second weekend, a steeper drop than its predecessor, taking in $2.6 million from 1,210 theaters. The film earned an additional $2 million over the week and $1.6 million in its third weekend as well as expanding to 1,232 theaters and remaining in tenth place. The film was a disappointment at the United States box office as it closed on July 15, 2010 after only 85 days of release, earning $19,422,319 domestically. However, the film earned $63,229,120 overseas for a total of $82,651,439 worldwide, making it financially successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=oceans.htm | title=Oceans | publisher= Box Office Mojo | accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD]] on October 19, 2010.

Offsets can be defined as provisions to an import agreement, between an exporting foreign company, or possibly a government acting as intermediary, and an importing public entity, that oblige the exporter to undertake activities in order to satisfy a second objective of the importing entity, distinct from the acquisition of the goods and/or services that form the core transaction. The incentive for the exporter results from the conditioning of the core transaction to the acceptance of the offset obligation. &lt;ref&gt;Ianakiev, Gueorgui (2014), " Defence Offsets : Regulation and Impact on the Integration of the European Defence Equipment Market ", in Bellais, Renaud (ed) (2014), "The Evolving Boundaries of Defence : An Assessment of Recent Shifts in Defence Activities ", Emerald Group Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;
Offset agreements often involve trade in military goods and services and are alternatively called: industrial compensations, industrial cooperation, offsets, industrial and regional benefits, balances, ''juste retour'' or equilibrium, to define mechanisms more complex than [[counter-trade]].
Counter-trade can also be considered one of the many forms of defense offset, to compensate a purchasing country.&lt;ref&gt;Counter-trade is an indirect offset. As a general introduction to the topic see J. Brauer -J. P. Dunne Arms ''Trade Offsets and Development'', 2005 (Martin, 1996, Udis and Maskus, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main difference between a generic offset and counter-trade, both common practices in the international defense trade, is the involvement of money. In counter-trade, goods are paid through barters or other mechanisms without the exchange of money, while in other generic offsets money is the main medium of exchange.

==Definition==
Offsets can be defined as provisions to an import agreement, between an exporting foreign company, or possibly a government acting as intermediary, and an importing public entity, that oblige the exporter to undertake activities in order to satisfy a second objective of the importing entity, distinct from the acquisition of the goods and/or services that form the core transaction. The incentive for the exporter results from the conditioning of the core transaction to the acceptance of the offset obligation. &lt;ref&gt;Ianakiev, Gueorgui (2014), " Defence Offsets : Regulation and Impact on the Integration of the European Defence Equipment Market ", in Bellais, Renaud (ed) (2014), "The Evolving Boundaries of Defence : An Assessment of Recent Shifts in Defence Activities ", Emerald Group Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the proclaimed aim of this process is to even-up a country's [[balance of trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndia.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Advocacy/Action_Items/PDFs29/Offset_Background_Paper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some forms of offsets transactions do not represent trade flows going from the initial importer towards the initial exporter. Offsets are frequently an integral part of international defense contracts.&lt;ref name=Acq&gt;http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/ic/offsets_of_foreign_military_sales.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offset as unfair burden===
The U.S. government's definition of offset agreement is the most crucial, since the U.S. aerospace and defense industry is the biggest exporter of aerospace and defence products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstopexports.com/aerospace-exports-by-country/ "Aerospace Exports by Country"]&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore engaged in the majority of the world’s offsets. The U.S. has a [[Commerce Department]] Division, the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (BIS), that deals specifically with U.S. defense offset agreements with foreign nations as a main subset of U.S. industrial security.  BIS - whose main task is protecting U.S. security from the point of view of export of high technology, fostering commercially acceptable U.S. foreign policy, and protecting U.S. economic interests - deals with U.S. aerospace and defense companies that export defense products, systems or services, involving “offset agreements,” that is, those sales' collateral or additional agreements requested by purchasers.  BIS defines offsets as “mandatory compensations required by foreign governments when purchasing weapon systems and services.”&lt;ref&gt;BIS, Annual Report, 2006 p. 28. See also the definition: “Offset: Compensation practices required as a condition of purchase in either government-to-government or commercial sales of “defense articles” and/or “defense services” as defined by the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. § 2751, et seq.) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 C.F.R. §§ 120-130). – BIS, 2007, page   . For a Glossary on Defense Offsets see
	[http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/osies/offsets/13th_report_to_congress.pdf]
	 Appendix E, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government underlines the compulsory aspect of this trade practice, since the United States, with other weapons exporting countries, such as Germany and France, opposes offsets as forms of protectionism and harmful transgressions of free market rules. These governments frown on offset agreements, consider them to be both market distorting and inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;In 2002, U.S. companies had 49% of global defense industry export, EU% 35. Data from AECMA 2002 Facts and Figures.[http://www.aecma.org/Publications/AECMA_FactsnFigures_2002.pdf]. See also [http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pfi17f7KhiCtd4zCv_PGDMA&amp;gid=1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022130700/https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pfi17f7KhiCtd4zCv_PGDMA&amp;gid=1 |date=2012-10-22 }}. In 2007, according to SIPRI open source data, the U.S. percentage of global export in arms was 61%.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Offset as partnership ===
In 2008 the Brazilian Minister of Strategic Affairs, speaking of a major defense purchase by his country, highlighted this key point: “We will not simply be buyers or clients, but partners.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Americas/Brazil-to-rebuild-its-weapons-industry/Article1-335618.aspx]; [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]], Brazilian Strategic Affairs Minister up to June 2009, now Harvard University professor.&lt;/ref&gt; The competition by different companies “in offering  comparable weapons to a country" is also on the level of “sharing” or “partnership” with the purchaser, [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] added.

=== Offset as marketing tool ===
In weapons trade, defense contractors are fully aware that offsets are powerful marketing tools to motivate the purchase, by showing and giving additional advantages for the purchasing country besides investing in military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd J. Dumas, ''Do offsets mitigate or magnify the military burden?'' in J. Brauer - J.P. Dunne, ''Arms Trade and Economic Development. Theory, Policy, and Cases in Arms Trade Offset'' London-New York, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. defense industry position seems to be more practical, and somewhat quietly nonaligned with U.S. government economic or political assessment of defense offsets. Generally speaking, one can understand offsets as a widespread sales technique. As such, they are not restricted to weapons sale, they belong to commerce itself, in the same way that rebates, price-pack deals, or loyalty rewards programs do. Understanding “defense offsets” to be part of a sales technique helps to curb the justified yet excessive emphasis on their mandatory nature.

Often, defense offsets are more motivating than the primary defense acquisition, for personal or political reasons. This may seem irrational, but it is part of commerce. If one adds the prevalent political aspect of spending huge public funds on modern weapons, then the motivating significance of defense offsets could not be underestimated in contemporary decision processes of democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Markunsen describes (and opposes) defense offsets not as economy or politics, but as “political economy.” Most EU countries have their Ministries of Economy in charge, or at least heavily involved in, the offset business, since they understand offsets precisely as “political economy.”&lt;/ref&gt; Prime defense contractors are well aware of offsets' power in the psychologies of democracies. As anyone can understand, the seller will include the cost of the “Envelope B,” that is, of the offset and its added value for the purchaser, in its total cost. In other words, the client will pay for the offset; it is not a free lunch.&lt;ref&gt;And the connected question: are defense offsets a benefit to the buyer greater than a negotiation for a weapons acquisition off-the-shelf? See on this point J. Brauer and J.P. Dunne, ''Arms Trade and Economic Development''. ''Theory, policy, and cases in arms trade offsets''. Routledge, Abingdon - New York 2004&lt;/ref&gt; But the key question is: to what extent is the offset proposal a factor in the consideration of defense contractor’s tender during the evaluation and the decision procedures? 
[[Transparency International]] clearly summarizes that using offsets as marketing tools makes offsets "the ideal playground for corruption":  
{{Quotation|There are three main categories of corruption risk from offsets:&lt;br&gt;
1. Improperly influencing the need for a particular defence acquisition in the first place&lt;br&gt;
2. Influencing the competitive decision for the main contract in non-transparent ways&lt;br&gt;
3. Allowing favours to be repaid to corrupt government officials via the offset contracts| Defence Offsets: Addressing The Risks Of Corruption &amp; Raising Transparency, Transparency International, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Magahy, B, Vilhena da Cunha, F., Pyman, M., Defence Offsets: Addressing The Risks Of Corruption &amp; Raising Transparency, Transparency International, (J. Muravska and A. Wegener eds.), 2010. {{ISBN|978-3-935711-49-4}}, p. 2 [92]. See also Shana Marshall, The Modernization of Bribery: The Arms Trade in the Arab Gulf, ''Jadaliyya'', Dec. 22, 2010, [http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/413/the-modernization-of-bribery_the-arms-trade-in-the]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The universe of this military niche of offsets trade is sophisticated and less innocuous than commonly believed. In 2000 [[Daniel Pearl]] wrote an article about the universe of offsets: “could the sale of U.S. weapons in the Persian Gulf help an oil concern unload gasoline stations in Europe? Yes, under the new logic of international arms deals.”&lt;ref&gt;April 20, 2000 - Offset Requirements Of Defense Deals Often Have Little To Do With Purchaser -- By Daniel Pearl – Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl describes the new-found world of indirect offsets:  
{{Quotation|For decades, countries that buy weapons have imposed "offset" requirements on their suppliers that keep some of the economic benefits of the deal at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now, defense contractors are moving toward more exotic plans to satisfy their growing offset obligations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Many deals have no relationship to the weapons being sold, and a few have only a tenuous connection to the country that is buying.|Daniel Pearl&lt;ref&gt;April 20, 2000, ''Offset Requirements Of Defense Deals Often Have Little To Do With Purchaser''  Daniel Pearl, ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;}} The market size of the international offset business is related to the volume of international weapons trade in the world. According to [[SIPRI]], in 2007 there were [[US$]]51 billion of weapons exports, an approximate value because it is open source, and not all weapons deals data are open source information.

As an example of a defense offset proposal, we could describe a hypothetical case of Nation ''P'' (Purchaser) buying 300 tanks from defense company ''S'' (Seller, of Nation S).&lt;ref&gt;See also U.S. ''Bureau for Industry and Security'''s example to explain the offset. BIS Annual Report 2007, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The total sale contract is $400 million and Nation ''P'' (Purchaser) requests offset of 120%. Defense Company ''S'' (Seller) is obliged to fulfill an offset equal to 120% of the sales contract, that is $480M. Nation ''P'' agrees on a list of specific offset deals and programs to fulfill the agreed total obligation with Company ''S'' (Seller). The offset agreement includes both direct and indirect offsets.

Nation ''P'' also assigns a credit value for each typology of offsets offered by Company ''S''. The credit value for the offset obligations is not the “actual value,” but it is the “actual value” by a multiplier, that expresses the degree of interest of Nation ''P'' (Purchaser) in the proposed offsets. In other words, something deemed very valuable by nation ''P'' will have a high multiplier that expresses the importance and the value to Nation ''P'' of that type of offset. The multiplier (for instance 2, or 5, or 7) translates nation P's attached value into the credit value that eventually accounts for the fulfillment of the agreed sum of $480M (120% of offset); it is evident that with no multipliers, 120% offset would be nonsense. 
Most of the offset packages are divided into direct and indirect offsets. Here is a hypothetical, complex offset offer, divided into direct and indirect offsets in Nation ''P''.
[[File:Offset-hypoth-example.jpg|thumb|400px|right]]

Direct Offsets (military and related to the product of the Company ''S'', i.e. the tanks in this example)

:Co-production: Nation ''P'' chooses one or more local companies to manufacture some components of the tanks, such as turrets and some of the internal components.  The actual value of the components is $70 million.  Nation ''P''  assigns a multiplier of 3, since this develops capabilities of its military industrial base and creates jobs in Nation ''P''. The total credit value for the fulfillment of the overall offset obligation is $70M x 3 = $210M.

Indirect Offsets (civilian and other agreements not related to the production of the weapons item, the tanks. They could be also military or security related, but not directly connected with the main acquisition, i.e., the tanks)

:Foreign Direct Investments: Company ''S'' makes investments in 5 (defense or non-defense) companies in Nation ''P''. The total value of the investments is $14.5M, and the multiplier is 4, a high multiplier, since Nation "P" suffers from a chronic lack of Foreign Direct Investments. This makes an additional credit value for Company ''S'' of $58M.

:Technology Transfer: Company S provides water desalination technologies to one Nation ''P'' company. This technology is particularly appreciated by Nation "P". Its actual value is $20M, but the credit value is 7 times the actual value, that is, $140M.

:Export Assistance and Marketing: Company ''S'' provides commercial assistance to market products and services of a Nation "P" company in a difficult market, such as, for instance, the Middle East. The assistance is offered for 8 years, at the value of $3M per year. Nation ''P'' considers this assistance to export as important to create new revenue streams and jobs for its company, and sets a multiplier of 3.  Credit value: $72M. (Since company ''S'' is not an expert on marketing and export assistance, it may hire a specialist company to subcontract the job. Such a subcontractor is also known as an “offset fulfiller”).

Nation ''P'' controls not only the supply of the military systems or services, but also the implementation of the offsets according to the offset agreement included or related to the main supply contract. This control is within the Minister of Defense and/or Ministry of Economy or Finance, or Ministry of Industry and Trade. Often arms importing nations establish special agencies for the supervision of the defense offsets.&lt;ref&gt;The example above is a simplified and graphic version of one of the best examples of offsets by the U.S. Department of Commerce: "'''OFFSET EXAMPLE''': This example is for illustrative purposes only and in no way represents an actual offset agreement. The fictitious nation of Atlantis purchased ten KS-340 jet fighters from a U.S. defense firm, PJD Inc. (PJD), for a total of $500 million with a 100 percent offset.  In other words, the offset agreement obligated PJD to fulfill offsets equal to the value of the contract, or $500 million.  The government of Atlantis decided what would be required of PJD in order to fulfill its offset obligation, which would include both direct and indirect compensation. The government [of Atlantis] also assigned the credit value for each category." BIS example then illustrates the fulfillment of the offset agreement with direct and indirect offset. See U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security ''Offsets in Defense Trade, Eleventh Report to Congress'', 2007, ''Appendix G, Glossary and Offset Example''[http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/osies/offsets/final_offsets_eleven_report.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of offset==
Offset proposals often make a distinction between direct and indirect offset.&lt;ref&gt;“Offset comes in different types, the most basic division being:
:  '''''Direct offsets''': Transactions that are directly related to the defense items or services exported by a defense firm – the supplying prime of offset.''
:  '''''Indirect offsets''': Offset transactions that are not directly related to the defense items or services exported by the supplying prime. These are further subdivided into:''
::'''''Defense (related) indirect offsets'''''
::'''''Non-defense (related) indirect offsets'''''.
Final Report of 06-DIM-022 ''Study on the effects of offsets on the Development of a European Defence Industry and Market'' By E. Anders Eriksson with contributions by Mattias Axelson, Keith Hartley, Mike Mason, Ann-Sofie Stenérus and Martin Trybus, 12 July 2007. The study was financed by the [[European Defense Agency]] and contracted to FOI and SCS. [http://www.eda.europa.eu/studiesprojects.aspx?directorate=Industry%20and%20Market], p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct offset is a [[Side letter (contract law)|side agreement]] that is directly related to the main product/service that is bought/sold, that is military equipment, systems, or services. They may be also called military offsets.  For example, a buyer of military equipment may be given the right to produce a component of a related technology in the buyer's country.

Indirect offsets are side agreements that are not directly related to the product/service that is bought/sold. Most people refer to such category of offsets as civilian offsets, though there are many indirect offsets that are not civilian offsets.  Indirect offsets may take the form of services, investments, counter-trade and/or co-production. For instance, Greek companies produce part of the [[Lockheed C-130]] that they bought from U.S. The Greek co-production is a U.S. direct offset. Or, in a more sophisticated form of offset involving three countries, Portugal is in charge of the maintenance of Kuwaiti [[Lockheed Martin]] aircraft. This is a Portuguese “direct offset", since Portugal bought the aircraft, and is partner in charge of their maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;For the definition of semi-direct offset see Belgian Policy of ''Industrial Compensation'' [http://economie.fgov.be/]&lt;/ref&gt; An investment in a security software company of Romania, or in assisting the export and marketing in difficult areas of a Belgian environmental company are other forms of actual indirect offsets.

The most common types of direct/indirect offsets are:

The most complete and accurate list of actual offsets can be found in the BIS Annual Reports to Congress, where all forms of registered offset are codified, according to the old [[Standard Industrial Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the Offsets in Defense Trade, Sixth Study.- BIS Annual Report to Congress, 2002. [http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/osies/offsets/01rept.pdf]. Also Appendix D: Offsets Transactions by SIC based Economic Sectors (spreadsheet) [http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/osies/offsets/2001rptexecsum.htm]; Recently BIS moved to [[NAICS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some offset mechanisms ==

Since offsets typically include military departments of sovereign nations comparable to the [[US Defense Department]], many countries have offset laws, public regulations or, alternatively, formal internal offset policies.

=== Defense prime contractor, offset service providers ===
In medium and large tenders for weapons systems the bid can be very complex, involving one or more than one company as bidder. The main offer is guided by a prime contractor that may have other companies associated to the bid as partners or as subcontractors. However, in regards to the agreed offset proposal only the prime contractor is liable toward the final client for its fulfillment. Since offsets are increasingly complex, the prime contractor may hire subcontractors to fulfill its contractual obligations. While the liability for the offsets stays with the prime contractor, the job can be executed by a subcontractor, or an offset fulfiller.
One of the collateral benefits of offsets in U.S. (probably not offsetting the adverse effects of defense offsets on economy and jobs) is the proliferation of legal and economic jobs in the “offsets sector,” that goes from international legal companies to the fully staffed international offices of U.S. defense companies. In addition, the establishment of new companies in “offset” venture capital, in “offset” marketing assistance: offset fulfillers that provide their support services to the defense and aerospace industry.  While many offset programs originally evolved as a result of defense and aerospace sales, today many new offset / Industrial Partnership programs have developed as a result of nations wanting to improve their industrial base, level of technology and desire to become more self-sufficient across a broad range of industry sectors.  As a result of this new interest and demand for Industrial Partnership, there has been both a growth and establishment of new offset associations.  There are both Global and Domestic "Offset" / Industrial Partnership organizations. The largest and most widely attended global association is ''GOCA'', the Global Offset and Countertrade Association, whose purpose is to promote trade and commerce between companies around the world and their foreign customers through a greater understanding of countertrade and offset.&lt;ref&gt;To obtain a more in depth overview of offset or Industrial Partnership activities, see GOCA website [http://www.globaloffset.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Each year GOCA hosts several industry meetings in partnership with other European and American offset organizations such as the ADS, ''Aerospace Defence Security''[http://www.adsgroup.org.uk] and DIOA, the U.S. ''Defense Industry Offset Association''[http://www.dioa.org]. ''DIOA'' was established in 1985 by members of the U.S. Defense Industry to foster education, networking and guidelines for professionalism in offsets implementations. 
The industry meetings referenced above are attended by leading global industrial companies, companies that specialize in providing support services for Industrial Partnership fulfillment, and by various government and military authorities, mostly from national ministries of defense and economy, who oversee and monitor offset and Industrial Partnership programs. The purpose of these industry meetings is to educate, and to foster relationships between the various offset obligors and beneficiaries so that real and sustainable economic benefits can be delivered to nations who are seeking to improve their respective economies. Offsets and Industrial Partnership programs have been evolving for over three decades and there are dozens of articles that describe various successes and challenges that have resulted from implementing offset programs. The most widely read publication that deals with the developments in the Offset and Industrial Participation arena is ''Countertrade and Offset'' ("CTO")[http://www.cto-offset.com].&lt;ref&gt;A sampling of some of the articles written include .....; See also Ann Markusen, ''Arms Trade as Illiberal Trade'', 2004: '''Defense contractors as trading companies''' in J. Brauer - JP Donne, ''Arms Trade and Economic Development'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Offset fulfillers /service providers may perform various support services: including marketing assistance, sourcing and structuring venture capital or other forms of corporate credit for [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), or more complex things, such as a joint ventures to produce shrimp (''Devcorp'', Bahrain [https://web.archive.org/web/20090207044544/http://devcorpint.com/]), a sugar factory, or, recently, environment and renewable energy.

=== Offset certificates, penalties, confidentiality clauses, pre-offset activities ===
Offsets are of various durations. They may be planned to last for 1 or 2 years, but 8-10 year plans are very common; exceptionally long is an offset like Al Yamamah Program, a BAE-UK offset in Saudi Arabia in place since 1987. Clients (sovereign countries) have in place mechanisms to control their implementations, and to certificate milestone accomplishments in their offset programs. An offset supervision authority certifies the advancement in the offset completion in percentages, issuing offset certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) DoD 5105, Ch 5, page 247, Figure C5.F14. Offset Certificate. {{cite web |url=http://www.dsca.mil/samm/Chapter%2005%20-%20FMS%20Case%20Development.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617050714/http://www.dsca.mil/samm/Chapter%2005%20-%20FMS%20Case%20Development.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These certificates may be issued to prime contractors fulfilling their offset agreement, but also to offset fulfillers, that have subcontracted the job from prime contractors and registered as such in the foreign countries. When there are multipliers, such certificates express the percentage of completion in "credit value" ("actual value" X multiplier). Offset fulfillers redeems the offsets certificates through contracts or subcontracts with the prime contractor. More recently, given the importance and the growth of offset practices around the world, offset fulfillers can “sell” their certificates to prime contractors other than their initial one, as long as they have national offset commissions authorizations. In this profitable niche of defense industry made by offset specialists, lawyers and companies - there is also a “currency” and a “trade” of offset certificates.

Like in any contract, there are forms of penalty for failing to complete offset obligations. Many nations have rigid systems of penalties, including the use of bank guarantees, while other nations believe in continued negotiations that are based on “the best effort” clauses. The list of incentives and penalties for offset is no different from many other systems of procurement, with two remarkable exceptions:

1. In the offset business there are two contracts proceeding in parallel, i.e. primary (A) and side (B) contract:
::A) The supply of defense equipment/services from the Defense Company to the Client (Foreign State), according to contractual specification (quality, quantity, time, etc.)
::B) The offsets progress as monitored by the same Client (Foreign State), but most of the times by a different State entity, according to contractual offset agreement (quality, quantity, time, etc.).
:These two contracts impact on each other and problems with one can affect the other. However, since most offsets today are not “direct,” this may create confusions and distortions, especially due to “indirect offsets.”

2. In direct offsets contracts there are legitimate "clauses of confidentiality", that in several countries may even assume value of official classification, up to secret of state. In European Union States, however, extending state secret classifications to indirect offsets - that have nothing to do with military or state security - is considered an abuse. For instance, classifying an offset not-related to state security or military preparedness - such as indirect and civilian offsets in pharmaceutical research, environmental technologies or export assistance of any non-military/security products - leads not only to major [[market distortion]]s but also to possibly unpunished corruption protected by baseless secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;"Offsets are under much less scrutiny during their negotiation than the main arms deal. This holds true for both governmental scrutiny and for public awareness of such contracts. Worse, in many countries, there is almost no due diligence on potential improper beneficiaries from the offsets, no monitoring of performance on offset contracts, no audits of what was delivered compared to the pledges, and no publication of offset results, benefits or performance at all. This makes offsets an ideal playground for corruption. The lack of surveillance of the offsets contracts is amplified by their complexity. Offsets processes involve a range of complicated and detailed contracts and often include investments into a variety of companies and subsidiaries, making monitoring even more difficult." Magahy, B, Vilhena da Cunha, F., Pyman, M., Defence Offsets: Addressing The Risks Of Corruption &amp; Raising Transparency, Transparency International, (J. Muravska and A. Wegener eds.), 2010, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;
Pre-offset activities are allowed and welcomed by several countries; they are like offsets without certainties to obtain “credit value”. These activities are straight marketing activities, similar to lobbying, to promote specific defense purchases. These pre-offset activities must be registered as such with national authorities. Often pre-offset activities will receive certificates, after a sale. Defense companies include them in the marketing budget, but after the sale, these offsets go into their offset budgets, and count toward offset fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;“Defence companies often avoid significant spending on an offset project, prior to the award of the defence contract for an obvious reason; the defence market is characterised by uncertainty - programme delays, [[cost overrun|budget overruns]] and economic problems at national and corporate level are common. However, there are exceptions to the rule, such as in the case of Swedish defence aerospace group Saab.” Keri Smith JDIN Reporter Offsets in Europe: A matter for debate Jane's Defence Weekly - November 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of pre-offset activities are sales arguments to convince the buying state of the strength and reliability of the aerospace &amp; defense company as potential supplier and partner. The pre-offsets arena is also the delicate and problematic field of sale-facilitators and, precisely because the client is a state, this must be monitored with additional care, since this field is prone to abuse and outright corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenceagainstcorruption.org/images/stories/TI_Defence_Offset_Report_2010-webLR.pdf]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign military and direct commercial sales – "no known offsets" and FMS ===
For the U.S., the major world exporter of weapons by far, there are two main ways to sell weapons to a foreign country. The first is referred to as "[[Direct Commercial Sales|Direct Commercial Sale]]" and it is a company to government sale. The second way is referred to as "[[Foreign Military Sales]]", that is a government to government sale.

A Direct Commercial Sale is highly supervised by U.S. Government and even by the U.S. Congress, in spite of its free market appearance. The arms trade, because of its connection with national security, is never free from strict government supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Markusen, ''The Arms Trade as Illiberal Trade'', Conference on Defense Offsets, Cape Town, South Africa, September 24-6, 2002. Ann Markunsen, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, directed also a 2 years long “''Study Group on the Arms Trade and the Transnationalization of the Defense Industry: Economic versus Security Drivers''” in 1998-2000 {{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/project/207/study_group_on_the_arms_trade_and_the_transnationalization_of_the_defense_industry.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826183452/http://www.cfr.org/project/207/study_group_on_the_arms_trade_and_the_transnationalization_of_the_defense_industry.html |archivedate=2008-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a sale to a foreign country's Defense Department, a U.S. defense firm must be licensed. It is checked by the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] and by the [[State Department]], and, in the case of relevant sales, even authorized or vetoed by [[U.S. Congress]]. Direct Commercial Sales are highly regulated because of security, political, and commercial reasons. Even from the point of view of indirect and non-military offset agreements, U.S. Defense companies and their subcontractors (offset fulfillers) must present detailed report of their offset activities to the [[Commerce Department]], [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (BIS).&lt;ref&gt;The most insidious damages to U.S. economy are unexpected problems and losses that may arise in all economic sectors (the area of U.S. indirect offsets) to unaware U.S. companies and business. The unjustified secrecy of civilian offsets, supported by a strong defense contractors' lobby: a) prohibits a definitive evaluation of the economic successes or, alternatively, of the economic adverse effects of indirect offsets; b) creates unknown and hidden source of losses and problems for U.S. companies; c) establishes clandestine niches of business areas, unnecessarily and unjustly protected by secrecy, where abuses, violations, frauds and corruption escape laws. d) damage the concept of “state secret” by extending it to things that do not deserve such high, noble, and restricted protection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign Military Sales are indirect sales of weapons produced by one or more U.S. contractors through an agency of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[Defense Security Cooperation Agency]] (DSCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dsca.mil/programs/biz-ops/factsbook/FactsBook07.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615124321/http://www.dsca.mil/programs/biz-ops/factsbook/FactsBook07.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsca.mil/]&lt;/ref&gt; In a way, DSCA acts as Prime Contractor's agent in promoting and selling U.S. made weapons to foreign countries. The known FMS disadvantage is that DSCA adds to the final sale price a small percentage for its own administrative costs; the advantage is some free training with U.S. Armed Forces for joint international operations.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Defense Department – Defense Security Cooperation Agency: “Strength through Cooperation. The FMS Advantage:  Frequently Asked Questions About Foreign Military Sales” [http://www.libertyparkusafd.org/lp/Hale/Special%20Reports%5CDefense%20Security%20Cooperation%20Agency%5CThe%20FMS%20Advantage.pdf]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of sale, however, there are two important aspects in regards to the offset business.

[[File:Fms-dcs-offsets.jpg|thumb|400px|right]]

1) Since 1990, under a specific directive by President George Bush,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/paic/attachments/offsets/presidential_policy_on_offsets_in_mil_exports.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; no U.S. Federal Agency or U.S. Government employee can be involved in the offset business. To each press release about a FMS (or of any documents regarding a FMS), there is a standard disclaimer: “There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this (potential) sale.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsca.mil/PressReleases/36-b/2006/Saudi%20Arabia_06-36.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210215450/http://www.dsca.mil/PressReleases/36-b/2006/Saudi%20Arabia_06-36.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-10 |df= }} All public releases by DSCA regarding FMS sales must include this disclaimer.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quotation|This language seems to imply that U.S. Government, as the broker for  the FMS case, has special insight into the transaction and is almost certifying  that there are, in fact, no offsets. Nothing could be further from the truth.|Mark Nackman, ''A Critical Examination Of Offsets In International Defense Procurements'' &lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Nackman, M. A Critical Examination Of Offsets In International Defense Procurements: Policy Options For The United States, Public Contract Law Journal, Vol. 40, No. 2, Winter 2011, p. 526&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The ''Defense Security Cooperation Agency'' acts on behalf of the prime contractor with a foreign government and refuses even the mere knowledge about offsets, but under the FMS program prime contractors are allowed to put all their offset costs into the final price.&lt;ref&gt;“Note 9. OFFSET COSTS. The Department of Defense is not a party to any offset agreements/arrangements that may be required by the Purchaser in relation to the sales made in this LOA and assumes no obligation to administer or satisfy any offset requirements or bear any of the associated costs. To the extent that the Purchaser requires offsets in conjunction with this sale, offset costs may be included in the price of contracts negotiated under this LOA. If the Purchaser desires visibility into these costs, the Purchaser should raise this with the contractor during negotiation of offset arrangements.”  ''Security Assistance Management Manual'' (SAMM), DoD 5105, Ch.5, pag. 22 – {{cite web |url=http://www.dsca.mil/samm/Chapter%2005%20-%20FMS%20Case%20Development.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617050714/http://www.dsca.mil/samm/Chapter%2005%20-%20FMS%20Case%20Development.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the offset is not even itemized in the FMS offer, and if the client wants to discuss or simply to know the cost of the offset, the client must speak directly with the Contractor and not with DSCA. In other words, U.S. Government cannot deal with offsets; U.S. Defense Prime Contractors can and do. DSCA has made available in its complete manual details and analytical explanations for U.S. Defense companies on how to include the offset various costs into their contract and invoices.&lt;ref&gt;See above.&lt;/ref&gt; So prime contractors, even under FMS, are allowed to recover all costs “of any offsets which are associated with those contracts.” To be sure, “U.S. Government agencies may not enter into or commit U.S. companies to any offset agreement.” 
''De facto'' during the cold war offsets had different functions and often U.S. Government Agencies were directly involved. President Bush, by ending the cold war with a victory, likewise ended U.S. agencies’ liability in delicate practices like the offsets (1990), since they lost the primary political value they had during the cold war.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Lockheed bribery scandals]] in Japan, Germany, The Netherlands and Italy is one of the most known for the political liabilities involved in the side agreements of weapons sales. In this famous case, the involvement was of military officers and main politicians of U.S. allied countries. A more recent affair is the Belgian Dassault [[Agusta scandal]].&lt;/ref&gt;

2) U.S. funds assigned by [[United States Foreign Military Financing]] (FMF) that may be connected with [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) cannot be used for any type of offsets, if they are non-repayable funds. On the other hand, FMF funds may be used for offset costs if they are loans. In any case, "U.S. Government agencies may not enter into or commit U.S. firms to any offset agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dsca.osd.mil/samm/PolicyMemoList-All.htm |title=SAMM, C6.3.9, Offset, as amended in 2006, DSCA Policy 06-31 |access-date=2011-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001020154/http://www.dsca.osd.mil/samm/PolicyMemoList-All.htm |archive-date=2011-10-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of offset policies of different countries==
The following is a cursory survey on some countries' offset policies. It does not enter into details, and basically it gives: 1) the legal base for the offset; 2) the purchase threshold above which there is a requests for offset; 3) the requested “quantity” of offset by the country in terms of percentages of the contract value; 4) the applied multipliers, that qualify (“quality”) through a number the appreciations of a certain type of offsets (the “Credit Value” of an offset is the “Actual Value” by the multiplier); 5) and some remarks or specific information, including the websites of the National Offset activities.

A detailed list of the National Laws and Policies of the Countries of the European Union can be found in the website of [[European Defense Agency]] in a new “EU Offset Portal”[http://www.eda.europa.eu/offsets/]. Another very useful analysis of country policies can be found in Belgian Ministry of Economy (in charge of Belgian offsets). This publicly available document gives one of the most intelligent global analyses of countries offsets policies, with a purchaser's perspective, that is the point of view of weapons importer countries [https://web.archive.org/web/20070516204911/http://economie.fgov.be/organization_market/compensations/industrial_offset_en.htm]. From a similar point of view, one can see the purchaser's point of view on offsets in UAE offset web-page [http://www.offset.ae], in the new Kuwaiti articulated offset policy [http://www.kuwaitnoc.com].

On the seller's point of view, in [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (BIS) Annual Reports to U.S. Congress one can find the position on offsets of weapons exporters countries like U.S. Magazines and specialized publications like ''Jane's Defense Industry'' [http://www.janes.com],'' EPICOS''[http://www.epicos.com], ''Countertrade &amp; Offset'' or CTO [http://www.cto-offset.com]  give detail accounts and updates on national policies, requests, changes, etc.

==={{flag|Australia}}===
The Department of Defense (Defense Material Organization) is in charge of the offset. The threshold is 5 million of Australian Dollars. Multipliers go from 1 to 6. By rule, Australia does not accept indirect (civilian) offsets, unless such offsets brings benefits to the Australian Defense Industry.[http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/]

Offset Agreements are negotiated by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Labor on a case by case basis; the percentage of offset is above 100%, up to 200% (and sometimes even more) of the contract values. Austria has one of the highest requests in the world for nominal quantity offsets. However, multipliers can go up to 10. The minimum value of the sale for mandatory offsets is 726,000 Euro. This high offset policy, applied to [[EADS]] [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]s purchase in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/26/idUSN2625116820070626 | work=Reuters | first=Mark | last=Heinrich | title=UPDATE 1-Austria, Eurofighter agree cut in jet purchase | date=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and still ongoing, was changed in 2008-9 when Austria signed the voluntary EU ''Code of Conduct on Offset''.

A Royal Decree (6/2/1997, and modified-6/12/2001) is the legal foundation of the Belgian Industrial Benefits Program. The program is directed by Ministry of Economic Affairs (Industrial Benefits in the Field of Defense Procurement [https://web.archive.org/web/20111001210931/http://economie.fgov.be/en/binaries/industrial_compensations_en_tcm327-58443.pdf]).  The threshold value is usually 11 million euro, but it is lower if it is not a public and open tender. The minimum required offset is 100%.  Multipliers are not specified.  The focus is on high technology and new or additional business flow. The Belgian offset guidelines are very sophisticated. One of the most important and explicit points is the so-called “newness aspect:” offsets, such export assistance, “must create unambiguously a new or additional business flow in export” for Belgian companies. Belgium distinguishes three forms of offsets: direct, semi-direct, and indirect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://economie.fgov.be/en/entreprises/particular_domains/Defence/industrial_offset/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050331/http://economie.fgov.be/en/entreprises/particular_domains/Defence/industrial_offset/ |archive-date=2011-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium has a specific problem with the ''Industrial Benefit Programme'', related to the ''de facto'' split of the country into [[Wallonia]] and [[Flanders]]. Belgian offset program is more meticulous than other European countries, but Belgian citizenry is aware that paying for offsets, instead of getting weapons at off-the-shelf price, implies not-so-transparent transfers of taxpayers' money to designated Belgian companies through political decisions. One can rightly consider such offset-transfer as confidential state [[subsidy]]. Flemish parties claim that subsidies to Wallonia cost proportionally more than the price West Germany paid for East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;“The MOWAG proposal further includes a comprehensive Industrial Benefit Programme worth 100% of the contract value in Belgian value added combining direct work, semi direct effort as well as a significant commitment to other industrial sectors through indirect benefits....MOWAG notes that the industrial offsets program will be proportionally balanced between Flemish and Wallonian companies, as indeed it must in a country that is no longer a strict unitary state after the St. Michael’s agreement.... Recent public complaints that the Airbus A400M program has seen 80% of its industrial benefits flow to Belgium’s southern Walloon districts haven’t helped matters.”[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/belgium-selects-piranha-iiis-for-850m-apc-contract-controversies-ensue-01872/]&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidies/offset issue was particularly acute in the repartition of direct and indirect industrial benefits for one of the recent acquisition with offsets: 242 [[Mowag Piranha]] for the [[Belgian Army]] from [[General Dynamics]], over 700 M Euro. One of the controversial offsets connected with the Piranha III is a direct offset for the Piranha III co-production, and the disputed choice of a 90mm gun (produced by a Wallonian company) instead of 105mm NATO standard cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lalibre.be/debats/opinions/article/210132/90mm-pour-l-armee-belge-c-est-leger.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian offset policy was formally implemented in 1990, however the practice had already been used constantly at least from 1975. Set by resolution 764, 2002, the current offset policy is dictated by the Ministry of Defense demanding offsets in purchases related to thresholds above 5 million USD per year. Deriving from the MD policy, Air Force, Navy and Army have separate specific offset guidelines. The total offset request is 100% whenever possible. Multipliers are usually between 1 and 4, excepcionaly 5.

Public Procurement Law 2004, revised in 2009. Direct offsets are supervised by the Defense Ministry, and indirect offsets by the Ministry of Economy and Energy. There is however a Permanent Inter-Ministerial Council of Special Purpose Public Procurement to approve offset agreements. The Agency for Information, Technology and Communications (SAITC) assists and coordinates offset projects. The threshold for offset is 5 million Euro.  The minimum Value is 110% of the contract value. Multipliers are between 1 and 3. Offsets are generally 30% direct and 70% indirect.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706143019/http://www.mee.government.bg/eng/offsetp/offsetp/docs.html?id=201014]

Canada's offset agreements (known as Industrial and Regional Benefits (IRB)) are managed by the IRB directorate within the Canadian government's Department of Industry.  The IRB Policy was created in 1986 to assist Canadian companies in leveraging government procurement.  The Policy requires that prime contractors place sub-contracts and investments in the high-tech sectors of the Canadian economy in an amount usually equal to the value of the defense contract won.  Investments can be direct (transactions that give small- to medium-sized enterprises an opportunity to provide goods, services and/or long-term service support directly for the items being procured by the government) or indirect (transactions which are not directly related to the procured items and are, instead, related to investments, technology cooperation, and product mandates).

Offset regulations are set by Government Resolution 9 - 2005. The Ministry of Trade and Industry is in charge of Industrial Cooperation (also through an Offset Commission).  The minimum value of the contract is CZK 500 million. The minimum offset percentage is 100 per cent. No multipliers are used. Offset focus is on new technologies, co-operation and technology transfer. Minimum 20% of direct offset. The Offset Commission issues Annual Reports on the status of the offsets. One of the major offset controversies in Czech Republic is about the purchase of ''General Dynamics'' Pandur II, between 2003 and 2009. In February 2010 anti-corruption police have opened an investigation. According to [[The Prague Post]] "the investigation will center on two main issues: the alleged bribery of politicians and the military's reasons for paying three times more for the Pandur than Portugal, which also purchased" the same armoured vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;

Ministry of Defense makes the acquisition, but the Ministry of Business and Growth is monitoring offset implementations stipulated in the individual ICC's (Industrial Cooperation Contracts). The Guidelines for Industrial Cooperation was issued in 2014 and replaced the former Offset Law which was rejected by the European Commission. The threshold is DKK 50 million and offset requirement varies from each project up to 100%. Multipliers up to 8 can be considered for R&amp;D and technology or financial transfers. Denmark signed a trilateral agreement with UK and The Netherlands on “best practice for the application of abatements in offset” regarding swaps of offset obligations.

No offset law. Estonia is particularly interested in counter-trade.

No law, only public guidelines on Industrial Participation. The Ministry of Defense is in charge, Defense Materiel Industry and Industrial Participation, but with The Ministry of Trade and Industry. The minimum contract value for offsets is EUR 10 million. 100% minimum of offset requirement. Multipliers are between 0.3 and 3.0 (for Finnish export). Technology transfer multipliers are negotiated. Finland's focus is on its domestic defense industry.

No formal offset policy, but has counter-trade and offset departments in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and in the Ministry of Defense. However, France like U.S., is almost completely independent on its own military needs, and it has a minimal amount of weapon procurements from foreign countries.

==={{flag|Germany}}===
German official position is that offset arrangements are economically counterproductive in defense trade. However, Germany applies a policy of “industrial balances,” based on 100% of the contract value. German Federal Ministry of Defense (BMVg), and The Federal Office of Defense Technology and Procurement (''Das Bundesamt für Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung'' - BWB, that is an Acquisition Agency)&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bundesamt für Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung]]&lt;/ref&gt; are in charge of procurement and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwb.org/resource/resource/MzEzNTM4MmUzMzMyMmUzMTM1MzMyZTM2MzEzMDMwMzAzMDMwMzAzMDY3NmI3MzMyNmE2ODMxMzUyMDIwMjAyMDIw/AGBw_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Agency has a branch office for U.S. and Canada in Reston, Virginia [http://www.bwb.org]. It is worth noting that Germany, while being the third world exporter of weapons, does not have huge “defense corporations”, that is, large companies whose core business is weapons production, but civilian companies that produce weapons in addition to their main business. WT - ''Wehr Technik'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.monch.com&lt;/ref&gt; is a source of information on BWB activities. Germany has a quota of 11% of defense global export and, according to SIPRI data, between 2004 and 2009 German weapons export doubled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,683598,00.html] See also Complicit in Corruption.

Offset regulation is in the official Procurement Law, 3433/2006. The Hellenic Ministry of National Defense is in charge through the department of General Armaments Directorate (GAD), and the Division of Offsets (DO). The threshold for offset request is EUR10 million. The minimum offset requirement is between 80 and 120%.  Multipliers are from 1 to 10.  Greece does not accept indirect offsets, since it is focused on the strengthening of its military capabilities. According to SIPRI data for 2006–2010, Greece is the 5th weapons importer of the world, with a global quota of 4%, about half of India (9%), and two third of China's import (6%). It is worth noting that Chinese GDP is about 20 times bigger than Greece's nominal GDP.&lt;ref&gt;SIPRI:{{cite web |url=http://books.sipri.org/files/FS/SIPRIFS1103a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812233821/http://books.sipri.org/files/FS/SIPRIFS1103a.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}, see also [[The Economist]], Global Weapons Imports, 2009 [http://www.economist.com/node/13565633]&lt;/ref&gt; Greece is the major EU importer of weapons and the first U.S. defense client in the European Union.[http://www.mod.mil.gr] According to K.

The offset legal base is a Government Decree 228/2004 and offset authority is the Ministry for National Development and Economy - Directive No. 23/2008.   The threshold is HUF1 billion (3.5 Mil Euro) with a minimum offset requirement of 100%. Multipliers can go up to 15.

==={{flag|Japan}}===
No formal offset policy. [[Japan Defense Agency]] (JDA) depended directly on the Prime Minister and was in charge of defense procurement, thorough the Bureau of Equipment and the Bureau of Finance. However, since 2007 the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) has been transformed into a full Ministry of Defense, with a minister in cabinet-level decisions.  Most of the Japanese defense import is from U.S., and it is regulated by bilateral agreements.  The majority of defense bidding goes through the representation of Japanese trading companies, though direct bidding is theoretically possible. There is an unspoken policy for the largest Japanese companies that is an understood as “Buy Japanese”  products policy. Two remarks: Japan, Germany and Italy, in spite of evident cultural differences, have similar political attitudes in “balancing” foreign weapons procurements. But Japan, in the name of political principles and then of official laws, restrained itself on weapon exports, and since the 1970s Japanese defense industry is self-confined to Japanese domestic market.[http://www.mod.go.jp/e/index.html]

Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor is in charge of the offset policy and implementation. Threshold is 100,000 USD. Minimum offset request is 35%, multipliers are either 1 or 2. The main point about Israel and its offset policy is the fact that Israel has been for a long time the largest beneficiary of [[United States Foreign Military Financing]] (FMF), getting more than 50% of the entire available U.S. FMF budget.&lt;ref&gt;Between 2004 and 2008 the largest beneficiary was Iraq and, since 2008, Afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; This condition sets a limit to Israeli offsets request to U.S.[http://www.moital.gov.il/CmsTamat/search.aspx?w=offset]
==={{flag|Italy}}===
There is no public law on offsets. There is not even an official name for the offset policy. The public position is that Italy has no general offset policy, just ''ad hoc'' (offset) policies. The National Armament Directorate of Ministry of Defense is in charge of offsets, while specific internal commissions of each branch of the Italian Armed Forces (Aviation, Army, and Navy) monitor offset fulfillment. The threshold for offset is 5 million Euro. The minimum offset request is 70%, but generally goes up to 100%. The highest multiplier is 3. The focus is on export opportunities for Italian defense companies. There is no website or web-page for a nameless offset program, the closest would be the Minister of Defense website [http://www.difesa.it].

The National Offset Company (NOC) is a state-owned company, and its activities in the Kuwait Offset Program are on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. The offset commitment is still at 35% of the monetary value of military contracts. Threshold is [[Kuwaiti dinar|KD]] 3m, (for civilian contracts is KD 10m.)

==={{flag|Morocco}}===
[[Morocco]], has yet no Offset policy. The only existing offset agreement has been signed with [[Alstom]] which won the contract to build Morocco’s high-speed train system and which is also responsible for the construction of tram networks in Rabat and Casablanca. In January the company signed an agreement with the government that will see it establish a local production base for cabling and electronic components, creating 5000 jobs over 10 years, as well as establishing a rail sector training institute. Alstom also signalled its intention to step up purchases from Moroccan suppliers and service providers (such as local back-office offshoring services), for use in projects in other countries as well. To stimulate its industry, the government is working on a new procurement offset (compensation industrielle) policy. Under the policy reportedly being developed by the minister for industry and trade, foreign companies that win government tenders worth more than Dh200m (€17.69m) will be obliged to carry out local investments and purchases worth at least 50% of the value of the contracts. The measure is intended to boost the local industrial sector by ensuring that foreign companies invest locally, use local subcontractors and locally made products, and transfer technology to the country. 
The policy will not affect US companies, as the 2004 US-Morocco free trade agreement bars the imposition of such requirements on US firms.
Since its election on 2012 as President of the CGEM [[:fr:Confédération générale des entreprises du Maroc|Confédération générale des entreprises du Maroc]], Miriem Bensaleh Chaqroun has been lobbying for the creation of a legal framework making mandatory for state controlled companies, offices, local authorities to sign offset agreements. The action was the creation of the commission compensation industrielle et accès aux marchés publics in 2012 which was headed by the former CEO of the CGEM [[:fr:Mehdi El Idrissi|Mehdi El Idrissi]].

# To be the sole interlocutor in the development of offset contracts.
# To guide foreign businesses to feasible projects in collaboration with Moroccan companies and sectors to promote and encourage industrial activities based on the industrial policy and the competitive advantages of the country.
# To measure the chances of success of projects and help develop contracts that will bind the foreign company with the Moroccan suppliers.
# To monitor and evaluate the implementation of offset projects.

The U.S., in spite of the fact the most of its defense sales to the Kingdom are U.S. Defense Department Foreign Military Sales, leaves offsets to the private contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, SAIC, Boeing, and General Dynamics. [[Foreign Direct Investments]] are authorized and supervised by [[SAGIA]] [http://www.sagia.sa], and they receive high multipliers according to the most strategic sectors and the Kingdom's priorities (such as water, electricity, communications, etc.). Saudi's offset market has an enormous significance for the Saudi non-oil economy since Saudi Arabia spends about 10% of its GDP in defense procurement.
==={{flag|Slovakia}}===
Ministry of Economy is the governing body for offsets. The threshold (not established clearly) can go down to 130,000 euro. The amount of offset proposal is negotiable, but usually is equivalent to 100% of the contract value. Higher multipliers are for direct offsets.[http://www.economy.gov.sk]
[[File:Patria AMV 1.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Slovenian Patria AMV]]

==={{flag|Slovenia}}===
Ministry of Defense is in charge, and offset guidelines were issued in 2000. The threshold is around 500,000 Euro, and the offset request is of 100% of the contract value. Multipliers go from 1 to 7. Foreign Direct Investments and technology transfers have the highest multipliers.&lt;ref&gt;Multipliers for "technology and knowledge transfer" and for "direct foreign investments" can go up to 7.[http://www.eda.europa.eu/offsets/viewpolicy.aspx?CountryID=SI]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 purchase of 135 Patria AMV infantry fighting vehicles is the largest in Slovenian history of military procurement (278 million Euro, deliveries 2007-2013), and the [[Patria case]] is the political controversy over claims of bribery of Slovenian officials by the Finnish company ''Patria''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Jorma Witakorpi, ''Patria'' CEO at the time of the sale, a kickback of about 21 M Euro (7,5% of the total contract price) has been paid to decision makers, Slovenian politicians and military, to further the sale.[http://www.cersa.cnrs.fr/sites/cersa/IMG/pdf/Chronique_2008-VD_REPCEE.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Patria'' AMV vehicles offset agreement has direct offset for 30% of the value of the contract (co-production of the AMV in Slovenia), and 70% of indirect offsets, mostly assistance to export for Slovenian companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/slovenian-armys-new-apcs-patrias-amvs-updated-02358/#patria-order-cancellation]&lt;/ref&gt;
==={{flag|South Korea}}===
DAPA, the ''Defense Acquisition Program Administration'', is in charge of country offset policy, that was published in 2008.  Threshold is 10 million USD. Minimum offset is 30%. Multipliers are between 1 and 6.  The contractual Memorandum of Understanding on offsets is a substantial part of the main contract.
==={{flag|Spain}}===
Ministry of Defense - General Direction of Armaments and Material (DGAM) - Industrial Cooperation Agency of Spain (ICA) is responsible for the negotiation and the supervision of offsets.  The guidelines for offset are not public, but issued by the Minister of Defense through internal and confidential procedures. The general request is 100% of the contract value. Multipliers are between 2 and 5.[http://www.isdefe.es]
==={{flag|Sweden}}===
The offset policy was issued by the Government in 1999. The Industrial Participation program is directed by Minister of Defense, Defence Material Administration (FMV), and offset guidelines were issued in 2002. The contract value offset threshold is about 10 million Euro. The request for offset is 100%. Multipliers can be applied only to 10% of the total offset value. Only defense related offsets (direct offsets) are accepted, since Sweden applies art. 346 of the European [[Treaty of Lisbon]] [http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/2060].
==={{flag|Switzerland}}===
The Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport, division "armasuisse" is in charge of offsets. The threshold for offset request is 15 million Swiss Francs. The offsets are minimum 100% and multipliers are between 2 and 3.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130619110959/http://www.ar.admin.ch/internet/armasuisse/en/home.html]
==={{flag|Turkey}}===
The Minister of Defense through an undersecretary for the Defense Industries is in charge of the Industrial Participation / Offset Directive (2007).  The threshold is about 5 million USD. The minimum required offset is 50%. Multipliers are between 1 and 6. The offset fulfillment time is 2 years, which is unusually short. Mostly interested in direct offsets to develop the Turkish defense industry.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090317111302/http://www2.ssm.gov.tr/]
==={{flag|United Arab Emirates}}===
The United Arab Emirates Offset Program Bureau (OFFSET) is in charge of offsets; Chairman of the bureau is the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The criteria are more sophisticated than most offset policies. The request for offset is 60% of the contract value. The offset credit is not evaluated on the investments, but through profit over time of an offset venture (a kind of multiplier ex post). Joint ventures in the UAE and partnership with local companies are the most common offset proposal, as direct and indirect offset.[http://www.offset.ae]
==={{flag|United Kingdom}}===
No official Policy. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] is in charge, but offsets go through UKTI, [[UK Trade &amp; Investment]], under the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Business. In 2007 the Prime Minister announced a change, transferring responsibility for defense trade from the Defence Export Services Organization (DESO) to UK Trade and Investment (UKTI). Since April 2008 UKTI DSO (Defence &amp; Security Organization) has responsibility for supporting both defense and security exports. The general threshold is 10 million GBP, but through bilateral agreements with Germany and France, has been reciprocally set to 50 million GBP. The offset is generally around 100%, no multipliers. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090524061928/http://www.dso.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/ip.htm].
==={{flag|United States}}===
The U.S. is formally against offsets. To date, the U.S. is the only country that prohibits U.S. government officials and employees, as well as Government agencies, to get involved in any offset business.{{cite wikisource |title=Defense_Production_Act_Amendments_of_1992/Title_I#Sec._123.}} U.S. depends on foreign defense “prime” contractors for less than 2% of its defense procurement. However, many countries consider the [[Buy American Act]] practically equivalent to the offset policies of other countries.

==Criticism of offset agreements==
While widely practiced, some, such as the [[US]] government, consider such agreements to be "market distorting and inefficient". On April 16, 1990, a US Presidential Policy statement&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/osies/offsets/1990prespolicyoff.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; was released, stating that "the decision whether to engage in offsets [...] resides with the companies involved" and that "no agency of the U.S. Government shall encourage, enter directly into, or commit U.S. firms to any offset arrangement in connection with the sale of defense goods or services for foreign governments."&lt;ref name=Acq/&gt;

== EU position on defense offsets ==
The most recent common European Union quasi-agreement on defense offsets is ''The Code of Conduct on Offsets'' [http://www.eda.europa.eu/offsets/], signed by all EU countries (with the exception of Romania and Denmark) in October 2008. The primary purpose of the voluntary and non-binding Code is to promote a "European Defense Technological and Industrial Base" and to outline a road map to arrive to a complete elimination of offset practices within the domestic EU market. In other words, to open to competitive bids the EU Defense and Security market and to overcome competition restrictions of [[EU Treaties]] of Rome and Lisbon, art. 346. The ideal goal is “competition in the EU Defense Market” and “Government-to-Government off-the-shelf sales.” The realistic target is humbler, though: to self-restrain and limit the offset quantity to 100% of the contract value.

The actual situation in EU is described in detail in a study on defense offsets in the Union countries commissioned by the [[European Defense Agency]] and published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Final Report of 06-DIM-022 Study on the effects of offsets on the Development of a European Defence Industry and Market By E. Anders Eriksson with contributions by Mattias Axelson, Keith Hartley, Mike Mason, Ann-Sofie Stenérus and Martin Trybus, 12 July 2007. The study was financed by the European Defence Agency and contracted to FOI and SCS.[http://www.eda.europa.eu/studiesprojects.aspx?directorate=Industry%20and%20Market]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study the volume of EU offset agreements in 2006 was above 4-5 billion euro.&lt;ref&gt;Idem, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of these offsets is as shown in the diagram: Direct Offsets, Military Indirect Offsets, Civilian Indirect Offsets.
[[File:Eu-offsets-types.JPG|thumb|450px|right]]

European policy on offsets is still regulated by the Treaty establishing the European Community. Art. 223 of the Treaty of Rome (1958),&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC)]]&lt;/ref&gt; then article 296 of the EU Treaty of Amsterdam (1999);&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/pdf/12002E_EN.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; since December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon (art. 346) protects member States weapons production and trade from competition rules of the common European market. In spite of 50 years of European history Article 223 (Rome) and Article 346 (Lisbon) are practically identical. Today the hinge of EU policy on offsets is still the same article, that is, Art. 346 of the Lisbon Treaty. This article preserves the national right to the secret of state related to its own security and military production and procurement.
This is the relevant part of '''Article 346''':
{{Quotation|1. The provisions of this Treaty shall not preclude the application of the following rules:
::(b) any Member State may take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material; such measures shall not adversely affect the conditions of competition in the common market regarding products which are not intended for specifically military purposes.| Art 346 ''Treaty of Lisbon''}}

The first part of the article states that European Union has no authority over national states policies and decisions on their defense/security choices. In other words, EU has no saying about domestic preference for homemade planes or tanks, or for preferred military offsets choice.  The second part, however, asserts a shared principle by all EU states regarding the non-military/indirect offsets, that is, EU reserves its right to supervise and regulate indirect-non-military offset effects, so that they do not “adversely affect the condition of competition” in the internal common EU market.

Any civilian-indirect-offset has distortion effects in the common market, and this distortion is amplified by the ignorance about specific offset agreements outside the circle of defense contractors and national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sigal, ''The Changing Dynamics of U.S. Defense Spending'', Praeger Publishers, Westport (CT), 1999, p. 200-1. See also Ann Markusen, ''The Arms Trade as Illiberal Trade'', Conference on Defense Offsets, Cape Town, South Africa, September 24-6, 2002, ''The Hidden Injuries of Privileged Trade''.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S started monitoring offsets adverse effects in United States when a small paper-making equipment company in Wisconsin (Beloit Corporation) got in trouble without understanding that the reason was an hidden cause, that is, an indirect offset by Northrop (now [[Northrop Grumman]]) with the Finnish Ministry of Defense. Only a concerned Wisconsin politician, Sen. [[Russell D. Feingold]], discovered the real reasons in 1992, after being informed that a tender for supply of machinery of the value about 50M USD was not awarded to the Wisconsin company, but to a Finnish company (Valmet Corporation) as part of an offset deal with the Finnish Government.&lt;ref&gt;Now Velmet has a different name after a merging in 1999: Metso [http://www.metso.com]; In 2000 Metso bought Beloit for $160M, hiring all Wisconsin workers and paying also for Beloit patents.&lt;/ref&gt;

This U.S. offset story brought to light the issue of the impact of confidential agreements by defense companies on U.S. non-military business, in some instances with devastating effects. Feingold's discovery is enlightening for the EU common market as well, where interferences and adverse impacts on EU companies are allowed by an unjustified national attitude for confidentiality or secrecy on indirect, non military, offset deals. Art. 346 of Lisbon Treaty, written more than 50 years ago, is there to wisely avoid disruptive effects caused by unjustified military secrecy in civilian offsets in the common European market. In EU market of Defense, approximately of the size of $250B, with 27 sovereign state authorities that can claim secret of state -from [[Germany]] to [[Cyprus]] and [[Luxembourg]]-, there is a potential for indirect non-military offsets of $60B, that is, more 1000 times the distortion problem caused by Northrop (and the Finnish Ministry of Defense) to Beloit.

== Offset associations and publications ==
The two main global organizations in the USA that deal with offsets are:
:G.O.C.A - Global Offset and Countertrade Association'' is a main source of information on the uses of counter-trade and offset [http://www.globaloffset.org/]
:DMA - Defence Manufacturers Association, based in UK but opened to many other countries.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100208230806/http://www.the-dma.org.uk/]

One domestic U.S. based organization that deals with offsets is:
:DIOA - Defense Industrial Offset Association, membership is primarily open to U.S. based defense contractors.[http://www.dioa.org]

In Europe, ECCO (European Club for Countertrade and Offset) hosts two symposiums a year and started publishing various volumes that explains offset in various domains, such as finance, ethics, the economy, and international law. Visit www.ecco-offset.eu

There are many regional or national offset conferences and symposiums, but recently GOCA and DMA jointly organize global offset meetings every two years. The first global meeting on offset took place in 2004 in Sintra, Portugal; then in Athens, Greece (2006); the third in Seville, Spain, in 2008.  GOCA and DIOA hold both individual and joint conferences several times per year.

''Countertrade &amp; Offset'' is a fortnightly magazine on the offset industry; the same publisher has also a quarterly for the industry: ''The Offset Guidelines Quarterly Bulletin''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10388">{{Other uses|Optical depth (astrophysics)}}

In [[physics]], '''optical depth''' or '''optical thickness''', is the ''[[natural logarithm]]'' of the ratio of incident to ''transmitted'' [[radiant power]] through a material, and '''spectral optical depth''' or '''spectral optical thickness''' is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to ''transmitted'' [[Radiant power|spectral radiant power]] through a material.&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Absorbance|file=A00028|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optical depth is [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and in particular is not a length, though it is a [[Monotonic function | monotonically]] increasing function of path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero. The use of the term "optical density" for optical depth is discouraged.&lt;ref name=GoldBook /&gt;

In [[chemistry]], a closely related quantity called "[[absorbance]]" or "decadic absorbance" is used instead of optical depth: the ''[[common logarithm]]'' of the ratio of incident to ''transmitted'' radiant power through a material, that is the optical depth divided by ln 10.

==Mathematical definitions==

===Optical depth===
'''Optical depth''' of a material, denoted &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Robert Kitchin|year=1987|title=Stars, Nebulae and the Interstellar Medium: Observational Physics and Astrophysics|publisher=[[CRC Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \ln\!\left(\frac{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}}{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t}}\right) = -\ln T,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the radiant flux received by that material;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[radiant flux]] ''transmitted'' by that material;
*''T'' is the [[transmittance]] of that material.

Absorbance is related to optical depth by:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = A \ln 10,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is the absorbance.

===Spectral optical depth===
'''Spectral optical depth in frequency''' and '''spectral optical depth in wavelength''' of a material, denoted ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; and ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, are given by:&lt;ref name=GoldBook /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\nu = \ln\!\left(\frac{\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}^\mathrm{i}}{\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}^\mathrm{t}}\right) = -\ln T_\nu,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\lambda = \ln\!\left(\frac{\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}^\mathrm{i}}{\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}^\mathrm{t}}\right) = -\ln T_\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Radiant flux|spectral radiant flux in frequency]] ''transmitted'' by that material;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that material;
*''T''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Transmittance|spectral transmittance in frequency]] of that material;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Radiant flux|spectral radiant flux in wavelength]] ''transmitted'' by that material;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that material;
*''T''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Transmittance|spectral transmittance in wavelength]] of that material.

Spectral absorbance is related to spectral optical depth by:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\nu = A_\nu \ln 10,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\lambda =A_\lambda \ln 10,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''A''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; is the spectral absorbance in frequency;
*''A''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the spectral absorbance in wavelength.

==Relationship with attenuation==

===Attenuation===
{{Main article|Attenuation}}
Optical depth measures the attenuation of the transmitted radiant power in a material. Attenuation can be caused by absorption, but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes. Optical depth of a material is approximately equal to its [[attenuation]] when both the absorbance is much less than 1 and the [[Radiant emittance|emittance]] of that material (not to be confused with [[radiant exitance]] or [[emissivity]]) is much less than the optical depth:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t} + \Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{att} = \Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i} + \Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{e},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T + ATT = 1 + E,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is the radiant power transmitted by that material;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;att&lt;/sup&gt; is the radiant power attenuated by that material;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the radiant power received by that material;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; is the radiant power emitted by that material;
*''T'' = Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;/Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the transmittance of that material;
*''ATT'' = Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;att&lt;/sup&gt;/Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''attenuance'' of that material;
*''E'' = Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;/Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the emittance of that material,
and according to [[Beer–Lambert law]],
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\tau},&lt;/math&gt;
so:
:&lt;math&gt;ATT = 1 - e^{-\tau} + E \approx \tau + E \approx \tau,\quad \text{if}\ \tau \ll 1\ \text{and}\ E \ll \tau.&lt;/math&gt;

===Attenuation coefficient===
Optical depth of a material is also related to its ''[[attenuation coefficient]]'' by:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \int_0^l \alpha(z)\, \mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''l'' is the thickness of that material through which the light travels;
*''α''(''z'') is the ''attenuation coefficient'' or ''Napierian attenuation coefficient'' of that material at ''z'',
and if ''α''(''z'') is uniform along the path, the attenuation is said to be a ''linear attenuation'' and the relation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \alpha l.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes the relation is given using the ''[[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]]'' of the material, that is its attenuation coefficient divided by its [[number density]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \int_0^l \sigma n(z)\, \mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''σ'' is the ''attenuation cross section'' of that material;
*''n''(''z'') is the number density of that material at ''z'',
and if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is uniform along the path, i.e., &lt;math&gt;n(z)\equiv N&lt;/math&gt;, the relation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \sigma Nl.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===Atomic physics===
In [[atomic physics]], the spectral optical depth of a cloud of atoms can be calculated from the quantum-mechanical properties of the atoms. It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\nu = \frac{d^2 n\nu} {2\mathrm{c} \hbar \varepsilon_0 \sigma \gamma},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''d'' is the [[transition dipole moment]];
*''n'' is the number of atoms;
*''ν'' is the frequency of the beam;
*c is the [[speed of light]];
*ħ is [[Planck's constant]];
*ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]];
*''σ'' the cross section of the beam;
*''γ'' the [[natural linewidth]] of the transition.

===Atmospheric sciences===
{{See also|Beer's law}}
In [[atmospheric sciences]], one often refers to the optical depth of the atmosphere as corresponding to the vertical path from Earth's surface to outer space; at other times the optical path is from the observer's altitude to outer space. The optical depth for a slant path is {{nobreak|1=''τ'' = ''mτ''′}}, where ''τ′'' refers to a vertical path, ''m'' is called the [[airmass|relative airmass]], and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as {{nobreak|1=''m'' = sec ''θ''}} where ''θ'' is the [[zenith angle]] corresponding to the given path. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\tau} = e^{-m\tau'}.&lt;/math&gt;

The optical depth of the atmosphere can be divided into several components, ascribed to [[Rayleigh scattering]], [[aerosols]], and gaseous [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. The optical depth of the atmosphere can be measured with a [[sun photometer]].

The optical depth with respect to the height within the atmosphere is given by

&lt;math&gt;\tau(z) = k_aw_1\rho_0H e^{-z/H}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

and it follows that the total atmospheric optical depth is given by

&lt;math&gt;\tau(0) = k_aw_1\rho_0H&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In both equations:
* k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the absorption coefficient
* w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the mixing ratio
* ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of air at sea level
* H is the scale height of the atmosphere
* z is the height in question
The optical depth of a plane parallel cloud layer is given by

&lt;math&gt;\tau = Q_e \left[\frac{9\pi L^2 H N}{16\rho_l^2}\right]^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932561283|title=A first course in atmospheric radiation|last=W.|first=Petty, Grant|date=2006|publisher=Sundog Pub|isbn=9780972903318|oclc=932561283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
* Q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the extinction efficiency
* L is the [[liquid water path]]
* H is the geometrical thickness
* N is the concentration of droplets
* ρ&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of liquid water
So, with a fixed depth and total liquid water path,

&lt;math&gt;\tau \propto N^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Astronomy===
In [[astronomy]], the [[photosphere]] of a star is defined as the surface where its optical depth is 2/3. This means that each photon emitted at the photosphere suffers an average of less than one scattering before it reaches the observer. At the temperature at optical depth 2/3, the energy emitted by the star (the original derivation is for the Sun) matches the observed total energy emitted.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}{{clarify|reason=See talk page|date=April 2015}}

Note that the optical depth of a given medium will be different for different colors ([[wavelength]]s) of light.

For [[planetary rings]], the optical depth is the (negative logarithm of the) proportion of light blocked by the ring when it lies between the source and the observer. This is usually obtained by observation of stellar occultations.

The '''Ouachita orogeny''' was a [[orogeny|mountain building]] event that resulted in the [[Fold (geology)|folding]] and [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] of [[stratum|strata]] currently exposed in the [[Ouachita Mountains]]. The more extensive Ouachita system extends from the current range in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] southeast to the [[Black Warrior Basin]] in [[Alabama]] and to the southwest through the [[Llano Uplift|Llano]], [[Marathon Uplift|Marathon]], and [[Solitario]] uplifts in [[Texas]] on into [[Coahuila]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Calvert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/geol/ouach.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207132653/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/geol/ouach.htm |archivedate=2006-12-07 |df= }} The Ouachita System&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-collision formations==
The region during the early [[Paleozoic]] lay off the coast of the southern portion of [[Laurentia]], in what is now the southern United States. Laurentia straddled the [[equator]] at the time and the [[Rheic Ocean]] was to the south of Laurentia. Through the [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian]], and early [[Carboniferous]], marine sedimentation left extensive deposits of [[black shale]], quartzose [[sandstone]], and [[chert]] beds. During the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], a [[flysch]] sequence with dark shales and [[graywacke]]s was deposited. Lenses of silicic [[tuff]] exist as evidence of limited [[volcanism]].&lt;ref name=Calvert/&gt; These later sediments were formed over a [[subduction zone]] which formed along southern Laurentia.

==Collision==
[[South America]] approached Laurentia as the intervening oceanic crust was subducted. The collision of South American and Laurentian continental crust compressed and uplifted the region to form the Ouachita Mountains. During the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]], river systems draining westward from the Ouachita Mountains deposited sediments in north-central Texas and Oklahoma, which are now exposed at the surface. The Ouachita Mountains were extensively eroded between the [[Permian]] and the [[Jurassic]], and much of the Ouachita system was subsequently buried beneath [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] sediments to the southeast and southwest. The structures there have only been revealed through deep drilling in petroleum exploration.&lt;ref name=Calvert/&gt;

The '''park of Frederiksborg Castle''' ({{lang-da|Frederiksborg Slotshave}}) is located to the north and west of [[Frederiksborg Castle]] in [[Hillerød]], Denmark. It consists of a formal Baroque garden and a Romantic landscape garden.

==History==

===The first gardens===
[[Image:Lille Dyrehave (Frederiksborg Castle).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lille Dyrehave seen on a map from about 1700]]
[[Image:Frederiksborg Slotshave by J.C. Krieger.jpg|thumb|160px|Krieger's garden plan from 1744. The Deer Fountain and the still existing isle Dronningeøen can be seen in the bottom of the picture.]]
An enclosed deer park for hunting was established at the same time as [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s new Frederiksborg Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oresundstid.dk/dansk/oresundstid/1700/side03-02.htm |title=Kongens jagtrevir |website=oresundstid.dk |accessdate=21 July 2015 |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310225331/http://www.oresundstid.dk/dansk/oresundstid/1700/side03-02.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became known as Lille Dyrehave ("Little Deer Park") when [[Store Dyrehave]] ("Large Deer Park") was created immediately to the south of the town a few years later. He also had a garden at the North Zealand residence. The Castle Lake featured a small island, Dronningeøen ("The Queen's Isle"), which was used for tea parties, as well as a fountain designed as a swimming deer chased by hunting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/trap/3-2/0146.html|title=Kongeriget Danmark|publisher=Projekt Tuneberg|accessdate=22 July 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature was the pavilion Sparepenge next to the road to [[Fredensborg]], which contained a collection of weapons. Sparepenge was pulled down in 1719, while the fountain was dismantled in the middle of the century.

===Frederick IV's Baroque garden===
[[Image:Frederiksborg Castle - garden.jpg|thumb|160px|Old map of the gardens of Frederiksborg]]
In 1720, [[Johan Cornelius Krieger]] was charged with the design of a new garden for the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnm.dk/dk/Slotshaverne.htm|title=Slotshaverne|publisher=Det Nationalhistoriske Museum|accessdate=22 July 2015 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1800, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] converted the areas Lille Dyrehave and Indelukket to the west of the Baroque garden into a Romantic landscape garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slke.dk/kongelige-haver/frederiksborg-slotshave/slotshavens-historie/den-romantiske-landskabshave/|title=Den romantiske landskabshave|publisher=Styrelsen for Slotte og Kulturejendomme|accessdate=22 July 2015|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723040737/http://www.slke.dk/kongelige-haver/frederiksborg-slotshave/slotshavens-historie/den-romantiske-landskabshave/|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baroque garden fell into neglect in the late 18th century.

===The Romantic garden===

==Today==
The Baroque garden was recreated in a somewhat modified form in the first half of the 1990s. A water feature cascades down the central axis of the terraced complex. The park contains a memorial to [[Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow]]. It was inaugurated on 15 August 1884 to mark the 100th anniversary of the agricultural reforms in which he played a central role.

The upper, northernmost part of the Baroque garden is home to Café Havehuset, a half-timbered, thatched building now used as a café. In summer, the café is open for lunch (11–3:30) Tuesday–Sunday.

==Activities==
A tour boat operates on the lake. The building Badstueslottet is still used by the royal family in connection with hunts in the surrounding forests. The park hosts an annual garden show.

A '''Santa Claus machine''', named after the folkloric [[Santa Claus]], is a hypothetical machine that is capable of creating any required object or structure out of any given material. It is most often referenced by [[Futures studies|futurist]]s and [[science fiction]] writers when discussing hypothetical projects of enormous scale, such as a [[Dyson sphere]]. These types of future constructions would be too large for many civilizations to build directly, so they would need a series of machines to intelligently build the machine with little or no direct control.

==Origin==
The term was coined by [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]] in 1978:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's possible to imagine a machine that could scoop up material – rocks from the Moon or rocks from asteroids – process them inside and produce just about any product: washing machines or teacups or automobiles or starships. Once such a machine exists it could gather sunlight and materials that it's sitting on, and produce on call whatever product anybody wants to name, as long as somebody knows how to make it and those instructions can be given to the machine. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discussion==
A mature Santa Claus machine requires significant advances in technology to be possible, including the ability to take any collection of matter and reconfigure it into any other type of matter.

Scientifically, it requires two parts: a disassembler and an assembler.

One form of disassembler would consist of an ionizing chamber, which heats the input matter to 43,000&amp;nbsp;°F (24,000&amp;nbsp;°C).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Once all the molecular bonds are broken and the electrons ripped off, each atomic nucleus would be moved through a magnetic field, where its path would curve in proportion to its charge/mass ratio, as per [[mass spectrometry]]. The separated ions would be captured by a linear array of cold traps to provide reservoirs of each element.

The assembler would use these reservoirs as input to some kind of [[3D printing|additive layer manufacturing]] device (also known as 3D printers and rapid prototype machines).  Many of these printers are commercially available today—though currently few can print with more than one highly prepared material (much less an alphabet consisting of all the raw elements).

An autonomous Santa Claus machine would presumably require a high level of [[artificial intelligence]], though for small projects, autonomous behavior is probably not necessary.  However, the "matter compiler" (that figures out which atom goes where) must be programmed appropriately—not a trivial task. A gigantic project such as a [[Dyson sphere]] would undoubtedly require not only autonomy, but also self-replication.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} These capabilities would enable a single Santa Claus machine, given sufficient matter and energy, to construct a project of any size.

Many theorists{{Who|date=August 2012}} have seen the obvious nightmare scenarios that accompany such a device, including machines running out of control and destroying an entire planet, or a [[clanking replicator]] disaster, ''à la'' the brooms in ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''. At the other extreme, others{{Who|date=August 2012}} suppose the resultant [[post scarcity]] [[economy]] could lead to a near-[[utopia]]—''[[Star Trek]]'' being the most culturally prominent example of this possibility.

The human society seen as a whole can be thought of as a limited Santa Claus machine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

'''Sinus Iridum''' ([[Latin]] for "Bay of Rainbows") is a plain of [[basalt]]ic [[lava]] that forms a northwestern extension to the [[Mare Imbrium]] on Earth's [[moon]]. It is surrounded from the northeast to the southwest by the [[Montes Jura]] range. Close to the bay in the range in the northwest is the crater [[Bianchini (lunar crater)|Bianchini]]; west of the bay is the crater [[Sharp (crater)|Sharp]]. The protruding part of the range at the southwest end is named [[Promontorium Heraclides]], while that at the northeast end is called [[Promontorium Laplace]]. This bay and the surrounding mountains is considered one of the most beautiful features on the Moon, and is a favorite among lunar observers.

Sinus Iridum is formed from the remains of a large impact crater, which was subsequently flooded with basaltic lava, inundating the "sea" wall. The bay itself does not contain any notable impact craters, but does include the satellite crater Heraclides E in the south, Laplace A along the eastern edge, and Bianchini G in the north. The surface is level, but is marked by a number of [[wrinkle ridge]]s (dorsa).

The [[selenographic coordinates]] of the bay's center are 45.01° N, 31.67° W, and the diameter is 249&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/5565 | title = Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature - Sinus Iridum | accessdate = 2018-01-30 | date = 18 October 2010 | work = United States Geological Survey | publisher = International Astronomical Union (IAU) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hdtv 041 l.jpg|thumb|View of Sinus Iridium and its surrounding features at about 100 km above the lunar surface as taken by the Kaguya spacecraft on October 31, 2007, this was the first high definition image of the Moon]]
One of the first image including video by JAXA's probe Kaguya were taken and recorded alongside Montes Jura and Mare Imbrium and the promontories of Heraclides and Laplace on October 31, 2007.  The spacecraft took the world's first high definition image data of the Moon from an altitude about 100 kilometers away from the Moon on October 31, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wms1.wms.selene.darts.isas.jaxa.jp/selene_viewer/en/observation_mission/hdtv/hdtv_041.html|title=Mare Imbrium on HDTV|publisher=Kaguya|date=October 31, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306052703/http://wms1.wms.selene.darts.isas.jaxa.jp/selene_viewer/en/observation_mission/hdtv/hdtv_041.html|archivedate=March 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the planned landing site of [[Chang'e 3]], China's 2013 lunar exploration mission, which instead landed nearby in [[Mare Imbrium]].

==Names==
The feature was given the Latin name for the Bay of Rainbows by [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names: [[Michael van Langren]]'s 1645 map calls it "Sinus Geometricus", the "Bay of Geometry" referring to its geometric shape.,&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johannes Hevelius]] called it "Sinus Apollonis" after Apollo, a bay in the north of  Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Promontorium Heraclides.

In a [[Physical chemistry|physical]] or [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] system, a '''solvus''' is a line (binary system) or surface (ternary system) on a [[phase diagram]] which separates a homogeneous [[solid solution]] from a field of several phases which may form by [[exsolution]] or [[incongruent melting]]. The line determines a solid [[solubility]] limit which changes as a function of temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering: An Integrated Approach|first=William D. |last=Callister Jr. |first2=David G. |last2=Rethwisch |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-42223-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a locus of points on the equilibrium diagram. 
An example is the formation of [[perthite]] when an alkali [[feldspar]] is cooled down. It defines the limit of solid solubility in an equilibrium diagram.

From book IV, chapter 2: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Orwell]] later paraphrases Henry George in ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] made a famous speech to the UN in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/477.html Speech to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, July 9, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following year, ''Spaceship Earth'' became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson's, the internationally influential economist [[Barbara Ward]].

Also in 1966, [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], who was influenced by reading [[Henry George]],&lt;ref&gt;King, J. E. "Economic Exiles". Palgrave Macmillan, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; used the phrase in the title of an essay, ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page160.htm|title=The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth|first=Kenneth E.|last=Boulding|authorlink=Kenneth E. Boulding|date=1966|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulding described the past open [[economy]] of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the "cowboy economy", and continued: "The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system".
([[David Korten]] would take up the "cowboys in a spaceship" theme in his 1995 book ''[[When Corporations Rule the World]]''.)

The phrase was also popularized by [[Buckminster Fuller]], who published a book in 1968 under the title of ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Buckminster|last=Fuller|authorlink=Buckminster Fuller|publisher=E.P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;…we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth.  These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] spoke of Spaceship Earth on [[Earth Day]] March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the [[Japanese Peace Bell]]: "May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowzone.com/mc-lee.htm|title=Earth Day: Past, Present, Future|first=Lee|last=Lawrence|author2=John McConnell |date=July 3, 1999|publisher=Wish Only Well|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spaceship Earth 2.jpg|thumb|Epcot's Spaceship Earth]]

Spaceship Earth is the name given to the 50&amp;nbsp;m diameter [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] that greets visitors at the entrance of [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] theme park. Housed within the sphere is [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|a dark ride]] that serves to explore the history of [[communications]] and promote Epcot's founding principles, "[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=WDW Chronicles: 1982 Opening of Epcot Center|website=http://allears.net/ae/issue678.htm|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor [[Jeremy Irons]] and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers….We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irons|first1=Jeremy|title=SE Script - Irons Version|website=http://www.intercot.com/edc/SpaceshipEarth/spscript.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Deutsch]] has pointed out that the picture of Earth as a friendly "spaceship" habitat is difficult to defend even in metaphorical sense. The Earth environment is harsh and survival is constant struggle for life, including whole species [[extinction]]. Humans wouldn't be able to live in most of the areas where they are living now without knowledge necessary to build life-support systems such as houses, heating, water supply, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=David Deutsch |author-link=David Deutsch |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Spaceship Earth" is frequently used on the labels of [[Emanuel Bronner]]'s products to refer to the Earth.

[[File:Subduction-en.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|Diagram of the geological process of subduction]]

'''Subduction''' is a geological process that takes place at [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]] of [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] where one plate moves under another and is forced or sinks due to gravity into the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Regions where this process occurs are known as ''subduction zones''. Rates of subduction are typically in centimeters per year, with the average rate of convergence being approximately two to eight centimeters per year along most plate boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Defant |first=M. J. |year=1998 |title=Voyage of Discovery: From the Big Bang to the Ice Age |publisher=Mancorp |page=325|isbn=978-0-931541-61-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plates include both [[oceanic crust]] and [[continental crust]]. Stable subduction zones involve the oceanic [[lithosphere]] of one plate sliding beneath the continental or oceanic lithosphere of another plate due to the higher density of the oceanic lithosphere. That is, the subducted lithosphere is always oceanic while the overriding lithosphere may or may not be oceanic. Subduction zones are sites that usually have a high rate of [[volcanism]] and [[earthquake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez-López, M.R., Mendoza, C.,|year=2016|title=Acoplamiento sismogénico en la zona de subducción de Michoacán-Colima-Jalisco,México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6802/(3)Martinez.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=2|pages=199–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=A source in English is preferred - see WP:NONENG|date=October 2018}} Furthermore, subduction zones develop [[orogen|belts]] of [[deformation (geology)|deformation]] and metamorphism in the subducting crust, whose exhumation is part of [[orogeny]] and also leads to [[Mountain formation|mountain building]] in addition to collisional thickening.

==General description==

Subduction zones are sites of gravitational sinking of Earth's [[lithosphere]] (the [[crust (geology)|crust]] plus the top non-convecting portion of the upper mantle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=YF|last2=Chen|first2=YX|year=2016|title=Continental versus oceanic subduction zones|journal=National Science Review|volume=3|pages=495–519}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subduction zones exist at convergent plate boundaries where one plate of [[lithosphere|oceanic lithosphere]] converges with another plate. The descending [[slab (geology)|slab]], the subducting plate, is over-ridden by the leading edge of the other plate. The slab sinks at an angle of approximately twenty-five to forty-five degrees to Earth's surface. This sinking is driven by the temperature difference between the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the surrounding mantle [[asthenosphere]], as the colder oceanic lithosphere has, on average, a greater density. At a depth of greater than 60&amp;nbsp;kilometers, the [[basalt]] of the oceanic crust is converted to a metamorphic rock called [[eclogite]]. At that point, the density of the oceanic crust increases and provides additional negative [[buoyancy]] (downwards force). It is at subduction zones that Earth's lithosphere, [[oceanic crust]] and [[continental crust]], [[sedimentary rocks|sedimentary]] layers and some trapped water are [[Geochemical cycle|recycled]] into the deep mantle.

Earth is so far the only planet where subduction is known to occur. Subduction is the driving force behind [[plate tectonics]], and without it, plate tectonics could not occur.

[[File:ConMarRJS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75]]
Oceanic subduction zones dive down into the mantle beneath 55,000 kilometers of convergent plate margins (Lallemand, 1999), almost equal to the cumulative 60,000 kilometers of mid-ocean ridges. Subduction zones burrow deeply, but are imperfectly camouflaged, and [[geophysics]] and [[geochemistry]] can be used to study them. Not surprisingly, the shallowest portions of subduction zones are known best. Subduction zones are strongly asymmetric for the first several hundred kilometers of their descent. They start to go down at [[oceanic trench]]es. Their descents are marked by inclined zones of earthquakes that dip away from the trench beneath the volcanoes and extend down to the [[Transition zone (Earth)|660-kilometer discontinuity]]. Subduction zones are defined by the inclined array of earthquakes known as the [[Wadati–Benioff zone]] after the two scientists who first identified this distinctive aspect. Subduction zone earthquakes occur at greater depths (up to 600&amp;nbsp;km) than elsewhere on Earth (typically less than 20&amp;nbsp;km depth); such deep earthquakes may be driven by deep phase transformations, thermal runaway, or dehydration embrittlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frolich | first1 = C. | year = 1989 | title = The Nature of Deep Focus Earthquakes | journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume =  17| issue = | pages =  227–254| doi = 10.1146/annurev.ea.17.050189.001303 | bibcode = 1989AREPS..17..227F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hacker | first1 = B. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2003 | title = Subduction factory 2.

The subducting basalt and sediment are normally rich in [[hydrous]] minerals and clays.  Additionally, large quantities of water are introduced into cracks and fractures created as the subducting slab bends downward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fujie | first1 = Gou | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Systematic changes in the incoming plate structure at the Kuril trench | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume =  40| issue = 1| pages =  88–93| doi = 10.1029/2012GL054340 | bibcode=2013GeoRL..40...88F}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the transition from basalt to eclogite, these hydrous materials break down, producing copious quantities of water, which at such great pressure and temperature exists as a [[supercritical fluid]]. The supercritical water, which is hot and more buoyant than the surrounding rock, rises into the overlying mantle where it lowers the pressure in (and thus the melting temperature of) the mantle rock to the point of actual melting, generating [[magma]]. The magmas, in turn, rise (and become labeled [[diapir]]s) because they are less dense than the rocks of the mantle. The mantle-derived magmas (which are basaltic in composition) can continue to rise, ultimately to Earth's surface, resulting in a volcanic eruption. The chemical composition of the erupting lava depends upon the degree to which the mantle-derived basalt interacts with (melts) Earth's crust and/or undergoes [[fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]].

Above subduction zones, volcanoes exist in long chains called [[volcanic arc]]s.  Volcanoes that exist along arcs tend to produce dangerous eruptions because they are rich in water (from the slab and sediments) and tend to be extremely explosive. [[Krakatoa]], [[Nevado del Ruiz]], and [[Mount Vesuvius]] are all examples of arc volcanoes. Arcs are also known to be associated with precious metals such as gold, silver and copper believed to be carried by water and concentrated in and around their host volcanoes in rock called "ore".

==Theory on origin==

===Initiation===
Although the process of subduction as it occurs today is fairly well understood, its origin remains a matter of discussion and continuing study. Subduction initiation can occur ''spontaneously'' if denser oceanic lithosphere is able to founder and sink beneath adjacent oceanic or continental lithosphere; alternatively, existing plate motions can ''induce'' new subduction zones by forcing oceanic lithosphere to rupture and sink into the asthenosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stern | first1 = R.J. | year = 2004 | title = Subduction initiation: spontaneous and induced | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X04004984 | journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume =  226| issue = 3–4| pages =  275–292| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2004.08.007 | bibcode=2004E&amp;PSL.226..275S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both models can eventually yield self-sustaining subduction zones, as oceanic crust is metamorphosed at great depth and becomes denser than the surrounding mantle rocks.

[[Geophysicist]] [[Don L. Anderson]] has hypothesized that plate tectonics could not happen without the [[calcium carbonate]] laid down by bioforms at the edges of subduction zones. The massive weight of these sediments could be softening the underlying rocks, making them pliable enough to plunge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=Stephan|title=Animated Earth Science, Intuition and Gaia|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2006|page=114|isbn=978-1-933392-29-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-style subduction===
Modern-style subduction is characterized by low [[geothermal gradient]]s and the associated formation of high-pressure low temperature rocks such as [[eclogite]] and [[blueschist]].&lt;ref name=Xuetal2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Robert J. |last2= |first2= |title=Evidence from ophiolites, blueschists, and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic terranes that the modern episode of subduction tectonics began in Neoproterozoic time |url= |journal=Geology |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=557–560 |doi=10.1130/G21365.1 |access-date= |bibcode=2005Geo....33..557S |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, rock assemblages called [[ophiolites]], associated to modern-style subduction, also indicate such conditions.&lt;ref name=Xuetal2018/&gt; [[Eclogite]] [[xenolith]]s found in the [[North China Craton]] provide evidence that modern-style subduction occurred at least as early as 1.8&amp;nbsp;[[Gigaannum|Ga]] ago in the [[Paleoproterozoic|Paleoproterozoic Era]].&lt;ref name=Xuetal2018/&gt;  Nevertheless, the eclogite itself was produced by oceanic subdcution during the assembly of supercontinents at about 1.9-2.0 Ga. 

[[Blueschist]] is a rock typical for present-day subduction settings. Absence of blueschist older than [[Neoproterozoic]] reflect more [[mafic|magnesium-rich]] compositions of Earth's [[oceanic crust]] during that period.&lt;ref name=PaWh2016/&gt; These more magnesium-rich rocks metamorphose into [[greenschist]] at conditions when modern oceanic crust rocks metamorphose into blueschist.&lt;ref name=PaWh2016/&gt; The ancient magnesium-rich rocks means that [[mantle (geology)|Earth's mantle]] was once hotter, but not that subduction conditions were hotter.

==Effects==

===Metamorphism===
{{main|Subduction zone metamorphism}}

===Volcanic activity===
{{Main|Volcanic arc}}
[[File:Oceanic spreading.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Oceanic [[Plate tectonics|plates]] are subducted creating [[oceanic trench]]es.]] [[Volcano]]es that occur above subduction zones, such as [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Mount Etna]] and [[Mount Fuji]], lie at approximately one hundred kilometers from the trench in arcuate chains, hence the term [[volcanic arc]]. Two kinds of arcs are generally observed on Earth: [[island arcs]] that form on oceanic lithosphere (for example, the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]] and the [[Tonga]] island arcs), and [[continental arc]]s such as the [[Cascade Volcanic Arc]], that form along the coast of continents. Island arcs are produced by the subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath another oceanic lithosphere (ocean-ocean subduction) while continental arcs formed during subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath a continental lithosphere (ocean-continent subduction).  An example of a volcanic arc having both island and continental arc sections is found behind the [[Aleutian Trench]] subduction zone in Alaska.

The arc magmatism occurs one hundred to two hundred kilometers from the trench and approximately one hundred kilometers above the subducting slab. This depth of arc [[magma]] generation is the consequence of the interaction between hydrous fluids, released from the subducting slab, and the arc mantle wedge that is hot enough to melt with the addition of water. It has also been suggested that the mixing of fluids from a subducted tectonic plate and melted sediment is  already occurring at the top of the slab before any mixing with the mantle takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170407143316.htm|title=Volcanic arcs form by deep melting of rock mixtures: Study changes our understanding of processes inside subduction zones|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcs produce about 25% of the total volume of magma produced each year on Earth (approximately thirty to thirty-five cubic kilometers), much less than the volume produced at mid-ocean ridges, and they contribute to the formation of new [[continental crust]]. Arc volcanism has the greatest impact on humans, because many arc volcanoes lie above sea level and erupt violently. [[Particulate|Aerosols]] injected into the stratosphere during violent eruptions can cause rapid cooling of Earth's [[climate]] and affect air travel.

===Earthquakes and tsunamis===
{{Main|Megathrust earthquake}}
The strains caused by plate convergence in subduction zones cause at least three different types of earthquakes. Earthquakes mainly propagate in the cold subducting slab and define the [[Wadati–Benioff zone]]. Seismicity shows that the slab can be tracked down to the upper mantle/lower mantle boundary (approximately six hundred kilometer depth).

Nine of the ten largest earthquakes of the last 100 years were subduction zone events, which included the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|1960 Great Chilean earthquake]], which, at M 9.5, was the largest earthquake ever recorded; the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]]; and the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. The subduction of cold oceanic crust into the mantle depresses the local [[geothermal gradient]] and causes a larger portion of Earth to deform in a more brittle fashion than it would in a normal geothermal gradient setting. Because earthquakes can occur only when a rock is deforming in a brittle fashion, subduction zones can cause large earthquakes. If such a quake causes rapid deformation of the sea floor, there is potential for [[tsunami]]s, such as the earthquake caused by subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate under the Euro-Asian Plate on December 26, 2004 that [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|devastated the areas around the Indian Ocean]]. Small tremors which cause small, nondamaging tsunamis, also occur frequently.

A study published in 2016 suggested a new parameter to determine a subduction zone's ability to generate mega-earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bletery|first=Quentin|last2=Thomas|first2=Amanda M.|last3=Rempel|first3=Alan W.|last4=Karlstrom|first4=Leif|last5=Sladen|first5=Anthony|last6=Barros|first6=Louis De|date=2016-11-25|title=Mega-earthquakes rupture flat megathrusts|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6315/1027|journal=Science|language=en|volume=354|issue=6315|pages=1027–1031|doi=10.1126/science.aag0482|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27885027|bibcode=2016Sci...354.1027B}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining subduction zone geometry and comparing the degree of curvature of the subducting plates in great historical earthquakes such as the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, it was determined that the magnitude of earthquakes in subduction zones is inversely proportional to the degree of the fault's curvature, meaning that "the flatter the contact between the two plates, the more likely it is that mega-earthquakes will occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161124150207.htm|title=Subduction zone geometry: Mega-earthquake risk indicator|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Outer trench swell|Outer rise]] earthquakes occur when normal faults oceanward of the subduction zone are activated by flexure of the plate as it bends into the subduction zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Anomalously deep events are a characteristic of subduction zones, which produce the deepest quakes on the planet. Earthquakes are generally restricted to the shallow, brittle parts of the crust, generally at depths of less than twenty kilometers. However, in subduction zones, quakes occur at depths as great as seven hundred kilometers. These quakes define inclined zones of seismicity known as [[Wadati–Benioff zone]]s which trace the descending lithosphere. [[Seismic tomography]] has helped detect subducted lithosphere, [[Slab (geology)|slabs]], deep in the mantle where there are no earthquakes. About one hundred slabs have been described in terms of depth and their timing and location of subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlas-of-the-underworld.org/|title=Atlas of the Underworld {{!}} Van der Meer, D.G., van Hinsbergen, D.J.J., and Spakman, W., 2017, Atlas of the Underworld: slab remnants in the mantle, their sinking history, and a new outlook on lower mantle viscosity, Tectonophysics|website=www.atlas-of-the-underworld.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some subducted slabs seem to have difficulty penetrating the major [[Transition zone (Earth)|discontinuity]] in the mantle, marking the boundary between the upper mantle and lower mantle, that lies at a depth of about 670&amp;nbsp;kilometers. Other subducted oceanic plates can penetrate all the way to the [[core-mantle boundary]]. The great seismic discontinuities in the mantle, at 410 and 670 kilometer depth, are disrupted by the descent of cold slabs in deep subduction zones.

===Orogeny===
{{Main|Orogeny}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
Orogeny is the process of mountain building. Subducting plates can lead to orogeny by bringing oceanic islands, oceanic plateaus, and sediments to convergent margins. The material often does not subduct with the rest of the plate but instead is accreted (scraped off) to the continent resulting in [[exotic terrane]]s. The collision of this oceanic material causes crustal thickening and mountain-building. The accreted material is often referred to as an [[accretionary wedge]], or prism. These accretionary wedges can be identified by [[ophiolites]] (uplifted ocean crust consisting of sediments, pillow basalts, sheeted dykes, gabbro, and peridotite).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Environmental Change|editor-first=John A.|editor-last=Matthews|volume=1|location=Los Angeles|publisher=SAGE Reference|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subduction may also cause orogeny without bringing in oceanic material that collides with the overriding continent. When the subducting plate subducts at a shallow angle underneath a continent (something called "flat-slab subduction"), the subducting plate may have enough traction on the bottom of the continental plate to cause the upper plate to contract leading to folding, faulting, crustal thickening and mountain building. This flat-slab subduction process is thought to be one of the main causes of mountain building and deformation in South America.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The processes described above allow subduction to continue while mountain building happens progressively, which is in contrast to continent-continent collision orogeny, which often leads to the termination of subduction.

==Subduction angle==
Subduction typically occurs at a moderately steep angle right at the point of the convergent plate boundary. However, anomalous shallower angles of subduction are known to exist as well some that are extremely steep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=YF|last2=Chen|first2=RX|last3=Xu|first3=Z|last4=Zhang|first4=SB|year=2016|title=The transport of water in subduction zones|journal=Science China: Earth Sciences|volume=59|pages=651–682}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flat-slab subduction]] (subducting angle less than 30°) occurs when subducting lithosphere, called a slab, subducts nearly horizontally. The relatively flat slab can extend for hundreds of kilometers. That is abnormal, as the dense slab typically sinks at a much steeper angle directly at the subduction zone. Because subduction of slabs to depth is necessary to drive subduction zone volcanism (through the destabilization and dewatering of minerals and the resultant [[flux melting]] of the [[mantle wedge]]), flat-slab subduction can be invoked to explain [[volcanic gap]]s. Flat-slab subduction is ongoing beneath part of the [[Andes]] causing segmentation of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]] into four zones. The flat-slab subduction in northern Peru and [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]] region of Chile is believed to be the result of the subduction of two buoyant aseismic ridges, the [[Nazca Ridge]] and the [[Juan Fernández Ridge]] respectively. Around [[Taitao Peninsula]] flat-slab subduction is attributed to the subduction of the [[Chile Rise]], a [[mid-ocean ridge|spreading ridge]]. The [[Laramide Orogeny]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of  [[United States]] is attributed to flat-slab subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=W. P. Schellart |author2=D. R. Stegman |author3=R.

&lt;/ref&gt; Then, a broad volcanic gap appeared at the southwestern margin of North America, and deformation occurred much farther inland; it was during this time that the [[basement (geology)|basement]]-cored mountain ranges of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, and New Mexico came into being.  The most massive subduction zone earthquakes, so-called "megaquakes", have been found to occur in flat-slab subduction zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-11/uoo-fcm112216.php |title=Fault curvature may control where big quakes occur, Eurekalert 24-NOV-2016 |journal=Science |volume=354 |issue=6315 |pages=1027–1031 |doi=10.1126/science.aag0482 |pmid=27885027 |date=2016-11-24 |accessdate=2018-06-05|bibcode=2016Sci...354.1027B |last1=Bletery |first1=Quentin |last2=Thomas |first2=Amanda M. |last3=Rempel |first3=Alan W. |last4=Karlstrom |first4=Leif |last5=Sladen |first5=Anthony |last6=De Barros |first6=Louis }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Steep-angle subduction (subducting angle greater than 70°) occurs in subduction zones where Earth's [[oceanic crust]] and lithosphere are old and thick and have, therefore, lost buoyancy. The steepest dipping subduction zone lies in the [[Mariana Trench]], which is also where the oceanic crust, of [[Jurassic]] age, is the oldest on Earth exempting [[ophiolite]]s. Steep-angle subduction is, in contrast to flat-slab subduction, associated with [[back-arc]] extension&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Lallemand, Serge |author2=Heuret, Arnauld |author3=Boutelier, David |date=8 September 2005 |url=http://perso-sdt.univ-brest.fr/~jacdev/pdf/1.pdf |title=On the relationships between slab dip, back-arc stress, upper plate absolute motion, and crustal nature in subduction zones |journal=Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems |volume=6 |issue=9 |page=Q09006 |doi=10.1029/2005GC000917 |bibcode=2005GGG.....609006L}}&lt;/ref&gt; of crust making volcanic arcs and fragments of continental crust wander away from continents over geological times leaving behind a [[marginal sea]].

==Importance==
Subduction zones are important for several reasons:
# Subduction Zone Physics: Sinking of the oceanic [[lithosphere]] (sediments, crust, mantle), by contrast of [[density]] between the cold and old lithosphere and the hot asthenospheric mantle wedge, is the strongest force (but not the only one) needed to drive plate motion and is the dominant mode of [[mantle convection]].
# Subduction Zone Chemistry: The subducted sediments and crust dehydrate and release water-rich ([[aqueous]]) [[fluids]] into the overlying mantle, causing mantle melting and [[fractionation]] of elements between surface and deep mantle reservoirs, producing island arcs and [[continental crust]].
# Subduction zones drag down subducted oceanic sediments, oceanic crust, and mantle lithosphere that interact with the hot asthenospheric [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] from the over-riding plate to produce [[calc-alkaline]] series melts, ore deposits, and  continental crust.
# Subduction zones pose significant threats to lives, property, economic vitality, cultural and natural resources, as well as quality of life. The tremendous magnitudes of earthquakes or volcanic eruptions can also have knock-on effects with global impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/news/usgs-publishes-a-new-blueprint-can-help-make-subduction-zone-areas-more-resilient|title=USGS publishes a new blueprint that can help make subduction zone areas more resilient|website=www.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subduction zones have also been considered as possible [[Nuclear waste#Geologic disposal|disposal sites for nuclear waste]] in which the action of subduction itself would carry the material into the planetary [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], safely away from any possible influence on humanity or the surface environment. However, that method of disposal is currently banned by international agreement.&lt;ref name="isbn0-387-95560-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hafemeister, David W. |title=Physics of societal issues: calculations on national security, environment, and energy |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=Berlin |year=2007 |page= 187|isbn=978-0-387-95560-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LT4MSqv9QUIC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7546-7133-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kingsley, Marvin G. |author2=Rogers, Kenneth H. |title=Calculated risks: highly radioactive waste and homeland security |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot, Hants, England |year=2007 |pages= 75–76|isbn=978-0-7546-7133-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOP4-BpYXrEC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/ilr/ona/pages/dumping2.htm |title= Dumping and Loss overview |work=Oceans in the Nuclear Age |accessdate=18 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605190619/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/ilr/ona/pages/dumping2.htm |archivedate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Storage and Disposal Options.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3824">'''Cecil Whittaker "Ted" Trueblood''' (1913-1982) was an outdoor writer and conservationist.  From 1941 to 1982, he was an editor and writer for the ''[[Field &amp; Stream]]'' magazine.  Born in [[Boise]], Idaho, on June 25, 1913, he grew up on the family farm near Homedale and graduated from Wilder High School in 1931. Drawn to writing about the outdoor life, he published his first article in ''National Sportsman'' magazine in 1931. He attended both the [[College of Idaho]] (at Caldwell) and the [[University of Idaho]] (at Moscow), but left before earning his degree.

In 1936, he became a reporter for the ''Boise Capital News''.  In 1937, he became a reporter for the ''Deseret News'' in Salt Lake City. From there, he began writing articles for ''Field &amp; Stream''. He returned to Idaho in 1939 and married Ellen Michaelson. Together they had two sons, Dan and Jack.  After struggling as a freelancer, Trueblood took a public relations position with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.  He became fishing editor of ''Field &amp; Stream'' in 1941 and moved to New York City.  In 1947, he moved back to Idaho in order to "fish, hunt, and write about it."  From his home in [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], he remained an associate editor and contributor to ''Field &amp; Stream'', and continued writing articles for the magazine throughout his life.  In addition to his magazine work, he also wrote several books about the outdoors (often based on his articles):  ''The Angler's Handbook'' (1949), ''The Fishing Handbook'' (1951), ''On Hunting'' (1953), ''The Hunter's Handbook'' (1954), ''How to Catch More Fish'' (1955),  ''Camping Handbook'' (1955), and ''The Ted Trueblood Hunting Treasury'' (1978).

Perhaps more important to Idahoans was Trueblood's work as a conservation leader.  In 1936, he helped to organize the Idaho Wildlife Federation, the state's major conservation group in the mid-twentieth century.  Trueblood often helped the Federation fight many of its conservation battles.  One of their most significant victories, in the 1950s, was the successful campaign to protect Idaho's salmon and steelhead trout by stopping the construction of Nez Perce Dam on the [[Snake River]], which would have blocked the migration of fish up the undammed [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]].  Trueblood advocated for the creation of the [[River of No Return Wilderness]] in central Idaho, and worked to oppose the anti-environmental "[[Sagebrush Rebellion]]" in 1980.  His conservation work was honored with several awards, including a 1975 Conservation Service Award from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] and the 1975 Outdoorsman of the Year award from the Outdoor Writers of America.

Painful and terminal bone cancer led Trueblood to kill himself at the age of 69 on September 12, 1982. He died of a gunshot wound to the head.

His life of conservation leadership is commemorated by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game's Ted Trueblood Wildlife Area, near Grandview.  In 1991, the newly organized Boise chapter of [[Trout Unlimited]] named itself the "Ted Trueblood Chapter."

His papers are housed in the Albertsons Library at Boise State University.

'''Transnational gangs''' can be described as [[gangs]] that are located in multiple countries. When these gangs commit crimes in one country, their plans for the crime can sometimes be put together in another country. These gangs or&amp;nbsp;[[Mara (gang)|mara]]&amp;nbsp;are able to move around efficiently from one place to another. Transnational gangs are not a normal&amp;nbsp;[[street gang]]&amp;nbsp;because they are much larger in size and located in more than one country; they are considered to be able to pose a significant threat for the safety of the countries they are located in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/afri/aspj/apjinternational/apj-s/2008/2tri08/sullivaneng.htm|title=Transnational Gangs|website=www.au.af.mil|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waconda Spring''', or '''Great Spirit Spring''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8X5krq3fP8C&amp;pg=PA786#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc. | publisher=Standard Publishing Company | author=Blackmar, Frank Wilson | year=1912 | pages=786}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a natural [[artesian aquifer|artesian]] spring located in [[Mitchell County, Kansas|Mitchell County]], near the towns of [[Glen Elder, Kansas|Glen Elder]] and [[Cawker City, Kansas|Cawker City]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kansas]].  It was a sacred site for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the [[Great Plains]] and, for a time, became the site of a health spa for American settlers.  With the completion of the Glen Elder Dam in 1968, the mineral spring disappeared beneath the waters of [[Waconda Reservoir]].

==Description==

Waconda Spring was situated on the bank of the [[Solomon River]], below the North and South Forks of the river.&lt;ref name=ksrelig /&gt;
The water flowing from the spring had deposited a large cone of [[travertine]] around it.&lt;ref name=kssprings&gt;Buchanan, Rex, Robert Sawin, and Wayne Lebsack (2000).  [http://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/2000autumn_buchanan.pdf "Water of the Most Excellent Kind: Historic Springs in Kansas".]   ''Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains''.  pp. 128-41.  Retrieved 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1866, surveyor David E. Ballard described it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Spring itself is a natural curiousity, it being located on the summit of a cone shaped limestone rock. The rock is circular, about 200 feet in diameter at the base and about 30 feet high, upon the summit of this, rests the spring, the basin being circular and about 30 feet in diameter, its outlet is a trough apparently formed by the action of the water upon the rock. The water in the spring is about 20 feet deep and exceedingly strong with salt...&lt;ref name=twocultures&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/places/kawmission/printtwocultureskansa.htm "Two Cultures: The Kaws".]  [http://www.kshs.org/places/kawmission/mainmenu.htm Kaw Mission State Historic Site.]  Retrieved 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Native American beliefs==
{{main|Pawnee mythology}}
The name "Waconda" is from the [[Kaw (tribe)|Kanza]] language, and translates as "spirit water" or "Great Spirit Spring".  However, it is located in territory controlled by the Pawnee,&lt;ref name=ksrelig&gt;Entz, Gary R. (2005).

who knew it by the names "Pahowa" and "Kitzawitzuk", the latter translated as "water on a bank".&lt;ref name=grinnell&gt;Grinnell, George Bird (1893).

Retrieved 2010-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|358}}

In the Pawnee traditional religion, the supreme being Tirawa allots supernatural powers to certain animals.  These animals, the ''nahurac'', act as Tirawa's servants and messengers, and intercede for the Pawnee with Tirawa.&lt;ref name=grinnell /&gt; {{rp|xvii}}

The ''nahurac'' had five lodges, of which Waconda Spring was one.

Lalawakohtito, or "dark island", was an island in the Platte near [[Central City, Nebraska]]; Ahkawitakol, or "white bank", was on the [[Loup River]] opposite the mouth of the [[Cedar River (Nebraska)|Cedar River]] in what is now [[Nance County, Nebraska]]; and [[Guide Rock (hill)|Pahur]], or "hill that points the way", was a bluff south of the [[Republican River]], near [[Guide Rock, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=grinnell /&gt;{{rp|359}}

Beside the Pawnee, many other Native American tribes venerated Waconda Spring, often casting articles of value into it as offerings.&lt;ref name=ksrelig /&gt;  [[George Bird Grinnell]] describes the offerings of the Pawnee as including blankets and robes, blue beads, eagle feathers, and moccasins.&lt;ref name=grinnell /&gt;{{rp|359}}

A [[geoglyph]], produced by the intaglio technique of removing the surface sod to form a figure, is located on a hillside about two miles southwest of Waconda Spring.  The figure represents an unidentified animal, possibly a beaver.  It is thought to be several hundred years old; soil analysis indicates that it was renewed at least once after its initial excavation, suggesting that it was in use over an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=holyground&gt;Blakeslee, Donald J.

==Waconda Spring in history==
It is said that the first European explorer to visit Waconda Spring was [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]] in 1767; however, this is unlikely.  The first recorded visit to the site was by General [[Zebulon Pike]] in 1806.  Pike visited the spring during his exploration of the Great Plains after he had concluded a treaty with the Pawnee.

Settlement in the area did not take place until after Kansas became a state in 1861.  The first settler in the region was in 1870 by a man named Pfeiffer, who took out the first claim on the property.  Kansas Senator [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]] toured the region in 1870 and marveled at what he saw.  Said Pomeroy, “At first I declared it the Crater of an Ancient Volcano.  The Water occupying its hollow center is fathomless, and about 200 feet in diameter in a perfect circle! It is always brimming full and running over on all sides... The hills about it were as sacred to the Indians as those about Jerusalem."  Pomeroy recognized the site's commercial potential and went on to predict that a health resort would soon be built in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasr.net/travel/city.php?City_ID=KS0806003&amp;VA=Y&amp;Attraction_ID=KS0806003a011 "Healing Waters: The Legend of Waconda Springs".]  [http://www.lasr.net/index.php Leisure and Sports Review.]  Retrieved 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, a man named Burnham constructed a bottling works on the site and began selling the mineral water as a health tonic.  He called it ''Waconda Flier''.  The sales of ''Waconda Flier'' piqued the interest of an eastern investor named McWilliams, who in 1884 invested in the site and began the construction of a stone sanitarium.  The spring was fenced off and completely privatized.  The building was completed ten years later, and under the management of G. W. Cooper, Waconda Spring became a hotel and health spa.  Sales of ''Waconda Flier'' continued, and by the 1890s it was being sold in all parts of the country.  In 1904, ''Waconda Flier'' won a medal for its superior medicinal qualities at the [[St. Louis World’s Fair]].

In 1906, Dr. G. P. Abrahams purchased the property from McWilliams and continued operating the health spa and bottling plant until his 1924 death.  In 1924, the property passed to Dr. Carl Bingesser, who had married Abrahams’ daughter Anna in 1907.  Under both Abrahams and Bingesser, the hotel resort was improved upon and maintained a solid reputation as health spa and place of healing.  It continued to do so even as the spa passed on to Dr. Carlos Bingesser, the third generation of the Abrahams-Bingesser family to own and operate the spa.  The facilities were fully modernized and offered physical therapy, hydro-therapy, electro-therapy, and dietary regimens.  Water from Waconda Spring was used for internal and external cleansing of the body.  It was piped into every bathtub in the sanitarium, was served with meals, and used for enemas.  A popular slogan used to lure tourists to the resort was, "It will clean works until your works work."  Waconda Spring was a popular, profitable enterprise for the Bingesser family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glenelder.com/waconda_springs.htm "The History of Waconda".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825003215/http://www.glenelder.com/waconda_springs.htm |date=2010-08-25 }}  [http://www.glenelder.com/index.htm Glen Elder, Kansas.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129001100/http://glenelder.com/Index.htm |date=2011-01-29 }}  Retrieved 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glen Elder Dam==
In 1944 the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] announced plans for a large earthen dam on the Solomon River near the town of Glen Elder.  The plan called for the inundation of Waconda Spring.  The Bingesser family fought to stop the plan, but in 1951 greater than normal rainfall in Kansas led to massive flooding in Topeka and other Kansas towns.  This led to renewed calls for dams and other flood control projects, including renewed calls for the Glen Elder Dam.  Dr. Bingesser brought in a respected hydrologist to inspect Waconda Spring.  The hydrologist concluded that Waconda Spring was unique and possibly the only spring like it in the world.  However, commercial advocates in favor of the dam dismissed the hydrologist and dismissively claimed that Waconda Spring was nothing more than a "mud hole."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In the end, the developers won.  Construction on Glen Elder Dam began in 1964 and was completed by the end of 1968.  Engineers bulldozed the hotel and health spa then, adding insult to injury, dumped the debris into the pool of Waconda Spring.  Water from the Solomon River began filling up the valley, and by 1970 it was full.  The irreplaceable Waconda Spring was lost beneath the waters of the reservoir that now bears its name.
