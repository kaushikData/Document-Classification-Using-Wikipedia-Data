The '''2016 Science Olympiad National Tournament''' was the 32nd&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/history&lt;/ref&gt; annual edition of the National [[Science Olympiad]] tournament, a competition in which 120 teams (sixty middle school and sixty high school) from all fifty states compete in around twenty [[science]]-themed events, in various fields of science, such as [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], and [[geology]].

Neither of the winners from last year's national competition at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] were able to defend their titles; the defending champions were Solon M.S ([[Ohio|OH]]) and Troy H.S. ([[California|CA]]). Solon finished fifth&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/2016_Final_Results_Div_B.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; and Troy finished fourth&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/2016_FInal_Results_Div_C.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; in their respective divisions.

Both of 2016's winners won for the first time in their history; Daniel Wright Junior High School from [[Illinois]] and Mira Loma High School from [[California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''''Alingano Maisu''''', also known simply as '''''Maisu''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|ʃ|uː}}, is a [[Outrigger canoe|double-hulled]] [[Canoe sailing|voyaging canoe]] built in [[Kawaihae, Hawai'i|Kawaihae, Hawaii]] by members of Na Kalai Wa{{okina}}a Moku o Hawai{{okina}}i and {{okina}}Ohana Wa'a members from throughout the Pacific and abroad as a gift and tribute to [[Satawal]]ese navigator [[Mau Piailug]], who navigated the voyaging canoe ''[[Hokulea|Hōkūle{{okina}}a]]'' on her [[maiden voyage]] to [[Tahiti]] in 1976 and has since trained numerous [[native Hawaiians]] in the ancient art of [[wayfinding]].  The word ''maisu'' in the name of the canoe comes from the Satawalese word for [[breadfruit]].  In particular, the word refers to breadfruit that has been knocked down by storm winds and is therefore available for anyone to take.  The name is said to symbolize the knowledge of [[Polynesian navigation|navigation]] that is made freely available.&lt;ref&gt;Polynesian Voyaging Society, http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/2007voyage/2007micronesiamaisu.html, quoting ''Ka Wai Ola, the Living Waters of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs,'' March 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept for ''Alingano Maisu'' came about in 2001 when two Hawaiian voyaging groups, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]] and Na Kalai Wa{{okina}}a Moku o Hawai{{okina}}i, met with Piailug.  The two hulls of the {{convert|56|ft|m|adj=on}} vessel were fabricated by the Friends of ''Hōkūle{{okina}}a'' and ''Hawai{{okina}}iloa'' on [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] and shipped to the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] where Na Kalai Wa{{okina}}a completed construction of the canoe.  The Polynesian Voyaging Society provided much of the funding for the voyaging aspect of the project as well as an escort boat to help sail the canoe to [[Satawal]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Wilder, "Mau's Canoe," in ''Hana Hou'' (Hawaiian Airlines), Vol. 9, No. 4, August/September 2006. [http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=488&amp;Page=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The canoe is home-ported on the island of [[Yap]] under the command of Piailug's son, Sesario Sewralur.&lt;ref&gt;Jan TenBruggencate, "Voyage of Friendship" in ''The Honolulu Advertiser'', Saturday, January 20, 2007. [http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Jan/20/ln/FP701200320.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maiden voyage==
Accompanied by ''[[Hokulea|Hōkūle{{okina}}a]]'', the ''Maisu'' left [[Kawaihae, Hawai'i|Kawaihae, Hawaii]] on January 18, 2007. After stops in the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Pohnpei]], and [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], the Maisu reached Satawal on March 15, 2007.  On March 18, while on Satawal, five native Hawaiian [[Polynesian navigation|navigators]] on the voyage were inducted into [[pwo]], a sacred [[Micronesia]]n brotherhood of master navigators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starbulletin.com/print/2005.php?fr=/2007/03/18/news/story04.html Honolulu Star-Bulletin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hōkūle{{okina}}a'' and ''Maisu'' both left Satawal on March 20 and made stops in [[Woleai]], [[Ulithi]] and [[Yap]] before reaching [[Palau]].  From there, the ''Maisu'' remained in Micronesia, returning to Yap state, while the ''Hōkūle{{okina}}a'' continued on to [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/2007voyage/2007sailplan.html 2007 Sail Plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigation Training Program with Palau Community College==
In June 2008, [[Palau Community College]] announced that there will be a one-year program in [[Polynesian navigation|traditional non-instrumental navigation]] on the ''Alingano Maisu'' under Sesario Sewralur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palau.edu/mesekiu/jun27issue.htm MESEKIU'S NEWS]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archbishop Romero Catholic Secondary School''' is an [[Alternative school#Canada|alternative-style]] [[Separate school|Separate]] [[High school#Canada|high school]] located in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada, with satellite campuses in [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]] and [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]].  The school is administered by the [[Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board]].

Like other members of the district, students who attend Archbishop Romero receive teaching on religion, family life and prayer in addition to the standard curriculum found in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. However, students who attend this school have usually been expelled from their schools within the Dufferin-Peel Board, and are sent to Romero to find their way on the right track. Archbishop Romero C.S.S. opened in February 2005.  The school offers programs that include Dual Credit College Transition, Career Opportunities in Trades and Technology, or Machining / Electrical Pre-Trades at Sheridan, ABLE Outdoor Adventure, Catholic Leadership, Co-op Experiential Learning, Flexible Alternative Learning, PLAR, New Directions and Positive Personal Change Programs. A newly formed community Roundtable allows participating stakeholders an opportunity to work together to align resources and services directly into program and school curriculum reflecting global learning for renewed hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General |url=http://www.dpcdsb.org/ROMER/General/ |publisher=Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board |accessdate=30 May 2012 |location=Mississauga |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022014615/http://www.dpcdsb.org/ROMER/General/ |archivedate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school has no sports teams or extra-curricular clubs.

'''Arthur Bostrom''' &lt;small&gt;[[FRGS]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steveorme.co.uk/news/never-a-dull-moment-for-actor-arthur/|title=Never a dull moment for actor Arthur - Steve Orme Productions|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 6 January 1955) is an English actor, most famous for his role as [[Officer Crabtree]] in the long-running [[BBC]] TV sitcom ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]''.

==Biography==
Bostrom was born in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]] and attended [[Lawrence Sheriff School]], where he was a contemporary with [[Kevin Warwick]]. He graduated from [[St Chad's College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stchads.ac.uk/notable.html |title=Notable Alumni |publisher= |accessdate=9 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074843/http://www.stchads.ac.uk/notable.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Durham]]. Besides his television career, he acted on the stage regularly, also being a trained [[life coaching|life coach]]. He lived in [[Manchester]] for a long time.

Bostrom had a recurrent character in ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', first appearing midway through the second series and remaining until the show's finale. [[Officer Crabtree]] was played as an idiotic British undercover officer, disguised constantly as a French local police agent during the [[Second World War]]. Much of the character's humour derived from his supposed inability to pronounce French words correctly in conversation, which, on an English-language television programme, was represented by ludicrous exaggeration and mispronunciation of ordinary English words. For example, "Good morning" would be pronounced as "Gid moaning", "I was just passing round the corner" would be "I was just pissing roond the corner", and famously, "The bombers were being chased by fighters when they dropped their bombs on the London docks" became "The bummers were being chased by farters when they drooped their bums on the London dicks'. Bostrom actually speaks fluent French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alloallo.org.uk/castcrew/bostrom.html |title=Arthur Bostrom |publisher=www.alloallo.org.uk |accessdate=21 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022220839/http://www.alloallo.org.uk/castcrew/bostrom.html |archivedate=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Bostrom guest-starred in ''[[Dead Man Walking (Sapphire and Steel)|Dead Man Walking]]'', an [[audio drama]] based on the television series ''[[Sapphire and Steel]]''. From December 2007 to January 2008, he continued his pantomime run when he appeared in a production as an ugly sister in ''Cinderella'' in Middlesbrough. On 8 January 2008, he appeared in an episode of ''[[List of Big Brother (UK) shows#Big Brother's Big Mouth|Big Brother's Big Mouth]]'' on [[E4 (channel)|E4]]. He discussed events in the house after introducing the show in the familiar character of Officer Crabtree.

'''Audio description''', also referred to as a '''video description''', '''described video''', or more precisely called a '''visual description''', is an additional [[narration]] track intended primarily for [[blindness|blind]] and [[visually impaired]] consumers of visual media (including [[television]] and [[film]], [[dance]], [[opera]], and [[visual art]]). It consists of a narrator talking through the presentation, describing what is happening on the screen or stage
during the natural pauses in the audio, and sometimes during dialogue if deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcmp.org/descriptionkey/|title=Description Key for Educational Media|publisher=The Described and Captioned Media Program|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the performing arts ([[theater]], [[dance]], [[opera]]), and media ([[television]], [[film|movies]] and [[DVD]]), description is a form of audio-visual translation, using the natural pauses in dialogue or between critical sound elements to insert narrative that translates the visual image into a sense form that is accessible to millions of individuals who otherwise lack full access to television and film. Occasionally when there is dialogue that is in another language from the main one of the film and subtitled on screen, the subtitles are read in character by the describer.{{citation needed lead|date=December 2014}}

In [[museums]] or visual art exhibitions, audio described tours (or universally designed tours that include description or the augmentation of existing recorded programs on audio- or videotape), are used to provide access to visitors who are blind or have low vision.  Docents or tour guides can be trained to employ audio description in their presentations.  Audio description of sporting events is now becoming more common, in particular at soccer stadiums.{{citation needed lead|date=December 2014}}

Researchers are working to show how description, through its use of varied word choice, synonyms, metaphor and simile, not only benefits children who are blind and others who have learning disabilities but can also boost literacy for all children.{{citation needed lead|date=December 2014}}

==History==
In early 2009, the [[American Council of the Blind]] (ACB) established the Audio Description Project (ADP) to boost levels of description activity and disseminate information on that work throughout the United States and worldwide.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

With respect to description and media, broadcast systems in Canada and the United States are transmitted digitally and access to description on the former SAP [[second audio program|secondary audio program]] channel is no longer available.  Ideally, it is now possible to access multiple streams of audio, e.g., Spanish translation, audio description, audio description in Spanish, etc. In the United States, affiliates in the top 25 markets and the top five-rated cable network are required to provide 50 hours of video-described programming per quarter under the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Networks Set to Launch Video Descriptions|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/60097/networks-set-to-launch-video-descriptions|work=TVNewsCheck.com|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descriptive Video Service]] (DVS) is a popular producer of audio description for shows on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Media Access Group at WGBH|title=Who We Are|url=http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/about/|website=WGBH|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the limited number of DVDs available with description in North America (less than 100—as compared to over 500 in the [[United Kingdom]] and over 700 in Australia&lt;ref name=MediaAccessOz&gt;{{cite web
|url          = http://www.mediaaccess.org.au/dvds/dvd_database
|title        = Audio described DVD Database
|publisher    = Media Access
|location     = Australia
|accessdate   = 10 December 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is further complicated by the lack of an audio menu on no more than a handful of those DVDs.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In August 2009, [[BBC iPlayer]] became the first [[video on demand]] service to offer Audio Description.&lt;ref name="iplayer09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/08/bbc_iplayer_audio_description.html|title=BBC iPlayer audio description is now available|work=BBC Internet Blog|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=August 27, 2009|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, [[The Wiz Live!]] was the first live TV program to contain audio description in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Foundation for the Blind Celebrates 20th Anniversary of the Helen Keller Achievement Awards and Announces 2016 Honorees|url=http://www.afb.org/info/about-us/press-room/press-release-archive/afb-announces-2016-helen-keller-achievement-awards-honorees-/1245|publisher=American Foundation for the Blind|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2016, [[Pornhub]] announced that it would launch a collection of [[pornographic video]]s with audio descriptions. The initiative is sponsored by the website's philanthropic arm Pornhub Cares.&lt;ref name="vice-pornhubdvs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pornhub Is Making Audio Porn for the Visually Impaired|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/pornhub-described-video-visually-impaired-vgtrn|website=Vice|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Broadcast audio description in the U.K. is delivered digital terrestrially on a separate track containing the narration only, making it possible to adjust the AD volume separately from that of the main audio track from the television programme before the receiver mixing is performed.  However, on digital receivers  that lack any kind of audio pre-mixing ability such as is the case with a number of digital [[satellite television]] or [[cable television]] or [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] receivers, the AD track is provided with the narration already mixed in and has to be manually selected as either a [[Second audio program|SAP]] for ATSC or another language for DVB.

In movie theaters, audio description can be heard using DVS Theatrical and similar systems (including [[DTS-CSS]] and [[Dolby Screentalk]]). Users listen to the description on a [[wireless headset]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[File:Audio describer in live theater.jpg|thumb|left|An audio describer working in a live theater. A small mixer and transmitter are visible, and the lit stage can be seen in the distance.]]
In live theaters, patrons also receive the description via a wireless device, a discreet monaural receiver. However, the description is provided live by describers located in a booth acoustically insulated from the audience, but from where they have a good view of the performance. They make their description which is fed to a small radio transmitter.&lt;ref name=VisionAustralia&gt;{{cite web
|url          = http://www.visionaustralia.org/living-with-low-vision/learning-to-live-independently/sport-recreation-and-the-arts/enjoying-theatre-museums-galleries-and-cinema
|title        = Enjoying theatre, museums, galleries and cinema
|publisher    = [[Vision Australia]]
|location     = Australia
|accessdate   = 10 December 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to provide the facility to a theater entirely with portable equipment, delivered to the theater in two equipment cases of suitcase size.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The description of the performance can be augmented with tactile tours of the stage or costumes or both.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Audio description logo==

Audio description logo can be used by equipment manufacturers i.e., television and set top box manufacturers, broadcasters, cinemas, theatres, DVD and Blu-ray disc production companies to convey that their services or products offer audio description. The logo makes it easier for people with sight loss to identify products which would be available with an additional audio description track.

This is a standard logo that has been in the UK for many years but it is now being adopted by service providers across countries to indicate that a product or service has audio description.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Other countries can have different logos, such as for example Sweden where different TV channels and organizations together created [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Synsymbol.jpg a Swedish standard].

The logo is available to download in various formats and sizes, as well as horizontal or vertical versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acb.org/adp/ad.html#symbols|title=What is Audio Description?|first=Fred|last=Brack|website=www.acb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}

A '''bursar''' (derived from "[[wikt:bursa|bursa]]", [[Latin]] for ''[[Coin purse|purse]]'') is a professional [[finance|financial]] [[academic administration|administrator]] in a [[school]] or [[university]]. In the United States, bursars usually exist only at the level of higher education (4-year colleges and universities) or at private secondary schools. In Australia, Great Britain, and other countries, bursars are common at lower levels of education.

==Duties==

The Office of the Bursar is responsible for billing of student tuition accounts. This responsibility involves sending bills and making payment plans; the ultimate goal is to bring all student accounts to a "paid off" status. Bursars are not necessarily involved in the [[Student financial aid|financial aid]] process. Bursars' duties vary from one institution to another. At many institutions, bursars deal only with student finances. At other institutions, bursars also deal with some faculty finance issues. Elsewhere, they also oversee accounts receivable, or the payments that the university receives from outside organizations for which it performs services. In some institutions, all money held by the institution is the bursar's responsibility. Some Bursars (in the UK for instance) also have responsibility for payroll, investments, facilities, IT, HR, Health and Safety and oversight of admin functions at an institution.

The Bursar Statement is also known as a tuition [[invoice|bill]] or a student account bill.

The bursar often reports to a [[comptroller]]. For example, [[Barnard College]] employs an Associate Comptroller–Bursar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barnard.edu/bursar Barnard College Bursar's webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the bursar has the same level as the comptroller, and both report to the director or vice president of finance. Some universities in the United States still have a Director of Student Financial Services whose role is similar to that of a bursar. The [[University of Pennsylvania]] employs an associate vice president who essentially combines the role of a bursar (using the student financial services title) and that of a [[Registrar (education)|registrar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfs.upenn.edu/about/index.htm UPenn website on student financial services]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional===
[[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' novels contain a character called "[[The Bursar]]". This character, like most other faculty members of Pratchett's [[Unseen University]], is almost always referred to by his job title.

In the ''[[Hamilton (musical)]]'' in the song "Aaron Burr, Sir", it is mentioned that Alexander Hamilton punched the bursar.

The '''Claire Trevor School of the Arts''' ('''CTSA''', '''Claire Trevor''') is an [[faculty (division)|academic unit]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]] focused on the [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts]]. The four departments housed in the school are for [[art]], [[dance]], [[drama]], and [[music]]. CTSA has undergraduate programs, masters programs, and a doctoral program in drama conducted jointly with UC San Diego.

==Architecture and history==
The school was named in honor of [[Academy Award]]-winning Hollywood [[film actress|actress]] [[Claire Trevor]] (1910-2000).&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/24/entertainment/ca-2social24&lt;/ref&gt; The school represents the largest contribution to the campus by architect [[William Pereira]], who oversaw its construction in 1970. It features a distinctive "modular" design in which individual buildings are connected by an overhead network of pillar-supported canopies. In 2005, the school's landscape was redesigned by [[Maya Lin]] in a [[retro-futurism|retro-futuristic]] style, featuring an outdoor theater, fountains, decorative [[LED]] lighting and landscaping with native grasses and wildflowers.  In fall 2011, the new "green" Contemporary Arts Center opened in the heart of the school, a $42.35-million building equipped with state-of-the-art studios and spaces for displaying, staging, and producing art.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.dailypilot.com/2011-09-08/news/tn-dpt-0909-ucartscenter-20110908_1_uci-chancellor-michael-drake-arts-at-uc-irvine-art-school&lt;/ref&gt;  It serves as the new anchor for the art school complex.

Early CTSA professors included [[Mehli Mehta]]&lt;ref&gt;http://music.arts.uci.edu/symphony/symphony/&lt;/ref&gt; (father of [[Zubin Mehta]]), choral master; [[Eugene Loring]], dance master with James Penrod as an assistant; [[Frank Stella]], [[Henry Clay]], [[Tony DeLap]] and [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], who were art instructors; and [[Robert Cohen (acting theorist)|Robert Cohen]], founding chair of the drama department.

==Departments and faculty==

===Art department===
Founded under the name Studio Art, the department renamed itself in 2012. It teaches a wide range of contemporary media, including drawing, electronic art and design, new genres, painting, performance, photography, sculpture, and video and digital filmmaking. The department has around 20 full-time faculty members and accepts about 10 graduate students each year into its three-year M.F.A. program. In addition to those listed above, notable faculty members have included [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Vija Celmins]], [[David Hockney]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Catherine Opie]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Eleanor Antin]], [[John Mason (artist)|John Mason]], [[Ed Bereal]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], John McCracken, and [[Yvonne Rainer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://studioart.arts.uci.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''M.F.A. in Critical and Curatorial Studies
'''

The Critical &amp; Curatorial Studies program  &lt;ref&gt;http://uag.arts.uci.edu/critical-curatorial-concentration&lt;/ref&gt; educates graduate students to pursue a career in the field of curatorial practice, art criticism and public programming. The University Art Gallery &lt;ref&gt;http://uag.arts.uci.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a 'laboratory' for research by Critical &amp; Curatorial students and faculty. Critical &amp; Curatorial students engage in a rigorous curriculum consisting of a collaboration between Visual Studies and Department of Art.

===Dance department===
The UCI Dance department teaches ballet, modern dance, improvisation, and jazz performance and choreography, as well as courses in the history of dance, dance medicine and science, and the integration of dance with interactive technologies such as motion capture and telematics. The department has about 15 full-time faculty and accepts about 10 students a year into its two-year M.F.A. program. Notable faculty members have included the African-American choreographer [[Donald McKayle]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dance.arts.uci.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama department===
Robert Cohen organized an undergraduate repertory company that took ''Oedipus Rex'' on the road to UC San Diego and UC Santa Cruz in the department's early years. Other early productions included ''[[Marat/Sade|The Assassination of Jean Paul Marat by the Marquis de Sade]]'', "Little Mary Sunshine", ''[[Night of the Iguana]]'' and ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uci.edu/features/2011/10/feature_cohen_111024.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805210026/http://www.uci.edu/features/2011/10/feature_cohen_111024.php |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Inge]], author of such plays as ''Bus Stop, Picnic, '' and ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs'' taught playwriting in the drama department in the 1970s.  [[Jerzy Grotowski]], acting theorist and founder of the Polish Laboratory Theater, joined the drama faculty in 1983,&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;Koehler, Robert, "O.C. Theater," ''Los AngelesTimes'', 07/23/1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  and conducted his Objective Drama project in the fields and barn south of the main campus.  UCI graduate drama student James Slowiak was his chief assistant during the project years.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;  Many fellow artists and students, from the UCI student body and around the world, came to Irvine to work with him and explore experimental theatrical exercises in what has come to be known as the "Grotowski Barn."  In addition to Cohen and Grotowski, other drama faculty notables have included Stephen Barker, [[Keith Fowler]], G. Cameron Harvey, [[William Needles]], C.M., [[Bryan Reynolds]], and [[:de:Robert Weimann|Robert Weimann]].  Choreographer [[Donald McKayle]] was a joint member of the dance and drama faculties until his retirement.

===Music department===
The Music department follows a conservatory model and offers both a B.A. and a B.Mus at the undergraduate level, as well as a two-year M.F.A. degree program. Emphases at the graduate level include choral conducting,
collaborative piano, guitar/lute performance, instrumental and piano performance, and vocal arts. There is also a two-year master's degree in Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology (ICIT). The faculty consists of composers, scholars, musicologists, music theorists, conductors, and concert and recording artists. Notable faculty include jazz pianist and composer [[Kei Akagi]], composer and trombonist [[Michael Dessen]], computer music expert [[Chris Dobrian]], and Ensemble-in-Residence [[Trio Céleste]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://music.arts.uci.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical social thought''' is an interdisciplinary [[academic major]] offered at several [[liberal arts colleges]].

It addresses the fundamental questions about social life and embraces the contours of modern experience and the historical forces that have helped to shape that experience. It examines the prevailing and oppositional currents of thought; cultural representations as well as the [[technologies]] of their production and dissemination; the tensions between [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]], [[individuality]] and [[society]], [[truth]] and [[uncertainty]], [[creativity]] and order. 

The program treats [[common sense]] and conventional beliefs as points of departure rather than as predetermined points of arrival. It also supports questioning the taken-for-granted regardless of the political angle from which that questioning takes place. While critical social thought introduces a broad range of established critical genres, it also encourages imaginative thinking through synthesis and bridging tendencies of thought.

Examples of topical concentrations include: [[Architecture]] and the [[social organization]] of space, [[disenchantment]], [[peace]] and [[War|conflict]], racial and [[Ethnic group|ethnic identities]], the [[Western canon]] and its critics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5087">The '''cultural studies theory of composition''' (hereafter referred to as "cultural studies") is a field of [[composition studies]] that examines both writing as an artifact of culture and the contexts of writing situations. It also examines what happens to writing when cultures come into contact with each other, situations often referred to as "contact zones".&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise. "Arts of the Contact Zone." Profession 91. New York: MLA, 1991, 33-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How cultural studies began ==
Cultural studies arose in the 1970s and 1980s as a way of empowering otherwise disenfranchised voices: those who did not follow common or accepted political or social norms. It is a way of challenging an established power by investigating issues of "multiculturalism, the politics of literacy, and the implications of race, class, and gender".&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the discipline exists a variety of agendas and methods, but the fundamental idea behind cultural studies is to give voice to "the masses" and encourage representation of all cultures within a society.

Cultural studies pedagogy tends to include examinations of [[popular culture|pop culture]] and media texts and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies is influential in the composition classroom because it enables instructors to help students write about subjects they were familiar with and to "teach close reading and interpretation of texts....substituting popular culture or media for literary texts";&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; allows for the idea that we are inundated by culture in everything we see and read, and so it is useful in the composition classroom to analyze, examine, close-read, and understand the meaning in and around the texts.

== Teaching methods and implications ==
Cultural studies composition instructors can use a variety of genres for students to work within and between. They include:
&lt;br /&gt;-- Production-based studies (emphasizes the producer; the "political organization of the conditions of production"&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Richard. "What is Cultural Studies, Anyway?" Social Text 16.1 (1986-87): 38-80.&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;br /&gt;-- Text-based studies (i.e. literary criticism)
&lt;br /&gt;-- Studies of lived culture (ethnographic, historic, semiotic looks at how people are enculturated or contextualized)

Classroom methods include using pop culture and [[media studies]] into composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Often these sources tend to allow students to write about what they know and to close-read and interpret texts about culture instead of literature.&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It helps students contextualize their own experiences. Teachers use multicultural texts&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise. "Arts of the Contact Zone." Profession 91. New York: MLA, 1991, 33-40.&lt;/ref&gt; that introduce and encourage discussions of multiple literacies, the implications of power, and the "contact zones" where cultures overlap and potentially collide.

When it comes to the personal essay, students from different multicultural backgrounds will bring different approaches, from the way the begin their stories to the information they choose to address.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, Jeanne Weiland. "Telling Stories: Rethinking the Personal Narrative in the Contact Zone of a Multicultural Classroom." Professing in the Contact Zone: Bringing Theory and Practice Together. Ed. Janice M. Wolff. Urbana: NCTE, 1994, 274-290.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that workshopping the personal narrative (or, perhaps, any writing) in a classroom full of diversity can bring challenges, not just with understanding each other's words, but also with understanding meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, Jeanne Weiland. "Telling Stories: Rethinking the Personal Narrative in the Contact Zone of a Multicultural Classroom." Professing in the Contact Zone: Bringing Theory and Practice Together. Ed. Janice M. Wolff. Urbana: NCTE, 1994, 274-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques of cultural studies ==
Critics have debated the ethics of professors pitching their soapboxes in class. Others accuse cultural studies compositionists as teaching an ideology, not writing.

== Current directions of cultural studies ==
One of the directions cultural studies is taking, is for civic- and community-service-oriented composition classes.

In the [[European Union]] education is the responsibility of Member States; European Union institutions play a supporting role. According to Art. 165 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], the Community {{cquote|shall contribute to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States,through actions such as promoting the mobility of citizens, designing joint study programmes, establishing networks, exchanging information or teaching [[languages of the European Union]]. The Treaty also contains a commitment to promote life-long learning for all citizens of the Union.}} 
The EU also funds educational, vocational and citizenship-building programmes which encourage EU citizens to take advantage of opportunities which the EU offers its citizens to live, study and work in other countries. The best known of these is the [[Erasmus programme]], under which more than 3,000,000 students have taken part in inter-university exchange and mobility over the last 20 years.
Since 2000, conscious of the importance of Education and Training for their economic and social objectives, EU Member States have begun working together to achieve specific goals in the field of Education. By sharing examples of good policy practice, by taking part in Peer Learning activities, by setting benchmarks and by tracking progress against key indicators, the 28 Member States aim to respond coherently to common challenges, whilst retaining their individual sovereignty in the field of Education policy. This strategy is referred to as the Education and Training 2020 programme (ET2020), which is an update of the [[Education and Training 2010]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XG0528(01)|title=EUR-Lex - 52009XG0528(01) - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The European Union is also a partner in various inter-governmental projects, including the [[Bologna Process]] whose purpose is to create a [[European higher education area]] by harmonising [[academic degree]] structures and standards as well as academic [[quality assurance]] standards throughout EU Member States and in other European countries.

==Building a Europe of knowledge==
The European Union adopted its first education programme  (the COMETT programme, designed to stimulate contacts and exchanges between universities and industry) in July 1987. This programme was rapidly followed by the [[ERASMUS programme]], which promoted inter-university contacts and cooperation, as well as substantial student mobility (as, in 1989, did the "Youth for Europe" programme, the EU's first youth exchange support scheme). These programmes were adopted by the [[Council of the European Union|EU countries]] but with considerable support from the [[European Parliament]] which made budgets available even before the legal instruments had been adopted.

The [[European Union]] has two different types of instrument to increase the quality and openness of the education and training systems of the EU's Member States: a set of policy instruments through which [[Member States of the European Union|EU countries]] are encouraged to develop their own education systems and to learn from each other's successes; and a substantial programme to support exchanges, networks and mutual learning between schools, universities or training centres as well as between the political authorities responsible for these areas in the different Member States.

==Education and training policy==
The [[European Union]]'s interest in Education policy (as opposed to Education programmes) developed after the Lisbon summit in March 2000, at which the [[European Council|EU's Heads of State and Government]] asked the Education Ministers of the EU to reflect on the "concrete objectives" of education systems with a view to improving them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/00100-r1.en0.htm Presidency Conclusions Lisbon European Council 23 and 24 March 2000];cf paragraphs 24-27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] and [[Council of the European Union|the European Union's Member States]] worked together on a report for the Spring 2001 [[European Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aei.pitt.edu/43341/|title=Stockholm European Council 23-24 March 2001.

The Commission seeks to encourage Member States to improve the quality of their education and training systems in two main ways: through a process of setting targets and publishing the position of Member States in achieving them and by stimulating debate on subjects of common interest. This is done using the process known as the [[Open Method of Coordination]].

===Target setting===
As regards target setting, the Member States agreed in the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] on 5 May 2003 on five benchmarks on : early school leavers; number of graduates and decrease of gender imbalance in maths, science and technology; upper secondary education completion; low achievers in reading literacy; lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2003.134.01.0003.01.ENG|title=EUR-Lex - 52003XG0607(01) - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current policy framework in Education and Policy (ET2020), the seven benchmarks require that by 2020:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/indicators-benchmarks_en.htm|title=Education and training policies based on evidence - Education and training - European Commission|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1 - ''Early School Leavers'' : less than 10% of school pupils should leave school before the end of compulsory schooling

2 - ''Tertiary education attainment'' : at least 40% of the population aged 30–34 years should have completed tertiary education

3 - ''Early childhood education and care'' : 95% of children aged 4 to the age when primary education starts should participate in early education

4 - ''Low achievement in Reading, Maths and Science'' : no more than 15% of 15-year-olds should be low-achievers in reading, maths and science as measured at level 2 in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD's]] [[Programme for International Student Assessment]]

5 - ''Employment rate of recent graduates'' : 82% of the population aged 20–34, who are no longer in education or training and have successfully completed upper secondary or tertiary education, should be employed

6 - ''Adult participation in life-long learning'' : participation of the 25-64 age group in lifelong learning (i.e. formal or non-formal continuing education or training including in-company skills development) should be not less than 15% per annum

7 - ''Mobility between countries'' : at least 20% of higher education graduates and 6% of 18- to 34-year-olds with an initial vocational qualification should have spent some time studying or training abroad

Since 2012,&lt;ref name="2012 Joint Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52012XG0308(01)|title=EUR-Lex - 52012XG0308(01) - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; progress against benchmarks and core indicators is yearly assessed in the ''Education and Training Monitor'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/tools/et-monitor_en.htm|title=Education and Training Monitor - Education and training - European Commission|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published every autumn by the [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture]] in replacement of the ''Progress Report''.&lt;ref name="2012 Joint Report"/&gt; The benchmark on ''Early school leavers'' and the benchmark on ''Tertiary education attainment'' are also [[Europe 2020]] targets.

===Policy discussions===
In addition to the measurement of progress, the Commission also publishes policy papers designed to encourage the EU's Member States to look more closely at particular areas of their education and training policy. The Commission has published such papers over many years, but until the [[Lisbon Strategy|Lisbon Summit]] in March 2000, few were widely followed. Since then, however, Member States have become more open to mutual exchange and learning, and a number of Commission papers have had significant impact. A recent example (late 2006) may be found in the Communication on "[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]] and [[Equity (economics)|equity]] in European education and training systems". This paper was generally welcomed by Member States but it drew criticism from some (in particular Germany and Austria) who felt that it commented negatively on their education and training systems.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, the article of 14 November 2006 in Der Spiegel Online at [http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,448433,00.html] or similar articles in Financial Times Deutschland and Tageszeitung on 15 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Networking===
Finally, the Commission has supported a variety of networking systems between Ministers (and Ministries) in the EU's Member States, in addition to the thrice yearly meetings of the "Education Council" within the EU's own institutional system. These range from biennial meetings of Ministers responsible for Vocational Education and Training (the "Copenhagen Process"), through regular meetings of Director Generals for Higher Education or for Vocational Education and Training to more specialised networks or "clusters" within the "[[Education and Training 2010]] programme" in areas such as key competences, foreign language learning or the recognition of informal and non-formal qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/et_2010_en.html |title=EUROPA - Education and Training - INNERPAGE - Education |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training programmes==

===Inside the EU===

The first European Union exchange programmes were the COMETT Programme for Industry-University links and exchanges, launched in 1987 (and discontinued in 1995); the [[Erasmus programme|Erasmus]] university exchange programme was launched in the same year. Similar programmes have been running ever since, and as from 2007 all the education and training programmes were brought together in one single programme; the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/index_en.html |title=EUROPA - Education and Training - The Lifelong learning programme |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319090812/http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/index_en.html |archivedate=19 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lifelong Learning programme comprises separate sub-programmes for schools; universities and higher education; vocational education and training; adult education; teaching about the EU in universities; and a 'horizontal' programme for policy development.

The schools exchange programme, named after the 15th century Czech teacher, scientist and educator John Amos [[Comenius]], has helped over 2.5 million school students take part in joint projects across boundaries. The Erasmus programme (named after [[Desiderius Erasmus]], the 16th century Dutch humanist and theologian), has been the icon of university exchange programmes since its launch in 1987. Some two million students have so far spent a fully accredited period of between 3 months and an academic year in another EU university under the programme, which has become a symbol of Europe in universities. The vocational education and training programme is named after the renaissance inventor and all-rounder [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It currently helps around 75,000 young people each year to do an apprenticeship or internship in another [[List of European Union member states|EU country]]. The adult education programme, named after Pastor [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]], the 19th century Danish theologian, poet, philosopher and thinker, helps those involved in adult education to have access to similar international experience. The sub-programme which supports teaching about Europe in higher education is named after the French politician and architect of [[European Unity]], [[Jean Monnet]].

The programme entered into force on 1 January 2007, and will continue until projects launched in its final year 2013 are closed - probably in 2016.

===Outside the EU===
The first EU programme to promote educational exchange and cooperation between educational institutions inside the EU and those outside it was the [[TEMPUS]] programme, adopted on 7 May 1990 by the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] as part of the assistance provided by the European Community of the day to the countries breaking free of Soviet rule.

The idea behind TEMPUS was that individual universities in the [[European Community]] could contribute to the process of rebuilding free and effective university systems in partner countries; and that a bottom-up process through partnerships with individual universities in these countries would provide a counterweight to the influence of the much less trusted Ministries, few of which had by then undergone serious change since Soviet domination. The programme was an immediate success; and by 1993 the number of participating countries had grown from five at the start to eleven. The programme was subsequently enlarged to include the [[Post-Soviet states|Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union]]; again to include the countries of the Western Balkans;&lt;ref&gt;Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia.&lt;/ref&gt; and  finally to cover the Mediterranean countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempus.am/about_tempus.html#partner|title=for a full list of current coverage, see|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TEMPUS programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/tempus/index_en.html|title=Capacity Building in the field of higher education - Erasmus+ - European Commission|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently supports projects run by consortia of universities in the EU and in partner countries which aim to update curricula and teaching methods; to improve academic management (e.g., strategic development plans, systems of quality assessment and assurance); and to promote the higher education priorities of its partner countries. It also provides Individual Mobility Grants to enable individuals to travel to or from Europe in connection with these themes. The TEMPUS programme is still running, but will be renewed and revised as from 2007.

TEMPUS was followed by a series of smaller programmes built more round the mobility of academics towards the EU. These included the ALFA/ALBAN programmes with Latin American universities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/projects/alfa/information_en.htm|title=see official web-site|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Asia-Link programme;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/projects/asia-link/index_en.htm|title=official web-site|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, sometimes time-limited.  A number of these appear to have been set up as a means of [[Development aid|development assistance]] rather than with the development of universities as such, an impression strengthened by the fact that they were managed by the [[European Commission]]'s development assistance service [[EuropeAid Co-operation Office|EuropeAid]] rather than (like [[TEMPUS]] or [[ERASMUS Mundus|Erasmus Mundus programme]]) by its [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture|Education and Culture]] department.

Finally, in 2003 the European Union launched the Erasmus Mundus programme, a project to ensure the place of European Universities as centres of excellence across the world; to attract the best students from around the world to Europe; and to enable partnerships between European universities and those in other countries. The programme had strong support both from the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] and from the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;see the enthusiastic report on the draft Erasmus Mundus programme by Mme [[Marielle de Sarnez]] MEP for the [[European Parliament]]: [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2003-0087+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN]&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of Erasmus Mundus will finish in 2008. The Commission has announced its intention to propose a further period. Europe Study Centre (ESC) has lately come up as a reputed and dependable company in Indian providing end to end services in the European overseas education field helping Indian students to avail the Erasmus Mundus benefits.

'''Emily Verdery Battey ''' (November 1826 — November 1912)&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt; was an American journalist who was one of the earliest salaried women reporters in the United States. Most of her career was spent in New York.

==Biography==
Emily Verdery was born in Belair, near [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; She married a physician, George Magruder Battey, who died in 1856.&lt;ref name=battey/&gt; 

It was shortly after the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] that Battey began writing for several Georgia newspapers and became a traveling correspondent for the ''Ladies Home Gazette'', which was edited by her  brother-in-law.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; Around 1870, she moved to New York, where she did editorial work and wrote for a range of periodicals, including the ''[[The Morning Telegraph|Morning Telegraph]]'', the ''[[New York Star (1800s newspaper)|New York Star]]'', the ''[[New York Herald]]'', and ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt;&lt;ref name=fahs/&gt; ''Harper's'', for example, published a story she wrote that required her to climb around among the steeples of New York's churches.&lt;ref name=ac1892/&gt;

The ''[[New York Sun]]'' in particular often printed special articles and editorials by Battey.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; The ''Sun'''s editor, [[Charles Anderson Dana]], thought highly of her, and in 1875 he offered her a salaried staff position at his paper.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt;&lt;ref name=hart/&gt; Battey took the position and remained at the ''Sun'' until 1890.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; One of the earliest salaried women reporters in the United States, she wrote on women's rights, general news, fashion, and religion.&lt;ref name=munsey/&gt;&lt;ref name=rosary/&gt; She was referred to as the "female [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] of the New York Press",&lt;ref name=fahs/&gt; and in her day she was called one of the top women writers from Georgia, along with [[Mary Edwards Bryan]].&lt;ref name=slw/&gt;

During her 15 years at the ''Sun'', she also wrote under various pen names for other newspapers around the country as well as for several syndicates.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; Through her work at the ''Sun'', she became very knowledgeable about the history of women's organizations, the [[temperance movement]], and other aspects of the social and political history of American women in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; She later spoke about her experiences in journalism in a lecture entitled "The Woman's Century".&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; 

Around 1891, her health broke down and she had to give up her newspaper work.&lt;ref name=fahs/&gt;&lt;ref name=ac1892/&gt; She opened a journalism school in New York, but continuing health issue made her decide to move back to the South to convalesce, bringing the school with her to Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref name=ac1892/&gt; By 1892, her school had several students.&lt;ref name=fahs/&gt; While she held that the best place to train reporters was in a newspaper room, she felt that through a journalism school she could teach the basics, including the ability to recognize what makes a good news story.&lt;ref name=ac1892/&gt;

She died in 1912 and is buried in [[Decatur Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=findagrave /&gt; Some correspondence related to Battey and her husband forms part of the [[Robert Battey]] papers at Emory University.&lt;ref name=finding/&gt; Robert Battey was George Magruder Battey's nephew and ward.&lt;ref name=finding/&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">Ex Ordo is an [[Abstract management|abstract and paper management system]] for [[Academic conference|research or academic conference]] and symposia. Their web application automates the process of collecting and [[peer review]]ing abstracts and papers. The tool is cloud-based, offering an online platform to allow all the persons involved in the conference to get involved directly.
The conference management system uses an built-in intelligence, creating automated tasks for each user involved in a conference – organisers, authors and reviewers – to guide them through the process of submitting, reviewing and accepting papers and abstracts.&lt;ref name="EU-Russia Innovation Forum 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation at the 3rd EU-Russia Innovation Forum in 2012, at Lappeenranta|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVgre-Q8vs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ex Ordo was founded in 2011 by Paul Killoran and Dermot Lally. The founders of the company started developing technology for academic conferences when Paul Killoran was still an engineering student at NUI Galway. He came up with the idea of creating a system to manage the research material for academic conferences to help one of his [[lecturer]]s organise a conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ex Ordo: Event Organising for Academic Conferences|journal=Technology voice|date=1 October 2012|url=http://technologyvoice.com/2012/01/10/ex-ordo-event-organising-for-academic-conferences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising how much conference Chairs needed efficient tools to manage their conference, they decided to develop their technology further and incorporated in 2011. They have offices in Galway, Boston and London. Ex Ordo support research conferences in Europe, the USA, South America, Asia and Australia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Startups|url=http://www.westbic.ie/our-startups|website=Westbic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in all academic fields.

They are a preferred partner of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE Conference Peer Review Service Network|url=http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/organizers/peer_review%20_network.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sponsors more than 1,400 annual conferences, workshops and meetings worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE Conferences &amp; Events|url=http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
Ex Ordo system allows Chairs to manage all the stages of the abstract management process: call for papers, submissions, peer-review, acceptance, author notification, registration, programme and putting together the proceedings[16].

They also have a team of mentors who provides one-to-one guidance to chairs at key decision times. They also have a "team of academic advisers [who] provide one to one mentorship at key milestones when critical decisions need to be made.

'''''Fast Food Tycoon''''', also known as '''''Pizza Syndicate''''' in Europe, is an [[Simulation|economical simulation]] [[computer game]] developed by Software 2000, and licensed to Activision Value Publishing. Similar to ''[[Pizza Tycoon]]'', ''Fast Food Tycoon'' is centered on the object of creating and managing a successful [[pizza]] restaurant-chain business. The series spawned a sequel, ''[[Fast Food Tycoon 2]]''. It also received an expansion pack, '''''Mehr Biss''''', which was released only in German.

==Gameplay==
''Fast Food Tycoon'' tests the player's culinary expertise and management skills. One creates his/her own character through balancing personal traits and experience, at the expense of age and starting money. The game provides more than 800,000 different character possibilities. The gameplay can be both open-ended or object-oriented. The player determines the conditions and objectives of the game during player configuration.

The player must manage and decide branch-location, pizza recipes, interior design, global marketing and [[fast food advertising]] strategies, employees, and out-competing rivals. The player has control of every aspect of the game, from the type of seating used in the branches to the medium of advertisement. The player can even choose what bank to invest/borrow from.

''Fast Food Tycoon'' also offers the "syndicate" theme where managers utilize the "underground" ([[Mafia]]) to meet his/her goals. The player can both form his own syndicate, or join an already established organization to partake in the darker side of the business. However, if the player is killed during a syndicate mission, the simulation ends. The player must weigh the benefits of illegal activity against the dangers of mafia life.

''Fast Food Tycoon'' allows for up to 6 computer opponents, simultaneously competing in up to six different international cities, picked from a list of 20. The game also includes up to 140 interactive characters in each city, and multi-cultural soundtracks matching each city’s location. ''Fast Food Tycoon'' incorporates a playful sense of humor into the animated game play, with a multitude of menus and tools.

==Reviews==
[http://pc.ign.com/articles/165/165761p1.html IGN] 7.0/10 (Decent): "When you consider that this game goes for around $19.99, it's a pretty good deal if you like economic simulations. Fast Food Tycoon isn't a hard-core sim or anything, but it'll give you some hours of fun equal to what you paid for it."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6005">'''Fernando Luís Cardoso de Meneses de Tavares e Távora''', [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|ComSE]], simply known as '''Fernando Távora''' ([[Porto]], August 25, 1923 - [[Matosinhos]], September 3, 2005), was a renowned [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[architect]] and [[professor]].

==Biography==
[[File:Praça 8 de Maio Coimbra photo by Christian Gänshirt.jpg|thumb|Praça 8 de Maio in [[Coimbra]], renovation by Fernando Távora c. 2002]]
The sixth of seven children and third of three sons of José Pinto Tavares de Mendonça Ferrão or José Ferrão de Tavares e Távora and wife Maria José do Amaral Ferrão Lobo Machado or Maria José Lobo de Sousa Machado Cardoso de Meneses, of the Viscounts of Paço de Nespereira, he inherited from his mother the House of Covilhã.&lt;ref&gt;Biografia Arquitecto Fernando Távora (in Portuguese), online at: http://www.oasrn.org/premio.php?inf=biografia , retrieved Jan. 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in architecture from the Porto School of Fine Arts (which later became the [[Porto School of Architecture|school of architecture]] of the [[University of Porto]]) in 1952. Having sat the examination in Fine Composition for Professor of Architecture, he was later invited to become a Professor at the school. Participating in several [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) and [[Team 10]] meetings, he became a key person in the modernization of the Porto School. Two of his former students, [[Álvaro Siza]] (who also worked in his architecture office) and [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], have been awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]].

Later on, Távora became "President of the Ad Hoc Committee of the [[Porto School of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture at the University of Porto]]" and university professor at the same faculty, as well as professor of the Department of Architecture at the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the [[University of Coimbra]]. He took part in the late 1950s "Survey on Portuguese Architecture" and was the author of several essays, namely "O Problema da Casa Portuguesa" (Lisbon, 1947) and "Da Organização do Espaço" (Porto, 1962 and 1982).&lt;ref&gt;Luiz Trigueiros (editor): Fernando Távora. Editorial Blau, Lisboa 1993, {{ISBN|972-8311-29-X}} http://www.cidadevirtual.com/blau/tav_cont.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most important works in the 1980s was the renovation and extension of the [[Pousadas de Portugal|Pousada]] de Guimarães, a former convent which at the time was transformed into the Sta. Marinha Historic Hotel.

Besides his academic career, Távora worked as an architect for Porto Town Council, consultant to [[Vila Nova de Gaia]] Town Council, consultant in the "Commissariat on the Urban Renovation of the Ribeira/Barredo" (Porto) project, consultant in the "Technical Bureau of the Northern Planning Commission", and consultant in the "Local Technical Bureau of [[Guimarães]] Town Council".

}}
'''GoldieBlox'''  is an interactive toy company for girls. GoldieBlox launched in 2012 and went from a prototype on [[Kickstarter]] to more than $1m of pre-orders placed in under a month. In just under two years, GoldieBlox has made its way to [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and more than 6,000 retailers worldwide, including Canada, Australia, and the UK. The company was founded by [[Debbie Sterling]], a Stanford engineering graduate and [[entrepreneur]], and is based in [[Oakland, CA]]. GoldieBlox pairs a construction kit with a storybook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Yuyu|title=GoldieBlox uses influencers to sell toys to young girls|url=http://digiday.com/brands/goldieblox-influencers/|website=''[[Digiday]]''|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Goldie Blox toy press image.png|thumb|right|Goldie Blox toy press image.]]
==History==
While Sterling was a student at Stanford, she noticed her classes were predominantly male. This ratio was indicative of a larger gender gap; while she was at Stanford, the percentage of women in engineering in the United States was only 11% &lt;ref name="postcrescent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20130622/APC0406/306220005/Girls-need-overcome-hurdles-build-their-presence-STEM-fields?nclick_check=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924080715/http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20130622/APC0406/306220005/Girls-need-overcome-hurdles-build-their-presence-STEM-fields?nclick_check=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Girls need to overcome hurdles to build their presence in STEM fields |publisher=[[Post-Crescent]] |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |last=Harp |first=Jill }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/09/24/goldieblox-the-toy-designed-to-inspire-future-female-engineers/ | title=GoldieBlox, The Toy Designed To Inspire Future Female Engineers | publisher=Time | date=24 September 2012 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | last=Paramaguru, | first=Kharunya}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After research, Sterling found that girls begin to lose interest in math and science as young as age 8. She set out to create a solution, but knew that creating a pink construction toy wasn’t enough.  She spent two years studying early child development, specifically in girls and the gender marketing of toys, and learned that girls excel in verbal skills, reading and writing. The breakthrough of GoldieBlox marries the story of Goldie, a girl inventor who loves to build, with a construction kit.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/GoldieBlox-helps-get-girls-into-engineering-4264633.php | title=GoldieBlox helps get girls into engineering | publisher=SF Gate | date=8 February 2013 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | last=Said | first=Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fund her first round of production, Sterling created a Kickstarter campaign in 2012.&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/09/25/goldie-blox/ | title=Stanford engineer launches GoldieBlox, a toy to inspire young girls to be engineers | publisher=Venture Beat | date=25 September 2012 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | last=Farr | first=Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/16029337/goldieblox-the-engineering-toy-for-girls | title=GoldieBlox: The Engineering Toy for Girls | publisher=Kickstarter | date=October 2012 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project reached its funding goal of $150,000 in 4 days, and went on to raise a total of $285,881 with 5,519 backers by the end of the campaign. In just under two years, GoldieBlox has made its way to Toys “R” Us, Amazon, and more than 1,000 retailers nationwide and in Canada, the U.K. and Australia.

==Products==
Geared toward ages (4-12), toys in the GoldieBlox series introduce engineering concepts to girls through storytelling and building. Each toy introduces new characters and concepts, and there are currently six sets in the series.

In 2014, GoldieBlox also began introducing digital content. The company’s first mobile app, GoldieBlox and the Movie Machine, was introduced in October 2014. The app features the company’s first-ever animated cartoon, and was named by Apple as one of the Best Apps of 2014. Bloxtown.com, GoldieBlox’s digital playground, houses original content and videos of new design ideas for kids to watch and build at home.

==Videos==

===GoldieBlox &amp; Rube Goldberg “Princess Machine”===
GoldieBlox’s “Princess Machine” video launched on YouTube in November 2013, garnering over 8 million views in 4 days. The video features three young girls building a Rube Goldberg machine built by [[Brett Doar]], and was set to a parody tune of the  [[Beastie Boys]] song "[[Girls (Beastie Boys song)|Girls]]". Shortly after the release, the Beastie Boys reached out to GoldieBlox, inquiring about the use of their song without their permission. Goldieblox responded by suing for [[declaratory judgment]] in U.S. District Court of San Francisco seeking declaration of [[Parody#United States|fair use due to parody]]. GoldieBlox  claimed fair use on the grounds that they had "created its parody video specifically to comment on the Beastie Boys song, and to further the company's goal to break down gender stereotypes and to encourage young girls to engage in their intellect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/186402972/Beastie|title=Beastie|website=Scribd|date=21 November 2013 |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beastie Boys responded with an [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/the-beastie-boys-fight-online-video-parody-of-girls/?_r=1 open letter], in which they lauded "the creativity and message behind the ad," voiced their support for GoldieBlox's mission, but ultimately declared that the band did not permit their "music and/or name to be used in product ads,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/the-beastie-boys-fight-online-video-parody-of-girls/?_r=1|title=Beastie Boys Fight Online Video Parody of 'Girls'|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|website=ArtsBeat |date=25 November 2013 |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim which was further bolstered by a stipulation in deceased band member [[Adam Yauch]]'s will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/adam-yauchs-will-prohibits-use-of-his-music-in-ads-20120809|title=Adam Yauch's Will Prohibits Use of His Music in Ads|website=Rolling Stone|date=9 August 2012|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beastie Boys concluded their letter by stating, "when we tried to simply ask how and why our song 'Girls' had been used in your ad without our permission, YOU sued US."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/11/beastie-boys-girls-goldieblox-toy-open-letter-lawsuit/|title=Beastie Boys Write Classy Open Letter to ‘Girls’-Spoofing Toy Company {{!}} SPIN|website=Spin|date=25 November 2013|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GoldieBlox responded positively by taking down the video and writing their own open letter (which has since been [http://blog.goldieblox.com/2013/11/our-letter-to-the-beastie-boys/ taken down]) stating that, "although we believe our parody video falls under fair use, we would like to respect [Yauch's] wishes and yours." Regardless, the Beastie Boys went ahead with the counter lawsuit and a settlement was ultimately reached. The settlement granted GoldieBlox a retroactive license for the song, in exchange GoldieBlox "agreed to make annual payments of 1% of its gross revenue, until the total payments reached $1 million, to a charitable organization chosen by the Beastie Boys and approved by GoldieBlox which supports ‘science, technology, engineering and/or mathematics education for "girls’."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/13/goldieblox-beastie-boys-girls-settlement|title=GoldieBlox agreed to pay $1m to charity in Beastie Boys settlement|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|date=13 May 2014|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===This is Your Brain on Engineering (GoldieBlox Easter PSA)===
“This is Your Brain on Engineering (GoldieBlox Easter PSA)” video launched on YouTube in April 2014.  The video spotlights the difference between a young girl’s brain “on princess” vs. her brain “on engineering.” It’s an eye opener to the gender norms placed on young girls at an early age, and uses wheels, axles and engineering to highlight some statistics related to the dearth of women in engineering.

===GoldieBlox vs. the Big Sister Machine===
“GoldieBlox vs. the Big Sister Machine” launched on YouTube in November 2014, demonstrating the need for female role models inspired by ingenuity and creativity. In the video, Big Sister prescribes her ideals of beauty and perfection to young girls. Little Sister - a girl inspired by Goldie - rebels against the mantra, breaking the girls free and leading them to a world of possibilities. The video is set to [[Metric (band)|Metric]]'s "Help I'm Alive" hit.

===Lightning Strikes===
GoldieBlox released their first single and animated music video, "Lightning Strikes," in December 2014. The track is an original song written and performed by [[Emily Haines]], the lead singer of Canadian rock band Metric. The video and song feature Goldie, a strong female character who comes up with a great idea and strives to accomplish it, despite whatever set-backs occur along the way. GoldieBlox and Emily created the song as a message to girls, showing them that with confidence and ingenuity they can accomplish anything.

==Advertisements==

===Intuit’s Small Business Big Game Super Bowl commercial===
In February 2014, GoldieBlox won [[Intuit]]’s Small Business, Big Game contest, earning a 30-second commercial spot during the broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]]. The commercial airtime was valued at $4 million, and with the advertisement, GoldieBlox became the first small business to air an ad in the Super Bowl. The ad was set to a parody of the Slade/Quiet Riot song, "Come on Feel the Noize," changing the words to "Come On Bring the Toys." The ad depicted hundreds of little girls ditching their pink toys, while singing "More than pink, pink, pink, we want to think," and that "girls build like all the boys."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/GoldieBlox-Super-Bowl-ad-strives-to-entice-girls-5194465.php|title=GoldieBlox Super Bowl ad strives to entice girls to science|first=Carolyn|last=Said|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FILMADOS ASESINOS DE GENESIS CARMONA - GUERRA CIVIL EN VENEZUELA.webm|290px|thumb|right|Pro-government militias fire upon the protest Carmona was participating in]]

On 18 February 2014, Carmona participated in an anti-government demonstration. Protesters, dressed in white, planned to march down Cedeño Avenue to the Plaza de Toros. The march encountered military barricades and prevented the hundreds of demonstrators from advancing, with participants deciding to protest in the space in which they were confined. At 3:30pm, pro-government [[Colectivo (Venezuela)|colectivos]] arrived on the scene and began to attack the protest with "[b]ottles, stones and gunfire". As shots rang out, individuals scattered into Cedeño Mall, seeking shelter from bullets.&lt;ref name="EC2017"/&gt;

The attack resulted in several opposition protesters injured, 8 of those injured from gunshot wounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Marianela|title=Al menos 8 heridos de bala en manifestaciones de Valencia|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140218/al-menos-8-heridos-de-bala-en-manifestaciones-de-valencia|accessdate=12 July 2014|agency=El Universal|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Carmona, who suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the head.&lt;ref name=SeveralInjured&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fiaschi|first1=M.|title=Reportan varios heridos en marcha que se realizó en la avenida Cedeño de Valencia|url=http://noticias24carabobo.com/actualidad/noticia/36407/un-joven-resulto-herido-en-marcha-de-la-avenida-cedeno-de-valencia/|accessdate=12 July 2014|agency=Noticias 24 Carabobo|date=18 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223624/http://noticias24carabobo.com/actualidad/noticia/36407/un-joven-resulto-herido-en-marcha-de-la-avenida-cedeno-de-valencia/|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maduronews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carmonaisdead"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140219/genesis-carmona-miss-tourism-2013-is-dead-after-being-shot-in-protest |title=Génesis Carmona, Miss Tourism 2013, is dead after being shot in protest|date=19 February 2014|accessdate=20 June 2014|work=El Universal|location=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses described that she sunk to the ground after a bullet penetrated her left [[occiput|occipital]] skull area.

Carmona was then placed in the [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]]. A day later on 19 February at 12:15 p.m, she died from "significant" brain damage due to gunshot trauma and loss of blood the following day.&lt;ref name="el-universal-mx-20140219" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc-es-20140219" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Falleció Miss Turismo 2013 herida de bala ayer en Valencia|trans-title=Miss Tourism 2013 shot yesterday in Valencia died|language= Spanish|url= http://www.el-nacional.com/sucesos/Solicitan-donantes-Miss-Turismo-Valencia_0_358764191.html|accessdate= 19 February 2014|newspaper= El Nacional|date= 19 February 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20140219175059/http://www.el-nacional.com/sucesos/Solicitan-donantes-Miss-Turismo-Valencia_0_358764191.html|archivedate= 19 February 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Carlos Rosales explained that the bullet was still in Carmona's brain and that if she had survived, she would have been blind.&lt;ref name="EC2017"/&gt;

===Aftermath===

====Media and family response====
In an interview with Spanish newspaper ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', Carmona's friend and fellow protester Héctor Rotunda said Carmona was shot when a group of about 50 individuals outfitted in red (and thus believed to be government supporters) approached the demonstration and fired a burst of about 10 rounds at protesters. Mourners at Carmona's funeral stated she was "killed by government mercenaries."&lt;ref name="President-Maduro-blames-protesters-for-genesis-carmona-death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuelans-mourn-slain-beauty-queen-as-more-protests-planned/|title=Venezuelans mourn slain beauty queen as more protests planned|date=February 21, 2014|agency=AP|work=[[CBS News]] online portal|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some foreign news sources said that pro-government paramilitaries were the ones who shot and killed her.&lt;ref name="Jornal Gazeta do Povo do Paraná 2014-02-22"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/mundo/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=1448569&amp;tit=Morre-miss-baleada-durante-protestos-na-Venezuela |title=Morre miss baleada durante protests na Venezuela |trans-title=A Beauty Queen Dies During Protests in Venezuela |work=Gazeta do Povo do Paraná|date=19 February 2014|accessdate=21 February 2014|location=[[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Brazil]]|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ELCOM&gt;{{cite news|title=Muerte de Génesis Carmona: chavista había incitado la violencia|url= http://elcomercio.pe/mundo/latinoamerica/genesis-carmona-gobernador-chavista-incito-violencia-noticia-1710775 |accessdate=25 February 2014|newspaper=El Comercio|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= ELMUNDO&gt;{{cite news|title= Una miss venezolana muere tras recibir un disparo en una protesta|url= http://www.elmundo.es/america/2014/02/19/5304d846ca4741ff108b457a.html |accessdate= 25 February 2014|newspaper= El Mundo|date= 19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= INFOBAE&gt;{{cite news |title= Murió la reina de belleza atacada por las milicias chavistas|trans-title=The beauty queen attacked by Chavist militia died | language = Spanish| url = http://www.infobae.com/2014/02/19/1544839-murio-la-reina-belleza-atacada-las-milicias-chavistas | accessdate= 25 February 2014 |newspaper= Infobae| date= 19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ferreiro | first = Ignacio| title= Génesis Carmona, Miss Carabobo, asesinada por las milicias chavistas |trans-title=Génesis Carmona, Miss Carabobo, Assassinated by the Chavist militia | language = Spanish| url = http://www.hechosdehoy.com/genesis-carmona-miss-carabobo-asesinada-por-las-milicias-chavistas--33662.htm |accessdate= 25 February 2014| newspaper = Hechos de Hoy | date = 19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCinterview&gt;{{cite news|last= Rozo| first= Diego | title = Unos moteros chavistas asesinaron a la miss venezolana Génesis Carmona |trans-title=Some Chavist motorcyclists assassinated the Miss Venezuela Génesis Carmona | language = Spanish| url = http://www.abc.es/internacional/20140221/abci-testigo-muerte-genesis-201402202150.html | accessdate =25 February 2014|newspaper=ABC (Spanish News)|date= 21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= OJO&gt;{{cite news | language = Spanish| title = Venezuela: Chavistas mataron a reina de belleza Génesis Carmona | format = video |trans-title=Venezuela: Chavists killed the beauty queen Génesis Carmona | url= http://ojo.pe/ojo/nota.php?/venezuela-chavistas-mataron-a-reina-de-belleza-genesis-carmona-%5Bvideo%5D/&amp;txtSecci_id=25&amp;txtNota_id=819190 | accessdate = 25 February 2014|newspaper=Ojo|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmona's mother has also stated that the attackers were clearly identifiable in videos as Venezuelan government supporters and that Venezuelan authorities did "nothing" to clarify Carmona's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Madre de Génesis Carmona se exilia en EEUU|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/141210/madre-de-genesis-carmona-se-exilia-en-eeuu|accessdate=6 January 2015|agency=El Universal|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have blamed [[Francisco Ameliach]] for Carmona's death. Days before Carmona was killed, the governor of the state of Carabobo, Francisco Ameliach, called on [[Units of Battle Hugo Chávez|Unidades de Batalla Bolívar-Chávez (''Units of Battle Hugo Chávez'', UBCh)]], in a tweet, asking UBCh to launch a rapid counterattack against protesters saying that the order would come from the President of the National Assembly, [[Diosdado Cabello]].&lt;ref name=ELCOM/&gt;&lt;ref name= ELMUNDO/&gt;&lt;ref name= INFOBAE/&gt;&lt;ref name= OJO/&gt;&lt;ref name=HRWpfp&gt;{{cite web|title=Punished for Protesting|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/venezuela0514_reportcover_web.pdf|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Carmona's death, Venezuela's anti-government protesters placed posters in various areas of Valencia, condemning Ameliach's tweet and linked it to the killing of Carmona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A dos meses del asesinato de Génesis Carmona, venezolanos piden justicia (Foto)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/04/19/en-memoria-a-genesis-carmona-asi-amanecieron-las-calles-de-valencia-fotos/|accessdate=9 July 2014|agency=La Patilla|date=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venezuelan government's response====
[[File:Banner at demonstrations and protests against Chavismo and Nicolas Maduro government 10.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|A memorial for a few of those killed during the 2014 Venezuelan protests, with Carmona among those pictured (top row, third from right)]]
The President of Venezuela, [[Nicolás Maduro]], expressed his condolences to Carmona's family and to the people who loved her. He also said that it had been "well-established" by the government's [[CIPC]] ballistic research and witnesses that violent groups from the opposition were responsible for her death.&lt;ref name="Maduronews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://noticias24carabobo.com/actualidad/noticia/38449/con-flores-y-misa-carabobenos-recuerdan-a-genesis-carmona-a-un-mes-de-su-fallecimiento/|title=Con flores y misa, carabobeños recuerdan hoy a Génesis Carmona a un mes de su muerte|date=March 19, 2014|work=Noticias24.com|accessdate=20 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615101241/http://noticias24carabobo.com/actualidad/noticia/38449/con-flores-y-misa-carabobenos-recuerdan-a-genesis-carmona-a-un-mes-de-su-fallecimiento/|archivedate=15 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ENmaduro&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.el-nacional.com/politica/Nicolas-Maduro-Genesis-Carmona-condolencias_0_359364237.html | title=Nicolás Maduro y Génesis Carmona: "Nuestras condolencias a su familia" | work=El-Nacional | date=20 February 2014 | accessdate=20 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121938/http://www.el-nacional.com/politica/Nicolas-Maduro-Genesis-Carmona-condolencias_0_359364237.html | archivedate=14 July 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=authorities-claim&gt;{{cite web|last=Robertson |first=Ewan |url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/10382 |title=Death Toll in Venezuela Clashes Rises to Ten (Updated) |publisher=venezuelanalysis.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span&gt;Minister of the Interior, [[Miguel Rodríguez Torres]], reported that the bullet that killed her came from her own ranks during the anti-government march.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2014/02/21/la-bala-que-mato-a-miss-turismo-salio-de-sus-propias-filas-dice-ministro-venezolano/|title = 'La bala que mató a Miss Turismo salió de sus propias filas', dice ministro venezolano|date = 21 February 2014|accessdate = 20 June 2014|website = CNN Español|publisher = CNN|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one PSUV member, Juan Maza, was placed on parole, having to report every 15 days.&lt;ref name="EC2017"/&gt; However as of 18 February 2017, three years after Carmona's death, the Venezuelan has never resolved the case surrounding her death.&lt;ref name="EC2017"/&gt;

===Eponyms===
Mayor Alejandro Feo La Cruz paid tribute to those who had died during protests in Carabobo, naming an avenue "Genesis Carmona Avenue" and named a park after another protester, Geraldin Moreno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inauguran Av. Génesis Carmona y Parque Geraldin Moreno en Valencia (Fotos)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/03/06/inauguran-av-genesis-carmona-y-parque-geraldin-moreno-en-valencia-fotos/|accessdate=9 July 2014|agency=La Patilla|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family's asylum===
In December 2014, Carmona's mother, María Eugenia Tovar, as well as her sister, Alejandra Carmona, moved to the United States seeking asylum. As of February 2017, the family has remained private, residing in the United States.&lt;ref name="EC2017"/&gt;

'''Hans-Georg Gadamer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|d|ə|m|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈɡaːdamɐ|lang}}; February 11, 1900&amp;nbsp;– March 13, 2002) was a German [[philosopher]] of the [[Continental philosophy|continental tradition]], best known for his 1960 ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' ''[[Truth and Method]]'' (''Wahrheit und Methode'') on [[hermeneutics]]. He was a Protestant [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gadamer|first1=Hans-Georg|title=The Relevance of the Beautiful and Other Essays|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521339537|page=35|url=http://timothyquigley.net/ipa/gadamer-rb.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2018|quote=As a Protestant, I have always found especially significant the controversy over the Last Supper, which raged in the Protestant Church, particularly between Luther and Zwingli.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Gadamer was born in [[Marburg]], [[German Empire|Germany]],{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=12}} the son of Johannes Gadamer (1867–1928),{{sfn|Grondin|2003|pp=26, 33}} a pharmaceutical [[chemistry]] professor who later also served as the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Marburg]]. He resisted his father's urging to take up the [[natural sciences]] and became more and more interested in the [[humanities]]. His mother, Emma Karoline Johanna Geiese (1869–1904) died of [[diabetes]] while Hans-Georg was four years old, and he later noted that this may have had an effect on his decision to not pursue scientific studies. [[Jean Grondin]] describes Gadamer as finding in his mother "a poetic and almost religious counterpart to the iron fist of his father".{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=21}} Gadamer did not serve during [[World War I]] for reasons of ill health{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=45}} and similarly was exempted from serving during [[World War II]] due to [[polio]].{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=46}}

He grew up and studied classics and philosophy in the [[University of Breslau]]{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=37}} under [[Richard Hönigswald]], but soon moved back to the University of Marburg to study with the [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Paul Natorp]] (his [[doctoral thesis]] advisor) and [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. He defended his [[dissertation]] ''The Essence of Pleasure in Plato's Dialogues'' ({{lang|de|Das Wesen der Lust nach den Platonischen Dialogen}}) in 1922.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=5–7}}

Shortly thereafter, Gadamer moved to [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg University]] and began studying with [[Martin Heidegger]], who was then a promising young scholar who had not yet received a professorship. He and Heidegger became close, and when Heidegger received a position at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], Gadamer followed him there, where he became one of a group of students such as [[Leo Strauss]], [[Karl Löwith]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]. It was Heidegger's influence that gave Gadamer's thought its distinctive cast and led him away from the earlier neo-Kantian influences of Natorp and Hartmann. Gadamer studied Aristotle both under [[Edmund Husserl]] and under Heidegger.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=7–8}}

Gadamer [[habilitation|habilitated]] in 1929 and spent most of the early 1930s lecturing in Marburg. Unlike Heidegger, who joined the [[Nazi Party]] in May 1933 and continued as a member until the party was dissolved following World War II, Gadamer was silent on [[Nazism]], and he was not politically active during the [[Third Reich]]. Gadamer did not join the Nazis, and he did not serve in the army because of the polio he had contracted in 1922. He joined the [[National Socialist Teachers League]] in August 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Ideologische Mächte im deutschen Faschismus Band 5: Heidegger im Kontext: Gesamtüberblick zum NS-Engagement der Universitätsphilosophen, George Leaman, Rainer Alisch, Thomas Laugstien, Verlag: Argument Hamburg, 1993, p. 105, {{ISBN|3886192059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Gadamer signed the ''[[w:de:Bekenntnis der deutschen Professoren zu Adolf Hitler|Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State]]''.

In April 1937 he became a temporary professor at Marburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Cesare|first=Donatella|title=Gadamer: A Philosophical Portrait|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmVdtUFL-ugC&amp;lpg=PA17|year=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253007631|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1938 he received a professorship at [[Leipzig University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dostal|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Byz-nfrKQkC&amp;lpg=PA21|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521000416|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-point of view Gadamer was classified as neither supportive nor disapproving in the "''SD-Dossiers über Philosophie-Professoren"'' (i.e. SD-files concerning philosophy professors) that were set up by the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SS-Security-Service (SD)]].&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Georg / Simon, Gerd: Deutsche Philosophen aus der Sicht des Sicherheitsdienstes des Reichsführers SS. Jahrbuch für Soziologie-Geschichte 1992, pages 261-292&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he was found by the American occupation forces to be untainted by Nazism and named rector of the university.&lt;!-- Please add this bit of the German Wikipedia properly into the article. Thanks. (But cf. German Wikipedia article, which notes [citing Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945'', Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;172] that on Nov. 11th, 1933 he signed the "declaration of loyalty to Adolf Hitler;" in 1937 he received a professorship in Marburg; in 1939 he became a full professor and director of an institute in Leipzig; and during the war he was involved in the "Humanities' contribution to the war effort" project:  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Gadamer.) --&gt;

The level of Gadamer's involvement with the Nazis has been disputed in the works of [[Richard Wolin]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wolin, ‚Nazism and the complicities of Hans-Georg Gadamer. Untruth and Method‘, ''The New Republic'', 15 May 2000, pp. 36–45&lt;/ref&gt; and Teresa Orozco.{{sfn|Orozco|1995}} Orozco alleges, with reference to Gadamer's published works, that Gadamer had supported the Nazis more than scholars had supposed. Gadamer scholars have rejected these assertions: [[Jean Grondin]] has said that Orozco is engaged in a "witch-hunt"{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=165}} while Donatella Di Cesare said that "the archival material on which Orozco bases her argument is actually quite negligible".{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=30}} Cesare and Grondin have argued that there is no trace of [[antisemitism]] in Gadamer's work, and that Gadamer maintained friendships with Jews and provided shelter for nearly two years for the philosopher [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] in 1933 and 1934.{{sfn|Grondin|2003|pp=153–154}} Gadamer also reduced his contact with Heidegger during the Nazi era.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|pp=14–15}}

The communist [[German Democratic Republic|DDR]] was no more to Gadamer's liking than the [[Third Reich]], and he left for West Germany, accepting first a position in [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] and then the succession of [[Karl Jaspers]] in the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1949. He remained in this position, as emeritus, until his death in 2002 at the age of 102.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A35910-2002Mar15 | title=Hans-Georg Gadamer Dies; Noted German Philosopher | accessdate=March 25, 2011 | date=March 16, 2002 | work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/18/guardianobituaries.obituaries | title=Hans-Georg Gadamer | accessdate=March 25, 2011 | author=Roberts, Julian | date=March 18, 2002 | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent_obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hansgeorg-gadamer-729860.html | title=Hans-Georg Gadamer | accessdate=March 25, 2011 | date=March 26, 2002 | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an Editorial Advisor of the journal [[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.dal.ca/Journals/Dionysius/Editorial_Board.php|title=Department of Classics|website=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that he completed his ''magnum opus'', ''Truth and Method'' (1960), and engaged in his famous debate with [[Jürgen Habermas]] over the possibility of transcending history and culture in order to find a truly objective position from which to critique society. The debate was inconclusive, but marked the beginning of warm relations between the two men. It was Gadamer who secured Habermas's first professorship in the University of Heidelberg.

In 1968, Gadamer invited [[Tomonobu Imamichi]] for lectures at Heidelberg, but their relationship became very cool after Imamichi alleged that Heidegger had taken his concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' out of [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das in-der-Welt-sein'' (to be in the [[being in the world]]) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.&lt;ref name="Imamichi"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tomonobu |last=Imamichi |title=In Search of Wisdom.

In 1981, Gadamer attempted to engage with [[Jacques Derrida]] at a conference in Paris but it proved less enlightening because the two thinkers had little in common. A last meeting between Gadamer and Derrida was held at the Stift of Heidelberg in July 2001, coordinated by Derrida's students Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This meeting marked, in many ways, a turn in their philosophical encounter. After Gadamer's death, Derrida called their failure to find common ground one of the worst debacles of his life and expressed, in the main obituary for Gadamer, his great personal and philosophical respect. [[Richard J. Bernstein]] said that "[a] genuine dialogue between Gadamer and Derrida has never taken place. This is a shame because there are crucial and consequential issues that arise between hermeneutics and deconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Richard J. Bernstein|chapter=Hermeneutics, Critical Theory and Deconstruction|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gadamer received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Bamberg]], the [[University of Breslau]], [[Boston College]], [[Charles University in Prague]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], the [[University of Leipzig]], the [[University of Marburg]] (1999) the [[University of Ottawa]], [[Saint Petersburg State University]] (2001), the [[University of Tübingen]] and [[University of Washington]].{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=27}}

On February 11, 2000, the [[University of Heidelberg]] celebrated Gadamer's one hundredth birthday with a ceremony and conference. Gadamer's last academic engagement was in the summer of 2001 at an annual symposium on hermeneutics that two of Gadamer's American students had organised. On March 13, 2002, Gadamer died at Heidelberg's University Clinic at the age of 102.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/fdomauricio/Gadamer.htm |title=Hans-Georg Gadamer, 1900-2002 |last=Marucio |first=Fernando |access-date=21 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018215428/http://geocities.com/fdomauricio/Gadamer.htm |archive-date=18 October 2009 |language=es |work=Geocities}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the Köpfel cemetery in [[Ziegelhausen]].{{sfn|Cesare|2007|pp=27–28}}

==Work==

===Philosophical hermeneutics and ''Truth and Method''===
Gadamer's philosophical project, as explained in ''[[Truth and Method]]'', was to elaborate on the concept of "[[Hermeneutics|philosophical hermeneutics]]", which Heidegger initiated but never dealt with at length. Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer argued that "truth" and "method" were at odds with one another. For Gadamer, "the experience of art is exemplary in its provision of truths that are inaccessible by scientific methods, and this experience is projected to the whole domain of human sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2016), "The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity," Lexington Books, {{ISBN|978-1498524568}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of two approaches to the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en''). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modeled themselves on the natural sciences, which simply sought to “objectively” observe and analyze texts and art. On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approaches to the humanities, represented for instance by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who believed that meaning, as an object, could be found within a text through a particular process that allowed for a connection with the author’s thoughts that led to the creation of a text (Schleiermacher),&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. "The Hermeneutics: Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 5;10.&lt;/ref&gt; or the situation that led to an expression of human inner life (Dilthey).&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 98. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gadamer argued meaning and understanding are not objects to be found through certain methods, but are inevitable phenomena.&lt;ref name="Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 163"&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 163. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hermeneutics is not a process in which an interpreter finds a particular meaning, but “a philosophical effort to account for understanding as an ontological—the ontological—process of man.”&lt;ref name="Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 163"/&gt;  Thus, Gadamer is not giving a prescriptive method on how to understand, but rather he is working to examine how understanding, whether of texts, artwork, or experience, is possible at all.  Gadamer intended ''Truth and Method'' to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): "My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing".&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Method 2nd ed. Sheed and Ward, London 1989 XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of [[Martin Heidegger]]’s temporal analysis of human existence, Gadamer argued that people have a so-called historically-effected [[consciousness]] (''wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein''), and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. However the historical consciousness is not an object over and against our existence, but “a stream in which we move and participate, in every act of understanding.”&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, people do not come to any given thing without some form of preunderstanding established by this historical stream.  The tradition in which an interpreter stands establishes "prejudices" that affect how he or she will make interpretations. For Gadamer, these prejudices are not something that hinders our ability to make interpretations, but are both integral to the reality of being, and “are the basis of our being able to understand history at all.”&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 182. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gadamer criticized Enlightenment thinkers for harboring a "prejudice against prejudices".&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Francisco J, “Dialectic and Dialogue in the Hermeneutics of Paul Ricouer and H.G. Gadamer,” ''Continental Philosophy Review'', 39 (2006), 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Gadamer, interpreting a text involves a [[fusion of horizons]] (''Horizontverschmelzung'').  Both the text and the interpreter find themselves within a particular historical tradition, or “horizon.”  Each horizon is expressed through the medium of language, and both text and interpreter belong to and participate in history and language.  This “belongingness” to language is the common ground between interpreter and text that makes understanding possible.  As an interpreter seeks to understand a text, a common horizon emerges.  This fusion of horizons does not mean the interpreter now fully understands some kind of objective meaning, but is “an event in which a world opens itself to him.”&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 209. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result is a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Gadamer further explains the hermeneutical experience as a dialogue.  To justify this, he uses [[Plato#The dialogues|Plato’s dialogues]] as a model for how we are to engage with written texts.  To be in conversation, one must take seriously “the truth claim of the person with whom one is conversing.”&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Francisco J, “Dialectic and Dialogue in the Hermeneutics of Paul Ricouer and H.G. Gadamer,” ''Continental Philosophy Review'', 39 (2006), 322-323.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, each participant in the conversation relates to one another insofar as they belong to the common goal of understanding one another.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez, Francisco J 2006"&gt;Gonzalez, Francisco J, “Dialectic and Dialogue in the Hermeneutics of Paul Ricouer and H.G. Gadamer,” ''Continental Philosophy Review'', 39 (2006), 323.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, for Gadamer, the most important dynamic of conversation as a model for the interpretation of a text is “the give-and-take of question and answer.”&lt;ref name="Gonzalez, Francisco J 2006"/&gt;  In other words, the interpretation of a
given text will change depending on the questions the interpreter asks of the
text. The "meaning" emerges not as an object that lies in the text or in the interpreter, but rather an event that results from the interaction of the two.

''Truth and Method'' was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's Collected Works includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on [[Paul Celan|Celan]] (entitled "Who Am I and Who Are You?") has been considered by many—including Heidegger and Gadamer himself—as a "second volume" or continuation of the argument in ''Truth and Method''.

====Contributions to communication ethics====
Gadamer's ''Truth and Method'' has become an authoritative work in the [[communication ethics]] field, spawning several prominent ethics theories and guidelines.  The most profound of these is the formulation of the dialogic coordinates, a standard set of prerequisite communication elements necessary for inciting dialogue.  Adhering to Gadamer's theories regarding bias, communicators can better initiate dialogic transaction, allowing biases to merge and promote mutual understanding and learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Communication Ethics Literacy: Dialogue and Difference Arnett, Harden Fritz &amp; Bell, Los Angeles 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Gadamer also added philosophical substance to the notion of human health. In ''The Enigma of Health'', Gadamer explored what it means to heal, as a patient and a provider. In this work the practice and art of medicine are thoroughly examined, as is the inevitability of any cure.&lt;ref name="Dostal-intro"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Robert J. Dostal|chapter=Introduction|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work in hermeneutics, Gadamer is also well known for a long list of publications on Greek philosophy. Indeed, while ''Truth and Method'' became central to his later career, much of Gadamer's early life centered around studying Greek thinkers, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] specifically. In the Italian introduction to ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer said that his work on Greek philosophy was "the best and most original part" of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gadamer: A Philosophical Portrait|author=Donatella Di Cesare|others=Niall Keane (trans.)|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253007636|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Plato's Dialectical Ethics'' looks at the ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue through the lens of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref name="Dostal-intro" /&gt;

'''Kalanidhi Narayanan''' (7 December 1928 – 21 February 2016) was an Indian dancer and teacher of [[Indian classical dance]] form of [[Bharatnatyam]], who was the early non-[[devadasi]] girl to learn the dance form and perform it on stage in the 1930s and 1940s. After a brief career in the 1940s, she returned to dance in 1973 and became a notable teacher of ''[[abhinaya]]''.&lt;ref name=lo&gt;{{cite web |title=Padmabhushan Kalanidhi Narayanan Talks To Lokvani|url=http://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=1142 |date=2 February 2003|work=Lokvani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hin03/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exploration of expressions|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/01/25/stories/2008012551100300.htm |date=25 January 2008|publisher=''The Hindu''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]] Award, India's third highest civilian honour in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Padma Awards Directory (1954-2009) |publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] |url=http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/LST-PDAWD.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510095705/http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/LST-PDAWD.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]] for Bharatnatyam in 1990, given by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm |title=SNA: List of Akademi Awardees |publisher=[[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217185616/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kalidas Samman]] (1998). She was also conferred  [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Tagore Ratna]] for Dance in 2011.


==Early life and training==
Born Kalanidhi Ganapathi &lt;ref name=Shea197/&gt; in the [[Brahmin]] household of Sumitra and Ganapati, her mother was keen on getting her dance education, and this was supported by her father. Thus starting at the age of seven she trained intensively under various gurus, this included Kamakshi Ammal, daughter of Veena Dhanam, for Padams and Javalis and Manakkal Sivarajan for vocal lessons. Noted guru Kannappa Pillai, from [[Kanchipuram]] was her main teacher of ''nritta'' (dance), he was also teacher to [[Balasaraswati]], while Chinnayya Naidu and Mylapore Gauri Ammal taught her ''[[Abhinaya]]'' (Art of expression). Later was to add a new dimension to ''abhinaya'' herself.&lt;ref name=lo/&gt;

She made her stage-debut ([[Arangetram]]) at the age of 12 at the [[University of Madras#Senate House|Senate House]] in Chennai, for the [[Madras Music Academy]].&lt;ref name=Shea197&gt;[[#Sh|O'Shea, p. 175]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nar/&gt; While still in her teens, she gave to two notable recitals, one with Dhanamanikkam and another with Nattuvanar K. Ganesan, son of the Kandappa Pillai.&lt;ref name=hin03/&gt;

She died in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Bharatanatyam-exponent-Kalanidhi-Narayanan-dies-aged-87/articleshow/51088402.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She had a brief dance career in the 1940s, before she stepped out at the age of sixteen when her mother died and she was married into a conservative family. She returned to dance when in 1973, when noted art-patron, Y. G. Doraiswamy, who had seen her performances as a teen, asked to instruct dancer [[Alarmel Valli]] in ''abhinaya'', to which she agreed, encouraged by her sons who had by now grown up. This started the second phase of her career after a gap of 30 years at the age of 46. She also started to reeducate herself in dance, luckily her books from her my younger days had survived, she started attending dance performances and ''[[Arangetram]]'' in the city, also enrolled in a course on dance theory on Bharatanatyam by Dr. Padma Subramanium..Gradually more students started coming to her and in the coming decades she became "the most sought after teacher for ''abhinaya''".&lt;ref name=lo/&gt;&lt;ref name=hin03&gt;{{cite news |title=Guru par excellence |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2003/12/05/stories/2003120501650400.htm |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=5 December 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 7 December 2003, various dance teachers and her disciples, celebrated her 75th birthday at Luz Community Hall in Chennai, it was marked by a two-day seminar on abhinaya, where in prominent gurus of Bharatanatyam participated. On the occasion, a set of 4 CDs on ''Padams''was also released.&lt;ref name=hin03/&gt;&lt;ref name=nar&gt;{{cite web |title=Ageless: the face of abhinaya |url=http://www.narthaki.com/info/reviews/rev161.html |date=14 December 2003 |work=narthaki }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Disciples==
Amongst her noted disciples are, A.Lakshmanaswamy (India), Bragha Basel (India), Subashree Narayanan (USA), Minal Prabhu (India), Priya Govind (India), &lt;ref name=lo/&gt; [[Sharmila Biswas]],&lt;ref name="sna"&gt;{{cite web |title=Katha Kavya Abhinaya |url=http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/RabindraPranati2011/sharmila-biswas.html |year=2011 |publisher=Sangeet Natak Akademi |accessdate=28 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927144520/http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/RabindraPranati2011/sharmila-biswas.html |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Meenakshi Chitharanjan]] (''abhinaya''), [[:ru:Милана_Северская_(Мандира)|Milana Severskaya]] (Russia)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milana-art.ru/html/rus/biogr.html|title=Домашняя страница Миланы Северской|website=www.milana-art.ru|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.&lt;ref name="Life’s dancing lessons"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/lifes-dancing-lessons/article5684655.ece | title=Life’s dancing lessons | publisher=The Hindu | date=13 February 2014 | accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has taught numerous disciples over the years, many of whom have personalised her philosophies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2313">The '''Korea Physics Olympiad (KPhO)''' is a [[physics]] competition held by the [[Korean Physical Society]] for middle and high school students.

== History ==
In 2010, KPhO changed to the form of General Physics Communication Education I and II, selecting the candidates for winter school by disguising it as providing [[Advanced Placement|AP]] courses. As of 2018, there exists a general physical course that includes [[calculus]] and one that does not. The first one is usually for science students; 55 are selected for winter school. The second is for students not in a science high school; 25 students are selected for this program.

== Business Background ==
In order to perform well in the International Physics Olympiad, the Korean Physical Society holds the Korean Physical Olympiad, and through the operation of the winter school, KPS discovers gifted students and educates them to contribute to the development of [[mathematics]], [[science]], and engineering in [[South Korea]]. Also, the Physics Olympiad Committee was established under the Korean Physical Society to select Korean students to be dispatched to the [[International Physics Olympiad]] competition every year, to supervise their education, and to participate in the international competition. The Physics Olympiad is supported by the Korea Science and Technology Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the beginning of the twenty first century, the term '''language coaching''' started to become used more and more in the field of [[Language_education|language teaching and language learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrios Thanasoulas (2002) 'The changing winds and shifting sands of the history of English Language Teaching' Online at EnglishClub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Corballis (2006) 'White Paper' Online at Corballis Communication Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, language coaching encompasses the teaching and training of foreign languages but incorporates principles, models and competences from the field of [[life coaching]]. These principles, competences and models may originate from coaching organisations themselves such as the [http://www.coachfederation.org/ International Coach Federation] in the USA or from particular coaching models or practices such as [[GROW_model|GROW]].

Thus, the whole process behind life coaching, such as goal setting, action and strategy setting, reviewing goals and really getting coachees to focus on personal development and accomplish feats step by step is then transported into the language learning process. 

The development of language coaching in the language teaching world is on the rise and more and more language teachers appear to be calling themselves language coaches. It is often difficult to distinguish between unqualified language teachers, qualified language teachers, language teachers with a specialization such as ESP ([[English for Specific Purposes]]) and now language coaches. It is also not clear if so called language coaches have any coaching qualifications or experience as life coaches. 

'''Neurolanguage Coaching''' 

In 2012, Rachel Marie Paling from Efficient Language Coaching™ defined Neurolanguage Coaching as follows:

“''Neurolanguage Coaching™ is the efficient and fast transfer of language knowledge and skills from the Language Coach to the Language Coachee with sustainable effects facilitated by brain-based coaching and coaching principles and [[neuroscience]]''.” 
© 2012 Rachel M. Paling&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagecoachingcertification.com/language-coaching&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paling wrote an article to distinguish the differences between language coaching and language teaching&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagecoachingcertification.com/differences-language-teaching-and-language-coaching&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, and this was echoed in the article by Dimitris Zeppos in a table demonstrating the principal differences between language teaching and language coaching:

In the last two years, Paling has clarified and clearly delineated the field of Language Coaching and Neurolanguage Coaching and created a Language Coaching Certification for already qualified language teachers to enhance their expertise with coaching training and with the knowledge of neuroscience and how the brain likes to learn. A study regarding the profile of such neurolanguage coaches in the world has recently been conducted by Dimitris Zeppos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciedu.ca/wje World Journal of Education Vol. 4, No. 6; 2014 Published by Sciedu Press 30 ISSN 1925-0746 E-ISSN 1925-0754&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monika Barz ''' (born 5 April 1953) was Professor for Women and Gender Studies at the [[:de:Evangelische Hochschule Ludwigsburg|Protestant University of applied sciences Ludwigsburg (''"Evangelische Hochschule"'')]] in [[Ludwigsburg]] between 1993 and 2016.   She is known in Germany as a pioneering campaigner for [[feminism|feminist causes]], including [[LGBT social movements|lesbian rights]].&lt;ref name=MBlautEHL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eh-ludwigsburg.de/hochschule/personenverzeichnis/einzelansicht/personregister/show/RegisterPerson/49190-monika-barz.html|title=Prof'in Dr'in Monika Barz  ...

==Life==
Monika Barz was born in [[Castrop-Rauxel]], near [[Dortmund]].   Her early training was in [[Mathematics]] and in Sports Education, after which she became a lower and middle school teacher.   She studied for her degree level teaching qualification at the [[University of Tübingen]].&lt;ref name=MBlautEHL/&gt;   She then received her doctorate&lt;ref name=MBlautRB/&gt; from the [[University of Hanover]] with a dissertation concerned with the situations of lesbian women in the churches.

After this, based in [[Loccum]] (to the north of [[Hanover]]) she spent many years working in adult education and women's education, also involving herself in local politics.&lt;ref name=MBlautEHL/&gt;   She became involved in the [[:de:Frauenbewegung in Deutschland|German women's movement]].   She was a co-founder of the [[Women's shelter|Women's refuge]] in [[Tübingen]]&lt;ref name=MBlautRB/&gt; and of an emergency helpline for assaulted women operated from [[Nienburg, Lower Saxony|Nienburg/Weser]].   In 1985 she joined with  {{Interlanguage link multi|Herta Leistner|de}} and Ute Wild to organise what became the first of a succession of annual lesbian meetings at the [[:de:Evangelische Akademie Bad Boll|Evangelical Academy]] in [[Bad Boll]], and was then one of the organisers of the event each year till 1997.&lt;ref name=MBlautKS/&gt;&lt;ref name=LTBBlautHL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ev-akademie-boll.de/fileadmin/res/otg/751005-Uetteroda.pdf|title=20 Jahre Lesbentagungen Bad Boll - International |work=Nationaler und internationaler Kontext|author=Dr. Herta Leistner, Uetteroda| date=2006| publisher=Evangelische Akademie Bad Boll |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Barz, Leistner and Wild published the book "„Hättest Du gedacht, dass wir so viele sind? Lesbische Frauen in der Kirche." (''"Would you have thought that there are so many of us lesbian women in the church?"'').&lt;ref&gt;Monika Barz, Herta Leistner, Ute Wild: Hättest du gedacht, dass wir so viele sind? Lesbische Frauen in der Kirche. {{ISBN|978-3-783-10849-1}}, Stuttgart 1987&lt;/ref&gt;   Taken together, the book and the  [[:de:Evangelische Akademie Bad Boll|annual Bad Boll lesbian meetings]] triggered a response across the German speaking world:  the annual meetings became a protected space in which lesbian churchwomen were able, for the first time, to create networks and collaborative quasi-political structures.   New groupings emerged such as LUK (''"Lesbians and the church"''), the MuM (''"Mary and Martha network"'') in Bad Boll, and later the "Labrystheia" and NKL (''"Network of Catholic Lesbians"'') networks.   In 2012 Monika Barz was herself a co-founder of the LSBTTIQ Baden-Württemberg network which drew together around 100 organisations and initiatives from the [[LGBT]] sector in the region.&lt;ref name=MBlautKS/&gt;

Between 1993 and 2016 Monika Barz was employed as a professor at the [[:de:Evangelische Hochschule Ludwigsburg|Protestant University of applied sciences (''"Evangelische Hochschule"'')]] in [[Ludwigsburg]] where she taught "Theory and Practice of Social Work with Girls and Women".   The focus of her research work was on [[Women's studies|Women's]] and [[Gender studies]].&lt;ref name=MBlautEHL/&gt;

Between 1995 and 2013 she served on the executive  of the [[:de:Deutscher Paritätischer Wohlfahrtsverband|Equality Welfare Association (''"Paritätische Wohlfahrtsverband"'')]] for [[Baden-Württemberg]]:  during 2014 and 2015 she served on its supervisory council.&lt;ref name=MBimSWPR&gt;{{cite web|title=Monika Barz im Landesvorstand bestätigt|url=https://www.swp.de/reutlingen/lokales/reutlingen/personalie-9547306.html|date=29 July 2013|publisher=SÜDWEST PRESSE, Reutlingen|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For her years of commitment and dedication she was honoured in 2016 with the "Golden pin-badge" (''"Goldene Ehrennadel"'').&lt;ref name=MBlautKS/&gt;

==Politics==
From 1985 till 1993 Monika Barz was a local councillor in [[Nienburg, Lower Saxony|Nienburg/Weser]], representing the little known&lt;!---well, aside from the mention in German wiki it doesn't get a lot of "google hits"....---&gt; (even in [[Lower Saxony]]) "Voters' Initiative for Democracy and Environmental Protection" (''"Wähler- und Wählerinnen Initiative für Demokratie und Umweltschutz"'' / WIDU) party.  In 2016 she stood for election to the [[Bundestag]] as a candidate for  the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Green Party]], but it appears to have been her first step into mainstream national politics at this level, and her name was too far down on the party list for her to stand a realistic chance of election.&lt;ref name=MBuB90/&gt;

'''Music education for young children''' is an educational program introducing children in a playful manner to [[singing]], [[Speech communication|speech]], [[music]], motion and [[organology]]. It is a subarea of [[music education]].

== Benefits ==
There are many benefits that [[music]] provides for children as they continue to grow.  The benefits that young children acquire through music include [[social skills]], [[emotional self-regulation|emotional self-regulating]] abilities, cognitive benefits, and physical benefits.  Socially, children have the opportunity to learn how to take turns and play with others while still playing individually, for example a band of little players each playing their instrument but yet looking at the big picture of playing with a group of little friends as well.  Music also allows a smooth transitioning throughout daily activities, whether it be at home or in a classroom setting children get the idea of the following activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Allowing children to play with others, including adults or older siblings also gives them a boost of [[self-esteem]].  Also, different songs show children the different words used for [[emotion]]s and body awareness, as well as extending their vocabulary in general.  Additionally, by extending children’s vocabulary they can also learn of different cultural music and languages, for some the benefit to integrate home within their care-giving setting.  Cognitive benefits also include learning how to count, recognizing sequencing and patterns, [[phonemic awareness]], memorizing different songs for different experiences, and simply memorizing songs and their pace and tone.  Physically, children’s all around [[Gross motor skill|gross]] and [[fine motor skill]]s grow rapidly by learning how to move their body to music, moving their bodies to actions of a song, and as they grow by learning how to hold and play an instrument.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.naeyc.org/files/yc/file/201003/ParlakianWeb0310.pdf|title = Beyond Twinkle, Twinkle Using Music with Infants and Toddlers|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = communityplaythings.com - Learning Through Music: The Support of Brain Research|url = http://www.communityplaythings.com/resources/articles/2006/learning-through-music-the-support-of-brain-research|website = www.communityplaythings.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms and activities ==
Music education for young children is offered privately through classes and music organizations or integrated into educations private and public schools. Activities and classes can start as early as prenatally or newborn &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suzuki Prenatal and Baby Years|url=http://www.suzukiece.com/pages/prenatal_and_baby.htm|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in private education, music programs are often integrated in as early as preschool. Early childhood music education in public school settings widely varies, but music programs have been established in some schools starting in kindergarten even in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juneau, Alaska Music Matters|url=http://juneaumusicmatters.blogspot.ca|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early childhood music education is accomplished through parent or teacher guided interactive play. Prenatal activities can include singing and playing music so that it can be heard in the womb and continued on with newborns. From birth, children can listen to music and observe other children in music classes and participate in tactile and parent assisted activities. With parental assistance, infants can partake in body movement and rhythm exercises to sung songs and recorded music and through play. As these children develop independent motor skills, they progress to doing these activities on their own. Infants and toddlers are often encouraged to sing and explore rhythm through body movements and percussion instruments such as egg shakers, drums, and xylophones. As young children progress, activities can include concepts that introduce counting, solfege, and notation. Some programs then allow for young children to shift easily into more formalized dance and instrumental instruction starting at a very early age.

==Pedagogies of early childhood music education==

Several pedagogies exist which promote specific methods of training young children in music including [[Orff Schulwerk|Orff]], [[Kodály]], [[Dalcroze]], and the [[Suzuki Method]] are among the most widely recognized of these methods. Many of these pedagogies share commonalities such as music and rhythm development through body movements, folk songs, aural training, and belief that music literacy from an early age is beneficial. Each is known for particular characteristics, such as in [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics]] the use of lifelong body movement and expression through music and private instrumental instruction as early as age two in the Suzuki Method. institutions and teachers often use a combination of these pedagogies even if they might be affiliated with only one.

==World music==
Studies done on children who have had a musical background, have shown that it increases brain function as well as brain stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website = brainvolts.northwestern.edu|title = Musicians’ Enhanced Neural Differentiation of Speech Sounds Arises Early in Life: Developmental Evidence from Ages 3 to 30|date = |accessdate = |url=http://www.brainvolts.northwestern.edu/documents/Cereb.%20Cortex-2013-Strait-cercor_bht103.pdf |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When children are exposed to music from other countries and cultures, they are able to learn about the instrument while at the same time being educated about a different part of the world.

'''Nepal Police School''' (abbreviated NPS, formerly Dipendra Police School) is a regional system of police [[boarding schools]] in [[Nepal]]. NPS also typically refers to the first of the schools established, the Nepal Police Higher Secondary Boarding School. Also called the "Central School", it is located in [[Nasiksthan Sanga]], 15 miles east of [[Kathmandu]].

These schools are paid for by the welfare program of the Nepal Police Organization, and provide education to children of police personnel, but will also allow civilian children to attend (up to 40% of the school population).

==Other branches of the school aside from the central school are==

# Nepal Police Boarding High School, [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan]], [[Sunsari District]] (Eastern Regional School), officially and more popularly known as Purwa Chhetriya Police Boarding High School. Also called Eastern Regional Police Boarding High School.
# Nepal Police Boarding High School, [[Belchautara]], [[Tanahu District]] (Western Regional School)
# Nepal Police Boarding High School, [[Gularia, Nepal|Gularia]], [[Dang Deokhuri District]] (Mid-Western Regional School)
# Nepal Police Boarding High School, [[Dhangadhi|Dhangadi]], [[Kailali District]] (Far Western Regional School)
# Nepal Police School (Secondary), [[Samakhusi]], [[Kathmandu District]]
# Mid Regional Police Boarding High School, Jigadhiya, [[Rautahat District]] (Mid Regional School)

==Academics==
The school curriculum is presented primarily in English; however there is also an emphasis on developing skills with both written and oral [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The school follows guidelines set by the Ministry of Education and the Higher Secondary Education Board of Nepal.

Abhijaya Shrestha, who graduated from Purwa Chhetriya Police Boarding High School, Dharan, in 2067 B.S. (2011), was ranked no. 1 in [[Sunsari District]] in the [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|S.L.C. Examination]] of that year.

==Athletics==
Police Schools are also known for their fierce athletic teams, specially in football. The central school at Sanga is known for organizing the IGP Running trophy, an inter-school football tournament. The Eastern school at Dharan used to organize a similar DIG Cup football tournament for schools in the Eastern Development Region of Nepal, but was discontinued after the 2006 season. The Dharan School also has a powerhouse football team in junior boys winning Under-5 Depot Cup several times.

The Nepal footballer [[Bimal Gharti Magar]] attended the Dipendra Police School, he now plays for the [[Nepal national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bimal Gharti Magar and his Sad Past|publisher=Givemegoal.com|date=2013-09-04|url=http://givemegoal.com/np/2013/09/04/bimal-gharti-magar-and-his-sad-past/|accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniform==
Students typically wear light blue shirt, navy blue pants, school issued tie and belt, blue socks and black shoes. Girls may replace navy blue pants with navy blue skirts. Students may also add a navy blue sweater or blazer during winter.

He is particularly known for identifying the characteristics of, and influences on, deep and surface approaches to learning, and developing the ''Approaches to Studying Inventory '' (''ASI'',Entwistle &amp; Ramsden, 1983) and the ''Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students'' (''ASSIST'', Entwistle, McCune &amp; Tait, 2013) . He also developed, with Ference Marton, the idea of 'knowledge objects' as structured understandings developed by students as they prepare for exams or writing essays (Entwistle &amp; Marton, 1994). Entwistle was formerly editor of the British Journal of Education Psychology and also of the international journal Higher Education. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society, has an Oeuvre Award from the European Association for Research in Learning and Instruction, and Honorary Doctorates from the universities of Gothenburg and Turku. He has published many articles in academic journals related to both educational psychology and teaching and learning in higher education, as well as several books including Styles of Learning and Teaching (1981), Understanding Student Learning (1983), Understanding Classroom Learning (1987), and Teaching for Understanding at University (2009).

== Biography ==

Paul Glewwe earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in economics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1979 as well as a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1985, the latter with a doctoral thesis analysing labour markets and the distribution of income in [[Sri Lanka]]. Already prior to graduation, Glewwe began working as a consultant for the [[World Bank]] (1984–85, 86-88), followed by appointments as economist in the World Bank's population and human resources department (1988–93) and as senior economist in its policy research department (1994–99). In parallel, Glewwe worked in various academic positions at [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[George Washington University]] and [[Oxford University]]. Since 1999, he has worked in the Department of Applied Economics of the [[University of Minnesota]], first as assistant professor (1999-2001), then as associate professor (2001–06), and finally as full professor (since 2006). Moreover, since 2013, Paul Glewwe has held the title of Distinguished McKnight University Professor. In terms of professional service, Glewwe is member of the [[American Economic Association|AEA]], [[Econometric Society]], and [[Royal Economic Society]], and has served on the editorial boards of the ''World Bank Economic Review'' (since 2009), ''Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy'' (since 2008), ''[[Journal of African Economies]]'' (since 2011), ''[[Economics of Education Review]]'' (since 2013), and the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apec.umn.edu/sites/apec.umn.edu/files/paul-glewwe-cv.pdf Curriculum vitae of Paul Glewwe on the website of the University of Minnesota.

== Research ==

Glewwe's research generally focuses on the [[education economics|economics of education]], [[poverty]] and [[Economic inequality|inequality]] in [[developing countries]], and [[econometrics|applied econometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.povertyactionlab.org/glewwe Webpage of Paul Glewwe at J-PAL. Retrieved on February 6, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Glewwe belongs to the top 2% of most cited economists as ranked by [[IDEAS/RePEc]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html#pgl14 Ranking of economists by IDEAS/RePEc. Retrieved on February 6, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between health and education ===

One of Glewwe's main research areas concerns the relationship between health and education. For example, he (with Hanan Jacoby) finds early childhood malnutrition - and not borrowing constraints or the rationing of school places - to be the likely cause of delayed enrollment in primary school in [[Ghana]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v77y1995i1p156-69.html Glewwe, P., Jacoby, H. (1995). An Economic Analysis of Delayed Primary School Enrollment in a Low Income Country: The Role of Early Childhood Nutrition. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 77(1), pp. 156-169.]&lt;/ref&gt; and documents (with Hanan Jacoby and Elizabeth M. King) how malnutrition among young children in the [[Philippines]] impairs their academic achievements by delaying the age at which they enroll into school and causing them to learn more slowly, though not by decreasing their effort exerted at school (in terms of attendance, homework, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v81y2001i3p345-368.html Glewwe, P., Jacoby, H.G., King, E.M. (2001). Early childhood nutrition and academic achievement: a longitudinal analysis. ''Journal of Public Economics'', 81(3), pp. 345-368.]&lt;/ref&gt; Looking into the link between child health and maternal education, Glewwe argues based on evidence from [[Morocco]] that mothers' health knowledge, which is generally correlated with (though not necessarily caused by) their schooling, is probably the main pathway how maternal education achieves its strongly positive impact on child health and nutrition in developing countries, which consequently suggests large public health payoffs to female health education in school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/uwp/jhriss/v34y1999i1p124-159.html Glewwe, P. (1999). Why Does Mother's Schooling Raise Child Health in Developing Countries? Evidence from Morocco. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 34(1), pp. 124-159.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of the quality of the supply of education on learning ===

Since the early 2000s, Glewwe has used [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) in order to investigate the impact of the quality of the supply of education, e.g. in terms of school supplies or the quality of teaching, on learning outcomes. For example, Glewwe finds (with [[Michael Kremer]], Sylvie Moulin, and Eric Zitzewitz) that in [[Kenya]] neither the provision of textbooks nor of flipcharts was effective in raising average student scores and that generally only the best students were able to take advantages of the improvement in school supplies. This in turn raises the question of whether the emphasis of many developing countries' (strongly centralized) education systems on top-down improvements to the supply of education may be guided rather by elite bias than by a concern for broad increases in students' learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v74y2004i1p251-268.html Glewwe, P. et al. (2004). Retrospective vs. prospective analyses of school inputs: the case of flip charts in Kenya. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 74(1), pp. 251-268.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejapp/v1y2009i1p112-35.html Glewwe, P., Kremer, M., Moulin, S. (2009). Many Children Left Behind? Textbooks and Test Scores in Kenya. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 1(1), pp. 112-135.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another RCT, Glewwe (with Michael Kremer and Nauman Ilias) finds that rewarding primary school teachers in Kenya based on students' test scores and penalizing them based on their students not attending the exam leads teachers to increase the number of test preparation sessions (but not teacher attendance or homework assignments), which then increases students' test scores and exam participation, but is ineffective in reducing dropout rates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejapp/v2y2010i3p205-27.html Glewwe, P., Ilias, N., Kremer, M. (2010). Teacher Incentives. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 2(3), pp. 205-227.]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier on, having found school characteristics in Ghana to be highly correlated with student achievement, e.g. via average grade attainment, Glewwe (with Hanan Jacoby) had argued that improvements to school quality, such as repairs of classrooms, may be a cost-effective investment into education in Ghana relative to the provision of more teaching materials and better trained teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/uwp/jhriss/v29y1994iii1p843-864.html Glewwe, P., Jacoby, H. (1994). Student Achievement and Schooling Choice in Low-Income Countries: Evidence from Ghana. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 29(1), pp. 843-864.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Returns to schooling, determinants of household vulnerability, and willingness to pay for education ===

Glewwe's other findings include the following:
* That many pre-1990s estimates of [[Mincer earnings function|rates of returns to schooling]] are significantly biased because they fail to account for differences in ability and school quality and, even if accurate, may provide poor guidance to education policy compared to rates of return to investments in school quality;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v51y1996i2p267-290.html Glewwe, P. (1996). The relevance of standard estimates of rates of return to schooling for education policy: A critical assessment. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 51(2), pp. 267-290.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the vulnerability of households in [[Peru]] to welfare decreases during macroeconomic shocks decreases in education and access to foreign transfer networks, increases if households are headed by women or have more children, and is hardly mitigated by Peru's social security programme (with Gillette Hall);&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v56y1998i1p181-206.html Glewwe, P., Hall, G. (1998). Are some groups more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks than others? Hypothesis tests based on panel data from Peru. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 56(1), pp. 181-206.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the willingness to pay for schooling in households in rural Peru is high enough at all income levels to cover the operating costs of new schools in their villages, thus suggesting that increasing school fees to raise revenue for educational improvements in developing countries may be feasible (with [[Paul Gertler]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v42y1990i3p251-275.html Gertler, P., Glewwe, P. (1990). The willingness to pay for education in developing countries: Evidence from rural Peru. ''Journal of Public Economics'', 42(3), pp. 251-275.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on priorities for education policy in developing countries ===

Finally, taking stock of the literature on the supply of education in developing countries, Glewwe (with Michael Kremer) criticizes that, although school enrollment rates have risen rapidly in the developing world between 1960 and 2000, dropout rates remain high and learning outcomes disappointing, and thus argues that the primary policy question should be which policies most effectively improve learning, with RCTs as the preferred tool to conduct that investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/educhp/2-16.html Glewwe, P., Kremer, M. (2006). Schools, Teachers, and Education Outcomes in Developing Countries. In: Hanushek, E., Welch, F. (eds.). ''Handbook of the Economics of Education'' (vol. 2). Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 945-1017.]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Glewwe has emphasized (with [[Karthik Muralidharan]]) that educational spending in developing countries could be much more cost effective, as improvements to pedagogy (e.g. remedial classes for children lagging behind) as well as improvements to school governance and teacher accountability tend to be much more cost effective than mere (yet widespread) increases in "standard" school inputs (e.g. more books); by contrast, interventions aimed at increasing the demand for education by raising students' returns to (or decreasing households' costs of) school enrollment and effort are also generally effective in improving learning outcomes, but vary widely in terms of cost effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444634597000105 Glewwe, P., Muralidharan, K. (2016). Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries: Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications. In: Hanushek, E.A., Machin, S., Woessmann, L. (eds.).

'''Paulo Mendes da Rocha''' (born October 25, 1928 in [[Vitória, Espírito Santo]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[architect]].

Mendes da Rocha attended the [[Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie]] College of Architecture, graduating in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mackenzista.com.br/PDFs/Mack_36_Pags_20e21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Working almost exclusively in Brazil, Mendes da Rocha has been producing buildings since 1957, many of them built in concrete, a method some call "Brazilian Brutalism", arguably allowing buildings to be constructed cheaply and quickly. He has contributed many notable cultural buildings to [[São Paulo, Brazil|São Paulo]] and is widely credited as enhancing and revitalizing the city.

Mendes da Rocha was Professor at the Architecture College of [[University of São Paulo]], known as [[FAU-USP]], until 1998. His work is influenced by Brazilian architect [[Vilanova Artigas]], from the paulist Brazilian School.  He was honored with the [[Mies van der Rohe Prize]] (2000), the [[Pritzker Prize]] (2006) and the  [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Venice Biennale]] Golden Lion for lifetime achievement (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/786934/paulo-mendes-da-rocha-awarded-golden-lion-for-lifetime-achievement-venice-biennale-2016-reporting-from-the-front|title=Paulo Mendes da Rocha Awarded Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement|date=2016-05-06|website=ArchDaily|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Block''' (born 1940) is an American author, consultant, and speaker in the areas of [[organization development]], [[community building]], and [[civic engagement]].

He was born in 1940 to Jewish parents, Ira and Dorothy Block.  He currently resides with his wife, Cathy Kramer, in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, L. "A Conversation with Peter Block".

==Education and career==

Peter Block completed his undergraduate studies in [[Industrial Management]] at the [[University of Kansas]] in 1961 and obtained a Master's degree in Industrial Administration from [[Yale University]] in 1963.

==Work and ideas==

Peter Block's work generally focuses on alternatives to [[patriarchal]] beliefs pervasive in Western [[culture]] and his ideas proffer that cultural change can be brought about through consent and connectedness as opposed through mandate and force.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, R (Ed). "The International Journal of Servant-Leadership". 2006, 2(1):79&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter contends that cultural change is only possible when it is preceded by relationship and connectedness among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, L. "A Conversation with Peter Block". The Canadian Learning Journal, Fall 2010:6&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter is the author and co-author of several books (see Selected Bibliography below).  His most recent, ''The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods (2010)'', is co-authored with John McKnight, emeritus professor of Education and Social Policy at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Northwestern University. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/people/mcknight.html]. Retrieved 4 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  This book is a culmination of Peter's work on community and the cultural change needed for the creation of a more sustainable future.

===Culture and community===

Regarding the changing of cultural beliefs, Peter Block argues that a "culture of accountability" is needed and feasible if attention is diverted away from leaders and refocused on citizens with a commitment towards the creation of a deeper sense of [[community]] and [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Block, P. "Servant Leadership: Creating An Alternative Future". The International Journal of Servant-Leadership, 2006, 2(1):75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirenberg, J. "Singapore Management Review". January 2001. [http://www.allbusiness.com/management/799081-1.html]. Retrieved 6 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter's conceptualization of community is more complex, but he generally connects the term with reality outside of systems and institutions. He also uses the term in reference to an aggregation of people or neighborhoods that have something in common.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, J &amp; Block, P. ''The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods''. 2010, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter builds on [[Robert D. Putnam]]'s ideas around the practical importance inherent in a "sense of community". As Peter explains, a community’s well-being relies on the quality of the relationships and the cohesion that exists among its citizens, known as a community's "social capital".&lt;ref&gt;Block, P. "Community: The Structure of Belonging". 2008, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Peter Block challenges communities and their leaders to transform the isolation, fear, and self-interest prevalent in Western culture into connectedness and caring for the whole by starting with accountability and generosity amongst its members. This is his notion of the "ideal world" where accountability is abundant, commitment is authentic, and a community consciousness is prevalent throughout the global village.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, CK &amp; Meda, AK. “New Horizons for Leadership Research and Practice: Ethical &amp; Global Sustainability”. Midwest Academy of Management Conference Proceedings. [http://www.midwestacademy.org/Proceedings/2004]. Retrieved 8 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship and consumerism===

Peter Block's notion of a citizen is someone accountable and committed to the well-being of the whole&lt;ref&gt;Block, P. ''Community: The Structure of Belonging''. 2008, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; and a participant in a [[democracy]], regardless of their legal status. Peter stated that a citizen is "one who chooses to create the life, the neighborhood, the world from their own gifts and the gifts of others".&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, J &amp; Block, P. ''The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods''. 2010, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, he points to a paradox: in the realization of citizenship today, many who have full citizenship rights wait for others to contribute to their life and yet themselves contribute little to democracy or the well-being of their community. Others without citizenship rights are major contributors to community and democracy. Nevertheless, Peter generally attributes citizenship to those functioning as full participants in a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, J &amp; Block, P. ''The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods''. 2010, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

His conceptualization of a "consumer" might be regarded as more contentious. In his words, "a consumer is one who has surrendered to others the power to provide what is essential for a full and satisfied life" and he goes as far as saying, "Consumerism is not about shopping, but about the transformation of citizens into consumers".&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, J &amp; Block, P. ''The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods''. 2010, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Peter believes there is a growing movement of people who believe that a full and satisfied life is obtained within their communities rather than in the market place.

===Stewardship and service===

Peter Block conceives of "stewardship" as an umbrella term that encapsulates the means towards the achievement of fundamental change in the manner in which we govern institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Block, P. ''Stewardship: Choosing Service Over Self Interest''. 1993, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;  His conceptualization of "service" is more complex.  He argues that service is realized in both the "language of service" and the "experience of service".  The problem however, as he argues, is that we{{Who|date=September 2012}} have the language of service, but lack the experience of it. He attributes this lack to self-interest present in ourselves as well as our institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Block, P. ''Stewardship: Choosing Service Over Self Interest''. 1993, p. xx–xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  He believes service is only truly realized when it is "authentic" and when the following characteristics are present: there is a balance of power; the primary commitment is to the larger community; and there is a balanced and equitable distribution of rewards.

Peter argues that these notions of stewardship and service (see aforementioned definitions) are, however, not characteristic of how organizations are currently being run. He explains that although these notions are reflective of our intentions towards governing, they are not reflective of the reality.&lt;ref&gt;Block, P. ''Stewardship: Choosing Service Over Self Interest''. 1993, p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  Block is regarded as a notable supporter, with others like [[Margaret Wheatley]], [[Max DePree]], and James Autry, of the basic premise inherent "[[Servant leadership|servant-leadership]]" implying that leaders should put the needs of followers ahead of their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;Willis M. Watt. "Facilitative Social Change Leadership Theory: 10 Recommendations toward Effective Leadership". Journal of Leadership Education, 8(2):45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable undertakings==

In collaboration with [[Werner H. Erhard]], Peter Block designed courses and trained clergy and grassroots leaders in transformation skills and perspectives in leadership and integrity to effect peace and reconciliation in the [[Northern Ireland Peace Process]].&lt;ref&gt;Mastery Foundation.

'''Saakshar Bharat''' is a government of [[India]] initiative launched by Prime Minister, Dr. [[Manmohan Singh]] to create a literate society through a variety of teaching learning programmes for non-literate and neo-literate of 15 years and above. It was launched on 8 September 2009 as a centrally sponsored scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Dobyns''' (born February 19, 1941) is an American [[poet]] and [[novelist]] born in [[Orange, New Jersey]], and residing in [[Westerly, RI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/743|title=Stephen Dobyns|first=Stephen|last=Dobyns|date=13 July 2001|website=Stephen Dobyns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Dobyns was born on February 19, 1941 in Orange, New Jersey to Lester L., an Episcopal minister, and Barbara Johnston Dobyns. Dobyns was raised in New Jersey, Michigan, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. He was educated at [[Shimer College]], transferred to and graduated from [[Wayne State University]] in 1964, and received an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1967. He has worked as a reporter for the ''[[Detroit News]]''.

He has taught at various academic institutions, including [[Sarah Lawrence College]], the [[Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers]], the [[University of Iowa]], [[Syracuse University]], and [[Boston University]].

In 1995, as a professor of English at [[Syracuse University]], he was involved in a [[sexual harassment]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Bill|title=Once upon a time|url=http://dailyorange.com/2007/11/once-upon-a-time/|accessdate=September 18, 2012|newspaper=The Daily Orange|date=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francine Prose]] defended him by portraying his accuser and the school as having reacted to outdated neo-[[Victorian morality|Victorian]] [[victim feminism|victim-feminism]] policies.

In much of his poetry and some works of non-genre fiction, Dobyns employs extended tropes, using the ridiculous and the absurd as vehicles to introduce more profound meditations on life, love, and art. He shies neither from the low nor from the sublime, and all in a straightforward narrative voice of reason. His journalistic training has strongly informed this voice.

For example, in the poem "Missed Chances" in ''Cemetery Nights'', the nameless speaker wanders through a metaphorical city in which those who missed their big opportunities futilely rehearse for opportunity's next arrival.

His poetic works count among them the 1971 [[Lamont Poetry Selection]] (''Concurring Beasts''), a [[National Poetry Series]] award winner (''Black Dog, Red Dog''), and a Melville Cane Award winner (''Cemetery Nights'').

Dobyns has written many detective stories about a private detective named Charlie Bradshaw who works out of Saratoga Springs in upstate New York. Bradshaw is unusual as a private eye protagonist, an ordinary man who was once a police officer. All the books have the word "Saratoga" in the title.

In the comic novel ''The Wrestler's Cruel Study'', the protagonist roams through a modern cityscape governed by fairy-tale rituals, searching for his missing fiancée. He is alternately aided or hindered by a Friedrich Nietzsche -quoting manager and his Hegelian nemesis, to find that his wrestling matches are choreographed by a shadowy organization that enacts their various [[Gnostic]] theological debates through the pageantry and panoply of the ring. He eventually learns to resolve his own dualistic nature and determine who he is despite the role he plays.

''Cold Dog Soup'' has been made into two films, the American ''Cold Dog Soup'' and the French ''Doggy Bag''. ''Two Deaths of Señora Puccini'' has been made into the film ''Two Deaths''. The movie ''Wild Turkey'' is based on one of his short stories.

''The Church of Dead Girls'' is a novel about a small town's hysterical response to the mysterious disappearance of three of its teenaged girls.

''Boy in the Water'' is a novel about events in a secluded private school in the United States.

Jenny Hilborne, wrote in ''New York Journal of Books'' that ''The Burn Palace'' "is an intriguing fictional mystery set in the town of Brewster, Rhode Island, and includes elements of the supernatural, satanism, and other alternate religions, including neo-pagans, Wicca, and witchcraft...mysterious and engaging . . .”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/burn-palace|title=a book review by Jenny Hilborne: The Burn Palace|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Is Fat Bob Dead Yet?'' was named one of ''Publishers Weekly'''s Best Mysteries of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://best-books.publishersweekly.com/pw/best-books/2015/mystery#book/book-4|title=Best Books of 2015 - Publishers Weekly Publishers Weekly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Her [[debut novel]], ''[[A Crime in the Neighborhood]]'', won Great Britain's prestigious [[Orange Prize]]. Told through the eyes of a ten-year-old girl, the book chronicles a child's murder in a sleepy suburb of [[Washington, D.C.]] against the backdrop of the unfolding [[Watergate]] scandal. ''A Perfect Arrangement'' tells of the complex and increasingly disturbing relationship between a normal suburban family and their exceptionally perfect nanny.  ''The Ghost at the Table'' explores the dramatic territory between two sisters' differing versions of their shared history.

'''text+work''' is the ethos behind [[The Arts University Bournemouth]]’s Gallery programme, and underpins the exhibitions presented at the Gallery since 2003.

text+work states that its aim is to provide a forum for the meeting of practitioners, writers and curators to discuss and push the boundaries the relationship between contemporary art practice and design and discourse—be it critical, experimental, fictional, poetic, or historical.

Each text+work project consists of an exhibition (work) and an accompanying publication (text). The text+work concept is core to The Arts University Bournemouth’s Gallery underpinnings and ethos, and was initially developed by the Gallery’s Research Committee in 2003 as a means of discussing the theoretical contexts surrounding respective different art practices.

Its first exhibition presented under this concept was ‘[[Four Quartets]] Series’ by [[Ian McKeever (artist)|Ian McKeever]] and [[David Miller (artist)|David Miller]]. It has since hosted 35 exhibitions (November 2003–April 2010). In 2008, the Gallery added music to its repertoire, and has so far included the [[Goldberg Variations]], performed by [[David Wright (British musician)|David Wright]], and From Experimentalism to Minimalism, performed by Kokoro, as part of [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]].

One of the main aims of text+work is to make the exhibitions / publications available to a wider audience who might not be able to visit the gallery. It does this through the distribution of the accompanying publications (text), both as hard copies and as e-publications, and through the virtual gallery space on its website.

Alongside the text+work concept, the Gallery also runs a programme of touring exhibitions. This has included FACING EAST: Contemporary Landscape Photography from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], which was curated by Liz Wells in 2004 and A SHORT GRAND TOUR by Professor Simon Olding + Jim Hunter.

In 2007, text+work partnered up with ArtSway on an Arts and Humanities Research Council funded project, teaming up to present two seminars at the 52nd [[Venice Biennale]], 2007, and again at the 53rd Venice Biennale in 2009. Since 2007, text+work, The Arts University Bournemouth and ArtSway have continued to collaborate, resulting is publications and projects including B.OK by [[Nathaniel Mellors]] and Family Village by [[Dinu Li]].

Other collaborators have included the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, the [[Norwich Gallery]], Birmingham Libraries, The Study Gallery, Impressions Gallery, Poole Photography Festival, TRACE, ROLLO Contemporary, Wolverhampton University and Winchester Discovery Centre, and it hosted the [[Jerwood Drawing Prize]] in 2006.

Past artists have included former [[Turner Prize]] winner, [[Grenville Davey]], [[Royal Academicians]] Ian McKeever and [[Frank Bowling]], 16 artists from the Baltic area as part of the FACING EAST exhibition, up and coming artists including [[Dinu Li]] and [[Eric Butcher]]. It also supports the university’s academic staff through research.

Past writers have included, amongst others, Susan Bright, curator and author; [[Luce Irigaray]], [[feminist]] and culture theorist; Professor Simon Olding, Director of [[Crafts Study Centre]], [[University for the Creative Arts]], [[Farnham]]; and David Bate, author of ‘Photography and Surrealism’ (2004).

{{Other uses of|TREC|TREC (disambiguation)}}
The '''Text REtrieval Conference''' ('''TREC''') is an ongoing series of [[workshop]]s focusing on a list of different [[information retrieval]] (IR) research areas, or ''tracks.'' It is co-sponsored by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity]] (part of the office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]]), and began in 1992 as part of the [[DARPA TIPSTER Program|TIPSTER Text program]]. Its purpose is to support and encourage research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large-scale ''evaluation'' of [[text retrieval]] methodologies and to increase the speed of lab-to-product [[technology transfer|transfer of technology]].

Each track has a challenge wherein NIST provides participating groups with data sets and test problems. Depending on track, test problems might be questions, topics, or target extractable [[Features (pattern recognition)|features]]. Uniform scoring is performed so the systems can be fairly evaluated. After evaluation of the results, a workshop provides a place for participants to collect together thoughts and ideas and present current and future research work.

== Tracks ==

===Current tracks===

In 1997, a Japanese counterpart of TREC was launched (first workshop in 1999), called [http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ NTCIR] ([[National Institute of Informatics|NII]] Test Collection for IR Systems), and in 2000, [[CLEF]], a European counterpart, specifically vectored towards the study of cross-language information retrieval was launched.

== Conference contributions to search effectiveness==

NIST claims that within the first six years of the workshops, the effectiveness of retrieval systems approximately doubled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trec.nist.gov/overview.html From TREC homepage: "... effectiveness approximately doubled in the first six years of TREC"]&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was also the first to hold large-scale evaluations of non-English documents, speech, video and retrieval across languages. Additionally, the challenges have inspired a large body of [http://trec.nist.gov/pubs.html publications]. Technology first developed in TREC is now included in many of the world's commercial [[search engine]]s.  An independent report by RTII found that "about one-third of the improvement in web search engines from 1999 to 2009 is attributable to TREC. Those enhancements likely saved up to 3 billion hours of time using web search engines. ... Additionally, the report showed that for every $1 that NIST and its partners invested in TREC, at least $3.35 to $5.07 in benefits were accrued to U.S. information retrieval researchers in both the private sector and academia."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rti.org/page.cfm?objectid=75E125DC-5056-B100-31A5A6BDE897DE6D |title=NIST Investment Significantly Improved Search Engines |publisher=Rti.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118194352/http://rti.org/page.cfm?objectid=75E125DC-5056-B100-31A5A6BDE897DE6D |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report10-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While one study suggests that the state of the art for ad hoc search has not advanced substantially in the past decade,&lt;ref&gt;Timothy G. Armstrong, Alistair Moffat, William Webber, Justin Zobel.  Improvements that don't add up: ad hoc retrieval results since 1998.  CIKM 2009.  ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; it is referring just to search for topically relevant documents in small news and web collections of a few gigabytes.  There have been advances in other types of ad hoc search in the past decade.  For example, test collections were created for known-item web search which found improvements from the use of anchor text, title weighting and url length, which were not useful techniques on the older ad hoc test collections.  In 2009, a new billion-page web collection was introduced, and spam filtering was found to be a useful technique for ad hoc web search, unlike in past test collections.

The test collections developed at TREC are useful not just for (potentially) helping researchers advance the state of the art, but also for allowing developers of new (commercial) retrieval products to evaluate their effectiveness on standard tests.  In the past decade, TREC has created new tests for enterprise e-mail search, genomics search, spam filtering, e-Discovery, and several other retrieval domains.

TREC systems often provide a baseline for further research.  Examples include:

The history of information retrieval illustrates this principle well," and describes TREC's contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-data-matters.html Why Data Matters]&lt;/ref&gt;
* TREC's Legal track has influenced the e-Discovery community both in research and in evaluation of commercial vendors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.the451group.com/information_management/2009/01/29/standards-in-e-discovery-%E2%80%93-walking-the-walk/ The 451 Group: Standards in e-Discovery -- walking the walk]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fairground Park Riot''' was a [[Ethnic conflict|race riot]] that broke out on June 21, 1949 at a newly integrated public swimming pool.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;Eddie Silva, "The Longest Day," Riverfront Times,  October 25, 2016, http://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/the-longest-day/Content?oid=2469321&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Swimmers at Fairgrounds Park swimming pool.jpg|thumb|Swimmers at Fairground Park swimming pool, 1920s]]
The Fairground Pool, in St. Louis [[Missouri]], was one of the largest pools in the [[American Midwest]] measuring 440 feet. The pool was able to hold from 10,000 to 12,000 swimmers at a time.&lt;ref&gt;"June 21, 1949-Race Riot Over Pool Integration in St. Louis Missouri,"legallegacy.worldpress.com, last modified June 21, 2016, https://legallegacy.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/june-21-1949-race-riot-over-pool-integration-in-st-louis-missouri/&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period much of the country was suffering from segregation. Missouri was among one of the states that was still segregated. Pickets had been put up at the Fairground Park to protest the segregation of pools. At the time; however, the federal law did not support segregation of public facilities.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; O'Toole, who at the time made the decision regarding the pools and parks, realized that the pools could not continue to be segregated. He said, "I can't oppose anyone from lawfully using a swimming pool. They are taxpayers and citizens, too."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; On June 21, 1949, African Americans were allowed access to the city pool for the first time. Until that day, the Fairground Park swimming pool was only open to white patrons. On the first day that it was open to African Americans too, only 30 to 40 African Americans showed up. They swam alongside white children without any problem until a group of white teenagers surrounded the fence that enclosed the pool and began to shout threats to the African American swimmers. The black children had to be taken to a changing room until they could be escorted out by police. Some eye witness reports contradict each other some saying that the children were not placed in harm's way, while others say that the police escorts did not stop the white teenagers from physically attacking the black children. Some witnesses reported that by 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day the crowd escalated to several hundred and of those people only 20 to 30 were African American. The riot escalated rapidly when a rumor got around that a black man had killed a white man. The black boys were surrounded by the white boys who had arrived with baseball bats. It appeared that one of the boys even had a knife. One of the African American children was beat until an officer fell on top of him to stop the white child from attacking him.  By now, the crowd had turned into thousands. Approximately 150 police officers were at the scene. By 10 o'clock that night, the situation mellowed down; however, the crowd did not fully disappear until after midnight. To avoid another eruption, the mayor decided that the best decision would be to segregate the pools again.&lt;ref name=Phillip&gt;Phillip O'Connor, "Pool riot pivotal in race relations City's decision in '49 to integrate swimming pools sparked violence that triggered change." St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 21, 2009, http://www.stltoday.com/news/pool-riot-pivotal-in-race-relations-city-s-decision-in/article_914ec52e-4be8-5b09-ac98-e71da7160cc6.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in 1950, it was ordered by the federal court to integrate the pools of St. Louis.

== Through Robert Gammon &amp; J.C. Tobias Eyes ==
When the race riot occurred, Robert Gammon was only a teenager. All he wanted to do wash cool down at the Fairground Park swimming pool. Sixty years later, he can still remember the fear he endured. He remembers the taunts, the bricks, and the fights. When he heard the radio announcement that the pool would be open for blacks as well, he did not think it would cause such backlash. For the longest time, all he wanted to do was swim in the outdoor pool that had the wooden diving platform. However, he had never experienced such fear as he did when he headed home that night. When he along with the other black kids were escorted to the changing room, he remembers a white woman spitting at him. Once the police escorts separated, Gammon and his friends were chased by whites to St. Louis Avenue before giving up. He even recalls one of his friends getting hit in the head by a brick that was thrown at him. After the riot, he felt that it would be a long time before he could trust white people again. He said, "I thought all white people hated us."&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; To this day Gammon cannot understand why the riot happened. He wonders, "Just because I'm black?" He remembers the crowds continuing to get larger and larger as the day went on and more fights kept breaking out. Time magazine published an article about the riot in the days following the riot and described the scene as, "Negro boys were chased and beaten by white gangs. In the gathering dusk, one grown-up rabble-rouser spoke out. 'Want to know how to take care of those niggers?' he shouted. 'Get bricks. Smash their heads, the dirty, filthy "-".'" &lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; Years later Gammon visited the Fairground Park and leaned against the fence that once had enclosed the original pool. As the years have gone by, he does not see race the same way. He does not continue to hold the belief that all whites hate him; however, he does wish that the whole incident would have never happened. In his eyes, he sees things are better nowadays, but the issue is still prevalent and there is still progress to be made.  J.C. Tobias recalls being chased by a mob of white teenagers when he and some friends were walking back home from the park's baseball diamond. He said, "When you're a kids, you don't think much about it. As you age, you realize it didn't make much sense. We were just up there to swim."&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; J.C. Tobias was just a teenager when the riot occurred and sixty years later he still has a vivid recollection of the event.

== The Other Side ==
Star-Times' also made a report about the riot. The report included what one middle-aged man at the riot said. According to the report, the man said, "Kill a nigger and make a name for yourself," the other man said.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; "Kill the black bastards." &lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Star Times' even included a photograph of white mothers carrying their young children along with them to miss the excitement. White teenagers went around with their weapons. They carried with them baseball bats and broom sticks. One reporter stated that they overheard one of the white teenagers say, "This is a waiting party. Waiting until it gets dark," and another white teenager replied with, "I'll kill the bastards."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Someone from the crowd spotted some African Americans and shouted, "There's some niggers!"&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Like a swarm of ants, the proceeded towards the African American boys and surrounded them. They saw an African American boy pull a knife and they began to attack him. They used their clubs, bats, sticks, and their fist to attack the young boy. Despite police effort to protect the boy, the whites continued to attack him as he laid on the ground.

== Forgotten history ==
In Eddie Silva's, "The Longest Day,"&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; he shares his feeling about the race riot and believes that the race riot "has been erased from the city's collective memory."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; This part of history is overlooked and not talked about because it forces the people to confront the city's racial divisions. Silva believes that ignoring the riot does not change that fact that it happened and it is something that needs receive the attention it deserves because its effects still continue currently. Some choose to forget or not believe that on the night of the riot approximately 4,000 to 5,000 whites roamed the grounds of the Fairground Park and assaulted any and every African American that crossed their path.&lt;ref name="Silva"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After the nearly twelve hours and 400 officers it took to restore order, there were over a dozen people injured and at least eight were arrested.&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; No deaths resulted in the melee, however, ten black people and two white people were hospitalized for injuries sustained in the event. Official reports state that out of the seven people that were arrested that day, three were white and four were black. Of those seven however, three blacks and one white was ultimately arrested and charged with initiating the riot.&lt;ref&gt;Landon Jones, "Echoes of Michael Brown's Death in St. Louis's Racially Charged Past," The Atlantic, August 12, 2014,  https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/how-an-integrated-swimming-pool-incited-race-riots-in-st-louis/375943/&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at the Fairground Park Pool dropped so significantly that it no longer made a profit and ultimately was closed down.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">'''Transitional kindergarten''' is a school grade that serves as a bridge between [[preschool]] and [[kindergarten]], functioning to provide students with time to develop fundamental skills needed for success in school in an age- and developmentally-appropriate setting.  It is not called preschool because it is state funded and is in the schools.

A school's bridge program may go by a different name, and may be positioned as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten or between kindergarten and first grade.


==Controversy== 
While the stated {{By whom|date=March 2018}} function of transitional kindergarten is to allow students to make up for a lack of development, it actually sets students back an academic year, without providing the assurance that they'll be able to make up for lost ground later {{According to whom|date=March 2018}} {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

==Implementation in California==

In [[California]], the grade was created by the Kindergarten Readiness Act (SB 1381), which was authored by Senator [[Joe Simitian|Joseph Simitian]] and Senate President pro Tem [[Darrell Steinberg]], and signed into law in 2010 by Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Schwarzenegger]]. The act also changed California's relatively late kindergarten entry date from December 2 to September 1, so that around 95% of children will have completed five years of age on the first day of kindergarten (any time in mid/late August), and those few that haven't yet would complete the fifth year ''at least soon'' after the first day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senatorsimitian.com/entry/sb_1381_kindergarten_age/ Senate Bill 1381 Summary from www.senatorsimitian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A child is automatically eligible for transitional kindergarten if the child will turn five between September 2 and December 2. Parents of children who turn five on December 3 or later may petition the school district to have their child admitted into transitional kindergarten, because they will still start regular kindergarten with the same batch of children who attend regular preschool instead (December 3 - September 1). However, by law, parents ''may not'' petition the school district to have their child admitted to regular kindergarten if the child is born on September 2 or later.

Transitional kindergarten is a part of the public school system and is free for families. Classes are taught by credentialed teachers from the K–12 system. Existing funding for these children with fall birthdays that would have been eligible for kindergarten under the old kindergarten entry dates is redirected to transitional kindergarten and used to employ existing teachers and classroom facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyedgecalifornia.org/resources/resource-files/outreach-packet/tk.pdf Transitional Kindergarten Fact Sheet],  Early Edge California&lt;/ref&gt;

The law phases in the new age requirement by moving the cutoff date one month a year for three years, beginning in the fall of 2012. In the fall of 2014, at full implementation, approximately 125,000 children – including more than 52,000 English language learners and about 79,000 who attend Title I schools – will benefit from transitional kindergarten.

AIR, the [[American Institutes for Research]], recently released a report on the first year of statewide TK, which finds that 89% of districts reported they offered transitional kindergarten, representing 96% of the state's kindergarten population. An estimated 39,000 four-year-olds were served in the first year of implementation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14561">'''Waldsee''' ("Lake of the Woods") is the [[Germany|German]] [[language immersion|immersion]] program offered by [[Concordia Language Villages]]. Located near [[Bemidji]], [[Minnesota]], Waldsee is also the site of North America's first certified [[passive house]], which uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.&lt;ref name="greenline"&gt;{{cite web

Waldsee is America's oldest and largest immersion program for German language and culture. Over 1,550 young people participate yearly, coming together from all 50 of the United States and many foreign countries. In 2009 Waldsee was recognized as a U.S. National Center of Excellence for its cultural immersion program by the [[American Association of Teachers of German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aatg.org/programs/kinder-lernen-deutsch/189-kld-centers-of-excellence.html|title= New Center of Excellence in 2010|work=AATG KLD Centers of Excellence|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Waldsee was the brainchild of professors Gerald Haukebo and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer at [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, USA]]. In 1961, the first two-week session of "Camp Waldsee" was held for 72 villagers.&lt;ref name="clv history"/&gt; The tuition was $75 and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer served as the dean of the program. Over the next decade, Waldsee began to grow in both the number of villagers attending as well as the number of weeks that the camp ran each summer. Waldsee's first "adventure program," Alpenland, was held at the Rising Wolf Ranch in [[Montana]], where villagers learned German while enjoying [[hiking|hikes]] in the mountains and [[horseback riding]]. 

In 1970, the [[high school]] credit program was launched, providing a four-week intensive instruction for high-school students equivalent to a full year's instruction in a traditional classroom. In 1973, Waldsee launched its first [[study abroad]] program, offering [[backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] and [[biking]] trips to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. 

In the early 1980s, the permanent Waldsee site began to be built on Turtle River Lake, near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. 

In 2010, Waldsee celebrated its 50th anniversary. Events in 2010 included a major "Waldseefest" on July 24, 2010 and six different alumni weekends.

===World connections===
Waldsee enjoys a continuing [[sister city]] relationship with the German town of [[Bad Waldsee]], located in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. 

[[Horst Köhler]], the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was the official patron (Schirmherr) of Waldsee, as was his predecessor, [[Roman Herzog]]. Many German Ambassadors and other dignitaries have visited Waldsee. World leaders have endorsed Concordia Language Villages, notably former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], whose daughter Chelsea attended Waldsee for six summers.&lt;ref name="clv history"&gt;{{cite web

Waldsee offers one-, two- and four-week living and learning experiences in German language and culture for beginning through advanced 7- to 18-year-olds.

The German Language Village has been cited as a model of innovative education by a wide variety of educators and organizations, including the [[American Association of Teachers of German]] and the [[Goethe Institut]] Inter Nationes. It has also been featured in such media as [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Basler Zeitung]], [[ZDF]] German Television, [[CBS]] American Television, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[German Life Magazine]]'', ''Oskar's'' and ''[[Deutschland (magazine)|Deutschland]]'' magazines, and been the subject of award-winning journalistic essays and various doctoral dissertations. 

===Daily life===
[[Image:Waldsee, Bemidji Panorama.JPG|thumb|right|Waldsee ''Marktplatz.'' The ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen at left, and the ''Bahnhof'' is in the background.]]
Waldsee offers programs that serve youth (7–18 years old), families of all ages, and adults; one of the high school credit programs travels abroad. During the academic year, Waldsee also hosts school groups.

The Waldsee credit program offers traditional instruction as well as credit programs in environmental learning and German (''die Gruene Welle'') and in [[medieval history]] and [[theater]] (''der Maerchenwald''). In the German apprentice program, starting in 2010, participants work half-time in the village stores, in gardening and green roof maintenance, music, the arts and the kitchen and bakery, and also learn half-time in intensive German language groups. 

Waldsee's non-credit programs include programs that focus on producing [[FM radio]] broadcasts at a live [[radio station]], learning about [[Swiss culture]] in tandem with the nearby French village [[Lac du Bois (camp)|Lac du Bois]] and the Italian village [[Lago del Bosco]], learning about the [[Natural environment|environment]], performing [[improvisational theater]] based on medieval lore and legends, and exploring German grammar in depth. 

Villagers can choose different activities every day. Waldsee offers a wide range of European sports from [[soccer]] to [[fencing]]. There is also traditional American [[Summer camp|camp]] activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[canoeing]] at the beach. Waldsee also has a few giant [[chess]] sets and a giant Mühle ([[Nine Men's Morris]]) game.

===Locations ===
Waldsee is currently located at a culturally authentic site on Turtle River Lake north of [[Bemidji]], [[Minnesota]]. Since its founding in 1961, Waldsee has also leased numerous sites across Minnesota. It also offers a credit program that travels abroad.

====Permanent site====
[[Image:WaldseeBemidjiMarktplatzAtDusk.jpg|thumb|left|Waldsee ''Marktplatz'' near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. The culturally authentic ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen in the background.]]
The Waldsee permanent site, which opened in 1982, is located at {{Coord|47|33|33.78|N|94|44|19.36|W|type:landmark_region:US}} near [[Bemidji]], Minnesota on Turtle River Lake, along with six other [[Concordia Language Village]] sites. In all, Waldsee can house up to 240 people (typically, there are about 170 students and 40-50 counselors).

The site is styled after a typical German village and is centered around a ''Marktplatz'', which is the center of most activity at ''Waldsee''. The ''Bahnhof'' is a large building near the entrance of the village that houses class and administrative rooms. The ''Gasthof'' is another building that serves as a dining hall and houses most indoor activities. There is an artists' colony, named ''[[Worpswede]]'', which has about 6 small cabins and houses the arts and crafts activities. 

The first building on the campsite was "''Haus Katja''", which is a log cabin that was built by a group of villagers. The first professionally built building was the ''[[Schwarzwaldhaus]]'' or [[Black Forest house]], which can house 64 people in four units as well as several more in separate sleeping rooms on the first floor. A twin to the ''Schwarzwaldhaus'' is the ''Max Kade Haus'', which was built a few years after the SWH and is very similar in design. 

Two new medium-sized residences have been recently built. The ''Erich Markel Haus'' (Oberammergau and Unterammergau) has room for 24 people in two units. The ''Robert Bosch Haus'' houses the healthcare center (''Heilbronn'') and another residence (''Stuttgart''). The newest building at ''Waldsee'' is the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America. The ''BioHaus'' is an integrated environmental learning center and residence for up to 30 people, including a small apartment upstairs. There is also ''Café Einbeck'', where villagers can sample candy, soft drinks, and other foods from Europe or listen to a jukebox playing German-language music. ''Waldsee'' also has a ''Laden'' at which villagers can make purchases using ''Euro''.

====Leased sites====
Waldsee has also operated at leased sites since its founding in 1961. Waldsee has been located in [[Alexandria, Minnesota]], [[Vergas, Minnesota]], Menagha, Minnesota, Hackensack, Minnesota, and [[Cass Lake, Minnesota]]. Waldsee departed from Vergas in the summer of 2006 to make room for [[Al-Wāḥa]], the [[Arabic]] language village, which was founded that year.

====Abroad====
Waldsee travels abroad to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] with smaller groups of high school students studying German in their summer for credit.


==BioHaus (Passive House)==
In 2006, Waldsee opened the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America, on its permanent site near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the [[Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt]] (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant in North America.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, the BioHaus won the [[Minnesota Environmental Initiative Award]] in the category of Air Quality and Climate Protection. It was a 2007 Nominee for the [[World Clean Energy Award]] in the construction category.&lt;ref name="initiative"&gt;{{cite web

===Cultural importance===
The fixtures are German, and the house helps to introduce students to the "new Germany" as well as preparing them for responsible and ecological citizenship in the global community, the mission of Concordia Language Villages. The modern house itself pays homage to the [[Bauhaus]] school of 1920s architecture, and floor-to-ceiling windows recall the symbolic transparency built into [[West German]] government buildings post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"&gt;{{cite web

===Design===
The house was built using eight critical design strategies: Passive Solar Design, Superinsulation, Advanced Window Technology, Airtightness, Ventilation, Space Heating, Efficient Lighting and Electrical appliances.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The building replaces 100% outside air; no air is recirculated through the system. Two underground tubes exchange outside and inside air eight feet beneath the ground, passively warming or cooling the air to match the temperature of the ground (~55°F year round). The house transfers heat between the outgoing air and the incoming air before it reaches the rooms, resulting in a difference of less than 10°F between the incoming fresh air and the desired room temperature, even in the midst of Minnesotan winter.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

Water in the house is heated by [[solar hot water|solar thermal heat panels]] on the roof, rather than [[photovoltaic]] solar cells, which would convert solar energy directly to electricity.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt;

Low-growing plants make up the building's green roof, reducing rainwater runoff and adding another layer of insulation to the building.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt; Additionally, the western half of the lower level of the structure is tucked into the slope, enabling natural insulation based on the soil.&lt;ref name="initiative"/&gt;

'''''Windfall: The Oil Crisis Game''''' is a real-time [[business simulation game]] developed by [[David Mullich]] in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]] for the [[Apple II]].  Based upon [[queuing theory]] and released after the [[1979 energy crisis]], the game puts the player in the role of chief executive of Engulf Oil, setting gas prices and worker salaries, monitoring gas station lines, scheduling oil tanker arrivals, and negotiating oil prices with OPEC countries in a race against the clock to maximize profits.  As with most Edu-Ware games, ''Windfall'' has an educational aspect, demonstrating the delicate balance in complex systems.

==Gameplay==

The player has six primary choices in this simulation of oil company operations:

# Observe Service Stations: A low-resolution graphics display appears, showing six service stations, two of which are under the player's control, while the other four are operated by computer-controlled competitors.  Small colored blocks entering the queue at each station represent thousands of cars. The queue length at each station is an indicator of the gasoline demand at the current selling price and the time it takes for each station to service cars.
# Observe Dock Yards: Another low-resolution graphics display appears, depicting oil tankers arriving at the docks.  The queue length at each dock is an indicator of the oil supply at the current purchase price and the time it takes for each dock to service each tanker.
# Service Station Statistics: A table of text information allows players to see such things as the amount of gasoline each station has to sell, how long the waiting queue of cars is, how much the rival stations may be undercutting the player's prices.
# Dock Yard Statistics: This text table shows players how much they are paying oil producers, how efficient the oil flow from their suppliers is, how much they are paying their dock workers.  Sometimes bad weather may slow down the arrival of ships.
# Set Wages, Prices, and Purchases: Here players can change the price of gasoline, wages of their station attendants, and select their oil source from among several fictional OPEC countries.
# Financial Status: This screen allows players to see the financial health of their company, buy or sell stock, and make an attempt at [[price fixing]].

Strategy is based upon several simple economic principles.  If players pay their employees poorly, the service time will be longer; however, if players pay them too much, prices will need to be raised to maintain a profit, but competitors may steal business away with lower prices.  If gasoline prices go too high, the government may step in and set price limits.  Occasionally, stockholders will overrule players' decisions.

A clock runs continuously through the game.  When time expires, the player's performance is evaluated.

==Reception==

''Windfall'', like most games from Edu-Ware's zip-lock bag era, sold only a few hundred units.{{cn|date=October 2017}} However, it was well reviewed, receiving an "A" rating from ''Peelings II'' magazine, which concluded, "Behind the simple displays is (probably) a reasonably sophisticated realtime simulation program synthesized with a realtime display updated.  Considering the programming effort involved and the educational value of the program, it is a bargain.  And it is great fun to play."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Bruce Webster reviewed ''Windfall'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Bruce |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster commented that "If there is a problem with this game, it is that the topic may not be all that interesting to you, or that the treatment may be too simple for your tastes. Beyond that, I can think of no serious objections to the game."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

'''Wynstones School''' is a [[Waldorf education|Steiner Waldorf school]] in [[Gloucestershire]], set on 11 acres in the [[Cotswolds]]. It takes pupils from pre-school through to university entrance and has an enrolment of around 275 students.

==History==

Wynstones was founded on the initiative of [[Margaret Bennell]] and Cora Nokes, two teachers from [[Crouch End]], London, who wished to change their educational direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=58 Margaret Bennell – Article by Magda Maier Biographien Dokumentation der Forschungstelle Kulturimpuls retrieved 2014.09.12]&lt;/ref&gt; Before and soon after its opening in 1937, they were joined by several other teachers including some, like Bettina Mellinger, [[Rudi Lissau]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=390 Rudi Lissau – Article by Marjatta van Boeschoten, Biographien Dokumentation der Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls retrieved 2014.09.12]&lt;/ref&gt; and Maria and Norbert Glas that had come to England after the closure of the German Waldorf schools by the [[Nazi]] government. The school grew rapidly over the War years, being in the countryside away from the bombing of the cities. Its hostel became a home to many children including those of the [[Camphill]] community co-workers in Scotland. The high school was established after the War and the land and new buildings surrounding the original manor house developed.&lt;ref&gt;‘’The Builders of Camphill: Lives and Destinies of the Founders’’ Edited by Friedwart Bock, Article by Christine Polyblank, Floris Books, 2004 {{ISBN|0863154425}}, 9780863154423&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

Situated in rural surroundings in the Cotswolds between Gloucester and Stroud, the school is set on 11 acres of extensive grounds, allowing for outdoor building and gardening pursuits as well as accommodating the sports hall, sports field and tennis courts.
 
The main building provides a central core, and each of the classroom blocks has been placed around it to create a kind of village centre – helping to engender a sense of community for pupils, parents, teachers and staff within the school.

The Barn, the school’s theatre, has enabled performance and visual arts to be at the heart of Wynstones School education and many memorable plays have been put on by pupils throughout the years. These have included King Lear, Romeo &amp; Juliet, An Inspector Calls, Amadeus, The House of Bernarda Alba and most recently, Les Misérables.

Boarding places offered to international students are with school families.

==Admissions and school programme==

Admission is not based on academic selection and children with a wide range of abilities are accepted.

The school offers a comprehensive curriculum based on Steiner-Waldorf education with numerous extra-curricular activities, arts and cultural events and a comprehensive GCSE &amp; A Level programme. It is a full member of the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[http://guidetoindependentschools.com/schools/view/543/Wynstones/ASCL-Steiner-Waldorf-Schools-Fellowship/Wynstones-Church-Lane-Whaddon-Gloucester-GL4-0UF Wynstones in ''Guide to Independent Schools'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a parent and child group, for 0-3 year olds, where parents and carers bring babies and toddlers to morning sessions on several days of the week. They spend a morning a week in school where they can experience some kindergarten activities such as simple seasonal crafts, food preparation, stories, singing and games, get to know the school, meet other parents and learn about Steiner Waldorf Education.

==Management==

Like most Steiner Waldorf schools, Wynstones adopts a co-operative approach to management.

Recently the school employed an Education Leader as part of the management structure. Broadly the roles of the various components are:

'''The Education Leader''' chairs the meetings of the College of Teachers, is responsible for Continuing Professional Development, INSET days, teacher appraisal, complaints &amp; grievances, to lead and support the school's development and enhance the scope of education provided
    
'''The College of Teachers''' works as an advisory, reference group to the Education Leader

'''The Chair of Lower School''' (pupils 6 – 14): Management responsibility for the curriculum, teaching and learning, standards and attainment
    
'''The Chair of Upper School''' (pupils 14 – 18): Management responsibility for the curriculum, teaching and learning, standards and attainment
    
'''A Mandate system''' enlists the individual members to undertake an area of responsibility in the school

'''School Council - The Trustees'''

Wynstones is an educational charity and the independent trustees making up the School Council have final responsibility for the well-being of the school.

The School Council is ultimately responsible for all aspects of the school. The Council’s role is not day-to-day management of the school which is delegated to the Education Leader/Chair of College. Our overall commitment is that: 'The Council, supporting the work of staff, the well being of pupils and the interest of parents, holds itself accountable to the Association to see that Wynstones (a) achieves its desired aims, and (b) avoids unacceptable actions and situations.
