'''ACORD''', the Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development, is a non-profit organization that provides the global insurance industry with data standards and implementation solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acord.org/about/Pages/default.aspx|title=About ACORD — ACORD.org|website=About|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACORD is widely known across the industry for the publication and maintenance of an extensive archive of standardized forms. ACORD has also developed a comprehensive library of electronic data standards with more than 1200 standardized transaction types to support exchange of insurance data between trading partners.

Today, many of the forms and electronic data standards utilized by the insurance and related industries – both in the United States and in several countries across the globe – were developed by ACORD. The [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance market uses ACORD standards for messaging between counterparties.&lt;ref&gt;''"[http://www.lloyds.com/the-market/operating-at-lloyds/exchange Exchange]". Lloyds of London. Retrieved 19 February 2015.''&lt;/ref&gt;

ACORD has also worked with the [[Centre for Study of Insurance Operations]] on numerous initiatives including the development of North American [[XML]] data standards&lt;ref&gt;''"[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2000/09/08/10500.htm ACORD, CSIO to Collaborate on XML Standards for North America]".

ACORD is headquartered in Pearl River, NY and maintains an office in London, U.K.

==History==

Established in 1970 as a non-profit organization, ACORD was formed by insurance carriers and agents focused on building efficiencies in the United States property casualty insurance market. Originally named Agent Company Operations Research and Development (ACORD), the organization's initial goal was to standardize the many proprietary forms being used by carriers for new business and claims submission.&lt;ref&gt;''Wan, Hakman (2006). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YEqkAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=ACORD&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=ACORD&amp;f=false Electronic Financial Services: Technology and Management]. Chandos. pp. 155–157.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, ACORD began developing electronic standards to complement its form standards. ACORD subsequently expanded both its forms and electronic data standards beyond property and casualty insurance to encompass life and annuity, surety, and reinsurance markets.

== Conferences ==
ACORD hosts several events on technology and related business topics.  Among its events are an annual conference dedicated to advancing innovation in insurance technology.

[[File:German WW2 Bombs.jpg|thumb|right|German [[World War II|WWII]] bombs: [[Explosive material|explosive]] to left, rest [[concrete]] practice bombs (250 [[kilogram|kg]] and 50 kg), [[Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection]] (2007)]]
An '''aerial bomb''' is a type of [[Explosive weapon|explosive]] or [[Incendiary bomb|incendiary weapon]] intended to travel through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] on a predictable [[trajectory]], usually designed to be dropped from an [[aircraft]].  Aerial bombs include a vast range and complexity of designs, from unguided [[gravity bomb]]s to [[guided bomb]]s, hand tossed from a [[vehicle]], to needing a large specially built delivery vehicle; or perhaps ''be'' the vehicle itself such as a [[glide bomb]], instant detonation or [[delay-action bomb]].  The act is termed aerial bombing. As with other types of [[explosive weapon]]s, aerial bombs are designed to kill and injure people and destroy [[materiel]] through the projection of blast and fragmentation outwards from the point of detonation.

== Early bombs ==
The first [[bomb]]s delivered to their targets by air were launched on unmanned [[Incendiary balloon|hot air balloons]], carrying a single bomb, by the Austrians against [[Venice]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Millbrooke|first=Anne|title=Aviation History|publisher=Jeppesen|year=2006|pages=1–20|isbn=0-88487-235-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first bombs dropped from a [[heavier-than-air]] aircraft were grenades or grenade-like devices. Historically, the first use was by [[Giulio Gavotti]] on 1 November 1911, during the [[Italo-Turkish War]].&lt;ref name="Flight100_59"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=R.G. |title=Flight - 100 Years of Aviation |pages=59 |publisher=Dorling-Kindersley Limited |year=2004 |isbn=9780751337327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albatros F-2.jpg|thumb|left|Albatros F-2, the first aircraft used as a bomber]][[File:British Grand Slam bomb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Air Force]] "[[Grand Slam bomb|Grand Slam]]" bomb, early 1945]]

[[File:JDAM GBU30 MER.jpg|thumb|right|Modern [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] guided GBU-31 bombs]]
In 1912, during the [[First Balkan War]], [[Bulgarian Air Force]] [[Aviator|pilot]] Christo Toprakchiev suggested the use of aircraft to drop "bombs" (called [[grenade]]s in the Bulgarian army at this time) on Turkish positions.{{cn|date=January 2018}} [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Simeon Petrov developed the idea and created several [[prototype]]s by adapting different types of grenades and increasing their payload.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;[http://aviation.zonebg.com/istoria/balcan-war/index.php Who was the first to use an aircraft as a bomber?]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Bulgarian; photographs of 1912 Bulgarian air-dropped bombs)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 1912, observer Prodan Tarakchiev dropped two of those bombs on the Turkish railway station of Karağaç (near the besieged [[Edirne]]) from an [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] F.2 aircraft piloted by Radul Milkov, for the first time in this campaign.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/histechintel.htm A Brief History of Air Force Scientific and Technical Intelligence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230215249/https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/histechintel.htm |date=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Balkan Wars: Scenes from the Front Lines"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Balkan Wars: Scenes from the Front Lines|url=http://world.time.com/2012/10/08/the-balkan-wars-scenes-from-the-frontlines/photo/bulgarian-bomber/|website=TIME|date=8 October 2012|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.Borislavov, R.Kirilov: ''The Bulgarian Aircraft, Vol.I: From Bleriot to Messerschmitt''. Litera Prima, Sofia, 1996 (in Bulgarian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical description==
Aerial bombs typically use a [[contact fuze]] to detonate the bomb upon impact, or a delayed-action fuze initiated by impact.

==Reliability==
Not all bombs dropped detonate; failures are common. It was estimated that during the [[Second World War]] about 10% of German bombs failed to detonate, and that [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombs had a failure rate of 15% or 20%, especially if they hit soft soil and used a [[Fuze#Aerial bomb fuze|pistol-type detonating mechanism]] rather than fuzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/23/allied-bombs-still-threaten-hamburg-ww2 |title='They haven't lost their potency': Allied bombs still threaten Hamburg |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 April 2018  |author=Brian Melican |accessdate= 23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great many bombs were dropped during the war; thousands of [[unexploded bomb]]s which may be able to detonate are discovered every year, particularly in Germany, and have to be defused or detonated in a controlled explosion, in some cases requiring evacuation of thousands of people beforehand. Old bombs occasionally detonate when disturbed, or when a faulty time fuze eventually functions, showing that precautions are still essential when dealing with them.

[[Image:DodgerAYCE.jpg|thumb|right|All-you-can-eat buffet at [[Dodger Stadium]]]]
'''All-you-can-eat seats''', also called '''all-inclusive sections''', are blocks of seats in a [[Major League Baseball]] or [[Minor League Baseball]] park in which seat holders are entitled to unlimited [[hot dogs]], [[nachos]], [[popcorn]], [[peanut]]s, [[soft drink]]s, and [[bottled water]] before and during a game. Typically located in less desirable areas of the ballpark, such as the [[Bleacher#Baseball|bleachers]] and upper decks, all-you-can-eat (AYCE) seats are priced approximately 50% higher than seats in the same section, but are viewed by patrons as a bargain considering the added cost of ballpark food. The first AYCE section was introduced at [[Dodger Stadium]] in 2007. The trend spread to 19 of the 30 major league parks by 2010&lt;ref name=si/&gt; and numerous minor league parks by 2012.&lt;ref name=sweep&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/3223/all-you-can-eat-sections-sweep-baseball|title=All-you-can-eat sections sweep baseball|first=Doug|last=Williams|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=July 9, 2012|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 AYCE seats were also inaugurated in numerous [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] arenas and at several [[NASCAR]] tracks.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

All-you-can-eat seats have successfully boosted attendance in ballparks experiencing low turnouts, as well as increased occupancy of stadium sections that were previously under-used.&lt;ref name=calorie&gt;{{cite web |url= http://calorielab.com/news/2008/03/12/you-get-a-great-view-of-the-game-from-the-trough/|title= You get a great view of the game from the trough: All you can eat baseball seating |first=Robert S. |last=Wieder|work=CalorieLab Calorie Counter News|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Dodger Stadium, for example, before 2007 the right-field bleachers were opened only when the left-field bleachers sold out, or for group sales.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Following the conversion of the right-field bleachers into an AYCE section of 3,300 seats, occupancy zoomed to 85%.&lt;ref name=sweep/&gt; The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] boosted ticket sales by 70% when it created a left-field AYCE section in 2009, while the [[Houston Astros]] averaged 95% capacity in its AYCE section.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

From the patrons' point of view, AYCE seats are viewed as a bargain considering the added cost of ballpark food. After a few orders of hot dogs, nachos, and soft drinks, the AYCE seat pays for itself. The Atlanta Braves estimated that a typical AYCE patron in 2007 consumed 3.35 hot dogs, 20 ounces of soda, 7.9 ounces of peanuts; 3 ounces of nachos; and 32 ounces of popcorn.&lt;ref name=sweep/&gt;&lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-03-06-Concessions_N.htm|title=Eating Away the Innings in Baseball's Cheap Seats|first=Michael|last=McCarthy|work=[[USA Today]] |date=March 7, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AYCE seats have been described as a way to indulge in [[junk food]] "with baseball as a nominal backdrop", an opportunity to eat a cheap dinner with a baseball game thrown in, and a way to feed a family on a budget.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/where-the-empty-calories-just-keep-on-coming/2012/04/30/gIQAJiPMuT_story.html|title=Where the empty calories just keep on coming|first=Tim|last=Carman|date=May 1, 2012|accessdate=July 15, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AYCE patrons have been known to engage in [[Competitive eating|eating contests]]&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=usa/&gt;&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=calorie/&gt; and to sneak food home with them.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

'''Aquamarine Power''' was a [[wave energy]] company, which was founded in 2005 to commercialise a wave energy device concept known as the [[Oyster wave energy converter]]. The company's head offices were based in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="S1215"/&gt; The company had further operations in [[Orkney]], Ireland, [[Northern Ireland]] and the United States. Its chief executive officer was Martin McAdam, who joined the company in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/business-consumer/new-boss-for-aquamarine-power-987809|title=New boss for Aquamarine Power|first=|last=Dailyrecord.co.uk|date=20 August 2008|website=dailyrecord.co.uk|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was advised by [[Trevor Whittaker]], inventor of the Oyster concept, and [[Stephen Salter]], inventor of the [[Salter's Duck]].

==History==
The Oyster concept originated from studies conducted in 2003 by the wave power research team at [[Queen's University, Belfast]], led by Professor [[Trevor Whittaker]]. The [[Queen's University, Belfast]] studies were co-funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/CMSWeb/Downloads/Publications/Pioneer/PioneerIssue2.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Allan Thomson, who had previously founded and led the UK’s first commercial wave energy company, [[Wavegen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wavegen.co.uk/news_archives_pressrelease.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808113632/http://www.wavegen.co.uk/news_archives_pressrelease.htm |archivedate=8 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Allan Thomson founded Aquamarine Power to progress the commercialisation of the Oyster device. In 2007 [[Scottish &amp; Southern Energy]] subsidiary Renewable Technology Ventures Limited invested in Aquamarine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/wave-and-tidal-power-join-forces/302351.article |title=Wave and tidal power join forces |work=[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]] |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further investment in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sse.com/PressReleases2010/InvestmentInAquamarinePower/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120919111927/http://www.sse.com/PressReleases2010/InvestmentInAquamarinePower/ |archivedate=19 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, Aquamarine Power and [[Queen's University, Belfast]] signed an agreement to extend their R&amp;D partnership to 2014.
 
In February 2009, Aquamarine Power signed an agreement with renewable energy company [[Airtricity]], a subsidiary of Scottish &amp; Southern Energy, to develop marine energy sites using the Oyster system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6926321.ece |location=London |newspaper=The Times |first=Greg |last=Hurst |title=Aquamarine Power signs agreement with Airtricity}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the first full-scale, 315&amp;nbsp;kW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquamarinepower.com|title=AMP - AMP|author=|date=|website=AMP|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrator Oyster began producing power when it was launched at the [[European Marine Energy Centre]] ([[EMEC]]) on [[Orkney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emec.org.uk/wave_energy_developers.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107185328/http://www.emec.org.uk/wave_energy_developers.asp |archivedate=7 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orkney.gov.uk/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=15061&amp;tt=orkneyv2{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Aquamarine announced it has plans to install 50 Oyster devices on the seabed off of the [[Western Isles]] in Scotland (provisionally dubbed the Orkney Wave Power Station). The project was intended to be able to supply electricity to more than 38,000 homes (2.4 MW in installed capacity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Displays of Edinburgh firm's wave power plan for Lewis|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-17235076|accessdate=5 March 2012 | work=BBC News|date=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automotive electronics''' are  electronic systems used in vehicles, including engine management, ignition, radio, [[carputer]]s, [[telematics]], [[In car entertainment|in-car entertainment systems]] and others. Ignition, engine, and transmission electronics are also found in trucks, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and other internal combustion-powered machinery such as [[forklifts]], [[tractors]], and [[excavators]].  Related elements for control of relevant electrical systems are found on [[hybrid vehicles]] and [[electric cars]] as well.

Electronic systems have become an increasingly large component of the cost of an automobile, from only around 1% of its value in 1950 to around 30% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/277931/automotive-electronics-cost-as-a-share-of-total-car-cost-worldwide/ Automotive electronics cost as a share of total car cost, retrieved July 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest electronics systems available as factory installations were [[vacuum tube]] [[vehicle audio|car radio]]s, starting in the early 1930s. The development of semiconductors after WWII greatly expanded the use of electronics in automobiles, with solid-state diodes making the automotive [[alternator]] the standard after about 1960, and the first transistorized [[ignition system]]s appearing about 1955.

The availability of microprocessors after about 1974 made another range of automotive applications economically feasible.  In 1978 the [[Cadillac Seville]] introduced a "trip computer" based on a 6802 microprocessor. Electronically-controlled ignition and fuel injection systems allowed automotive designers to achieve vehicles meeting requirements for fuel economy and lower emissions, while still maintaining high levels of performance and convenience for drivers.  Today's automobiles contain a dozen or more processors, in functions such as engine management, transmission control, climate control,antilock braking, passive safety systems, navigation, and other functions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/significant-bits/4024611/Motoring-with-microprocessors  Motoring with microprocessors, retrieved July 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[electric car]]s rely on [[power electronics]] for the main propulsion motor control, as well as managing the battery system. Future [[autonomous car]]s will rely on powerful computer systems, an array of sensors, networking, and satellite navigation, all of which will require electronics.

==Types==
Automotive electronics or automotive embedded systems are distributed systems, and according to different domains in the automotive field, they can be classified into: 
# [[Automotive_electronics#Engine_electronics|Engine electronics]]
# [[Automotive_electronics#Transmission electronics|Transmission electronics]]
# [[Automotive_electronics#Chassis electronics|Chassis electronics]]
# [[Automotive_electronics#Active safety|Passive safety]]
# [[Automotive_electronics#Driver assistance|Driver assistance]]
# [[Automotive_electronics#Passenger comfort|Passenger comfort]]
# [[Automotive_electronics#Entertainment systems|Entertainment systems]]
# [[Automotive_electronics#Electronic Integrated Cockpit systems|Electronic Integrated Cockpit systems]]

===Engine electronics===
One of the most demanding electronic parts of an automobile is the [[engine control unit]] (ECU). Engine controls demand one of the highest real time deadlines, as the engine itself is a very fast and complex part of the automobile. Of all the electronics in any car the computing power of the engine control unit is the highest, typically a 32-bit processor.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

A modern car may have up to 100 ECU's and a commercial vehicle up to 40.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

An engine ECU controls such functions as:

In a [[diesel engine]]: 
* [[Fuel injection]] rate
* Emission control, [[NOx]] control
* Regeneration of [[Catalytic converter|oxidation catalytic converter]]
* [[Turbocharger]] control
* Cooling system control
* Throttle control

In a gasoline engine: 
* [[Air–fuel ratio|Lambda]] control
* OBD ([[On-board diagnostics|On-Board Diagnostics]])
* Cooling system control
* Ignition system control
* [[Lubrication]] system control (only a few have electronic control)
* Fuel injection rate control
* Throttle control

Many more engine parameters are actively monitored and controlled in real-time. There are about 20 to 50 that measure pressure, temperature, flow, engine speed, oxygen level and [[NOx]] level plus other parameters at different points within the engine. All these sensor signals are sent to the ECU, which has the logic circuits to do the actual controlling. The ECU output is connected to different [[actuator]]s for the throttle valve, EGR valve, rack (in [[Variable-geometry turbocharger|VGT]]s), fuel injector (using a [[pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] signal), dosing injector and more. There are about 20 to 30 actuators in all.

===Transmission electronics===
These control the transmission system, mainly the shifting of the gears for better shift comfort and to lower torque interrupt while shifting. [[Automatic transmissions]] use controls for their operation, and also many semi-automatic transmissions having a fully automatic clutch or a semi-auto clutch (declutching only). The engine control unit and the transmission control exchange messages, sensor signals and control signals for their operation.

===Chassis electronics===
The chassis system has a lot of sub-systems which monitor various parameters and are actively controlled:
* ABS  - [[Anti-lock Braking System]]
* TCS – [[Traction Control System]]
* EBD – [[Electronic brake force distribution|Electronic Brake Distribution]]
* ESP – [[Electronic Stability Program]]
* PA - [[Parking Assistance ]]

===Passive safety===
{{main|Passive safety}}
These systems are always ready to act when there is a [[collision]] in progress or to prevent it when it senses a dangerous situation:
*Air bags
*[[Hill Descent Control system|Hill descent control]]
*[[Emergency brake assist|Emergency brake assist system]]

===Driver assistance===
{{main|Advanced driver-assistance systems}}
*Lane assist system
*Speed assist system
*Blind spot detection
*Park assist system
*[[Autonomous cruise control system|Adaptive cruise control system]]
*Pre-collision Assist

===Passenger comfort===
*Automatic climate control
*Electronic seat adjustment with memory
*Automatic wipers
*Automatic headlamps - adjusts beam automatically
*Automatic cooling - temperature adjustment

===Infotainment systems===
*[[Navigation system]]
*[[Vehicle audio]]
*[[Information access]]

All of the above systems forms an infotainment system. Developmental methods for these systems vary according to each manufacturer. Different tools are used for both hardware and [[software]] development.

===Electronic Integrated Cockpit systems===
These are new generation hybrid ECUs that combine the functionalities of multiple ECUs of Infotainment Head Unit, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Instrument Cluster, Rear Camera/Parking Assist, Surround View Systems etc. This saves on cost of electronics as well as mechanical/physical parts like interconnects across ECUs etc.  There is also a more centralized control so data can be seamlessly exchanged between the systems.

There are of course challenges too. Given the complexity of this hybrid system, a lot more rigor is needed to validate the system for robustness, safety and security. For example, if the infotainment system's application which could be running an open source Android OS is breached, there could be [[automotive hacking|possibility of hackers to take control of the car remotely]] and potentially misuse it for anti social activities. Typically so, usage of a hardware+software enabled hypervisors are used to virtualize and create separate trust and safety zones that are immune to each other's failures or breaches. Lot of work is happening in this area and potentially will have such systems soon if not already.

==Functional safety requirements==
In order to minimize the risk of dangerous failures, safety related electronic systems have to be developed following the applicable product liability requirements. Disregard for, or inadequate application of these standards can lead to not only personal injuries, but also severe legal and economic consequences such as product cancellations or [[product recall|recalls]].

The [[IEC 61508]] standard, generally applicable to electrical/electronic/programmable safety-related products, is only partially adequate for automotive-development requirements. Consequently, for the automotive industry, this standard is replaced by the existing [[ISO 26262]], currently released as a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS). ISO/DIS 26262 describes the entire [[product life-cycle]] of safety related electrical/electronic systems for road vehicles. It has been published as an international standard in its final version in November 2011. The implementation of this new standard will result in modifications and various innovations in the automobile electronics development process, as it covers the complete product life-cycle from the [[concept phase]] until its decommissioning.

==Security==
As more functions of the automobile are connected to short- or long-range networks, [[cybersecurity]] of systems against unauthorized modification is required. With critical systems such as engine controls, transmission, air bags, and braking connected to internal diagnostic networks, remote access could result in a malicious intruder altering the function of systems or disabling them, possibly causing injuries or fatalities. Every new interface presents a new "[[attack surface]]". The same facility that allows the owner to unlock and start a car from a smart phone app also presents risks due to remote access.  Auto manufacturers may protect the memory of various control microprocessors both to secure them from unauthorized changes and also to ensure only manufacturer-authorized facilities can diagnose or repair the vehicle.  Systems such as [[keyless entry]] rely on cryptographic techniques to ensure "[[replay attach|replay]]" or "[[man-in-the-middle attack]]s" attacks cannot record sequences to allow later break-in to the automobile. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279038 ''Tech Trends:Security concerns for next-generation automotive electronics'', retrieved November 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the [[ADAC|German general automobile club]] commissioned an investigation of the vulnerabilities of one manufacturer's electronics system, which could have led to such exploits as unauthorized remote unlocking of the vehicle. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2015-5-Sicherheitsluecken-bei-BMWs-ConnectedDrive-2536384.html Auto, öffne dich!

'''Coding [[best practice|best practices]]''' are a set of informal rules that the [[software development]] community has learned over time which can help improve the quality of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Code Complete
| edition = Second
| last = McConnell
| first = Steve
| year = 2004
| publisher = Microsoft Press
| isbn = 0-7356-1967-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many computer programs remain in use for far longer than the original authors ever envisaged (sometimes 40 years or more),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Software Engineering
| edition = Seventh
| last = Sommerville
| first = Ian
| year = 2004
| publisher = Pearson
| isbn = 0-321-21026-3
| page = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so any rules need to facilitate both initial development and subsequent maintenance and enhancement by people other than the original authors.

In [[Ninety-ninety rule]], Tom Cargill is credited with this explanation as to why programming projects often run late: &lt;!-- these do add to 180%, and are meant to (=late project). See linked Ninety-ninety rule --&gt;  "The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time." Any guidance which can redress this lack of foresight is worth considering.

The size of a project or program has a significant effect on error rates, programmer productivity, and the amount of management needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Software quality ==
{{main article|Software quality}}
As listed below, there are many attributes associated with good software.  Some of these can be mutually contradictory (e.g. very fast versus full error checking), and different customers and participants may have different priorities. Weinberg provides an example of how different goals can have a dramatic effect on both effort required and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Psychology of Computer Programming
| edition = Silver anniversary
| last = Weinberg
| first =  Gerald
| year = 1998
| publisher = Dorset House Publishing, New York
| isbn = 978-0-932633-42-2
| pages = 128–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he notes that programmers will generally aim to achieve any explicit goals which may be set, probably at the expense of any other quality attributes.

Sommerville has identified four generalised attributes which are not concerned with what a program does, but how well the program does it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Software Engineering
| edition = Seventh
| last = Sommerville

| isbn = 0-321-21026-3
| pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maintainability]]
* [[Dependability]]
* [[Efficiency]]
* [[Usability]]

Weinberg has identified four targets which a good program should meet:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Psychology of Computer Programming
| edition = Silver anniversary
| last = Weinberg
| first = Gerald
| year = 1998
| publisher = Dorset House Publishing, New York
| isbn = 978-0-932633-42-2
| pages = 15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Does a program meet its [[software specification|specification]]; "correct output for each possible input"?
* Is the program produced on schedule (and within budget)?
* How adaptable is the program to cope with changing requirements?
* Is the program efficient enough for the environment in which it is used?

[[Tony Hoare|Hoare]] has identified seventeen objectives related to software quality, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Hoare
| first = C.A.R.
| title = The Quality of Software
| journal = Software Practice and Experience
| volume = 2
| pages = 103–105

| date = 1972
| doi=10.1002/spe.4380020202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clear definition of purpose.
* [[KISS principle|Simplicity]] of use.
* Ruggedness (difficult to misuse, kind to errors).
* Early availability (delivered on time when needed).
* Reliability.
* [[Extensibility]] in the light of experience.
* Brevity.
* Efficiency (fast enough for the purpose to which it is put).
* Minimum cost to develop.
* Conformity to any relevant [[Coding conventions|standards]].
* Clear, accurate, and precise [[user documentation|user documents]].

== Prerequisites ==

Before coding starts, it is important to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been completed (or have at least progressed far enough to provide a solid foundation for coding).  If the various prerequisites are not satisfied then the software is likely to be unsatisfactory, even if it is completed.

From Meek &amp; Heath: "What happens before one gets to the coding stage is often of crucial importance to the success of the project."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | last = Meek
 | first = Brian
 | last2 = Heath
 | first2 = Patricia
 | title = Guide to Good Programming Practice
 | publisher = Ellis Horwood, Wiley
 | year = 1980
 | page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites outlined below cover such matters as:
* how is development structured? (life cycle)
* what is the software meant to do? (requirements)
* the overall structure of the software system (architecture)
* more detailed design of individual components (design)
* choice of programming language(s)

For small simple projects involving only one person, it may be feasible to combine architecture with design and adopt a very simple life cycle.

=== Life cycle ===
{{Main article|Software development methodology}}

A software development methodology is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the life cycle of a software product. Common methodologies include [[waterfall model|waterfall]], [[Software prototyping|prototyping]], [[iterative and incremental development]], [[spiral model|spiral development]], [[agile software development]], [[rapid application development]], and [[extreme programming]].

The waterfall model is a sequential development approach; in particular, it assumes that the requirements can be completely defined at the start of a project.  However, McConnell quotes three studies which indicate that, on average, requirements change by around 25% during a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Code Complete
| edition = Second
| last = McConnell
| first = Steve
| year = 2004
| publisher = Microsoft Press
| isbn = 0-7356-1967-0
| page = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other methodologies mentioned above all attempt to reduce the impact of such requirement changes, often by some form of step-wise, incremental, or iterative approach.  Different methodologies may be appropriate for different development environments.

=== Requirements ===
{{Main article|Requirements engineering}}
McConnell states: "The first prerequisite you need to fulfill before beginning construction is a clear statement of the problem the system is supposed to solve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Code Complete
| edition = Second
| last = McConnell
| first = Steve
| year = 2004
| publisher = Microsoft Press
| isbn = 0-7356-1967-0
| page = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meek and Heath emphasise that a clear, complete, precise, and unambiguous written specification is the target to aim for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| last = Meek
| first = Brian
| last2 = Heath
| first2 = Patricia
| title = Guide to Good Programming Practice
| publisher = Ellis Horwood, Wiley
| year = 1980
| page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that it may not be possible to achieve this target, and the target is likely to change anyway (as mentioned in the previous section).

Sommerville distinguishes between less detailed user requirements and more detailed system requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Software Engineering
| edition = Seventh
| last = Sommerville
| first = Ian
| year = 2004
| publisher = Pearson
| isbn = 0-321-21026-3
| pages = 118–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also distinguishes between functional requirements (e.g. update a record) and non-functional requirements (e.g. response time must be less than 1 second).

=== Architecture ===
{{Main article|Software architecture}}

Hoare points out: "there are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are ''obviously'' no deficiencies; the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no ''obvious'' deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software architecture is concerned with deciding what has to be done, and which program component is going to do it (how something is done is left to the detailed design phase, below).  This is particularly important when a software system contains more than one program since it effectively defines the interface between these various programs.  It should include some consideration of any user interfaces as well, without going into excessive detail.

Any non-functional system requirements (response time, reliability, maintainability, etc.) need to be considered at this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Software Engineering
| edition = Seventh
| last = Sommerville
| first = Ian
| year = 2004
| publisher = Pearson
| isbn = 0-321-21026-3
| pages = 242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software architecture is also of interest to various stakeholders (sponsors, end-users, etc.) since it gives them a chance to check that their requirements can be met.

=== Design ===
{{Main article|Software design}}
The main purpose of design is to fill in the details which have been glossed over in the architectural design.  The intention is that the design should be detailed enough to provide a good guide for actual coding, including details of any particular algorithms to be used.  For example, at the architectural level, it may have been noted that some data has to be sorted, while at the design level it is necessary to decide which sorting algorithm is to be used.  As a further example, if an object-oriented approach is being used, then the details of the objects must be determined (attributes and methods).

=== Choice of programming language(s) ===
Mayer states: "No programming language is perfect. There is not even a single best language; there are only languages well suited or perhaps poorly suited for particular purposes.  Understanding the problem and associated programming requirements is necessary for choosing the language best suited for the solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Mayer
 | first = Herbert
 | title = Advanced C programming on the IBM PC
 | publisher = Windcrest Books
 | date = 1989
 | page = xii (preface)
 | isbn = 0830693637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Meek &amp; Heath: "The essence of the art of choosing a language is to start with the problem, decide what its requirements are, and their relative importance since it will probably be impossible to satisfy them all equally well. The available languages should then be measured against the list of requirements, and the most suitable (or least unsatisfactory) chosen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| last = Meek
| first = Brian
| last2 = Heath
| first2 = Patricia
| title = Guide to Good Programming Practice
| publisher = Ellis Horwood, Wiley
| year = 1980
| page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that different programming languages may be appropriate for different aspects of the problem.  If the languages or their compilers permit, it may be feasible to mix routines written in different languages within the same program.

Even if there is no choice as to which programming language is to be used, McConnell provides some advice: "Every programming language has strengths and weaknesses.  Be aware of the specific strengths and weaknesses of the language you're using."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Code Complete
| edition = Second
| last = McConnell
| first = Steve
| year = 2004
| publisher = Microsoft Press
| isbn = 0-7356-1967-0
| page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coding standards ==
{{main article|Coding conventions}}
This section is also really a prerequisite to coding, as McConnell points out: "Establish programming conventions before you begin programming.  It's nearly impossible to change code to match them later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Code Complete
| edition = Second
| last = McConnell
| first = Steve
| year = 2004
| publisher = Microsoft Press
| isbn = 0-7356-1967-0
| page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As listed near the end of [[Coding conventions]], there are different conventions for different programming languages, so it may be counterproductive to apply the same conventions across different languages.

The use of coding conventions is particularly important when a project involves more than one programmer (there have been projects with thousands of programmers).  It is much easier for a programmer to read code written by someone else if all code follows the same conventions.

For some examples of bad coding conventions, Roedy Green provides a lengthy (tongue-in-cheek) article on how to produce unmaintainable code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.mindprod.com/jgloss/unmain.html
| title = unmaintainable code : Java Glossary
| author = Roedy Green
| accessdate = 2013-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commenting ===
Due to time restrictions or enthusiastic programmers who want immediate results for their code, commenting of code often takes a back seat.  Programmers working as a team have found it better to leave comments behind since coding usually follows cycles, or more than one person may work on a particular module. However, some commenting can decrease the cost of knowledge transfer between developers working on the same module.

In the early days of computing, one commenting practice was to leave a brief description of the following:
# Name of the module
# Purpose of the Module
# Description of the Module
# Original Author
# Modifications
# Authors who modified code with a description on why it was modified.

The "description of the module" should be as brief as possible but without sacrificing clarity and comprehensiveness.

However, the last two items have largely been obsoleted by the advent of [[revision control system]]s. Modifications and their authorship can be reliably tracked by using such tools rather than by using comments.

Also, if complicated logic is being used, it is a good practice to leave a comment "block" near that part so that another programmer can understand what is exactly happening.

[[Unit testing]] can be another way to show how code is intended to be used.

=== Naming conventions ===
Use of proper naming conventions is considered good practice. Sometimes programmers tend to use X1, Y1, etc. as variables and forget to replace them with meaningful ones, causing confusion.

In order to prevent this waste of time, it is usually considered good practice to use descriptive names in the code since it’s about real data.

Example: A variable for taking in weight as a parameter for a truck can be named TrkWeight or TruckWeightKilograms, with TruckWeightKilograms being the more preferable one, since it is instantly recognisable. See [[camelcase|CamelCase]] naming of variables.

=== Keep the code simple ===
The code that a programmer writes should be simple. Complicated logic for achieving a simple thing should be kept to a minimum since the code might be modified by another programmer in the future. The logic one programmer implemented may not make perfect sense to another. So, always keep the code as simple as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://docforge.com/wiki/Best_practices | title=Best practices | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2012-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''For example,''' consider these equivalent lines of C code:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
if (hours &lt; 24 &amp;&amp; minutes &lt; 60 &amp;&amp; seconds &lt; 60)
{
    return true;
}
else
{
    return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and 

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
if (hours &lt; 24 &amp;&amp; minutes &lt; 60 &amp;&amp; seconds &lt; 60)
    return true;
else
    return false;
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
return hours &lt; 24 &amp;&amp; minutes &lt; 60 &amp;&amp; seconds &lt; 60;
&lt;/source&gt;

The 1st approach, which is much more commonly used{{dubious|date=December 2017}}, is considerably larger than the 3rd. In particular, it consumes 5 times more screen vertical space (lines), and 97 characters versus 52 (though editing tools may reduce the difference in actual typing). It is arguable, however, which is "simpler". The first has an explicit if/then else, with an explicit return value obviously connected with each; even a novice programmer should have no difficulty understanding it. The 2nd merely discards the braces, cutting the "vertical" size in half with little change in conceptual complexity. In most languages the "return" statements could also be appended to the prior lines, bringing the "vertical" size to only one more line that the 3rd form. 

The third form obviously minimizes the size, but may increase the complexity: It leaves the "true" and "false" values implicit, and intermixes the notions of "condition" and "return value". It is likely obvious to most programmers, but a novice might not immediately understand that the result of evaluating a condition is actually a value (of type Boolean, or its equivalent in whatever language), and thus can be manipulated or returned. In more realistic examples, the 3rd form could have problems due to [[operator precedence]], perhaps returning an unexpected type, where the prior forms would in some languages report an error. Thus, "simplicity" is not merely a matter of length, but of logical and conceptual structure; making code shorter may make it less or more complex. 

For large, long lived programs using verbose alternatives could contribute to [[Software bloat|bloat]].{{dubious|date=December 2017}}

Compactness can allow coders to view more code per page, reducing scrolling gestures and keystrokes. Given how many times code might be viewed in the process of writing and maintaining, it might amount to a significant savings in programmer keystrokes in the life of the code. This might not seem significant to a student first learning to program. But when producing and maintaining large programs which often reach thousands or even millions of lines, it becomes apparent{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} how much a minor code simplification might speed work{{dubious|date=December 2017}}, and lessen finger, wrist and eye strain, which are common medical issues suffered by production coders and information workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Repetitive Strain Injury|url=http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/rsi.html|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terser coding speeds compilation very slightly, as fewer symbols need to be processed. Furthermore, the 3rd approach may allow similar lines of code to be more easily compared, particularly when many such constructs can appear on one screen at the same time.

Finally, very terses layouts might better utilize modern wide-screen computer displays.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the past screens were limited to 40 or 80 characters (such limits originated far earlier: manuscripts, printed books, and even scrolls, have for millennia used quite short lines (see for example [[Gutenberg Bible]]). Modern screens can easily display 200 or more characters, allowing extremely long lines. Most modern coding styles and standards do not take up that entire width. Thus, if using one window as wide as the screen, a great deal of available space is wasted. On the other hand, with multiple windows, or using an IDE or other tool with various information in side panes, the available width for code is in the range familiar from earlier systems. 

It is also worth noting that the human visual system is greatly affected by line length; very long lines slightly increase reading speed, but reduce comprehension [https://blog.codinghorror.com/text-columns-how-long-is-too-long/] and add to eye-tracking errors. Some studies suggest that longer lines fare better online than in print [http://www.humanfactors.com/newsletters/optimal_line_length.asp], but this still only goes up to about 10 inches, and mainly for raw speed of reading prose.

=== Portability ===
Program code should not contain "hard-coded" (literal) values referring to environmental parameters, such as absolute file paths, file names, user names, host names, IP addresses, URLs, UDP/TCP ports. Otherwise the application will not run on a host that has a different design than anticipated. A careful programmer can parametrize such variables and configure them for the hosting environment outside of the application proper (for example in property files, on an application server, or even in a database). Compare the mantra of a "single point of definition"&lt;ref&gt;
See for example:
{{cite web
 | url = http://jeffkemponoracle.com/2010/06/11/single-point-of-definition-by-example/
 | title = Single-Point-of-Definition by Example
 | access-date = 2015-11-30
 | quote = 'Don't repeat anything. Aim for a Single Point of Definition for every aspect of your application [...]'.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
(SPOD).

As an extension, resources such as XML files should also contain variables rather than literal values, otherwise the application will not be portable to another environment without editing the XML files. For example, with J2EE applications running in an application server, such environmental parameters can be defined in the scope of the JVM and the application should get the values from there.

=== Construction guidelines in brief ===
A general overview of all of the above:

# Know what the code block must perform
# Maintain naming conventions which are uniform throughout.
# Indicate a brief description of what a variable is for (reference to commenting)
# Correct errors as they occur.
# Keep your code simple

== Code development ==

=== Code building ===
A best practice for building code involves daily builds and testing, or better still [[continuous integration]], or even [[continuous delivery]].

=== Testing ===
{{Main article|Software testing}}
Testing is an integral part of software development that needs to be planned. It is also important that testing is done proactively; meaning that test cases are planned before coding starts, and test cases are developed while the application is being designed and coded.

=== Debugging the code and correcting errors ===
Programmers tend to write the complete code and then begin debugging and checking for errors. Though this approach can save time in smaller projects, bigger and complex ones tend to
have too many variables and functions that need attention. Therefore, it is good to debug every module once you are done and not the entire program. This saves time in the long run so that one does not end up wasting a lot of time on figuring out what is wrong. [[Unit test]]s for individual modules, and/or [[functional test]]s for [[web service]]s and web applications, can help with this.

=== Deployment ===
{{Main article|Software deployment}}
Deployment is the final stage of releasing an application for users. Some best practices are:&lt;ref&gt;https://dzone.com/articles/7-application-deployment-best&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://lwn.net/Articles/562333/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Keep the installation structure simple: Files and directories should be kept to a minimum. Don’t install anything that’s never going to be used.
# Keep only what is needed: The software configuration management activities must make sure this is enforced. Unused resources (old or failed versions of files, source code, interfaces, etc.) must be archived somewhere else to keep newer builds lean.
# Keep everything updated: The software configuration management activities must make sure this is enforced. For delta-based deployments, make sure the versions of the resources that are already deployed are the latest before deploying the deltas. If not sure, perform a deployment from scratch (delete everything first and then re-deploy).
# Adopt a multi-stage strategy: Depending on the size of the project, sometimes more deployments are needed.&lt;ref&gt;blog.fortrabbit.com/multi-stage-deployment-for-website-development&lt;/ref&gt;
# Have a roll back strategy: There must be a way to roll-back to a previous (working) version.
# Rely on automation for repeatable processes: There's far too much room for human error, deployments should not be manual. Use a tool that is native to each operating system or, use a scripting language for cross-platform deployments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/04/why-30-of-app-deployments-fail/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://emphaticsolutions.com/2009/09/06/the-rules-of-software-deployment.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# Re-create the real deployment environment: Consider everything (routers, firewalls, web servers, web browsers, file systems, etc.)
# Do not change deployment procedures and scripts on-the-fly and, document such changes: Wait for a new iteration and record such changes appropriately.
# Customize deployment: Newer software products such as APIs, micro-services, etc. require specific considerations for successful deployment.&lt;ref&gt;https://airbrake.io/blog/software-development/speed-up-deployment-match-demand&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linux.com/news/devops-and-art-secure-application-deployment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2014/05/organizing-software-deployments-to-match-failure-conditions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jamesward.com/2015/06/08/comparing-application-deployment-2005-vs-2015&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reduce risk from other development phases: If other activities such as testing and configuration management are wrong, deployment surely will fail.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theserverside.com/news/1364556/Best-Practices-for-Risk-Free-Deployment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drdobbs.com/effective-software-deployment/184415760&lt;/ref&gt;
# Consider the influence each stakeholder has: Organizational, social, governmental considerations.&lt;ref&gt;http://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/Enterprise-application-deployment-The-humanity-of-software-implementation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/05/14/hacking-bureaucracy-improving-hiring-and-software/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intact-tech.com/why-a-bad-software-deployment-is-worse-than-doing-nothing/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Hiro Hamada is a 14-year-old robotics genius living in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo who spends much of his free time participating in illegal [[Robot combat|robot fights]]. To redirect Hiro, his older brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Hiro meets Tadashi's friends, GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Hiro also meets Professor Robert Callaghan, the head of the university's robotics program. Amazed, Hiro decides to apply to the university.

To enroll, he signs up for the school's science fair and presents his project: [[microbots]], swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable using a neurocranial transmitter. At the fair, Hiro declines an offer from Alistair Krei, CEO of Krei Tech, to market the microbots, and Callaghan accepts him into the school. At the end of the day, a fire breaks out among the exhibits and Tadashi rushes in to save Callaghan, the only person left inside. The building explodes moments later, killing Tadashi.

Weeks later, a depressed Hiro, in mourning for Callaghan's and Tadashi's death, inadvertently activates Baymax, the [[Soft robotics|inflatable]] healthcare robot that Tadashi created; the two find Hiro's only remaining microbot and follow it to an abandoned warehouse. There they discover that someone has been mass-producing the microbots, and are attacked by a man wearing a [[Kabuki]] mask who is controlling them. After they escape, Hiro equips Baymax with armor and a battle chip containing various [[karate]] moves, and they track the masked man to the docks. GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred arrive, responding to a call from Baymax, and the masked man chases the group. The six escape to Fred's mansion, where they decide to form a high-tech superhero team to combat the villain.

The group tracks the masked man, whom they suspect to be Krei, to an abandoned Krei Tech laboratory which was used for [[teleportation]] research until a test pilot was lost in an accident. The masked man attacks, but the group subdues him and knocks off his mask – revealing him to be Callaghan, who had stolen and used Hiro's microbots to shield himself from the explosion, leaving Tadashi to die. Enraged, Hiro removes Baymax's healthcare chip, leaving only the battle chip, and orders him to kill Callaghan. Honey reinstalls the healthcare chip at the last second, preventing Baymax from carrying out the kill order. Callaghan escapes, and Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi.

Back home, Hiro tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax stops him and states that vengeance is not what Tadashi would have wanted. To calm him down, Baymax shows Hiro videos of Tadashi running numerous tests during Baymax's development as a demonstration of Tadashi's benevolence and legacy. Hiro remorsefully apologizes to his friends, who reassure him they will catch Callaghan the right way.

Video footage from the laboratory accident reveals that the lost test pilot was Callaghan's daughter Abigail, and that Callaghan is seeking revenge on Krei. Callaghan interrupts Krei at a public event and attempts to destroy his headquarters using Krei's teleportation portal. After a lengthy battle, the team deprives Callaghan of his microbots and the mask, saving Krei, but the portal remains active. Baymax detects Abigail inside, alive but in hyper-sleep, and leaps into the portal with Hiro to rescue her. They find Abigail's pod, but on the way back out, Baymax is struck by debris, damaging his armor and disabling his thrusters. With no other option Baymax activates his armor's rocket fist, and asks Hiro to say he is satisfied with his care, to the shock of Hiro, but Baymax convinces him to do it, saying he will always be with him. Hiro agrees, and Baymax fires his rocket fist, propelling Hiro and Abigail back through the portal before it closes. Callaghan is arrested while Abigail is taken to the hospital.

Some time later, Hiro discovers Baymax's health care chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymax's body, and the six friends continue their exploits throughout the city. During the end credits, a series of newspaper headlines reveals that the university has awarded Hiro a grant and dedicated a building in Tadashi's honor, and that the team has continued protecting the city. In a [[post-credits scene]], Fred discovers a hidden cache of superhero equipment in his family mansion. His father, a retired superhero, returns from vacation and says, "We have a lot to talk about."

{{Further|List of Disney's Big Hero 6 characters}}
*[[Ryan Potter]] as [[Hiro Hamada|Hiro]], a 14-year-old robotics prodigy. Speaking of the character, co-director [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] said "Hiro is transitioning from boy to man, it's a tough time for a kid and some teenagers develop that inevitable snarkiness and jaded attitude. Luckily Ryan is a very likeable kid. So no matter what he did, he was able to take the edge off the character in a way that made him authentic, but appealing".&lt;ref name="USATodayTruitt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Brian|title=Meet the saviors of San Fransokyo in 'Big Hero 6'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/13/big-hero-6-character-reveal-exclusive/12535005|work=USA Today|accessdate=July 13, 2014|date=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineMayaJames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hiro|url=https://thismoment-a.akamaihd.net/other/1410708503-2030.pdf|publisher=xprizechallenge.org|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Scott Adsit]] as [[Baymax (Disney)|Baymax]], an inflatable robot built by Tadashi as a medical assistant. Hall said, "Baymax views the world from one perspective&amp;nbsp;– he just wants to help people, he sees Hiro as his patient". Producer [[Roy Conli]] said "The fact that his character is a [[robot]] limits how you can emote, but Scott was hilarious. He took those boundaries and was able to shape the language in a way that makes you feel Baymax's emotion and sense of humor. Scott was able to relay just how much Baymax cares".&lt;ref name="USATodayTruitt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineMayaJames" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baymax|url=https://thismoment-a.akamaihd.net/other/1410708438-2030.pdf|publisher=xprizechallenge.org|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Daniel Henney]] as [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi]], Hiro's older brother and Baymax's creator. On Hiro and Tadashi's relationship, Conli said "We really wanted them to be brothers first. Tadashi is a smart mentor. He very subtly introduces Hiro to his friends and what they do at San Fransokyo Tech. Once Hiro sees Wasabi, Honey, GoGo, and Fred in action, he realizes that there's a much bigger world out there that really interests him".&lt;ref name="DeadlineMayaJames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OMDisneyCast" /&gt;
*[[T.J. Miller]] as [[Fred (Disney)|Fred]], a comic-book fan and [[slacker]] who is also a team mascot at San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Speaking of Miller, Williams said "He's a real student of comedy.

[[File:Inflatable Robotic Arm.jpg|thumb|An inflatable vinyl robotic arm that helped inspire Baymax's design, from the researchers in the new field of [[soft robotics]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Robotics Institute]].]]
With respect to the design of Baymax, Hall mentioned in an interview, "I wanted a robot that we had never seen before and something to be wholly original. That's a tough thing to do, we've got a lot of robots in pop culture, everything from [[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]] to [[WALL-E#Cast and characters|WALL-E]] to [[C-3PO]] on down the line and not to mention [[Japanese robots]], I won't go into that. So I wanted to do something original." Even if they did not yet know what the robot should look like, artist Lisa Keene came up with the idea that it should be a huggable robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-31/-big-hero-6-turns-godzilla-into-lovable-disney-robot.html|title='Big Hero 6' Turns Godzilla into Lovable Disney Robot|author=Christopher Palmeri|date=October 31, 2014|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of inspiration cited by the team include Japanese [[anime]], such as [[Hayao Miyazaki]] films (including ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[The Wind Rises]]'') and ''[[Pokémon]]'', as well as [[Shogun Warriors (toys)|Shogun Warriors]] toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How anime inspired Disney’s ‘Big Hero 6’ |url=https://nypost.com/2014/11/01/will-disneys-japanese-anime-big-hero-6-get-lost-in-translation/ |work=[[New York Post]] |date=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mecha]] designer Shigeto Koyama, who previously did design work for [[mecha anime]] such as ''[[Gunbuster 2]]'', ''[[Eureka Seven]]'', ''[[Gurren Lagann]]'', and ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'', worked on the concept design for Baymax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview: Shigeto Koyama Talks About Baymax, GAINAX And Kill la Kill |url=https://www.superadrianme.com/event-2/interview-shigeto-koyama-baymax/ |work=superadrianme.com |date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Designer Reveals "Big Hero 6" Anime Connection |url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/10/24/designer-reveals-big-hero-6-anime-connection |work=[[Crunchyroll]] |date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on in the development process, Hall and the design team took a research trip to [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Robotics Institute]], where they met a team of [[DARPA]]-funded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aitoro|first1=Jill R.|title=DARPA goes Disney thanks to 'Big Hero 6'|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/fedbiz_daily/2014/11/darpa-goes-disney-thanks-to-big-hero-6.html|accessdate=February 10, 2015|work=Washington Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers who were pioneering the new field of '[[soft robotics]]' using inflatable vinyl,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/health/2011/winter/soft-bots.shtml|title=Easy Does It|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubergizmo.com/2011/01/inflatable-robot-arm-wont-break-any-bones|title=Inflatable robot arm won't break any bones|author=Edwin Kee|work=Ubergizmo|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ultimately inspired Baymax's inflatable, vinyl, truly huggable design.&lt;ref name="reddit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geekdad.com/2014/10/technology-big-hero-6|title=The Technology of Big Hero 6|work=GeekDad|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/bighero6|title=Big Hero 6|publisher=Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall stated that "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. ... It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app would be in the healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute he showed me that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2014/07/15/big-hero-6-directors-new-trailer|title=The 'Big Hero 6' Directors Reveal the Story Behind the Wild New Trailer (EXCLUSIVE)|date=July 15, 2014|work=The Moviefone Blog|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall stated that the technology "will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future, making robots that are very pliable and gentle and not going to hurt people when they pick them up."

Hall mentioned that achieving a unique look for the mechanical armor took some time and "just trying to get something that felt like the personality of the character". Co-director Williams stated, "A big part of the design challenge is when he puts on the armor you want to feel that he's a very powerful intimidating presence ... at the same time, design-wise he has to relate to the really adorable simple vinyl robot underneath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDaniel|first=Matt|title=First Teaser for Marvel and Disney's 'Big Hero 6': Meet Their 'Huggable' Robot|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/big-hero-6-exclusive-teaser-trailer-walt-disney-86509088837.html|publisher=Yahoo!

According to Conli, Lasseter initially disliked Baymax's description (while low on battery power) of Hiro's cat as a "hairy baby", but Williams kept the line in anyway, and at the film's first test screening, Lasseter admitted that Williams was correct.&lt;ref name="Bodey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bodey|first1=Michael|title=Big Hero 6: another animation marvel from Disney|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/big-hero-6-another-animation-marvel-from-disney/story-e6frg8n6-1227169452274|accessdate=January 1, 2015|work=The Australian|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Williams, Baymax was originally going to be introduced rather late in the film, but then story artist John Ripa conceived of a way for Baymax to meet Hiro much earlier.&lt;ref name="Lark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lark|first1=Max|last2=Draskovic|first2=Marina|last3=Solomon|first3=Charles|title=It's a Matter of Trust: At Walt Disney Animation Studios, The 'Story Trust,' A Peer-to-Peer Feedback System, Has Taken Storytelling—And Disney Animation—To New Creative Heights|journal=Disney twenty-three|date=Spring 2016|volume=8|issue=1|pages=18–21|publisher=Walt Disney Company|location=Burbank|issn=2162-5492|oclc=698366817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire film became much stronger by establishing the relationship between Hiro and Baymax early on, but the filmmakers ended up having to reconstruct "a fair amount of the first act" in order to make that idea work.&lt;ref name="Lark" /&gt;

Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like [[Haight-Ashbury|the Haight]]. I love the [[Painted ladies]]. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." According to production designer Paul Felix, "The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think you could really walk up them ... When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there. When you get out of there, it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) ''[[Blade Runner]]'', but contained to a few square blocks.

The reason why Disney wanted to merge Tokyo (which is where the comic book version takes place) with San Francisco was partly because San Francisco had not been used by Marvel before, partly because of all the city's iconic aspects, and partly because they felt its aesthetics would blend well with Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Sims" /&gt; The filmmakers' idea was that San Fransokyo is based on an alternative history in which San Francisco was largely rebuilt by Japanese immigrants in the aftermath of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]], although this premise is never stated in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keegan|first1=Rebecca|title=San Fransokyo architects built a new world for Disney's Big Hero 6|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/san-fransokyo-architects-built-a-new-world-for-disneys-big-hero-6/|accessdate=December 10, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create San Fransokyo as a detailed digital simulation of an entire city, Disney purchased the actual [[Tax assessment|assessor]] data for the entire city and county of San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt; The final city contains over 83,000 buildings and 100,000 vehicles.&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt;

A software program called Denizen was used to create over 700 distinctive characters&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt; that populate the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/interviews/item/11968-iar-goes-behind-the-scenes-of-big-hero-6-disneys-take-on-a-marvel-superhero-team.html|title=IAR Screens 'Big Hero 6' Footage and Goes Behind the Scenes of Disney's Next|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another one named Bonzai was responsible for the creation of the city's 250,000 trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3037877/the-monster-supercomputing-achievement-that-lights-up-disneys-big-hero-6|title=The Monster Supercomputing Achievement That Lights Up Disney's 'Big Hero 6'|work=Co.Create}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a new rendering system called Hyperion offered new illumination possibilities, like light shining through a translucent object (e.g. Baymax's vinyl covering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Steven|title=Disney creates new digital animation process for 'Big Hero 6'|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disney-creates-new-digital-animation-process-for-big-hero-6-20141020-story.html|accessdate=October 30, 2014|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pixar]]'s [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]] was considered as a "Plan B" for the film's [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], if Hyperion was not able to meet production deadlines.&lt;ref name=WrapHyp/&gt;

Development on Hyperion started in 2011 and was based upon research into multi-bounce complex [[global illumination]] originally conducted at [[Disney Research]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt; Disney, in turn, had to assemble a new super-computing cluster just to handle Hyperion's immense processing demands, which consists of over 2,300 Linux workstations distributed across four data centers (three in [[Los Angeles]] and one in San Francisco).&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt; Each workstation, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, included a pair of 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz Intel Xeon processors, 256 GB of memory, and a pair of 300 GB [[solid-state drive]]s configured as a [[Standard RAID levels|RAID Level 0 array]] (i.e., to operate as a single 600 GB drive).&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt; This was all backed by a central storage system with a capacity of five [[petabyte]]s, which holds all digital assets as well as archival copies of all 54 Disney Animation films.&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt;

The emotional climax that takes place in the middle of a [[wormhole]] portal is represented by the stylized interior of a [[mandelbulb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/immersed-in-movies-going-into-the-big-hero-6-portal-20150130|title = Immersed in Movies: Going Into the 'Big Hero 6' Portal|date = January 30, 2015|accessdate = May 3, 2015|website = Animation Scoop|publisher = Indiewire|last = Desowitz|first = Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-credits scene was only added to the film in August 2014, late in production, after co-director Don Hall and his crew went to see [[Marvel Studios]]' ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. He stated that "[i]t horrified us, that people were sat waiting for an end credits thing, because of the Marvel DNA.

For the South Korean release of the film, it was retitled ''Big Hero'', to avoid the impression of being a sequel, and edited to remove indications of the characters' Japanese origin. This is owing to the [[Japan–South Korea relations|tense relations between Korea and Japan]]. For instance, the protagonist's name, Hiro Hamada, was changed to "Hero Armada", and Japanese-language signage onscreen was changed to English. Nonetheless, the film caused some online controversy in South Korea, because of small images resembling the [[Rising Sun Flag]] in the protagonist's room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Why Big Hero 6 Is Upsetting Some People in South Korea|url=http://kotaku.com/why-big-hero-6-is-upsetting-some-people-in-south-korea-1680370861|accessdate=January 19, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks ahead of its North American release, ''Big Hero 6'' was released in Russia (earned $4.8&amp;nbsp;million) and Ukraine (earned $0.2&amp;nbsp;million) in two days (October 25–26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/international-box-office-fury-annabelle-hercules-happy-new-year-china-guardians-861602|title=Int'l Box Office: 'Annabelle' Still A Doll With $26.5M Frame; 'Fury' Wages $11.2M; 'Lucy' Outmuscles 'Hercules' In China; 'Guardians' Warps To #3 On 2014 Global Hit List; More|author=Nancy Tartaglione|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 26, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason behind the early release was in order to take advantage of the two weeks of school holidays in Russia. Jeff Bock, box office analyst for ''Exhibitor Relations'', said "For a two-day gross, that's huge. It's a giant number in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/26/big-hero-6-russia/17959391|title='Big Hero 6' scores in Russia before U.S. release|author=Bryan Alexander|work=USA Today|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its second weekend, the film added $4.8&amp;nbsp;million (up 1%) bringing its total nine-day cumulative audience to $10.3&amp;nbsp;million in Russia and $10.9 including its revenue from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/11/international-box-office-guardians-of-the-galaxy-number-2-movie-2014-turtles-china-maze-runner-kung-fu-jungle-happy-new-year-1201271064|title='Turtles', 'Maze Runner' Top Int'l Box Office; 'Guardians' Is 2014's #2 Pic: Update|author=Nancy Tartaglione|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=November 2, 2014|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 89% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 211 reviews, with an average score of 7.3/10. The site's consensus states: "Agreeably entertaining and brilliantly animated, ''Big Hero 6'' is briskly-paced, action-packed, and often touching."&lt;ref name="tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_hero_6|title=''Big Hero 6'' (2014)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 from top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 74 based on 38 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/big-hero-6|title=''Big Hero 6'' Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film 3.5/4 stars, writing that "The real appeal of ''Big Hero 6'' isn't its action.

* A Japanese [[manga]] adaptation of ''Big Hero 6'' (which is titled {{nihongo|''Baymax''|ベイマックス|Beimakkusu}} in Japan), illustrated by Haruki Ueno, began serialization in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Magazine Special]]'' from August 20, 2014. A prologue chapter was published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'' on August 6, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-07-15/big-hero-6-is-1st-disney-film-to-be-previewed-with-manga-series/.76668|title=Big Hero 6 Is 1st Disney Film to Be Previewed With Manga Series |publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the film's official Japanese website, the manga revealed plot details in Japan before anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name="japan_official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugc.disney.co.jp/blog/movie/article/23538?category=baymax|title=初の連載マンガ化決定！映画に先駆けストーリーが解禁！ &amp;#124; ニュース &amp;#124; ベイマックス|publisher=Ugc.disney.co.jp|date=July 15, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725193521/http://ugc.disney.co.jp/blog/movie/article/23538?category=baymax|archive-date=July 25, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also quoted the film's co-director Don Hall, to whom it referred as a manga fan, as saying that the film was Japanese-inspired.&lt;ref name="japan_official" /&gt;&lt;!-- ANN cite http://natalie.mu/comic/news/121228 and http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2039814/full/?from_al. The only information in either of these sources that isn't the same as the official website's content is a quote from the manga artist and plot details that come from the film's Japanese trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPvR3nI8eCs. At present, this news is essentially just a blurb from the film's Japanese advertising team, and the official blurb is on the film's official website (the URL is given at the end of the above-mentioned trailer).

[[Bandai]] released a number of action figures related to the film; these toys including a number of different Baymax figures. One is a soft plastic 10-inch version that includes a series of projected stills from the film on his stomach, which can be changed when the figure's arm is moved, and which emits accompanying sounds. Deluxe Flying Baymax, which retails for $39.99, depicts the armored version of the character and features lights and sounds that activate at the push of a button. Placing the Hiro figurine on his back changes the sounds into speech and when the figure is tilted, the sounds are those of flying. The Armor-Up Baymax (original retail cost $19.99) comes with 20 pieces of armor that can be assembled onto the robot by the owner. The other characters from the film, including the other members of team and Professor Callaghan (who is called Yokai) are issued in 4-inch action figures, each of which have eight points of articulation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Robertson, Andy (July 16, 2014).

A '''cage antenna''' (British '''cage aerial''') is a [[radio antenna]] that consists of the top portion of a tower or mast and of several parallel wires, which are radially arranged around the lower part of the mast. One advantage of the cage aerial is that the supporting tower can be grounded, allowing it to be used for other radio services, such as a support for [[VHF]] or [[UHF]] antennas.  A grounded tower also simplifies the installation of aircraft warning lamps. Cage aerials have been built in different variants for broadcasting stations in the [[longwave]] and [[mediumwave]] bands.

The cage is electrically one-quarter of the operating wavelength. It is connected to the mast at its upper end. That way it isolates the lower part of the mast (λ/4 stub) and makes the upper part of the mast the radiator. Very often the typical height of such an antenna is no problem as the height of the mast is selected for the TV or FM antennas on top.

Example: At 1000&amp;nbsp;kHz the wavelength is 300 m. Therefore, the minimum length of the cage antenna is a bit more than 150 m; 75 m for the radiator, 75 m for the cage and a few metres to make the lower end of the cage inaccessible from the ground, as the lower end of the cage carries a very high RF voltage. This type of antenna is known in America as a "[[Folded unipole antenna|folded unipole]]", which has been extensively studied by John H. Mullaney.

The '''Canada Geographic Information System''' ('''CGIS''') was an early [[geographic information system]] (GIS) developed for the [[Government of Canada]] beginning in the early 1960s.   CGIS was used to store geospatial data for the [[Canada Land Inventory]] and assisted in the development of  [[land management|regulatory]] procedures for [[land management|land-use]] management and resource monitoring in Canada.

At that time, [[Canada]] was beginning to realize problems associated with its large land mass and attempting to discern the availability of [[natural resource]]s. The federal government decided to launch a national program to assist in management and [[inventory]] of its resources. The simple automated computer processes designed to store and process large amounts of data enabled Canada to begin a national land-use management program and become a foremost promoter of [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

CGIS was designed to withstand great amounts of collected data by managing, modeling, and analyzing this data very quickly and accurately. As Canada presented such large geospatial datasets, it was necessary to be able to focus on certain regions or [[Canadian provinces|provinces]] in order to more effectively manage and maintain land-use. CGIS enabled its users to effectively collect national data and, if necessary, break it down into provincial datasets. Early applications of CGIS benefited land-use management and [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] monitoring programs across Canada.

==Development==
In 1960, [[Roger Tomlinson]] was working at Spartan Air Services, an [[aerial survey]] company based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. The company was focused on producing large-scale [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] and [[geophysical]] maps, mostly for the Government of Canada.  In the early 1960s, Tomlinson and the company were asked to produce a map for site-location analysis in an [[east Africa]]n nation. Tomlinson immediately recognized that the new automated computer technologies might be applicable and even necessary to complete such a detail-oriented task more effectively and efficiently than humans. Eventually, Spartan met with [[IBM]] offices in Ottawa to begin developing a relationship to bridge the previous gap between geographic data and computer services. Tomlinson brought his geographic knowledge to the table as IBM brought computer programming and data management.
  
The Government of Canada began working towards the development of a national program after a 1962 meeting between Tomlinson and Lee Pratt, head of the [[Canada Land Inventory]] (CLI). Pratt was charged with creation of maps covering the entire region of Canada's commercially productive areas by showing agriculture, forestry, wildlife, and recreation, all with the same classification schemes. Not only was the development of such maps a formidable task, but Pratt understood that computer automation may assist in the analytical processes as well. Tomlinson was the first to produce a technical feasibility study on whether computer mapping programs would be a viable solution for the land-use inventory and management programs, such as CLI. He is also given credit for coining the term "geographic information system" and is recognized as the "Modern Father of GIS."

CGIS continued to be developed and operated as a stand alone system by the Government of Canada until the late 1980s, at which point the widespread emergence of commercial GIS software slowly rendered it obsolete.  In the early 1990s, a group of volunteers successfully extracted all of the data from the old computer tapes, and the data made available on GeoGratis.

'''Directive 98/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 on the legal protection of designs''' 
is a [[European Union directive]] in the field of [[industrial design rights]], made under the [[Single European market|internal market]] 
provisions of the [[Treaty of Rome]]. It sets harmonised standards for eligibility and protection of most types of 
[[registered design]].

== Eligible designs ==
A design is defined as "the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, 
the lines, contours, colours, shape, texture and/or materials of the product itself and/or its ornamentation" (Art.&amp;nbsp;2). 
Designs may be protected if:
*they are ''novel'', that is if no identical design has been made available to the public;
*they have ''individual character'', that is the "informed user" would find it different from other designs which are available to the public.
Where a design forms part of a more complex product, the novelty and individual character of the design are judged on the part 
of the design which is visible during normal use.

Designs are not protected insofar as their appearance is wholly determined by their technical function, or by the need to 
interconnect with other products to perform a technical function (the "must-fit" exception). However modular systems such as 
[[Lego]] or [[Mechano]] may be protected [Art.&amp;nbsp;8(3)].

== Design right protection ==
The holder of a registered design right has the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit others from using the design in any 
way, notably by producing, importing, selling or using products based on the design. However, rightholders may not prevent 
private and non-commercial use, use for research or use for teaching. There is also an exception for foreign-registered ships 
and aeroplanes, based on the principles of maritime sovereignty.

Protection under a registered design right last initially for one or more periods of five years, and may be renewed up to a 
maximum total of twenty-five years. In respect of a given product, they are exhausted when it is sold with the consent of the 
rightholder (the [[first-sale doctrine]]).

Protection by a registered design right does not affect any other intellectual property rights in the product, notably 
[[unregistered design right]]s, patents and [[Trademark|trade marks]]. The question of copyright protection is left to the 
laws of the Member States, which apply varying criteria of originality to the copyright protection of "applied art"; the point, however, is that the existence of the registered design right does not stop the design also being eligible for copyright protection.

== Implementation ==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}
== Review ==
The Directive leaves the question of component parts mostly without harmonisation, given the widely varying practices between 
Member States.

A '''down-the-hole drill''', usually called '''DTH''' by most professionals,  is basically a mini [[jackhammer]] screwed on the bottom of a [[drill string]]. The fast hammer action breaks hard rock into small flakes and dust and is blown clear by the air exhaust from the DTH hammer. The DTH hammer is one of the fastest ways to drill hard rock. Now smaller portable drillcat drilling rigs with DTH hammers can drill as fast as much larger truck rigs with this newer technology. The system is thought to have been invented independently by Stenuick Frères in Belgium and Ingersoll  Rand in the USA in the mid-1950s.

==History==
A [[pneumatic tool]] is first thought to have been used for rock drilling in 1844. Many quarries used hand held tools that required the driller to suspend himself from a rope over the quarry face in order to place the drill hole in the required position. This system used small diameter holes and was not only terribly inefficient, but very dangerous due to flying rock as a result of the inaccuracy of the drilled borehole.

Some quarries used primitive top hammer machines that carried the jack hammer on a mast - the slenderness of the drill rods working with a relatively large diameter drill bit caused bore holes to deviate which sometimes meant that a bore hole might finish dangerously close to its neighbour or indeed be closer to the face of the quarry than had been intended. In any event boreholes that are not aligned correctly which are then loaded with high explosive can be extremely dangerous, resulting in rock being projected beyond the intended site.

Larger quarries used big rotary machines that required huge amounts of down thrust and high rotation speeds to drive the tri-cone bit hard enough to crush the rock. This system could not be successfully used for holes below 6 inches (150mm) and the machines were very expensive to buy and to run. Another system in use was the very primitive cable tool machine (or bash and splash as it was known by the drillers) which caused a heavy bar and chisel to be lifted and dropped on the rock to crush it whilst water was introduced to create a slurry, which in the process, enabled the hole to be drilled. This system could not guarantee a finished hole size and only pure vertical holes could be drilled as the system basically relied on gravity. Debris from the hole was baled out using a baling tube with a clack valve, which was periodically dropped on a winch to capture the slurry, which was then brought to the top of the hole to be discharged.

It was only when the DTH system came along that many of the problems associated with the other systems were overcome - with the DTH system the energy source is constantly behind the drill bit, the drill tubes (or drill string) are rigid being only slightly less in diameter than the drill bit, copious amounts of air can be passed through the drill string to operate the DTH Hammer which is then used to efficiently flush the bore hole clean. DTH did not require heavy down thrusts or high rotational speeds and as such a light, cheap machine could be employed to carry out the drilling process - the machine could also be worked by one man, whereas some other systems required two operatives. The benefits that DTH brought to the industry were enormous - for the first time a drill hole could be placed where it was required because DTH gave a truly aligned, straight, accurately placed, clean bore hole that could be easily charged with explosive to provide good control over the blasting process that was safer and which provided good fragmentation of the rock. Holes could be drilled to increasing depths without the loss of performance since the energy source was always directly behind the drill bit. The system was able to drill in almost all rock conditions that other systems were unable to do. Quarry faces became safer, well profiled and quarry floors were level and easier for loading equipment to operate and move across.

The DTH system completely revolutionised the blast hole industry with many quarries embracing it with open arms.  Eventually the larger DTH systems then found their way into other applications, such as water well drilling and construction work.

It still offers the same benefits to the operator that it initially brought to the quarry industry but it is now being used in many different applications such as gold exploration, ground consolidation, geo-thermal drilling, shallow oil and gas well, directional and piling. The advent of [[tungsten carbide]] for the drill bits (the first bits were all-steel) and the development of the button drill bit coupled with the introduction of high air pressures (25 bar plus) has meant that the DTH system can compete easily and efficiently with other drilling systems.

DTH tools were used to locate the [[2010 Copiapó mining accident|trapped miners in Chile]] and enabled food, water, and medicine to be passed to them and communication systems to be set up that eventually led to their safe rescue.

==Origin of the name==
DTH is short for “down-the-hole”. Since the DTH method was originally developed to drill large-diameter holes downwards in surface-drilling applications, its name originated from the fact that the percussion mechanism followed the bit down into the hole. Applications were later found for the DTH method underground, where the direction of drilling is generally upwards instead of downwards.

==Technical details==
In ''DTH'' drilling, the percussion mechanism – commonly called the hammer – is located directly behind the drill bit. The drill pipes transmit the necessary feed force and rotation to hammer and bit plus [[compressed air]] or fluids for the hammer and flushing of cuttings. The drill pipes are added to the drill string successively behind the hammer as the hole gets deeper. The piston strikes the impact surface of the bit directly, while the hammer casing gives straight and stable guidance of the drill bit. This means that the impact energy does not have to pass through any joints at all. The impact energy therefore is not lost in joints allowing for much deeper percussion drilling. This is a great breakthrough for smaller portable water well drilling rigs, that before were limited. The DTH on smaller rigs now can get same results as large heavy truck rigs.

With recent advances in technology DTH hammers and bits can now be operated to run at up to 500Psi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://www.geosystemsbruce.com/v20/biblio/275%20-%20Evolution%20of%20Small%20Hole%20Drilling%20Methods.pdf |title=The Evolution of Small Hole Drilling Methods for Geotechnical Construction Techniques |first=Donald |last=Bruce |publisher=Geosystems |page=4 |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the penetration speed.

==Uses==
DTH drilling is used in the [[Civil engineering|construction industry]] to produce [[Deep foundation|piles]] into rock, also [[water well]]s, and drilling bores for [[Geothermal heat pump|geothermal ground source heat pumps]].

DTH products can be used in the following applications:

Mining- Drill &amp; Blast holes in Open Pit mining, Where the drill operator will drill several holes, then fill with explosives and detonate to lift rock allowing access to ore body

RC- Exploration &amp; Pit grade control

GW- Geothermal Bore Holes &amp; Waterwells

Oil &amp; Gas- Deepwell Bore Holes : Air hammers can be used as long as cutting uplift and borehole stability are ensured. For deeper wells, new DTH technologies including water hammer and mudhammer can be used to improve drilling rates in hard rocks.

Construction- Piling, Footings

'''Glassblowing''' is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten [[glass]] into a bubble (or parison) with the aid of a [[Blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a '''glassblower''', '''glassmith''', or '''gaffer'''. A '''[[lampworking|lampworker]]''' (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of [[borosilicate glass]].

==Technology==

===Principles===
As a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the [[1st century BC]], glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers; inflation, which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network,&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, S 1982. Glass and Archaeology. Academic Press: London. {{ISBN|0-12-265620-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freestone"&gt;Freestone, I. (1991). "Looking into Glass". In S. Bowman (ed.) ''Science and the Past''. pp.37–56. University of Toronto Press: Toronto &amp; Buffalo. {{ISBN|0-7141-2071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollard"&gt;Pollard, A.M. and C. Heron 2008. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CT_FWEfanCIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Archaeological Chemistry]. The Royal Society of Chemistry {{ISBN|0-85404-262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;Cummings, K. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nm387Ui_DEAC&amp;printsec=frontcover A History of Glassforming]. University of Pennsylvania Press {{ISBN|0812236475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase the stiffness of the molten glass, which in turn facilitates the process of blowing, there was a subtle change in the composition of glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from [[Sepphoris]] of Israel, Fischer and McCray&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0398|title=Glass Production Activities as Practiced at Sepphoris, Israel (37 ?–? 1516)|year=1999|last1=Fischer|first1=A|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|pages=893|issue=8|last2=McGray|first2=W.Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulated that the concentration of [[natron]], which acts as [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.

During blowing, thinner layers of glass cool faster than thicker ones and become more viscous than the thicker layers. That allows production of blown glass with uniform thickness instead of causing blow-through of the thinned layers.

A full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The two major methods of glassblowing are free-blowing and mold-blowing.

====Free-blowing====
[[File:Glassblowing demo at Norcal Ren Faire 2010-09-19 20.JPG|alt=Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010|thumb|Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010]]
This method held a pre-eminent position in glassforming ever since its introduction in the middle of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used nowadays as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a '"gather" which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mariacher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mariacher|first1=G|title=Glass: from Antiquity to the Renaissance|date=1970|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=Middlesex}} (apparently out of print)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zerwick"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chloe Zerwick|author2=Corning Museum of Glass|title=A short history of glass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1ZQAAAAMAAJ|date=May 1990|publisher=H.N. Abrams in association with the Corning Museum of Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the Toledo Museum of Art attempted to reconstruct the ancient free-blowing technique by using clay blowpipes. The result proved that short clay blowpipes of about {{convert|30|–|60|cm|abbr=on}} facilitate free-blowing because they are simple to handle and to manipulate and can be re-used several times.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Birgit Schlick-Nolte|author2=E. Marianne|title=Early glass of the ancient world: 1600 B.C.-A.D. 50 : Ernesto Wolf collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJUsAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=clay+blowpipe|year=1994|publisher=[[Gerd Hatje|Verlag Gerd Hatje]]|isbn=978-3-7757-0502-8|pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled workers are capable of shaping almost any vessel forms by rotating the pipe, swinging it and controlling the temperature of the piece while they blow. They can produce a great variety of glass objects, ranging from drinking cups to window glass.

An outstanding example of the free-blowing technique is the [[Portland Vase]], which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment was carried out by Gudenrath and Whitehouse&lt;ref name="Gudnerath"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudenrath |first1=W. |last2=Whitehouse |first2=D. |year=1990 |title= The Manufacture of the Vase of its Ancient Repair |journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume= 32 |pages= 108–121 |jstor=24188035}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered on the end of the blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.

====Mold-blowing====
[[File:Bamboo Framing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassblower [[Jean-Pierre Canlis]] sculpting a section of his piece "Insignificance"]]
Mold-blowing was an alternative glassblowing method that came after the invention of free-blowing, during the first part of the second quarter of the [[1st century AD]].&lt;ref name="Lightfoot"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lightfoot, C.S.|year= 1987|title= A Group of early Roman Mould-Blown Flasks from the West|journal= Journal of Glass Studies |volume=29|pages= 11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pricea"&gt;Price, J. (1991). "Decorated Mould-Blown Glass Tablewares in the First century AD". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention''. pp. 56–75. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A glob of molten glass is placed on the end of the blowpipe, and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mold rather than the skill of the glassworker.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;

Two types of molds, namely single-piece mold and multi-piece mold, are frequently used to produce mold-blown vessels. The former allows the finished glass object to be removed in one movement by pulling it upwards from the single-piece mold and is largely employed to produce tableware and utilitarian vessels for storage and transportation.&lt;ref name="Tattona"&gt;Tatton-Brown, V. (1991). "The Roman Empire". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 62–97. British Museum Press: London {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the latter is made in multi-paneled mold segments that join together, thus permitting the development of more sophisticated surface modeling, texture and design.

The Roman leaf beaker which is now on display in the J. Paul Getty Museum was blown in a three-part mold decorated with the foliage relief frieze of four vertical plants.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wright, K.|year= 2000|title= Leaf Beakers and Roman Mould-blown Glass Production in the First Century AD|journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume=42|pages= 61–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Taylor and Hill&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, M. &amp; D. Hill 1998. Making Roman Glass Today. In The Colchester Archaeologist 11&lt;/ref&gt; tried to reproduce mold-blown vessels by using three-part molds made of different materials. The result suggested that metal, in particular bronze, molds are more effective in producing high-relief design on glass than plaster molds and wooden molds.

The development of the mold-blowing technique has enabled the speedy production of glass objects in large quantity, thus encouraging the mass production and widespread distribution of glass objects.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cuneaz"&gt;Cuneaz, G. (2003). "Introduction". In R.B. Mentasti, R. Mollo, P. Framarin, M. Sciaccaluga &amp; A. Geotti (eds.)

The transformation of raw materials into glass takes place around {{convert|2400|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NJBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=glass+at+2,400+%C2%BAF+white+hot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jp2zDacTFp&amp;sig=_YDd_WvTydE_gY9mNTl3EatB8Mk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu57OEj_DTAhVL4mMKHRsVDL4Q6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=glass%20at%202,400%20%C2%BAF%20white%20hot&amp;f=false|title=Purchasing Agent: Magazine of Centralized Buying|date=1919-01-01|publisher=Purchasing agent Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the glass emits enough heat to appear almost white hot. The glass is then left to "fine out" (allowing the [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] to rise out of the mass), and then the working temperature is reduced in the furnace to around {{convert|2000|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. At this stage, the glass appears to be a bright orange color. Though most glassblowing is done between {{convert|1600|and|1900|°F|°C|order=flip}}, "soda-lime" glass remains somewhat plastic and workable as low as {{convert|1350|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Annealing is usually done between {{convert|700|and|900|°F|°C|order=flip}}.

{{anchor|glory hole|lehr|annealer}}
Glassblowing involves three [[furnace]]s. The first, which contains a [[crucible]] of molten glass, is simply referred to as '''the furnace'''. The second is called the '''glory hole''', and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the '''lehr''' or '''annealer''', and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, depending on the size of the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to [[thermal stress]]. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.

{{anchor|punty|pontil|blowpipe|marver}}
The major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears.

The tip of the '''[[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]]''' is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is "gathered" onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous [[honey]] is picked up on a [[honey dipper]]. This glass is then rolled on the '''[[marver]]''', which was traditionally a flat slab of [[marble]], but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of [[steel]]. This process, called marvering,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100118153111/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/269.html Marvering]. glassonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]] rod called a punty  for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and/or to finalize the top.

The '''bench''' is a glassblower's workstation, and has a place for the glassblower to sit, a place for the handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. '''Blocks''' are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked [[fruitwood]], and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation.  In similar fashion, pads of '''water-soaked newspaper''' (roughly {{cvt|6|in|cm|order=flip}} square, {{convert|0.5|to|1|in|cm|order=flip}} thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece.  '''Jacks''' are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later in the creation of a piece. '''Paddles''' are flat pieces of wood or [[graphite]] used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. '''Tweezers''' are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. '''Straight shears''' are essentially bulky [[scissors]], used for making linear cuts. '''Diamond shears''' have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.

There are many ways to apply patterns and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called [[frit]]. Complex patterns with great detail can be created through the use of [[caneworking|cane]] (rods of colored glass) and [[murrine]] (rods cut in cross-sections to reveal patterns). These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then "picked up" by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is "reticello", which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each twisted in a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form.

A [[lampworking|lampworker]], usually operating on a much smaller scale, historically used [[alcohol]] lamps and breath or [[bellows]]-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as [[laboratory glassware]], beads, and durable scientific "specimens"—miniature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by [[Hans Godo Frabel]] (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practiced today. The modern lampworker uses a flame of [[oxygen]] and [[propane]] or [[natural gas]]. The modern torch permits working both the soft glass from the furnace worker and the [[borosilicate glass]] (low-expansion) of the [[scientific glassblowing|scientific glassblower]]. This latter worker may also have multiple headed torches and special [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]s to help form the glass or [[fused quartz]] used for special projects.

==History==

===Origins===

The earliest evidence of glassblowing was found by [[Roman Ghirshman]] in [[Chogha Zanbil]], where many glass bottles were found in the excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Sève, L (2012). Ghirshman, Roman. Encyclopaedia Iranica Vol. X, Fasc. 6, pp. 583-586&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;شیشه‌گری (In Persian: Glassblowing) [[:fa:شیشه‌گری]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later evidence comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a [[mikvah]], a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of [[Jerusalem]], dated from 37 to 4 BC.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avigad"&gt;Avigad, N (1983). ''Discovering Jerusalem''. Nashville. {{ISBN|0-8407-5299-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.&lt;ref name="Gudnerath"/&gt;

Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass.&lt;ref name="Israeli"&gt;Israeli, Y. (1991). "The Invention of Blowing". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention''. pp. 46–55. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such inventions swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass.

===Roman Empire===
{{Main|Roman glass}}
[[File:Roman glass hydria from Baelo Claudia (M.A.N. 1926-15-287) 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman blown glass [[hydria]] from [[Baelo Claudia]] (4th century AD)]]

[[File:Glassworking and glassblowing.jpg|thumb|upright|Glassblowing production methods in England in 1858]]

The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century BC, which enhanced the spread and dominance of this new technology.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vosea"&gt;Vose, R.H. (1989). ''Glass''. Collins Archaeology: London. {{ISBN|0-85223-714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glassblowing was greatly supported by the Roman government (although Roman citizens could not be "in trade", in particular under the reign of [[Augustus]]), and glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isings"&gt;Isings, C. 1957. Roman Glass: from dated finds. Archaeologica Traiectina. J.B. Wolters: Groningen.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eastern borders of the Empire, the first large glass workshops were set up by the [[Phoenicians]] in the birthplace of glassblowing in contemporary [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]] as well as in the neighbouring province of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;

[[Ennion]] for example, was among one of the most prominent glassworkers from Lebanon of the time. He was renowned for producing the multi-paneled mold-blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; The complexity of designs of these mold-blown glass vessels illustrated the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mold-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas, and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horicht"&gt;Hőricht, L.A.S. (1991). "Syrian Elements among the Glass from Pompeii". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: two centuries of art and invention''. pp. 76–85. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the glassblowing technique reached [[Egypt]] and was described in a fragmentary poem printed on [[papyrus]] which was dated to 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coles"&gt;Coles, R.A. 1983. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri 50. Egypt Exploration Society for the British Academy: London.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of [[Samothrace]] and at [[Corinth]] in mainland [[Greece]] which were dated to the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;

Later, the Phoenician glassworkers exploited their glassblowing techniques and set up their workshops in the western territories of the Roman Empire, first in [[Italy]] by the middle of the 1st century AD. [[Rome]], the heartland of the Empire, soon became a major glassblowing center, and more glassblowing workshops were subsequently established in other provinces of Italy, for example [[Campania]], [[Morgantina]] and [[Aquileia]].&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grose"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grose, D.F.|year=1982|title=The Hellenistic and Early Roman Glass from Morgantina (Serra Orlando), Sicily|journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume=24|page=s 20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of blown glass objects, ranging from [[unguentaria]] (toiletry containers for [[perfume]]) to [[cameo (carving)|cameo]], from [[tableware]] to [[window]] glass, were produced.

From there, escaping craftsmen (who had been forbidden to travel) otherwise advanced to the rest of Europe by building their glassblowing workshops in the north of the [[Alps]] (which is now [[Switzerland]]), and then at sites in northern Europe in present-day [[France]] and [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="Vosea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, D. (1998). "Roman Glass in Britain". ''Shire Archaeology'' No. 76. CTT Printing Series Ltd.: Pembrokeshire.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priceb"&gt;Price, J. (2000). "Roman Glass Production in Western Europe". In M-D Nenna (ed.) ''La Route Du Verre: ateliers primaries et secondaires du second millenaire av. J-C au Moyen Age''. pp. 123–124. Maison de l’Orient Mediterranean: Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific glassblowing centers of the Roman period was established in [[Cologne]] on the river [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]] by late 1st century BC. Stone base molds and [[terracotta]] base molds were discovered from these Rhineland workshops, suggesting the adoption and the application of mold-blowing technique by the glassworkers.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; Besides, blown [[flagon]]s and blown jars decorated with ribbing, as well as blown perfume bottles with letters CCAA or CCA which stand for Colonia Claudia Agrippiniensis, were produced from the Rhineland workshops.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vosea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; Remains of blown blue-green glass vessels, for example [[bottle]]s with a handle, collared bowls and indented beakers, were found in abundance from the local glass workshops at [[Poetovio]] and [[Celeia]] in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="Lazar"&gt;Lazar, I. 2006. Glass finds in Slovenia and neighbouring areas. In Journal of Roman Archaeology 19: 299–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving physical evidence, such as blowpipes and molds which are indicative of the presence of blowing, is fragmentary and limited. Pieces of clay blowpipes were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at [[Avenches]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; Clay blowpipes, also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal blowpipes. Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered from the glass workshop in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] of [[Spain]], as well as in [[Salona]] in [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The glass blowing tradition was carried on in Europe from the medieval period through the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] in the demise of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. During the early medieval period, the Franks manipulated the technique of glassblowing by creating the simple corrugated molds and developing the claws decoration techniques.&lt;ref name="Tattonb"&gt;Tatton-Brown, V. (1991). "Early Medieval Europe AD 400 – 1066". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 98–111. British Museum Press: London. {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voseb"&gt;Vose, R.H. (1989). "From Dark Ages to the Fall of Constantinople". In D. Klein &amp; W. Lloyd (eds.) ''The History of Glass''. pp. 39–66. Macdonald &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: {{ISBN|0-85613-516-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blown glass objects, such as the drinking vessels that imitated the shape of the animal horn were produced in the Rhine and Meuse valleys, as well as in Belgium. The [[Byzantine]] glassworkers made mold-blown glass decorated with [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] symbols in [[Jerusalem]] between late 6th century and the middle of the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="Voseb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt; Mold-blown vessels with facets, relief and linear-cut decoration were discovered at [[Samarra]] in the Islamic lands.&lt;ref name="Voseb"/&gt;

[[Renaissance]] Europe witnessed the revitalization of glass industry in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the [[Venice|Venetian]] glassworkers from [[Murano]] to produce the fine glassware which is also known as [[cristallo]].&lt;ref name="Tait"&gt;Tait, H. (1994). "Europe from the Middle Ages to Industrial Revolution". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 145–187. British Museum Press: London {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood, P. (1989). "The Tradition from Medieval to Renaissance". In D. Klein &amp; W. Lloyd (eds.) ''The History of Glass''. pp. 67–92. Macdonald &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: {{ISBN|0-85613-516-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for [[window]] panes in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt; The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread that glass was being blown in many parts of the world, for example, in [[China]], [[Japan]] and the Islamic Lands.

The Nøstetangen Museum at [[Hokksund]], [[Norway]] shows how glass was made according to ancient tradition. The Nøstetangenglassworks had operated there from 1741 to 1777, producing  table-glass and chandeliers in the German and English style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nostetangenmuseum.no/ ''Nøstetangen Glassworks'' (Nøstetangen)]. nostetangenmuseum.no&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nostetangenmuseum.no/?page_id=14 ''Gamle Sorenskrivergaarden'' (Nøstetangen)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192422/http://nostetangenmuseum.no/?page_id=14 |date=2012-03-24 }}. nostetangenmuseum.no&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}

===Recent developments===
The "[[studio glass movement]]" began in 1962 when [[Harvey Littleton]], a ceramics professor, and [[Dominick Labino]], a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], during which they started experimenting with melting glass in a small [[furnace]] and creating blown glass art. Littleton promoted the use of small furnaces in individual artists studios([http://www.handblownglass.com/Modern-Hand-Blown-Glass]). This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Dante Marioni]], Fritz Driesbach and [[Marvin Lipofsky]] as well as scores of other modern glass artists. Today there are many different institutions around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment.

Working with large or complex pieces requires a team of several glassworkers, in a complex [[choreography]] of precisely timed movements.  This practical requirement has encouraged collaboration among glass artists, in both semi-permanent and temporary working groups.

===In literature===
The writer [[Daphne du Maurier]] was descended from a family of glass-blowers in 18th century France, and she wrote about her forebears in the 1963 [[historical novel]] ''The Glass-Blowers''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382723.The_Glass_Blowers&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of mystery novelist [[Donna Leon]]'s ''Through a Glass, Darkly'' is the investigation of a crime in a Venetian glassworks on the island of Murano.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/donna-leon/through-a-glass-darkly/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hakapik''' ({{lang-no|gaff}}) is a club, of [[Norway|Norwegian]] design, used for [[seal hunt|killing seals]]. The hakapik is a multipurpose hunting tool—a heavy wooden club, with a hammer head (used to crush a seal's skull), and a hook (used to drag away the carcass) on the end.

Regulation Canadian hakapiks consist of a metal [[ferrule]] that weighs at least 340 g (12&amp;nbsp;oz) with a slightly bent spike not more than 14&amp;nbsp;cm (5.5&amp;nbsp;in) in length on one side of the ferrule and a blunt projection not more than 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm (0.5&amp;nbsp;in) in length on the opposite side of the ferrule and that is attached to a wooden handle that measures not less than 105&amp;nbsp;cm (3.4&amp;nbsp;ft) and not more than 153&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft) in length and not less than 3&amp;nbsp;cm and not more than 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter.&lt;ref name="ifaw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fink|first1=Sheryl|title=An illustrated guide to the tools used to kill seals in Canada’s commercial seal hunt|url=http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/2007_An%20illustrated%20guide%20to%20the%20tool%20used%20to%20kill%20seals%20in%20the%20canadas%20commercial%20seal%20hunt.pdf|website=ifaw.org|publisher=IFAW|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hakapik is favored by sealers because it allows them to kill the seal without damaging the pelt. Further, studies by American veterinary scientists on the use of the hakapik on the seal hunt carried out on [[Pribilof Islands]] of [[Alaska]] suggested that it is an efficient tool designed to kill the animal quickly and humanely when used correctly. A report by members of the [[Canadian Veterinary Medical Association]] in September 2002 confirmed this claim.&lt;ref name="Veterinary"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Daoust |first=Pierre-Yves  |author2=Alice Crook |author3=Trent K.

A '''heliodon''' (HEE-leo-don) is a device for adjusting the angle between a flat surface and a beam of light to match the [[angle]] between a horizontal plane at a specific latitude and the solar beam. Heliodons are used primarily by [[architects]] and students of architecture. By placing a model building on the heliodon’s flat surface and making adjustments to the light/surface angle, the investigator can see how the building would look in the three-dimensional solar beam at various dates and times of day.

The [[Earth]] is a ball in space perpetually intercepting a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of parallel energy rays from the sun. (Think of a tennis ball being held in the wind.) The angle of any earthly site to the solar beam is determined by
*The site’s latitude, which gives its position on the curve of the Earth between the Equator and one of the Poles.
*The time of day at the site, measured by its progress eastward around the Earth’s axis from sunrise to sunset.
*The date, which locates the Earth on its annual orbit of the sun.

The change due to date is the most difficult to visualize. The Earth’s axis is steady but ''tilted'': the plane that includes the Earth’s [[equator]], which is perpendicular to the axis, is not parallel to the plane that includes the center of the sun and the center of the Earth, called the [[ecliptic]]. Think of the Earth as a car on a Ferris wheel. The car’s axis always points “down”, which changes its relation to the center of the wheel. A light at the center of the wheel would touch the bottom of the car at the top of the orbit and the top of the car at the bottom of the orbit. As the Earth orbits, the location of the centerline of the solar cylinder changes, sliding from the [[Tropic of Cancer]] (in June) to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (in December) and back again. This changes sun angles all over Earth according to the date. ''See more at [[analemma]].''

Heliodons can mimic [[latitude]], time of day, and date. They must also show a clear north-south direction on their surface in order to orient models. Some heliodons are very elaborate, using tracks in a high ceiling to carry a light across a large studio. Others are very simple, using a sundial as a guide to the adjustments and the sun of the day as a light source. In general, the date adjustment causes the most difficulty for the heliodon designer, while the light source presents the most problems in use. The parallel rays of the sun are not easy to duplicate with an artificial light at a useful scale, while the real sun is no respecter of deadlines or class hours.

All heliodons can benefit by including a moveable, tiltable device that can be set to match any surface on a model to show angle of incidence. The angle of incidence device indicates the relative intensity of the direct beam on the surface. The device consists of a diagram of concentric rings around a shadow-casting pointer perpendicular to the diagram. Each ring represents a percent of the direct solar beam incident on the surface. The percentage varies from 100%—the ray runs straight down the pointer perpendicular to the diagram—to zero—the ray runs parallel to the diagram and misses surface. The cosine of the angle of incidence gives the percentage. A cosine of 0.9, 90%, for example, corresponds to an angle of incidence of 26.84 degrees. The radius of the ring for the angle is equal to its tangent times the height of the shadow casting pointer. A 45 degree angle of incidence would generate a cosine of about .7, 70%, for example. Since the tangent of 45 degrees is 1, the radius of the 70% ring would be equal to the height of the shadow-casting rod.

'''ID2020''' is a nonprofit [[Public-private-partnership|public-private partnership]] committed to improving lives through digital identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/admin/hcspeeches/59d1f3b77/opening-statement-68th-session-executive-committee-high-commissioners-programme.html|title=Opening statement at the 68th session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=UNHCR|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An estimated 1.1 billion people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/id4d-dataset|title=Identification for Development Global Dataset {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including many millions of children, women and refugees, globally lack any form of officially recognized identification. Without an identity, individuals are often invisible – unable to vote, access healthcare, open a bank account, or receive an education – and bear higher risk for trafficking. Without accurate population data, public and private organizations struggle to broadly and accurately deliver the most basic human services.

In 2017, ID2020 established an alliance to bring together governments, public and private sector organizations, including [[Accenture]], [[Microsoft]], [[Mercy Corps]], [[Hyperledger]], and [https://www.unicc.org/Pages/Home.aspx UNICC]. The alliance model enables a synchronized approach to digital identity initiatives by enabling diverse stakeholders to work collaboratively and by coordinating funding to support high-impact projects.

ID2020’s mission supports the [http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ UN Sustainable Development Goal] Target 16.9&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/peace-justice/|title=Peace, justice and strong institutions - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. which aims to provide legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. As proof of one’s identity is a prerequisite to social and economic inclusion in the modern world, an identity must be broadly recognized by both the public- and private-sector organizations with which an individual may interact.

ID2020 principles for identity focus on protecting the individual and giving the individual control over their own identity and associated data. These principles apply to any project ID2020 may undertake.
# Personal: Unique to you and you only
# Persistent: Lives with you from birth to death
# Private: Only you can give permission to use data
# Portable: Accessible anywhere you happen to be

== History ==
ID2020 was launched in 2014 by John Edge, a social entrepreneur specializing in financial technology and digital identity.

ID2020’s initial funding came from [[Rockefeller Foundation|The Rockefeller Foundation]], with further support provided by Accenture.

==History==
InGeneron was founded in 2006, through a recapitalization of aDEPtas, Inc. in Houston, Texas with the focus on translating fundamental research in the regenerative medicine field into clinical practice. Over 40 peer-reviewed studies have been published by InGeneron's team in collaboration with various renowned academic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ingeneron.principlepointdev.com/content/literature-references|title=Literature References {{!}} Ingeneron|website=ingeneron.principlepointdev.com|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the fully owned subsidiary InGeneron GmbH in Munich was founded to serve as its European headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.online-handelsregister.de/handelsregisterauszug/by/M%25C3%25BCnchen/I/InGeneron+GmbH/1098681|title=Handelsregisterauszug von InGeneron GmbH (HRB 185925)|website=www.online-handelsregister.de|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 InGeneron Equine GmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/InGeneronEquine|title=Facebook - InGeneron Equine|last=|first=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in Germany, which focuses on treating orthopedic indications of sports horses.

An efficient point-of-care processing system that isolates regenerative cells from adipose tissue has been developed. This system relies on a proprietary enzyme blend and centrifuge technology to isolate and prepare regenerative cells with high yield from adipose tissue within one hour after extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ingeneron.com/content/human-health-products|title=Human Health Products {{!}} Ingeneron|website=www.ingeneron.com|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial results in the veterinary space show that possible treatment areas include orthopedic injuries, osteoarthritis, incontinence, soft tissue reconstruction and non-healing wounds in animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingeneron.com/commercial-areas/animal-health/ InGeneron Treatment Areas] retrieved September 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transpose RT™ System ===
Consisting of the disposables for processing and the Tissue Processing Unit, the Transpose™ RT System is InGeneron's system that allows for point-of-care preparation of regenerative cells. The collected tissue is processed with the InGeneron Tissue Processing Unit, which is a semi-automated, heatable centrifuge that is developed to process tissue prior to stem cell extraction and uses proprietary agitation to assist in the separation of the regenerative cells.

This system is used in conjunction with the Matrase™ enzyme that ensures a high yield of regenerative cells. The proprietary enzyme is designed to quickly and gently release from adipose tissue the [[Adult stem cell|adult regenerative cells]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2962">'''Induced gas flotation''' ('''IGF''') is a [[water treatment]] process that clarifies [[wastewater]]s (or other waters) by the removal of suspended matter such as oil or solids. The removal is achieved by injecting gas bubbles into the water or wastewater in a flotation tank or basin. The small bubbles adhere to the suspended matter causing the suspended matter to float to the surface of the water where it may then be removed by a skimming device.

Induced gas flotation is very widely used in treating the industrial wastewater [[effluent]]s from [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plants]] and similar industrial facilities. A very similar process known as ''[[dissolved air flotation]]'' is also used for waste water treatment. ''[[Froth flotation]]'' is commonly used in the processing of mineral ores.

IGF units in the [[oil industry]] do not use air as the flotation medium due to the explosion risk. These IGF units use [[natural gas]] or [[nitrogen]] to create the bubbles.

==Process description==
The feed water to the IGF float tank is often (but not always) dosed with a coagulant (such as ferric chloride or aluminum sulfate) to [[flocculate]] the suspended matter.

The bubbles may be generated by an impeller, eductors or a sparger. The bubbles adhere to the suspended matter, causing the suspended matter to float to the surface and form a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the IGF unit.&lt;ref name=Aqueous&gt;{{cite book

Some IGF unit designs utilize parallel plate packing material to provide more separation surface and therefore to enhance the separation efficiency of the unit.

[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Star]]s in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], a [[dwarf galaxy]]. At a distance of 163,000 light-years, the LMC is the third closest galaxy to the Milky Way.]]
{{wpspace}}
'''Intergalactic travel''' is the term used for hypothetical [[Human spaceflight|manned]] or unmanned travel between [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Due to the enormous distances between our own galaxy the [[Milky Way]] and even its closest neighbors&lt;wbr&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;wbr&gt;hundreds of thousands to millions of light-years&lt;wbr&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;wbr&gt;any such venture would be far more technologically demanding than even [[interstellar travel]]. Intergalactic distances are roughly a hundred-thousandfold (five orders of magnitude) greater than their interstellar counterparts.{{efn| Between small galaxies, which are the majority of galaxies, distances are typically a few hundred thousand light-years. Between large galaxies like the Milky Way and M31, they are typically a few million light-years.}}

The technology required to travel between galaxies is far beyond humanity's present capabilities, and currently only the subject of speculation, hypothesis, and [[science fiction]].

However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible. There are several hypothesized methods of carrying out such a journey, and to date several academics have studied intergalactic travel in a serious manner.&lt;ref name="burruss"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Robert Page | last = Burruss | first2= J. | last2= Colwell | title = Intergalactic Travel: The Long Voyage From Home | journal = The Futurist | date=September–October 1987 | volume= 21 | issue= 5 | pages = 29–33.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Fogg, Martyn | title= The Feasibility of Intergalactic Colonisation and its Relevance to SETI | journal= Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | volume= 41 | number= 11 | date= November 1988 | pages= 491–496. | url= https://www.academia.edu/4166742/The_Feasibility_of_Intergalactic_Colonisation_and_its_Relevance_to_SETI | bibcode= 1988JBIS...41..491F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Armstrong, Stuart | author2= Sandberg, Anders | url= http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/intergalactic-spreading.pdf | title=Eternity in six hours: intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox | publisher= Future of Humanity Institute, Philosophy Department, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The difficulties of intergalactic travel==
Due to the size of the distances involved any serious attempt to travel between galaxies would require methods of [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] far beyond what is currently thought possible in order to bring a large craft close to the [[speed of light]].

According to the current understanding of [[physics]], an object within space-time cannot exceed the speed of light,&lt;ref name="FRAME_PUSHING"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/090506-tw-warp-drive.html | title= Star Trek's Warp Drive: Not Impossible | website= space.com | date= 6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an attempt to travel to any other galaxy would be a journey of millions of earth years via conventional flight.

Manned travel at a speed not close to the speed of light, would require either that we overcome our own mortality with technologies like radical [[life extension]] or traveling with a [[generation ship]]. If traveling at a speed closer to the speed of light, [[time dilation]] would allow intergalactic travel in a timespan of decades of on-ship time.

Additional constraints include the variety of unknowns regarding the durability of a spaceship for such complex travel. Fluctuating temperatures as in the [[warm-hot intergalactic medium]] could potentially disintegrate future spacecraft if not properly shielded.

These challenges also mean a return trip would be very difficult. Therefore, all future studies on the risks and feasibility of intergalactic travel would have to include a wide range of simulations to increase chances of a successful payload.

==Possible methods==
===Extreme long-duration voyages===
Voyages to other galaxies at sub-light speeds would require voyage times anywhere from hundreds of thousands to many millions of years. To date only one design such as this has ever been made.&lt;ref name="burruss"/&gt;

===Hypervelocity stars===

| title=The Hyper Velocity Star Project: The stars| publisher=The Hyper-Velocity Star Project| date=6 September 2009| accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[Stellar kinematics#Origin of hypervelocity stars|theories for their existence]]. One of the mechanisms would be that the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of the [[Milky Way]] ejects stars from the galaxy at a rate of about one every hundred thousand years. Another theorized mechanism might be a supernova explosion in a binary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

These stars travel at speeds up to about 3,000&amp;nbsp;km/second. However, recently (November 2014) stars going up to a significant fraction of the speed of light have been postulated, based on numerical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= The Fastest Unbound Stars in the Universe | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 806 | pages = 124 | author1 = Guillochon, James | author2= Loeb, Abraham | date= 18 Nov 2014 | arxiv= 1411.5022| bibcode= 2015ApJ...806..124G | doi= 10.1088/0004-637X/806/1/124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called Semi-Relativistic Hypervelocity Stars by the authors, these would be ejected by mergers of [[supermassive black hole]]s in colliding galaxies. And, the authors think, will be detectable by forthcoming telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | title= Observational Cosmology With Semi-Relativistic Stars |author1 = Guillochon, James | author2= Loeb, Abraham | date= 18 Nov 2014 | eprint= 1411.5030|class = astro-ph.CO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These could be used by entering into an orbit around them and waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.discovery.com/space/the-great-escape-intergalactic-travel-is-possible.html| title=The Great Escape: Intergalactic Travel is Possible| author=Villard, Ray| date=24 May 2010| publisher=Discovery News| accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Gilster, Paul | date= 26 June 2014 | url= http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30936 | title= Intergalactic Travel via Hypervelocity Stars | website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate= 16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellar engines===
Another proposal is to [[Stellar engine#Class A .28Shkadov thruster.29|artificially propel a star]] in the direction of another galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Gilster, Paul| date=27 June 2014| url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30941| title=Stars as Stellar Engines| website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Gilster, Paul| date=30 June 2014| url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30948| title=Building the Bowl of Heaven| website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time dilation===
While it takes light approximately 2.54 million years to traverse the gulf of space between Earth and, for instance, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], it would take a much shorter amount of time from the point of view of a traveler at close to the speed of light due to the effects of [[time dilation]]; the time experienced by the traveler depending both on velocity (anything less than the speed of light) and distance traveled ([[length contraction]]). Intergalactic travel for humans is therefore possible, in theory, from the point of view of the traveller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Gilster, Paul| date=25 June 2014| url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=30929| title=Sagan's Andromeda Crossing| website= centauri-dreams.org | accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerating to speeds closer to the speed of light with a [[relativistic rocket]] would allow the on-ship travel time to be drastically lower, but would require very large amounts of energy. A way to do this is [[space travel using constant acceleration]]. Traveling to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], 2 million light years away, would take 28 years on-ship time with a constant acceleration of 1g and a deceleration of 1g after reaching half way, to be able to stop.

Going to the Andromeda Galaxy at this acceleration would require 4 100 000&amp;nbsp;kg fuel per kg payload using the unrealistic assumption of a 100% efficient engine that converts matter to energy. Decelerating at the halfway point in order to stop dramatically increases the fuel requirements to 42 trillion kg fuel per kg payload. This is ten times the mass of Mt Everest required in fuel for each kg of payload. As the fuel contributes to the total mass of the ship, carrying more fuel also increases the energy required to travel at a certain acceleration and extra fuel added to make up for the increased mass would further contribute to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html|title=The Relativistic Rocket|author=|date=|website=math.ucr.edu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fuel requirements of going to the Andromeda Galaxy with constant acceleration means that either the payload has to be very small, the spaceship has to be very large or it has to collect fuel or receive energy on the way through other means (e.g. using a [[Bussard ramjet]]).

===Possible faster-than-light methods===
The [[Alcubierre drive]] is a hypothetical concept that is able to impulse a spacecraft to speeds [[faster-than-light|faster than light]] (the spaceship itself would not move faster than light, but the space around it would). This could in theory allow practical intergalactic travel. There is no known way to create the space-distorting wave this concept needs to work, but the metrics of the equations comply with relativity and the limit of light speed.&lt;ref name="Christopher Pike"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alcubierre, Miguel|title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |year=1994|volume=11|pages=L73–L77|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001|arxiv = gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode = 1994CQGra..11L..73A|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced''' ('''JEE-Advanced'''), formerly the '''Indian Institutes of Technology-Joint Entrance Examination'''  ('''IIT-JEE''') is an annual engineering college entrance examination in [[India]]. It is
conducted by one of the seven zonal IITs (IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT  Guwahati ) under guidance of the Joint Admission Board(JAB). It is used as the sole admission test by the 23 [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs). Other universities like the [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs) and the premier [[Indian Institute of Science]] (IISc) also use the score obtained in JEE Advanced as the basis for admission. Any student who took admission to IITs could not appear for the JEE-Advanced exam in the next year, but the same was not the case with IISc, IISER, [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology|RGIPT]] and other institutes as these institutes only used JEE Advanced score for admission. The examination is organised each year by one of the various IITs, on a [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] rotation pattern. It has a very low admission rate (about 9,369 in 479,651 in 2012;which was around 1.95%)[https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/data/jee-report/JEE-2012%20Report.pdf] The latest admission rate in 2017 was around 0.92% in IITs (about 11,000 out of 1,200,000 who applied for [[Joint Entrance Examination#JEE_Main|JEE Main]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bonus-marks-improved-success-rate-in-jee-advanced-say-experts-in-mumbai/story-uzx8aAmyyeXxIJ2uNSgL6J.html |date= June 14, 2017|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is recognised as one of the toughest examinations in the world and is one of the most difficult examinations of India to qualify.

In 2013 the exam, originally called the IIT-JEE, was renamed as JEE (Advanced), along with the [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|AIEEE]] being renamed [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|JEE(Main)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120529/jsp/frontpage/story_15544962.jsp | title=Combined JEE from next year | date= 29 May 2012|publisher=The Calcutta Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2017, IITs started conducting JEE internationally to give admission to international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iits-to-hold-entrance-exam-abroad-for-foreign-students/article8264215.ece|title=IITs to hold entrance exam abroad for foreign students |date= February 21, 2016|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first IIT, [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]], started in 1951. In the initial few years (1951-1954) students were admitted on the basis of their academic results followed by an Interview in several Centers across the country. From 1955-1959 admission was via an all India examination held only for IIT Kharagpur (other IITs had not started by then). Branches were allotted through Interviews/counseling held at Kharagpur.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The common IIT-JEE was conducted for the first time in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IIT Madras Annual Report 1960|url=https://www.iitm.ac.in/annualreports/IITM-AnnualReport-1960.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it had four subjects including an [[English language]] paper. The examination since evolved considerably from its initial pattern. The IIT-JEE was initially called the Common Entrance Exam (CEE); its creation coincided with that of the 1961 IIT Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://forbesindia.com/article/hindsight/iitjee-will-be-missed/32286/1 |title=IIT-JEE Will Be Missed |author=Ashish K. Mishra and Shishir Prasad |date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978, The English paper was stopped being taken into account for counting the rank. From 1998, the English exam was completely stopped.

In 1997, the IIT-JEE was conducted twice after the question paper was leaked in some centers.

Between 2000 and 2005, an additional screening test was used alongside the main examination, intended to reduce pressure on the main examination by allowing only about 20,000 top candidates to sit for the paper, out of more than 450,000 applicants.

From 2002, an additional exam called the [[AIEEE]] was introduced and this was used for admissions to institutions other than IITs. In 2012 The AIEEE was changed to [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|JEE(Main)]] and IIT-JEE to JEE(Advanced); with this, the JEE (Main) became the screening exam for JEE (Advanced).

From June 2005, The Hindu newspaper led a campaign for reforming the IIT-JEE to reduce the coaching mania and to improve the gender and socio-economic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;S.S. Vasan. [http://www.thehindu.com/2005/06/20/stories/2005062001561000.htm Reforming the Joint Entrance Examination system].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editorial. [http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/23/stories/2005092302481000.htm Reforming JEE needs wider reach].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2005/06/20/stories/2005062006322200.htm National admission test called for].&lt;/ref&gt; Two possible solutions were proposed - either a convergence between the screening test and the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE), or a two-tier examination whereby ranks from the first tier can be used for the purposes of gaining admission to the NITs and other engineering colleges in the country.

In September 2005, an analysis group of directors of all the IITs announced major reforms to the examination. These were implemented from 2006 onwards. .&lt;ref&gt;Indrani Dutta. [http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091803530900.htm New IIT-JEE format from 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; The revised test consisted of a single objective test, replacing the earlier two-test system. In order to be eligible for the main examination, candidates in the general category had to secure a minimum of 60% aggregated marks in the qualifying examination of the XIIth standard organized by various educational boards of India, while candidates belonging to [[Scheduled Caste]] (SC), [[Scheduled Tribe]] (ST) and Physically Disabled (PD) categories must secure a minimum of 55%.

From 2006, the screening exam was abolished with the introduction of 8 new IITs. The exam became fully objective [obviously incorrect statement; new IITs started in 2008, screening exam was removed and single stage multiple-choice exam started in 2006].

In 2008, the Director and the Dean of IIT Madras called for revisions to the examination, arguing that the coaching institutes were "enabling many among the less-than-best students to crack the test and keeping girls from qualifying". They expressed concern that the present system did not allow for applicants' 12 years of schooling to have a bearing on admissions into IITs.&lt;ref&gt;D Suresh Kumar. [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-07-31/india/27933184_1_jee-iit-madras-joint-entrance-exam JEE fails to get the best: IIT dons]. [[The Times of India]]. 31 Jul 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Indian Institutes of Technology, for the first time, went overseas with their entrance examination as they set up a centre for the competitive test in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-07/entrance-exams/31304542_1_bombay-zone-joint-entrance-exam-jees|title=5 lakh aspirants to sit for IIT-JEE in 2012 - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of candidates appearing in Dubai hovered around 200 to 220.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-07/mumbai/31304468_1_exam-centres-iit-bombay-indian-institutes|title=IITs hike number of examination centres for JEE - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-tier reform suggested in 2005 may become a reality as the Indian government has announced plans for a single entrance exam for all engineering colleges from 2018, with students aspiring for the IITs having to pass the nationwide common entrance test (JEE-Main) with high marks and then take the JEE-Advanced to qualify for the IITs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/govt-plans-single-entrance-exam-for-all-engineering-colleges-from-2018/story-0TaCjvwwd4eav8uxpqI9sO.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2018, JEE(Advanced) started being conducted online.

== Eligibility ==
Candidates satisfying all the following criteria are eligible to appear in JEE(Advanced).
* Should be among the top 2,24,000 candidates in JEE(Main).
* Should be less than 25 years of age. For SC, ST, PwD candidates the age limit is 30 years.
* Should not have appeared in the JEE(Advanced) exam 2 years before or earlier.
* Should have appeared for the Class XII Board Examination for the first time in the last year of the exam or that year only.
* Should not have accepted admission in any of the IITs earlier.
* Should have passed Class 12 Board Exams with minimum 75% marks. For SC, ST, PwD minimum 65%.

From 2008, six new IITs (IIT Bhubaneshwar, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Jodhpur, IIT Patna and IIT Ropar) were opened with 120 seats each, increasing the total number of seats to almost 7000. For 2009, admissions were made to two more IITs, namely IIT Indore and IIT Mandi (Himachal Pradesh) taking the seat count to almost 8300. In 2011, with additional courses in several old and new IITs, the total seat count crossed 9600. IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad started functioning in 2015 and four more (IIT Bhilai, IIT Dharwad, IIT Goa, IIT Jammu) started in 2016; along with seat additions in other Institutions, making the 2017 seat count to almost 11000. In 2018, in an effort to ensure minimum female enrolment of 14%, the IITs introduced "female only" and "gender neutral" seats based on 2017 enrolment and super-numerary seats were created per-Institute per-program to reach the 14% target. With this and slight overall seats increases, the total seats availability crossed 12000, including 801 super-numerary "female only" seats.

== Reservation ==
Reservation are provided to Indian Nationals belonging to certain categories (SC, ST, PwD, etc.) and to the girls in accordance with the rules of Government of India and such candidates are declared qualified in JEE(Advanced) 2018 based on relaxed norms.

== Admission ==
Candidates qualifying in the JEE(Advanced) are eligible to admission in the 23 IITs if they satisfy ''any one of the following'' criteria.
* They should score a minimum of 75% in the class XII board examination.

* Must be in the top 20 percentile marks of the board exam.&lt;ref name="IITs ease admission norms, 75 percent cutoff in 12th standard to replace old criteria"&gt;{{cite news|title=Board marks criteria|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/education/iits-ease-admission-norms-75-percent-cutoff-in-12th-standard-to-replace-old-criteria_1474422.html|accessdate=13 December 2017|agency=zee news|publisher=zee news|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2012, [[Super 30]] founder and mathematician [[Anand Kumar]] criticised the New Admission Norms, saying that the decision of the IIT Council to give chance to students having top 20% from various boards in the class 12 examinations, was a decision in haste. "This is one decision that will go against the poor, who don't have the opportunity to study in elite schools," he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/patna/32440065_1_school-boards-new-format-iit-council | work=The Times Of India | title=New format of IIT-JEE examination would go against the poor: Anand Kumar | date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIT-JEE was conducted only in [[English language|English]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]], which was criticised as making it harder for students where regional languages, like [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Urdu]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], are more prominent. In September 2011, the [[Gujarat High Court]] acted on a [[Public Interest Litigation]] by the [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]], demanding the exams be conducted in Gujarati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-21/education/30184151_1_regional-languages-entrance-tests-raghuveer-chaudhary |title=Sahitya Parishad demands entrance tests in Gujarati - Times Of India  |work=indiatimes.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 |date=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second petition was made in October by Navsari's Sayaji Vaibhav Sarvajanik Pustakalaya Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-21/ahmedabad/30306229_1_entrance-tests-regional-language-gujarati-language |title=Another PIL seeks entrance tests in Gujarati - Times Of India  |work=indiatimes.com  |accessdate=28 October 2011 |date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another petition was made at the Madras High Court for conducting the exam in Tamil. In the petition, it was claimed that not conducting the exam in the regional languages is in violation of article 14 of the [[Constitution of India]]. PMK, a political party in Tamil Nadu held a demonstration at Chennai for conducting IIT-JEE and other national entrance exams in regional languages also, particularly Tamil in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article2961807.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Conduct IIT entrance test in Tamil also: PMK | date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]] party has filed Public Interest Litigation in Madras High Court for conducting IIT JEE entrance exam in Tamil also. They submitted that every year 7.63 lakh students were completing 12th standard in Tamil Nadu, 75% of them from Tamil Medium. They had to take the entrance exam in English or Hindi, neither of which was their medium of instruction nor their mother tongue, and so were denied their fundamental right to take up the entrance exam in their medium of instruction, based on their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article3338041.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Court notice on plea for entrance exams in Tamil | date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/plea-write-iit-entrance-tamil-866 |title=Plea to write IIT entrance in Tamil &amp;#124; Deccan Chronicle |work=deccanchronicle.com |accessdate=20 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110221016/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/plea-write-iit-entrance-tamil-866 |archivedate=10 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Shiv Sena]] urged MHRD to conduct IITJEE and other national undergraduate entrance exams in regional languages, particularly Marathi language in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_shiv-sena-demands-iit-entrance-test-in-regional-languages_1515676 |title= Shiv Sena demands IIT entrance test in regional languages |date=March 5, 2011 |first=Shubhangi |last=Khapre |publisher= Daily News Analysis |location= Mumbai |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the JEE controversies sparked the nation as the exam is very well known. In 2017, the supreme court ordered JAB to put a bar on the ongoing counseling process. There were three questions comprising a total of 11 marks that were unclear.

==Changes made in JEE (Advanced) 2018==
There were several changes made in the exam from 2018. The Joint Admission Board (JAB) decided to conduct the entire exam online from 2018 since it reduces chances of paper leak and makes logistics and evaluation easier. It said that the online exam will neutralise the problem of misprinting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/jee-advanced-exam-will-now-be-conducted-completely-online/story-pRv6YITTJKN7pwlw6zJeuJ.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching==
Preparing for the Joint Entrance Exam normally began two years before students take the test. 90% of students who passed this exam attended [[Cram school|coaching institutes]], which had created a $3.37 billion industry with annual tuitions of up to $1,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://priceonomics.com/the-iit-entrance-exam/|title=The IIT Entrance Exam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These academies included tests multiple times a week, up to 200 students per class, and long hours, in addition to regular high school work. There were hundreds of academies across the country and the most famous—in [[Kota, Rajasthan]]—attracted approximately 125,000 students each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatesman.com/news/campus/making-capital-of-coaching/72514.html|title=Making capital of coaching|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaching programs had become major corporations and were now not only listed on the Indian stock market, but also attracted millions of dollars of investment from private equity firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kot-coaching-coaching-institutes-iit-jee-aspirants-suicides/1/267308.html|title=Despite high suicide rate, IIT-JEE aspirants made a beeline for a seat in Kotas coaching institutes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-pressure environments, with much competition and high expectations, were blamed for the significant number of suicides that occurred in these academies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/06/01/life-and-death-in-kota_n_10232456.html|title=Why 57 Young Students Have Taken Their Lives In Kota|website=Huffington Post India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sudhanshu Mishra|title=Revealed: Inside Kota's Rs 300 crore coaching industry, where 1.5 lakh students brave cut-throat competition to crack IIT-JEE|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2313660/Inside-Kotas-Rs-300-crore-coaching-industry-How-students-aiming-crack-IIT-JEE-join-mushrooming-institutes.html|publisher=Daily Mail|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a working list of '''Carbon Ranches''' a term referring to [[regenerative agriculture]] practices that specifically accomplish [[carbon sequestration]] in the soil. "The world’s cultivated soils have lost between 50 and 70 percent of their original carbon stock." (Lal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil as Carbon Storehouse:New Weapon in Climate Fight?|url=https://e360.yale.edu/feature/soil_as_carbon_storehouse_new_weapon_in_climate_fight/2744/ |website=yale.edu|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) "A mere two percent increase in the carbon content of the planet’s soils could offset 100 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions going into the atmosphere."(Lal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Farm Carbon|url=http://www.onenaturellc.com/press/c5isfbpw8tbytnpsdlaw5z3tvh07a5 |website=onenaturellc.com|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Grasslands cover 350 billion hectares, comprising 70% of global agricultural land &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Challenges and opportunities for carbon sequestration in grassland systems|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/agphome/documents/climate/AGPC_grassland_webversion_19.pdf |website=fao.org|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making carbon ranching an especially climate beneficial alternative to meat produced as part of a [[Concentrated animal feeding operation]]. Carbon ranching may include, but is not limited to [[Managed intensive rotational grazing]], [[Compost]] application, [[Holistic management (agriculture)]] and [[Tree planting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft Carbon Farm Plan|url=http://www.carboncycle.org/carbon-farming/draft-carbon-farm-plan/ |website=carboncycle.org|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many research groups and NGO's studying and advancing this field including Arizona State University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=
One Million Tons Project (1MMt)|url=https://sustainability.asu.edu/research/project/one-million-tons-project-1mmt/ |website=asu.edu|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carbon Cycle Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Cycle Institute Page|url=http://www.carboncycle.org |website=carboncycle.org|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holistic Management International]], The Ohio State University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OARDC |url=http://oardc.osu.edu/about/message-director |website=osu.edu|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quivira Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quivira Coalition |url=http://quiviracoalition.org |website=quiviracoalition.org|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Savory Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Savory Institute|url=http://savory.global |website=savory.global|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soil Carbon Coalition,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil Carbon Change|url=http://soilcarboncoalition.org/changemap.htm |website=soilcarboncoalition.org|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas A&amp;M University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranch Management University|url=http://forages.tamu.edu/workshop.html |website=tamu.edu|accessdate=18 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list does not necessarily reflect scientific or academic endorsements insofar as best practices and results vary across ranches, climates, time periods, and sources of funding and are therefore challenging to quantify and/or compare. Currently, confirmation of the carbon ranching designation is confirmed through either third party citation or Soil Organic Matter test result.

A '''Mailgram''' is a type of [[telegraphy|telegraphic]] message which is transmitted electronically from the sender to a [[post office]] and then printed and delivered to the recipient via postal means. 

[[Western Union]] invented the Mailgram in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oslin|first=George P.|title=The Story of Telecommunications: From the Deep South to the Top of the Big Apple|publisher=Mercer University Press|date=1999|pages=417|isbn=978-0-86554-659-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_H6lQWiY8wC&amp;pg=PA417|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Service via [[Westar]], Western Union's own [[communications satellite]], was introduced in 1974. 

The advantage of Mailgrams over postal mail was speed and verifiability of transmission; they were widely used in official notifications and [[legal]] transactions. Their advantage over full-rate telegrams was lower cost while still maintaining the look and feel of an important Western Union Telegram. The Mailgram quickly became a widely used medium for business-to-consumer communications. 

Although [[iTelegram]] still provides a mailgram service in the [[United States]], Western Union discontinued all telegram messaging, including Mailgram, in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5690">A ''mud pump'' (sometimes referred to as a ''mud drilling pump'' or ''drilling mud pump''), is a reciprocating piston/plunger pump designed to circulate drilling fluid under high pressure (up to {{convert|7500|psi|abbr=on}}) down the [[drill string]] and back up the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]]. A mud pump is an important part of the equipment used for oil well drilling.

==Classification==

===According to the acting type===

Mud pumps can be divided into single-acting pump and double-acting pump according to the completion times of the suction and drainage acting in one cycle of the piston's reciprocating motion.

===According to the quantity of liners (piston/plunger)===

Mud pumps come in a variety of sizes and configurations but for the typical petroleum drilling rig, the triplex (three piston/plunger) mud pump is the pump of choice. Duplex mud pumps (two piston/plungers) have generally been replaced by the triplex pump, but are still common in developing countries. Two later developments are the hex pump with six vertical pistons/plungers, and various quintuplex's with five horizontal piston/plungers. The advantages that these new pumps have over convention triplex pumps is a lower mud noise which assists with better [[Measurement while drilling]] (MWD) and [[Logging while drilling]] (LWD) decoding.

==Composition==
The "normal" mud pump consists of two main sub-assemblies, the fluid end and the power end.

===Fluid End===
The fluid end produces the pumping process with valves, pistons, and liners.  Because these components are high-wear items, modern pumps are designed to allow quick replacement of these parts.

To reduce severe vibration caused by the pumping process, these pumps incorporate both a suction and discharge pulsation dampener.  These are connected to the inlet and outlet of the fluid end.

===Power End===
The power end converts the rotation of the drive shaft to the reciprocating motion of the pistons.
In most cases a [[crosshead]] crank gear is used for this.

===Mud pump parts===
A mud pump is composed of many parts including mud pump liner, mud pump piston, modules, hydraulic seat pullers, and other parts.
Parts of a mud pump:
1. housing itself,
2. liner with packing,
3. cover plus packing,
4. piston and piston rod,
5. suction valve and discharge valve with their seats,
6. stuffing box (only in double-acting pumps),
7. gland (only in double-acting pumps),
8. pulsation dampener.

==Performance Parameters==
There are two main parameters to measure the performance of a mud pump: Displacement and Pressure.

===Displacement===
Displacement is calculated as discharged liters per minute, it is related with the drilling hole diameter and the return speed of drilling fluid from the bottom of the hole, i.e. the larger the diameter of drilling hole, the larger the desired displacement. The return speed of drilling fluid should reach the requirement that can wash away the debris and rock powder cut by the drill from the bottom of the hole in a timely manner, and reliably carry them to the earth surface. When drilling geological core, the speed is generally in range of 0.4 to 1.0 m^3/min.

===Pressure===
The pressure size of the pump depends on the depth of the drilling hole, the resistance of flushing fluid (drilling fluid) through the channel, as well as the nature of the conveying drilling fluid. The deeper the drilling hole and the greater the pipeline resistance, the higher the pressure needed.

With the changes of drilling hole diameter and depth, it requires that the displacement of the pump can be adjusted accordingly. In the mud pump mechanism, the gearbox or hydraulic motor is equipped to adjust its speed and displacement. In order to accurately grasp the changes in pressure and displacement, a flow meter and pressure gauge are installed in the mud pump.

==Characteristics==
# The structure is simple and easy for disassembly and maintenance,
# smooth operation, small vibration and low noise,
# it can deliver high concentration and high viscosity (less than 10000 PaS) suspended slurry,
# the drilling fluid flow is stable, no overcurrent, pulsation and stirred, shear slurry phenomena,
# the discharge pressure has nothing to do with the speed, low flow can also maintain a high discharge pressure,
# displacement is proportional to the speed, by shifting mechanism or motor, one can adjust the displacement,
# it has high self-absorption ability, and can suck liquid directly without bottom valve.

==Maintenance==
The construction department should have a special maintenance worker that is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the machine. mud pumps and other mechanical equipment should be inspected and maintained on a scheduled and timely basis to find and address problems ahead of time, in order to avoid unscheduled shutdown. The worker should attend to the size of the sediment particles; when finding large particles, the mud pump wearing parts should frequently be checked for repairing needs or replacement. The wearing parts for mud pumps include pump casing, bearings, impeller, piston, liner, etc. Advanced antiwear measures should be adopted to increase the service life of the wearing parts, which can reduce the investment cost of the project, and improve production efficiency. At the same time, wearing parts and other mud pump parts should be repaired rather than replaced when possible.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:_NSAKEY}}
{{context|date=March 2018}}
In [[computer security]] and [[cryptography]], '''_NSAKEY''' was a [[variable (computer science)|variable]] name discovered in [[Windows NT 4]] [[Windows NT 4.0#Service Packs|Service Pack]] 5 (which had been released unstripped of its [[Debug symbol|symbolic debugging]] data) in August 1999 by Andrew D. Fernandes of Cryptonym Corporation. That variable contained a 1024-bit [[public key]].

== Overview ==
[[Microsoft]]'s [[operating system]]s require all [[cryptography]] suites that work with its operating systems to have a [[digital signature]]. Since only Microsoft-approved cryptography suites can be installed or used as a component of Windows, it is possible to keep export copies of this operating system (and products with Windows installed) in compliance with the [[Export Administration Regulations]] (EAR), which are enforced by the [[US Department of Commerce]] [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (BIS).

It was already known that Microsoft used two keys, a primary and a spare, either of which can create valid signatures. Microsoft had failed to remove the debugging symbols in ADVAPI32.DLL, a security and encryption driver, when it released Service Pack 5 for [[Windows NT 4.0]], and Andrew Fernandes, chief scientist with Cryptonym, found the primary key stored in the variable _KEY and the second key was labeled _NSAKEY.&lt;ref name="Cryptonym"&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft, the NSA, and You |publisher=Cryptonym |date=1999-08-31 |url=http://www.cryptonym.com/hottopics/msft-nsa/msft-nsa.html  |accessdate=2007-01-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000617094917/http://www.cryptonym.com/hottopics/msft-nsa/msft-nsa.html |archivedate = 17 June 2000}} ([[Internet Archive]] / [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]])&lt;/ref&gt;  Fernandes published his discovery, touching off a flurry of speculation and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], including the possibility that the second key was owned by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (the NSA) and allowed the intelligence agency to subvert any Windows user's security.&lt;ref name= "CNN"&gt;{{cite web |title= NSA key to Windows: an open question |publisher=CNN |date=1999-09-04 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/03/windows.nsa.02/ |accessdate=2007-01-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151005212459/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/03/windows.nsa.02/ |archivedate=October 2015}} ([[Internet Archive]] / [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]])&lt;/ref&gt;

During a presentation at the [[Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference|Computers, Freedom and Privacy]] 2000 (CFP2000) conference, [[Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)|Duncan Campbell]], senior research fellow at the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC), mentioned the _NSAKEY controversy as an example of an outstanding issue related to security and surveillance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In addition, Dr. Nicko van Someren found  a third key in Windows 2000, which he doubted had a legitimate purpose, and declared that "It looks more fishy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How NSA access was built into Windows |publisher=Heise  |date=1999-01-04 |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/5/5263/1.html |accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microsoft's reaction ==
Microsoft denied the speculations on _NSAKEY. "This report is inaccurate and unfounded. The key in question is a Microsoft key. It is maintained and safeguarded by Microsoft, and we have not shared this key with the NSA or any other party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Microsoft Says Speculation About Security and NSA Is "Inaccurate and Unfounded"|publisher=Microsoft Corp.|date=1999-09-03|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/sept99/rsapr.mspx|accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft said that the key's symbol was "_NSAKEY" because the NSA is the technical review authority for U.S. export controls, and the key ensures compliance with U.S. export laws.&lt;ref name="NoBackdoor"/&gt;

Richard Purcell, Microsoft’s Director of Corporate Privacy, approached Campbell after his presentation and expressed a wish to clear up the confusion and doubts about _NSAKEY. Immediately after the conference, Scott Culp, of the Microsoft Security Response Center, contacted Campbell and offered to answer his questions. Their correspondence began cordially but soon became strained; Campbell apparently felt Culp was being evasive and Culp apparently felt that Campbell was hostilely repeating questions that he had already answered. On 28 April 2000, Culp stated that "we have definitely reached the end of this discussion ... [which] is rapidly spiraling into the realm of conspiracy theory"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows NSAKEY Controversy |publisher=Rice University |url=http://www.stat.rice.edu/~dobelman/kstorm.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Campbell's further inquiries went unanswered.

Microsoft claimed the third key was only in beta builds of Windows 2000 and that its purpose was for signing [[Cryptographic Service Provider]]s.&lt;ref name="NoBackdoor"&gt;{{cite web |title=There is no "Back Door" in Windows |publisher=Microsoft |date=1999-09-07 |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/security/news/backdoor.mspx?mfr=true |accessdate=2007-01-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000520001558/http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/backdoor.asp |archivedate=2000-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations from other sources ==
Some in the software industry question whether the BXA's EAR has specific requirements for backup keys.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} However, none claim the legal or technical expertise necessary to authoritatively discuss that document.  The following theories have been presented.

Microsoft stated that the second key is present as a backup to guard against the possibility of losing the primary secret key. Fernandes doubts this explanation, pointing out that the generally accepted way to guard against loss of a secret key is [[secret splitting]], which would divide the key into several different parts, which would then be distributed throughout senior management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Analysis by Bruce Schneier |publisher=Counterpane |date=1999-09-15 |url=http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-9909.html#NSAKeyinMicrosoftCryptoAPI |accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that this would be far more robust than using two keys; if the second key is also lost, Microsoft would need to patch or upgrade every copy of Windows in the world, as well as every cryptographic module it had ever signed.

On the other hand, if Microsoft failed to think about the consequences of key loss and created a first key without using [[secret splitting]] (and did so in secure hardware which doesn't allow protection to be weakened after key generation), and the [[NSA]] pointed out this problem as part of the review process, it might explain why Microsoft weakened their scheme with a second key and why the new one was called _NSAKEY. (The second key might be backed up using [[secret splitting]], so losing both keys needn't be a problem.)

A second possibility is that Microsoft included a second key to be able to sign cryptographic modules outside the United States, while still complying with the BXA's EAR. If cryptographic modules were to be signed in multiple locations, using multiple keys is a reasonable approach. However, no cryptographic module has ever been found to be signed by _NSAKEY, and Microsoft denies that any other certification authority exists.

Microsoft denied that the NSA has access to the _NSAKEY secret key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-09-03/tech/9909_03_windows.nsa.02_1_national-security-agency-cryptography-windows-nt4?_s=PM:TECH
|title=NSA key to Windows an open question
|date=3 September 1999
|accessdate=2011-11-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was possible to remove the second _NSAKEY using the following (note this was for Windows software in 1999).

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is good news among the bad, however. It turns out that there is a flaw in the way the "crypto_verify" function is implemented. Because of the way the crypto verification occurs, users can easily eliminate or replace the NSA key from the operating system without modifying any of Microsoft's original
components. Since the NSA key is easily replaced, it means that non-US companies are free to install "strong" crypto services into Windows, without Microsoft's or the NSA's approval. Thus the NSA has effectively removed export control of "strong" crypto from Windows. A demonstration program that replaces the NSA key can be found on Cryptonym's website.&lt;ref name="Cryptonym" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== CAPI Signature Public Keys as PGP Keys ==
In September 1999, an anonymous researcher reverse-engineered both the primary key and the _NSAKEY into [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]-compatible format and published them to the [[key server (cryptographic)|key servers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The reverse-engineered keys |publisher=Cypherspace |date=1999-09-06 |url=http://cypherspace.org/adam/hacks/ms-nsa-key.html |accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is dedicated to the industrial history of Odda and Tyssedal, and more generally to history related to rivers and water, [[hydropower]] production, electricity, power intensive industry and its society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Norsk_Vasskraft-_og_Industristadmuseum|title=Norsk Vasskraft- og Industristadmuseum|publisher=     lokalhistoriewiki.no |accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main attraction is the power station [[Tysso I]], which was designed by architect  [[Thorvald Astrup]] (1876&amp;ndash;1940) and constructed between 1906 and 1918. The station contains machinery and control room equipment from the entire period of operation, 1908&amp;ndash;1989. In 2000 Tyssedal power plant &amp;ndash; including Tysso I, pipelines, distribution pool and watchman's house at Lilletopp, and intake pool and valve house at Vetlevann &amp;ndash; was protected for posterity by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]]. During the following years the power plant went through extensive restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Tysso_I_kraftverk|title=Tysso I kraftverk|publisher=   Store norske leksikon  |author=   Knut A Rosvold|accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to the power station is the former administration building for AS Tyssefaldene, the power generation company that owns and operates the hydropower plant. Today the building houses the museum's exhibitions, library, archives, photo and audio collections, as well as an auditorium. Further upstream it is possible to visit the installations at Lilletopp, Vetlevann and the [[Ringedals Dam]]. Three old workmen's houses in Odda and a small former hydrologic research station at the glacier [[Folgefonna]] are also part of the museum. A [[Via_ferrata#Norway|via ferrata]] has been built that allows safe climbing along the very steep pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://snl.no/AS_Tyssefaldene|title=AS Tyssefaldene|publisher=   Store norske leksikon  |author=   Knut A Rosvold

== History ==
[[Image:X10 Reactor Face.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Workers in 1943 loading uranium slugs into the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] (now a National Historic Landmark)]]

The town of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] was established by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] as part of the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] in 1942 on isolated farm land as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name=bigproblems&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
During the war, advanced research for the government was managed at the site by the [[University of Chicago]].  In 1943, construction of the "Clinton Laboratories" was completed, later renamed to "Oak Ridge National Laboratory".&lt;ref name=bigproblems/&gt;  The site was chosen for the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]], used to show that [[plutonium]] can be created from [[enriched uranium]].  [[Enrico Fermi]] and his colleagues developed the world's second self-sustaining [[nuclear reactor]] after Fermi's previous experiment, the [[Chicago Pile-1]].  The X-10 was the first reactor designed for continuous operation.&lt;ref name=x10&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  After the end of [[World War II]] the demand for weapons-grade plutonium fell and the reactor and the laboratory's 1000 employees were no longer involved in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=bigproblems/&gt;&lt;ref name=swords&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, it was used for scientific research.&lt;ref name=x10/&gt;  In 1946 the first [[medical isotopes]] were produced in the X-10 reactor, and by 1950 almost 20,000 samples had been shipped to various hospitals.&lt;ref name=x10/&gt;&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  As the demand for [[military science]] had fallen dramatically, the future of the lab was uncertain.  Management of the lab was contracted by the US government to [[Monsanto]]; however, they withdrew in 1947.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  The [[University of Chicago]] re-assumed responsibility, until in December 1947 [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide and Carbon Co.]], which already operated two other facilities at Oak Ridge, took control of the laboratory [[Alvin Weinberg]] was named Director of Research, ORNL, and in 1955 Director of the Laboratory.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:MSRE Core.JPG|thumb|The core of the [[Molten Salt Reactor Experiment]]]]

In 1950 the [[Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology]] was established with two courses in reactor operation and safety; almost 1000 students graduated.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  Much of the research performed at ORNL in the 1950s was relating to nuclear reactors as a form of energy production, both for propulsion and electricity.  More reactors were built in the 1950s than in the rest of the ORNL's history combined.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

Another project was the world's first [[light water reactor]].  With its principles of neutron moderation and fuel cooling by ordinary water, it is the direct ancestor of most modern nuclear power stations.  The [[United States Armed Forces|US Military]] funded much of its development, for [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered submarines and ships]] of the [[US Navy]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The [[US Army]] contracted portable nuclear reactors in 1953 for heat and electricity generation in remote military bases.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The reactors were designed at ORNL, produced by [[American Locomotive Company]] and used in [[Greenland]], the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) also contributed funding to three reactors, the lab's first computers, and its first particle accelerators.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  ORNL designed and tested a nuclear-powered aircraft in 1954 as a proof-of-concept for a proposed USAF fleet of long-range bombers, although it never flew.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

The provision of [[radionuclide]]s by X-10 for medicine grew steadily in the 1950s with more isotopes available.  ORNL was the only Western source of [[californium-252]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt; ORNL scientists lowered the [[immune system]]s of mice and performed the world's first successful [[bone marrow transplant]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In the early 1960s there was a large push at ORNL to develop nuclear-powered [[desalination]] plants, where deserts met the sea, to provide water. The project, called Water for Peace, was backed by [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and presented at a 1964 United Nations conference, but increases in the cost of construction and public confidence in nuclear power falling caused the plan to fail.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;  The Health Physics Research Reactor built in 1962 was used for radiation exposure experiments leading to more accurate [[Dosimetry|dosage limits]] and [[dosimeter]]s, and improved radiation shielding.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1964 the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] began with the construction of the reactor. It was operated from 1966 until 1969 (with six months down time to move from [[U-235]] to [[Uranium-233|U-233]] fuel), and proved the viability of [[molten salt reactor]]s, while also producing fuel for other reactors as a byproduct of its own reaction.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] built in 1965 had the highest [[neutron flux]] of any reactor at the time.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  It improved upon the work of the X-10 reactor, producing more medical isotopes, as well as allowing higher fidelity of materials research.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

Researchers in the Biology Division studied the effects of chemicals on mice, including [[air pollution|petrol fumes]], [[Health effects of pesticides|pesticides]], and [[Health effects of tobacco|tobacco]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In the late 1960s, cuts in funding led to the cancellation of plans for another particle accelerator, and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] cut the breeder reactor program by two-thirds, leading to a downsizing in staff from 5000 to 3800.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

[[File:ORMAK.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of ORMAK, an early [[tokamak]], was gold plated for reflectivity]]

In the 1970s, the prospect of [[fusion power]] was strongly considered, sparking research at ORNL.  A [[tokamak]] called ORMAK, made operational in 1971, was the first tokamak to achieve a plasma temperature of 20 million Kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  After the success of the fusion experiments, it was enlarged and renamed ORMAK II in 1973; however, the experiments ultimately failed to lead to fusion power plants.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The US Atomic Energy Commission required improved safety standards in the early 1970s for nuclear reactors, so ORNL staff wrote almost 100 requirements covering many factors including fuel transport and earthquake resistance.  In 1972 the AEC held a series of public hearings where emergency cooling requirements were highlighted and the safety requirements became more stringent.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

ORNL was involved in analysing the damage to the core of the [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] after the [[Three Mile Island accident|accident in 1979]].&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

Also in 1972, [[Peter Mazur (biologist)|Peter Mazur]], a biologist at ORNL, froze with [[liquid nitrogen]], thawed and implanted mouse [[embryo]]s in a [[surrogate mother]].  The mouse pups were born healthy.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  The technique is popular in the livestock industry, as it allows the embryos of valuable cattle to be transported easily and a prize cow can have multiple eggs extracted and thus, through [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]], have many more offspring than would naturally be possible.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1974 Alvin Weinberg, director of the lab for 19 years, was replaced by [[Herman Postma]], a fusion scientist.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1977 construction began for 6&amp;nbsp;metre (20&amp;nbsp;foot) [[superconductor|superconducting]] [[electromagnet]]s, intended to control fusion reactions.  The project was an international effort: three electromagnets were produced in the US, one in Japan, one in [[Switzerland]] and the final by remaining European states.  Experimentation continued into the 1980s.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The 1980s brought more changes to ORNL: a focus on efficiency became paramount.

An accelerated climate simulation chamber was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  Materials research into heat resistant [[Ceramic materials|ceramics]] for use in truck and high-tech car engines was performed, building upon the materials research that began in the nuclear reactors of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;  In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established, where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects.  The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policy]] of less government expenditure.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1981, the Holifield Heavy Ion Research Facility, a 25&amp;nbsp;MV particle accelerator, was opened at ORNL.  At the time, Holifield had the widest range of ion species and was twice as powerful as other accelerators, attracting hundreds of guest researchers each year.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The Department of Energy was concerned with the pollution surrounding ORNL and it began clean-up efforts.  Burial trenches and leaking pipes had contaminated the groundwater beneath the lab, and radiation tanks were sitting idle, full of waste.  Estimates of the total cost of clean-up were into the hundreds of millions of US dollars.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

The five older reactors were subjected to safety reviews in 1987, ordered to be deactivated until the reviews were complete.  By 1989 when the High Flux Isotope Reactor was restarted the US supply of certain medical isotopes was depleted.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1989 the former executive officer of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[Alvin Trivelpiece]], became director of ORNL; he remained in the role until 2000.&lt;ref name=swords/&gt;

In 1992, a [[whistleblower]], Charles Varnadore, filed complaints against ORNL, alleging safety violations and retaliation by his superiors.  While an administrative law judge ruled in Varnadore's favor, the Secretary of Labor, [[Robert Reich]], overturned that ruling.  However, Varnadore's case saw prime contractor [[Martin Marietta]] cited for safety violations, and ultimately led to additional whistleblower protection within DOE.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas, Charles Varnadore, whistleblower at lab, dies at 71, [[New York Times]], August 5, 2013, p.B8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===

Housing built at Oak Ridge was located at "Townsite," along with stores and other necessary buildings.  Housing was [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]].  There were separate dorms for single men and women, with houses available for marrieds.  The dorms tended to be overcrowded, with "four sinks for forty-two women."&lt;ref name="Believer"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=[[Millicent G Dillon|Dillon]] |first=Millicent G. |date=June 2011 |title=In the Atomic City |magazine=The Believer |location=San Francisco |publisher=McSweeney's }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of Townsite has now been replaced by the modern city of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee#History|Oak Ridge]].

==Areas of research==
ORNL conducts research and development activities that span a wide range of scientific disciplines. Many research areas have a significant overlap with each other; researchers often work in two or more of the fields listed here. The laboratory's major research areas are described briefly below.
* [[Chemistry|Chemical sciences]] – ORNL conducts both fundamental and applied research in a number of areas, including [[catalysis]], [[Surface chemistry|surface science]] and [[surface chemistry|interfacial chemistry]]; molecular transformations and fuel chemistry; heavy element chemistry and radioactive materials characterization; aqueous solution chemistry and [[geochemistry]]; [[mass spectrometry]] and laser spectroscopy; separations chemistry; materials chemistry including synthesis and characterization of [[polymers]] and other soft materials; chemical biosciences; and [[neutron scattering|neutron science]].
* [[Electron microscopy]]  – ORNL's electron microscopy program investigates key issues in [[condensed matter]], [[materials science|materials]], [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[nanotechnology|nanosciences]].
* [[Nuclear medicine]] – The laboratory's nuclear medicine research is focused on the development of improved reactor production and processing methods to provide medical [[radiopharmacology|radioisotopes]], the development of new radionuclide generator systems, the design and evaluation of new radiopharmaceuticals for applications in nuclear medicine and [[oncology]].
* [[Physics]] – Physics research at ORNL is focused primarily on studies of the fundamental properties of [[matter]] at the [[atom]]ic, [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]], and [[subatomic particle|subnuclear]] levels and the development of experimental devices in support of these studies.
* Population – ORNL provides federal, state and international organizations with a gridded population database, called Landscan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/landscan |title=LandScan Home |publisher=Ornl.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for estimating ambient population. LandScan is a raster image, or grid, of population counts, which provides human population estimates every 30 x 30 arc seconds, which translates roughly to population estimates for 1 kilometer square windows or grid cells at the equator, with cell width decreasing at higher latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;LandScan Home, [http://www.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/ ornl.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Though many population datasets exist, LandScan is the best spatial population dataset, which also covers the globe. Updated annually (although data releases are generally one year behind the current year) offers continuous, updated values of population, based on the most recent information.  Landscan data are accessible through [[GIS]] applications and a [[USAID]] public domain application called Population Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationexplorer.com/ |title=Populationexplorer.com |publisher=Populationexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
The laboratory has a long history of energy research; nuclear reactor experiments have been conducted since the end of World War II in 1945. Because of the availability of reactors and high-performance computing resources an emphasis on improving the efficiency of nuclear reactors is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel Cycle and Isotopes Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/division_fcid.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rnsd&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/rnsd/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs develop more efficient materials, more accurate simulations of aging reactor cores, sensors and controls as well as safety procedures for regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name=rnsd/&gt;

The Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program (EEETP) aims to improve air quality in the US and reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies.&lt;ref name=eetp&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ees/factsheets/fs_eere.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three key areas of research; electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production.

Unlike conventional [[inorganic]] conductors and [[semiconductor]]s, organic electronic materials are constructed from [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon-based) small molecules or polymers using synthetic strategies developed in the context of organic and polymer chemistry. One of the promised benefits of organic electronics is their potential low cost compared to traditional inorganic electronics.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen Klauk (Ed.)

Relative to metals, they have mechanical [[flexibility]]. Some have high [[thermal stability]].

==History==
One class of materials of interest in organic electronics are electrical [[Electrical conductor|conductive]], i.e. substances that can transmit electrical [[Electric charge|charges]] with low resistivity. Traditionally, conductive materials are [[inorganic]]. Classical (and still technologically dominant) conductive materials are [[metals]] such as [[copper]] and [[aluminum]] as well as many [[alloy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electrical Conductivity – History |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2321/Electrical-Conductivity-History.html |publisher=Net Industries and its LicensorsNet Industries and its Licensors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reported organic conductive material, [[polyaniline]], was described by [[Henry Letheby]] in 1862. Work on other polymeric organic materials began in earnest in the 1960s, A high conductivity of 1 S/cm (S = [[Siemens (unit)|Siemens]]) was reported in 1963 for a derivative of tetraiodopyrrole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electronic Conduction in Polymers.

The 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan G. MacDiarmid]], and [[Hideki Shirakawa]] jointly for their work on conductive polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/ |publisher=Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These and many other workers identified large families of electrically conducting polymers including [[polythiophene]], [[polyphenylene sulfide]], and others.

In the 1950s, a second class of electric conductors were discovered based on charge-transfer salts.  Early examples were derivatives of [[polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] [[aromatic]] compounds.  For example, [[pyrene]] was shown to form semiconducting charge-transfer complex [[salts]] with [[halogens]]. In 1972, researchers found metallic conductivity(conductivity comparable to a metal) in the charge-transfer complex TTF-TCNQ.

Conductive [[plastic]]s have undergone development for applications in industry. In 1987, the first organic [[diode]] was produced at [[Eastman Kodak]] by [[Ching W. Tang]] and [[Steven Van Slyke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1557/mrs.2012.125 |title=Energy efficiency with organic electronics: Ching W.

The initial characterization of the basic properties of [[Poly(p-phenylene vinylene)|polymer]] light emitting diodes, demonstrating that the light emission phenomenon was injection electroluminescence and that the frequency response was sufficiently fast to permit video display applications, was reported by [[Donal Bradley|Bradley]], [[Jeremy Burroughes|Burroughes]], [[Richard Friend|Friend]], et al. in a 1990 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] paper.

==Conductive organic materials==
[[File:Semiconducting small molecules.png|thumb|Typical semiconducting small molecules]]
Organic conductive materials can be grouped into two main classes: conductive polymers and conductive [[molecule|molecular]] solids and salts.

&lt;!-- the following says nothing new--&gt;

===Molecular solids and salts===
Semiconducting small molecules include [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polycyclic aromatic]] compounds such as [[pentacene]] and [[rubrene]].

===Conductive polymers===
Conductive polymers are often typically intrinsically conductive or at least semiconductors. They sometimes show mechanical properties comparable to those of conventional organic polymers. Both [[organic chemistry|organic]] synthesis and advanced [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] techniques can be used to tune the [[electrical]] properties of conductive polymers, unlike typical [[inorganic]] conductors. The most well-studied class of conductive polymers include [[polyacetylene]], [[polypyrrole]], [[polyaniline]], and their [[copolymers]]. Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) and its [[derivative]]s are used for [[electroluminescent]] semiconducting polymers. Poly(3-alkythiophenes) are also a typical [[Chemical substance|material]] for use in [[solar cell]]s and [[transistor]]s.

==Organic light-emitting diode==
{{Main article|Organic Light Emitting Diode|AMOLED}}
An [[OLED]] (organic light-emitting diode) consists of a thin film of organic material that emits light under stimulation by an electric current. A typical OLED consists of an anode, a cathode, OLED organic material and a conductive layer.

===Discovery of OLED===
[[André Bernanose]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bernanose, A. |author2=Comte, M. |author3=Vouaux, P. |journal=J. Chim. Phys. |year=1953 |volume=50 |pages=64 |title=A new method of light emission by certain organic compounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bernanose, A. |author2=Vouaux, P. |journal=J. Chim. Phys. |year=1953 |volume=50 |pages=261 |title=Organic electroluminescence type of emission}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first person to observe [[electroluminescence]] in organic [[Chemical substance|materials]], and Ching W. Tang,&lt;ref name=ApplPhy87/&gt; reported fabrication of an OLED device in 1987. The OLED device incorporated a double-layer structure motif consisting of separate hole transporting and [[electron]]-transporting layers, with light [[emission (radiocommunications)|emission]] taking place in between the two layers. Their discovery opened a new [[era]] of current OLED research and device design.

===Classification and current research===
OLED organic [[Chemical substance|materials]] can be divided into two major families: small-molecule-based and polymer-based. Small molecule OLEDs (SM-OLEDs) include [[organometallic]] [[chelate]]s(Alq3),&lt;ref name=ApplPhy87&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.98799 |title=Organic electroluminescent diodes |year=1987 |last1=Tang |first1=C.

A. |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=51 |page=913 |issue=12 |bibcode=1987ApPhL..51..913T}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fluorescent]] and [[phosphorescent]] dyes, and conjugated [[dendrimers]]. [[Fluorescent]] [[dye]]s can be selected according to the desired range of [[emission (radiocommunications)|emission]] [[wavelength]]s; compounds like [[perylene]] and [[rubrene]] are often used. Very recently, Dr. Kim J. et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kim |first=Jinsang |author2=Onas Bolton |title=Activating efficient phosphorescence from purely organic materials by crystal design |journal=Nature Chemistry |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=205–210 |doi=10.1038/nchem.984 |pmid=21336325 |bibcode=2011NatCh...3..207B |last3=Kim |first3=Hyong-Jun |last4=Lin |first4=Kevin Y. |last5=Kim |first5=Jinsang}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[University of Michigan]] reported a pure organic light emitting [[crystal]], Br6A, by modifying its [[halogen]] bonding, they succeeded in tuning the [[phosphorescence]] to different wavelengths including green, blue and red. By modifying the structure of Br6A, scientists are attempting to achieve a next generation organic light emitting diode. Devices based on small molecules are usually fabricated by [[thermal]] [[evaporation]] under [[vacuum]]. While this method enables the formation of well-controlled homogeneous [[film]]; is hampered by high cost and limited scalability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1317547 |title=Role of CsF on electron injection into a conjugated polymer |year=2000 |last1=Piromreun |first1=Pongpun |last2=Oh |first2=Hwansool |last3=Shen |first3=Yulong |last4=Malliaras |first4=George G. |last5=Scott |first5=J.

Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), similar to SM-OLED, emit light under an applied electric current. Polymer-based OLEDs are generally more efficient than SM-OLEDs requiring a comparatively lower amount of [[energy]] to produce the same luminescence. Common polymers used in PLEDs include [[derivative]]s of poly(p-phenylene vinylene)&lt;ref name="Polyphenylene vinylene"/&gt; and [[polyfluorene]]. The emitted [[color]] can be tuned by substitution of different [[side chain]]s onto the polymer backbone or modifying the stability of the polymer. In contrast to SM-OLEDs, polymer-based OLEDs cannot be fabricated through [[vacuum evaporation]], and must instead be processed using solution-based techniques. Compared to thermal evaporation, [[solution]] based methods are more suited to creating [[film]]s with large dimensions.

==Organic field-effect transistor==
{{Main article|Organic Field-Effect Transistor}}
[[File:Rubrene.svg|thumb|Rubrene-OFET with the highest charge mobility]]
An [[Organic field-effect transistor]] is a field-effect transistor utilizing organic molecules or polymers as the active semiconducting layer. A field-effect transistor ([[FET]]) is any semiconductor material that utilizes [[electric field]] to control the shape of a channel of one type of [[charge (physics)|charge]] carrier, thereby changing its conductivity. Two major classes of [[FET]] are n-type and p-type semiconductor, classified according to the charge type carried. In the case of organic FETs (OFETs), p-type OFET compounds are generally more stable than n-type due to the susceptibility of the latter to oxidative damage.

===Discovery of the OFET===
J.E. Lilienfeld&lt;ref name=patent&gt;Lilienfeld, J.E. (1930-01-28). {{Cite patent|US|1745175}} "Method and apparatus for controlling electric currents"&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed the [[field-effect transistor]] in 1930, but the first OFET was not reported until 1987, when Koezuka et al. constructed one using [[Polythiophene]]&lt;ref name = Koezuka1988&gt;{{cite journal |title=Field-effect transistor with polythiophene thin film |journal=Synthetic Metals |volume=18 |year=1987 |pages=699–704 |doi=10.1016/0379-6779(87)90964-7 |last1=Koezuka |first1=H. |last2=Tsumura |first2=A. |last3=Ando |first3=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which shows extremely high conductivity. Other conductive polymers have been shown to act as semiconductors, and newly synthesized and characterized compounds are reported weekly in prominent research journals. Many review articles exist documenting the development of these [[Chemical substance|materials]].&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite journal |type=free download |journal=Sci. Technol. Adv.

===Classification of OFETs and current research===
Like OLEDs, OFETs can be classified into small-molecule and polymer-based system. Charge transport in OFETs can be quantified using a measure called carrier mobility; currently, [[rubrene]]-based OFETs show the highest carrier mobility of 20–40&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s). Another popular OFET material is [[Pentacene]]. Due to its low [[solubility]] in most organic [[solvent]]s, it's difficult to fabricate thin film transistors ([[Thin-film transistor|TFTs]]) from pentacene itself using conventional spin-cast or, [[dip coating]] methods, but this obstacle can be overcome by using the derivative TIPS-pentacene. Current research focuses more on thin-film transistor ([[Thin-film transistor|TFT]]) model, which eliminates the usage of conductive materials. Very recently, two studies conducted by Dr. Bao Z.&lt;ref name="Bao 2013 665–671"/&gt; et al. and Dr. Kim J.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kim |first=Jinsang |author2=Bong-Gi Kim |title=A molecular design principle of lyotropic liquid-crystalline conjugated polymers with directed alignment capability for plastic electronics |journal=Nature Materials |year=2013 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=659–664 |doi=10.1038/nmat3595 |bibcode=2013NatMa..12..659K |last3=Chung |first3=Jong Won |last4=Seo |first4=Sungbaek |last5=Koo |first5=Bonwon |last6=Kim |first6=Jinsang}}&lt;/ref&gt;  et al. demonstrated control over the formation of designed [[thin-film transistor]]s. By controlling the formation of [[crystalline]] [[Thin-film transistor|TFT]], it is possible to create an aligned (as opposed to randomly ordered) charge transport pathway, resulting in enhanced charge mobility.

==Organic electronic devices==
{{Main article|Organic photovoltaics|Photovoltaics|Low cost solar cell}}
[[File:Flexible display.jpg|thumb|Organics-based flexible display]]
[[File:Organic photovoltaic material.pdf|thumb|Five structures of organic photovoltaic materials]]
[[Organic solar cell]]s could cut the cost of solar power by making use of inexpensive organic polymers rather than the expensive [[crystalline silicon]] used in most solar cells. What's more, the polymers can be processed using low-cost equipment such as ink-jet printers or [[coating]] equipment employed to make [[photographic film]], which reduces both capital and operating costs compared with conventional solar-cell manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/21574/page1/ |title=Mass Production of Plastic Solar Cells |publisher=Technology Review |author=Bullis, Kevin |date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon [[thin-film solar cell]]s on flexible substrates allow a significant cost reduction of large-area photovoltaics for several reasons:&lt;ref name="ipe.uni-stuttgart.de"&gt;Koch, Christian (2002) [http://www.ipe.uni-stuttgart.de/index.php?lang=eng&amp;pulldownID=12&amp;ebene2ID=18&amp;ID=3394 Niedertemperaturabscheidung von Dünnschicht-Silicium für Solarzellen auf Kunststofffolien], Doctoral Thesis, ipe.uni-stuttgart.de&lt;/ref&gt;

# The so-called '[[roll-to-roll]]'-deposition on flexible sheets is much easier to realize in terms of technological effort than deposition on fragile and heavy [[glass sheet]]s.
# Transport and installation of lightweight flexible solar cells also saves cost as compared to cells on glass.

Inexpensive polymeric substrates like [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) or [[polycarbonate]] (PC) have the potential for further cost reduction in photovoltaics. [[Protocrystalline|Protomorphous]] solar cells prove to be a promising concept for efficient and low-cost photovoltaics on cheap and flexible substrates for large-area production as well as small and mobile applications.&lt;ref name="ipe.uni-stuttgart.de"/&gt;

One advantage of printed electronics is that different electrical and electronic components can be printed on top of each other, saving space and increasing reliability and sometimes they are all transparent. One ink must not damage another, and low temperature annealing is vital if low-cost flexible materials such as paper and [[plastic film]] are to be used. There is much sophisticated engineering and chemistry involved here, with iTi, Pixdro, Asahi Kasei, Merck &amp; Co.|Merck, BASF, HC Starck, Hitachi Chemical and Frontier Carbon Corporation among the leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Raghu Das, IDTechEx |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2008/09/25/44587/printed-electronics-is-it-a-niche.htm |title=Printed electronics, is it a niche? – 25 September 2008 |work=Electronics Weekly |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Electronic device]]s based on [[organic compound]]s are now widely used, with many new products under development. [[Sony]] reported the first full-color, video-rate, flexible, plastic display made purely of organic [[Chemical substance|materials]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/200705/07-053/index.html プラスチックフィルム上の有機TFT駆動有機ELディスプレイで世界初のフルカラー表示を実現]. sony.co.jp (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinktentacle.com/2007/05/flexible-full-color-organic-el-display/ Flexible, full-color OLED display]. pinktentacle.com (2007-06-24).&lt;/ref&gt; [[television]] screen based on OLED materials; [[biodegradable]] electronics based on organic compound and low-cost organic [[solar cell]] are also available.

===Fabrication methods===
There are important differences between the processing of small molecule organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers. Small molecule semiconductors are quite often [[insoluble]] and typically require [[deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] via vacuum [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. While usually [[thin film]]s of soluble conjugated polymers. Devices based on conductive polymers can be prepared by solution processing methods. Both solution processing and vacuum based methods produce amorphous and [[polycrystalline]] films with variable degree of disorder. "Wet" [[coating]] techniques require polymers to be dissolved in a volatile [[solvent]], filtered and deposited onto a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]]. Common examples of solvent-based coating techniques include drop casting, [[spin-coating]], doctor-blading, [[inkjet printing]] and [[screen printing]]. Spin-coating is a widely used technique for small area [[thin film]] production. It may result in a high degree of material loss. The doctor-blade technique results in a minimal material loss and was primarily developed for large area thin film production. Vacuum based thermal deposition of small molecules requires [[evaporation]] of molecules from a hot source. The molecules are then transported through vacuum onto a substrate. The process of condensing these molecules on the substrate surface results in thin film formation. Wet coating techniques can in some cases be applied to small molecules depending on their solubility.

===Organic solar cells===
[[File:BilayerElectrode.pdf|thumb|Bilayer organic photovoltaic cell]]
Compared to conventional inorganic solar cell, organic solar cells have the advantage of lower fabrication cost. An [[organic solar cell]] is a device that uses organic [[electronics]] to convert light into electricity. Organic [[solar cell]]s utilize organic [[photovoltaic]] materials, organic semiconductor diodes that convert light into electricity. Figure to the right shows five commonly used organic photovoltaic materials. Electrons in these organic molecules can be delocalized in a delocalized π [[Molecular orbital|orbital]] with a corresponding π* antibonding [[Molecular orbital|orbital]]. The difference in energy between the π orbital, or highest occupied molecular orbital([[HOMO]]), and π* orbital, or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital([[LUMO]]) is called the [[band gap]] of organic photovoltaic materials. Typically, the [[band gap]] lies in the range of 1-4eV.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HallsFriend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoppe"/&gt;

The difference in the [[band gap]] of organic [[photovoltaic]] materials leads to different chemical structures and forms of organic [[solar cell]]s. Different forms of solar cells includes single-layer organic [[photovoltaic]] cells, bilayer organic [[photovoltaic]] cells and heterojunction [[photovoltaic]] cells. However, all three of these types of solar cells share the approach of sandwiching the organic electronic layer between two metallic conductors, typically [[indium tin oxide]].&lt;ref name="McGehee"/&gt;
[[File:Tft.png|thumb|Illustration of thin film transistor device]]

===Organic field-effect transistors===
An organic field-effect transistor device consists of three major components: the source, the drain and the [[Gate (transistor)|gate]]. Generally, a field-effect transistor has two [[plate electrode|plates]], source in contact with drain and the gate respectively, working as conducting [[channel (transistors)|channel]]. The electrons move from source to the drain, and the gate serves to control the [[electron]]s’ movement from source to drain. Different types of [[FET]]s are designed based on [[Charge carrier|carrier]] properties. Thin film transistor ([[Thin-film transistor|TFT]]), among them, is an easy fabricating one. In a [[thin film transistor]], the source and drain are made by directly depositing a thin layer of semiconductor  followed by a thin film of [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] between semiconductor and the metal gate contact. Such a thin film is made by either thermal evaporation, or simply spins coating. In a TFT device, there is no carrier movement between the source and drain. After applying a [[positive charge]], accumulation of [[electron]]s on the [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] cause bending of the semiconductor and ultimately lowers the [[conduction band]] with regards to the [[Fermi]]-level of the semiconductor. Finally, a highly conductive channel is formed at the [[interface (chemistry)|interface]].&lt;ref name=Weimer&gt;{{cite journal |title=TFT – A New Thin-Film Transistor |journal=[[Proc. IRE]] |year=1962 |volume=50 |pages=1462 |author=Weimer, P.K. |doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288190 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
{{Main article|Printed electronics}}

Conductive polymers are lighter, more [[flexible electronics|flexible]], and less expensive than inorganic conductors. This makes them a desirable alternative in many applications. It also creates the possibility of new applications that would be impossible using copper or silicon.

Organic electronics not only includes [[organic semiconductor]]s, but also organic [[dielectric]]s, conductors and [[light emitter]]s.

New applications include [[smart windows]] and [[electronic paper]]. Conductive polymers are expected to play an important role in the emerging science of [[molecular computer]]s.

[[File:Rafale-5.jpg|thumb|The top end of the aircraft's vertical stabilizer contains a Radar warning receiver, part of the Rafale's SPECTRA self defense system]]
'''Radar warning receiver''' ('''RWR''') systems detect the [[radio]] emissions of [[radar]] systems. Their primary purpose is to issue a warning when a radar signal that might be a threat (such as a police [[speed detection radar]] or a fighter jet's fire control radar) is detected. The warning can then be used, manually or automatically, to evade the detected threat. RWR systems can be installed in all kind of airborne, sea-based, and ground-based assets (such as [[aircraft]], [[ship]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[military base]]s). This article is focused mainly on airborne military RWR systems; for commercial police RWR systems, see [[radar detector]].

Depending on the market the RWR system is designed for, it can be as simple as detecting the presence of energy in a specific radar band (such as police radar detectors). For more critical situations, such as military combat, RWR systems are often capable of classifying the source of the radar by the signal's strength, phase and waveform type, such as [[pulsed power]] wave or [[continuous wave]] with [[amplitude modulation]] or frequency modulation ([[chirp]]ed). The information about the signal's strength and waveform can then be used to estimate the most probable type of threat the detected radar poses. Simpler systems are typically installed in less expensive assets like 
[[automobiles]], while more sophisticated systems are installed in mission critical assets such as [[military aircraft]].

==Description==
The RWR usually has a visual display somewhere prominent in the cockpit (in some modern aircraft, in multiple locations in the cockpit) and also generates audible tones which feed into the pilot's (and perhaps [[radar intercept officer|RIO]]/co-pilot/[[guy in back|GIB]]'s in a multi-seat aircraft) headset. The visual display often takes the form of a circle, with symbols displaying the detected radars according to their direction relative to the current aircraft heading (i.e. a radar straight ahead displayed at the top of the circle, directly behind at the bottom, etc.).  The distance from the center of the circle, depending on the type of unit, can represent the estimated distance from the generating radar, or to categorize the severity of threats to the aircraft, with tracking radars placed closer to the center than search radars. The symbol itself is related to the type of radar or the type of vehicle that carries it, often with a distinction made between ground-based radars and airborne radars.

The typical airborne RWR system consists of multiple wideband antennas placed around the aircraft which receive the radar signals. The receiver periodically scans across the frequency band and determines various parameters of the received signals, like frequency, signal shape, direction of arrival, [[pulse repetition frequency]], etc. By using these measurements, the signals are first [[wikt:interleaving|deinterleaved]] to sort the mixture of incoming signals by emitter type. These data are then further sorted by threat priority and displayed.

The RWR is used for identifying, avoiding, evading or engaging threats. For example, a [[fighter aircraft]] on a [[combat air patrol]] (CAP) might notice enemy fighters on the RWR and subsequently use its own radar set to find and eventually engage the threat. In addition, the RWR helps identify and classify threats—it's hard to tell{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} which blips on a radar console-screen are dangerous, but since different fighter aircraft typically have different types of radar sets, once they turn them on and point them near the aircraft in question it may be able to tell, by the direction and strength of the signal, which of the blips is which type of fighter.

A non-combat [[aircraft]], or one attempting to avoid engagements, might turn its own radar off and attempt to steer around threats detected on the RWR. Especially at high altitude (more than 30,000 feet [[above ground level|AGL]]), very few{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} threats exist that don't emit radiation. As long as the pilot is careful to check for aircraft that might try to sneak up without radar, say with the assistance of [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] or [[ground-controlled interception|GCI]], it should be able to steer clear of SAMs, fighter aircraft and high altitude, radar-directed [[anti-aircraft artillery|AAA]].

[[SEAD]] and [[ELINT]] aircraft often have sensitive and sophisticated RWR equipment like the U.S. [[AN/ASQ-213|HTS]] ([[AGM-88 HARM|HARM]] targeting system) pod which is able to find and classify threats which are much further away than those detected by a typical RWR, and may be able to overlay [[threat circles]] on a map in the aircraft's [[multi-function display]] (MFD), providing much better&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/descriptivesum/Y2000/Navy/0603270N.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  information for avoiding or engaging threats, and may even store information to be analyzed later or transmitted to the ground to help the commanders plan future missions.

The RWR can be an important tool for evading threats if avoidance has failed. For example, if a SAM system or enemy fighter aircraft has fired a [[missile]] (for example, a [[SARH]]-guided [[missile]]) at the aircraft, the RWR may be able to detect the change in mode that the radar must use to guide the missile and notify the pilot with much more insistent warning tones and flashing, bracketed symbols on the RWR display. The pilot then can take evasive action to break the [[missile lock-on]] or dodge the [[missile]]. The pilot may even be able to visually acquire the missile after being alerted to the possible launch. What's more, if an actively guided missile is tracking the aircraft, the pilot can use the direction and distance display of the RWR to work out which evasive maneuvers to perform to outrun or dodge the missile. For example, the rate of closure and aspect of the incoming missile may allow the pilot to determine that if they dive away from the missile, it is unlikely to catch up, or if it is closing fast, that it is time to jettison external supplies and turn toward the missile in an attempt to out-turn it. The RWR may be able to send a signal to another defensive system on board the aircraft, such as a Countermeasure Dispensing System (CMDS), which can eject countermeasures such as [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]], to aid in avoidance.

== Example of an RWR display ==
This is what an RWR display might look like and is particularly representative of the AN/ALR-69. It shows a ground-based search [[radar]] nearly straight ahead, an [[SA-6 Gainful|SA-6]] SAM system about 30 degrees to the right of straight ahead (currently the closest and most dangerous threat as indicated by the diamond and hat) and an [[F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighter behind and slightly to the left. The distance of the threats from the center is not necessarily indicative of the threat's absolute range, but rather the proximity to the lethal envelope of the threat. For example, if an [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] and a [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka|ZSU-23-4]] are both dead ahead of the aircraft and at the same range, the SA-2 actually appears nearer to the center of the display because the SA-2 has a much greater lethal envelope than the ZSU-23-4.  The concentric rings on the display signify different 'lethality zones'. The outer ring signifies that the threat is beyond engagement range (i.e., the range it can engage you, not vice versa), the middle ring signifies that the threat is within engagement range, the inner ring equates to a 'no-escape' zone. This ordering of the rings applies to the AN/ALR-69 found in, for example, the F-16.  However, some sources claim the order is reversed on the AN/ALR-67, with the 'critical' zone being the outer ring. In many ways this would make more sense, because it allows greater spacial separation of the highest priority threats on the display, allowing the pilot a greater degree of angular resolution when determining the direction of the threat.

'''Real-time kinematic''' ('''RTK''') positioning is a [[satellite navigation]] technique used to enhance the precision of position data derived from satellite-based positioning systems (global navigation satellite systems, [[GNSS]]) such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], and [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]]. It uses measurements of the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the signal's [[carrier wave]] in addition to the information content of the signal and relies on a single reference station or interpolated virtual station to provide real-time corrections, providing up to [[centimetre]]-level [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]].&lt;ref name="Wanninger2008"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wanninger |first1=Lambert |title=Introduction to Network RTK |url=http://www.wasoft.de/e/iagwg451/intro/introduction.html |website=www.wasoft.de |publisher=IAG Working Group 4.5.1 |accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to GPS in particular, the system is commonly referred to as '''carrier-phase enhancement''', or '''CPGPS'''.&lt;ref name="ubiquitous"/&gt; It has applications in [[Surveying|land survey]], [[hydrographic survey]], and in [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] navigation.

==Overview==

===Background===
{{see also|GPS signals|GNSS positioning calculation}}
The distance between a satellite navigation receiver and a satellite can be calculated from the time it takes for a signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver. To calculate the delay, the receiver must align a [[pseudorandom binary sequence]] contained in the signal to an internally generated pseudorandom binary sequence. Since the satellite signal takes time to reach the receiver, the satellite's sequence is delayed in relation to the receiver's sequence. By increasingly delaying the receiver's sequence, the two sequences are eventually aligned.

The accuracy of the resulting range measurement is essentially a function of the ability of the receiver's electronics to accurately process signals from the satellite, and additional error sources such as non-mitigated ionospheric and tropospheric delays, multipath, satellite clock and ephemeris errors, etc.

===Carrier-phase tracking===
{{see also|GNSS enhancement#Carrier-phase tracking (surveying){{!}}GPS carrier-phase tracking}}
RTK follows the same general concept, but uses the satellite signal's [[carrier wave]] as its signal, ignoring the information contained within. RTK uses a fixed base station and a rover to reduce the rover's position error. The base station transmits correction data to the rover.

As described in the previous section, the range to a satellite is essentially calculated by multiplying the carrier wavelength times the number of whole cycles between the satellite and the rover and adding the phase difference. Determining the number of cycles is non-trivial, since signals may be shifted in phase by one or more cycles. This results in an error equal to the error in the estimated number of cycles times the wavelength, which is 19&amp;nbsp;cm for the L1 signal. Solving this so-called '''integer ambiguity search''' problem results in centimeter precision. The error can be reduced with sophisticated statistical methods that compare the measurements from the C/A signals and by comparing the resulting ranges between multiple satellites.

The improvement possible using this technique is potentially very high if one continues to assume a 1%&amp;nbsp;accuracy in locking. For instance, in the case of GPS, the coarse-acquisition (C/A) code, which is broadcast in the L1 signal, changes [[Phase (waves)|phase]] at 1.023&amp;nbsp;MHz, but the L1 carrier itself is 1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz, which changes phase over a thousand times more often. A ±1%&amp;nbsp;error in L1 carrier-phase measurement thus corresponds to a ±1.9&amp;nbsp;mm error in baseline estimation.&lt;ref name="precisionag.org"/&gt;

==={{anchor|CORS}}Practical considerations===
In practice, RTK systems use a single base-station receiver and a number of mobile units. The base station re-broadcasts the phase of the carrier that it observes, and the mobile units compare their own phase measurements with the one received from the base station. There are several ways to transmit a correction signal from base station to mobile station. The most popular way to achieve real-time, low-cost signal transmission is to use a [[radio modem]], typically in the [[UHF Band]]. In most countries, certain frequencies are allocated specifically for RTK purposes. Most [[Surveying|land-survey]] equipment has a built-in UHF-band radio modem as a standard option. RTK provides accuracy enhancements up to about 20&amp;nbsp;km from the base station.&lt;ref name="RIETDORF2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=RIETDORF |first1=Anette |last2=DAUB |first2=Christopher |last3=LOEF |first3=Peter |title=Precise Positioning in Real-Time using Navigation Satellites and Telecommunication |journal=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu |date=2006 |volume=PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3rd WORKSHOP ON POSITIONING, NAVIGATION AND COMMUNICATION (WPNC’06) |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.2400&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allows the units to calculate their ''relative'' position to within millimeters, although their absolute position is accurate only to the same accuracy as the computed position of the base station. The typical nominal accuracy for these systems is {{nowrap|1 centimetre ± 2 parts-per-million}} (ppm) horizontally and {{nowrap|2 centimetres ± 2 ppm}} vertically.&lt;ref name="agnav.com"/&gt;

Although these parameters limit the usefulness of the RTK technique for general navigation, the technique is perfectly suited to roles like surveying. In this case, the base station is located at a known surveyed location, often a [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]], and the mobile units can then produce a highly accurate map by taking fixes relative to that point. RTK has also found uses in autodrive/autopilot systems, [[precision farming]], [[Machine control|machine control systems]] and similar roles.

The '''RTK networks''' extend the use of RTK to a larger area containing a network of reference stations.&lt;ref name="Gakstatter2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gakstatter |first1=Eric |title=RTK Networks – What, Why, Where? |url=https://www.gps.gov/cgsic/meetings/2009/gakstatter1.pdf |website=www.gps.gov |publisher=USSLS/CGSIC Meeting 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operational reliability and accuracy depend on the density and capabilities of the reference-station network.

A '''Continuously Operating Reference Station''' (CORS) network is a network of RTK base stations that broadcast corrections, usually over an Internet connection. Accuracy is increased in a CORS network, because more than one station helps ensure correct positioning and guards against a false initialization of a single base station.

[[Image:R-evolve-Rotary-Storage-System.jpg|thumb|right|Rotary storage filing system unit]]
'''Rotary storage''' systems are specialised office filing units designed to offer increased storage volumes per square foot compared to traditional filing units.

== Rotary storage systems ==
Rotary storage systems are [[filing cabinets]]; specialised [[office furniture]] units usually consisting of a double sided rotating unit, allowing the user to access two full sides of filing from one point. A foot pedal or lever is often used to operate the rotation mechanism, thus allowing user easy control.

== Capacity, siting and speed advantages ==
Many rotary filing systems can store the contents of seventeen four drawer filing cabinets in just three eight-tier units, allowing multiple times the storage volume created by traditional filing cabinets.  A wide range of fitments makes the systems suitable for storing a vast array file types and multimedia. For security, each unit can invariably be locked individually.

Rotary storage systems usually have no shutters or doors, and therefore can be placed very close to walls or partitioning, for a very efficient use of floor space. Units are often used to divide office space.

Rotary storage units can allow faster file access than banks of conventional cabinets, as 50% of stored items are immediately visible to the operator, the rest typically being a pedal push away.

'''Ryszard S. Michalski''' (May 7, 1937 – September 20, 2007) was a Polish-American computer scientist. Michalski was Professor at [[George Mason University]] and a pioneer in the field of [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;

==Biography==
Michalski was born in Kalusz near Lvov on 7 May 1937.

He received an equivalent of Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at the Universities of Technology in Kraków and Warsaw in 1959; obtained M.S. Computer Science at the Polytechnic Institute of
St. Petersburg in 1961; and Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice in 1969. In the period 1962–1970 he worked at the Institute of Automation of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (PAS) in Warsaw, during which he and  Jacek Karpiński developed an early successful learning system for recognizing handwritten alpha-numeric characters.

He emigrated to America in 1970, worked at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] until moved with his research group to the [[George Mason University]] in 1988. Although leaving Poland, he worked part-time at the Institute of Computer Science of PAS in Warsaw.

Ryszard S. Michalski died on 20 September 2007 from cancer at his home in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Ryszard Michalski; Shaped How Machines Learn |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic life==
Michalski was cofounder of Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory at George Mason University.  He earned a patent for the university with Learnable Non-Darwinian Evolution Model (LEM), a form of evolutionary computation, in 2003.

He cofounded the [[Machine Learning (journal)|Journal of Machine Learning]] in 1986 and helped organize the first international multistrategy machine learning conferences in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mli.gmu.edu/papers/91-95/91-31.pdf Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Multistrategy Learning, Michalski, R. S. &amp; Tecuci, G. (Eds.), Harpers Ferry, WV, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work===
Michalski influenced wide areas, notably in machine learning, but also in the broadly understood areas of data analysis and knowledge discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koronacki  |first=Jacek  |date=2010 |title=Advances in Machine Learning I: Dedicated to the Memory of Professor Ryszard S.

'''Salted fish''', such as [[Kipper|kippered herring]] or [[dried and salted cod]], is fish [[curing (food preservation)|cured]] with dry [[salt]] and thus [[food preservation|preserved]] for later eating. [[Drying (food)|Drying]] or [[Salting (food)|salting]], either with dry salt or with [[brine]], was the only widely available method of preserving fish until the 19th century. [[Dried fish]] and salted fish (or fish both dried and salted) are a staple of diets in the [[Caribbean]], [[North Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Southern China]], [[Scandinavia]], parts of [[Canada]] including [[Newfoundland]], coastal [[Russia]], and in the [[Arctic]]. Like other [[salt-cured meat]]s, it provides preserved animal protein even in the absence of [[refrigeration]].

==Method==
[[File:PasarKlender5.jpg|thumb|left|Various salted fish sold in a marketplace in a suburb of [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]
[[Salting (food)|Salting]] is the [[preservation of food]] with dry [[edible salt]].&lt;ref name="uog"&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html "Historical Origins of Food Preservation."] [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp University of Georgia, National Center for Home Food Preservation]. Accessed Mat 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[pickling]] (preparing food with [[brine]], i.e. salty water), and is one of the oldest methods of preserving food.&lt;ref name="uog"/&gt; Salt inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s by drawing water out of microbial cells through [[osmosis]]. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted [[bacterium|bacteria]]. [[Smoking (food)|Smoking]], often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required. Salting is used because most [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and other potentially pathogenic [[organism]]s cannot survive in a highly salty environment, due to the [[Tonicity|hypertonic]] nature of salt.  Any living cell in such an environment will become dehydrated through osmosis and die or become temporarily inactivated.

The [[water activity]], a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, in a fish is defined as the ratio of the [[water vapour]] pressure in the flesh of the fish to the vapour pressure of pure water at the same temperature and pressure. It ranges between 0 and 1, and is a parameter that measures how available the water is in the flesh of the fish. Available water is necessary for the microbial and enzymatic reactions involved in spoilage. There are a number of techniques that have been or are used to tie up the available water or remove it by reducing the a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;. Traditionally, techniques such as [[Stockfish|drying]], [[Salt-cured meat|salting]] and [[Smoked fish|smoking]] have been used, and have been used for thousands of years. In more recent times, [[freeze-drying]], water binding [[humectant]]s, and fully automated equipment with temperature and humidity control have been added. Often a combination of these techniques is used.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation"&gt;FAO: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/12322/en Preservation techniques] Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome.

A '''self-propelled modular transporter''' or sometimes '''self-propelled modular trailer''' (SPMT) is a platform vehicle with a large array of wheels. SPMTs are used for transporting massive objects such as large bridge sections,&lt;ref name="bridges"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/pubs/07022/chap00.cfm |title=Manual on Use of Self-Propelled Modular Transporters to Remove and Replace Bridges |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil refining equipment, motors and other objects that are too big or heavy for [[truck]]s. Trucks can however provide traction and braking for the SPMTs on inclines and descents.

SPMTs are used in many industry sectors worldwide such as the construction and oil industries, in the shipyard and offshore industry, for road transportation, on plant construction sites and even for moving [[oil platforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scheuerle.com/en/products/new-vehicles/plant-construction.html |title=Products |publisher=Scheuerle |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently in addition, they have begun to be used to replace bridge spans in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.nicolas.fr/en/home/press/press/the-fascination-of-bridge-construction-nicolas-involved-in-the-building-of-the-chongqi-bridge-in-china/17/ffdcb6ac23.html |title=Press: NICOLAS - leading manufacturer of heavy load transporters |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2017-02-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106171304/http://www.nicolas.fr/en/home/press/press/the-fascination-of-bridge-construction-nicolas-involved-in-the-building-of-the-chongqi-bridge-in-china/17/ffdcb6ac23.html |archivedate=2011-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently [[Canada]].

A typical SPMT has a grid of computer-controlled axles, usually 2 axles across and 4–8 axles along.&lt;ref name="scheuerle"&gt;https://www.scheuerle.com/fileadmin/data_all/files/Self-Propelled_Transporters_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When two (or more) axles are placed side-by-side, this is called an axle line. All axles are individually controllable, in order to evenly distribute weight and steer accurately. Each axle can swivel through 270°, with some manufacturers offering up to a full 360° of motion. The axles are coordinated by the control system to allow the SPMT to turn, move sideways or even spin in place. Some SPMTs allow the axles to telescope independently of each other so that the load can be kept flat and evenly distributed while moving over uneven terrain. Each axle can also contain a [[Hydrostatic transmission|hydrostatic drive]] unit.  

A hydraulic power pack can be attached to the SPMT to provide power for steering, suspension and drive functions. This power pack is driven by an internal combustion engine. A single power pack can drive a string of SPMTs.  As SPMTs often carry the world's heaviest loads on wheeled vehicles, they are very slow, often moving at under one mile per hour while fully loaded. Some SPMTs are controlled by a worker with a hand-held control panel, while others have a driver cabin. Multiple SPMTs can be linked (lengthwise and side-by-side) to transport massive building-sized objects. The linked SPMTs can be controlled from a single control panel.

The first modular self-propelled trailers were built in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, heavy haulage company [[Mammoet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mammoetbenelux.nl/Overonsbedrijf/Historie.aspx |title=Mammoet Benelux &gt; Over ons bedrijf &gt; Historie |publisher=Mammoetbenelux.nl |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; refined the concept into the form we see today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cranestodaymagazine.com/news/the-first-self-propelled-modular-trailers/ |title=The first self-propelled modular trailers - Cranes Today |publisher=Cranestodaymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They set the width of the modules to 2.44 m, so the modules would fit on an ISO container flatrack. They also added 360° steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heavyliftnews.com/news/30-years-spmt-self-propelled-modular-transporter-scheuerle-8000-axle-lines-world-motion |title=30 years of SPMT (Self Propelled Modular Transporter) from SCHEUERLE – over 8,000 axle lines keep the world in motion |publisher=Heavyliftnews.com |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They commissioned Scheuerle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kamag.com/company/milestones.html |title=Milestones |publisher=KAMAG |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop and build the first units. Deliveries started in 1983. The two companies defined standard units: a 4-axle SPMT, a 6-axle SPMT and a power pack. Over the years, more modules were added to this system&lt;ref name="scheuerle" /&gt; to accommodate a range of payloads.

In 2016 ESTA (the European Association of Abnormal Load Transport and Mobile Cranes) published the first SPMT Best Practice Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estaeurope.eu/ESTABPGSPMT|title=ESTA SPMT Best Practice Guide Published|last=|first=|date=|website=estaeurope.eu|publisher=ESTA|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help address the problem of trailers tipping over, which has happened on some occasions even though the operating rules and stability calculations have been precisely followed.
[[File:SPMT Transport and Positioning.jpg|thumb|Collett &amp; Sons SPMT Transport]]
Some shipbuilding companies have started to use SPMT instead of gantry cranes for carrying ship sections. This has reduced the cost for transporting loads by millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anstertrailer.com/spmt-self-propelled-modular-transporter-design-specifications/#11Applications_of_SPMT|title=What is SPMT?

Executing the salvage operation of the sunken ferry [[MV Sewol|MV ''Sewol'']] in the East China Sea in 2017, the company [[ALE (company)|ALE]] used SPMTs totalling 600 axle lines and a load weight of 17,000 t, beating two world records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ale-heavylift.com/case-study/salvage-operation-sewol-ferry-east-china-sea/ Load-in of Sewol ferry, East China Sea] ale-heavylift.com, 15 June 2017 (08:43), retrieved 20 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ale-heavylift.com/news/ale-break-spmt-world-record-during-complex-salvage-ferry-operation-in-south-korea-2/ ALE break SPMT world record during complex salvage ferry operation in South Korea] ale-heavylift.com, 15 June 2017 (08:47), retrieved 20 December 2017. – Remaining mud as 4.000 t extra weight.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stereopticon''' is a [[slide projector]] or "[[magic lantern]]", which has two lenses, usually one above the other.
These devices date back to the mid 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were a popular form of entertainment and education before the advent of [[motion picture|moving pictures]]. Americans William and [[Frederick Langenheim]] introduced stereopticon slide technology—slide shows of projected images on glass—in 1850.  For a usual fee of ten cents, people could view realistic images of nature, history, and science themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magiclanternsociety.org/about-magic-lanterns/lantern-slides/|title=Lantern Slides {{!}} Magic Lantern Society|website=www.magiclanternsociety.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two lenses are used to dissolve between images when projected. At first, the shows used random images, but over time, lanternists began to place the slides in logical order, creating a narrative.  This "visual storytelling" with technology directly preceded the development of the first moving pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term stereopticon has been widely misused to name a [[stereoscope]]. A stereopticon will not project or display stereoscopic/[[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] images on cards. All stereopticons can be classified as [[Magic lantern|magic lanterns]], but not all magic lanterns are stereopticons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2741">A '''submersible drilling rig''' is a [[marine vessel]] design that can be floated to location and lowered onto the sea floor for [[offshore drilling]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Oilfield Glossary : submersible drilling rig| url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=submersible%20drilling%20rig| publisher=[[Schlumberger]]| accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and operation==
The submersible [[drilling platform]] is supported on large [[Floats (nautical)|pontoon]]-like structures. These pontoons provide buoyancy allowing the unit to be towed from location to location.

Once on the location, the pontoon structure is slowly flooded until it rests securely on its anchors, of which there are usually two per corner.

The operating deck is elevated 100 feet above the pontoons on large steel columns to provide clearance above the waves.

After the well is drilled, the water is pumped out of the buoyancy tanks and the vessel is re-floated and towed to the next location.

''Submersibles'', as they are known informally, operate in relatively shallow water, since they must rest on the sea floor. Other floating vessel types are used in deeper water depths. The term [[Offshore drilling|Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit]] (MODU) is generally used for all offshore drilling rigs that can be moved from location to location.

==Evolution==
[[File:Blue Water Rig No. 1.JPG|thumb|Blue Water Rig No. 1]]
The first offshore mobile drilling platform was the [[ODECO|Hayward-Barnsdall]] ''Breton Rig 20'', first operated in 1949.&lt;ref name="Howe"&gt;The Evolution of Offshore Mobile Drilling Units, Richard J. Howe, Esso Production Research Company, Drilling and Production Practice, 1966, American Petroleum Institute 66-120&lt;/ref&gt; This rig had evolved from the inland drilling barges which were used to drill in marshes and protected waters in up to 10 feet of water. The ''Breton Rig 20'' was 160 feet by 85 feet, and could work in 20 feet water depth.

By 1958, the number of submersible drilling rigs had increased to around 30.&lt;ref name="Howe"/&gt;

In 1961, Shell Oil successfully converted an existing submersible rig ''Blue Water Rig No.1'' into the first semi submersible drilling unit for operation in the Gulf of Mexico when it was found to have good stability and motions whilst being towed at a partial draught.&lt;ref&gt;Technology Pioneers - Drilling Semi-submersible Rigs, Ocean Energy Center : http://www.oceanstaroec.com/fame/2000/semisubmersible.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Alden J. Laborde designed and constructed the first purpose-built V-shaped [[Semi-submersible platform|semi-submersible]] drilling rig, ''Ocean Driller'', delivered in 1963.&lt;ref name="Howe"/&gt;

[[Image:Australian bass 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This fine [[Australian bass]] was caught and released on a fizzer equipped with barbless hooks.]]
A '''surface lure''' is a [[fishing]] [[fishing lure|lure]] designed to waddle, pop, lock, drop, pulse, twitch or fizz across the surface of the water as it is retrieved, and in doing so imitate surface prey for fish such as mice, lizards, frogs, cicadas, moths and small injured fish.
A typical surface lure has a solid body made out of wood or plastic, carries one or two [[Fish hook|treble hook]]s, and has an eyelet at the front of the lure body to attach the [[fishing line]].  Waddlers get their action from a scooped metal dish attached to the front of the lure body.  [[Fishing popper|Poppers]] get their action from a cupped face carved or molded into the front of the lure body.  Fizzers get their action both from the fisherman manipulating the lure with the [[fishing rod]] and from one or more blades attached to the lure body, that spin when the lure is pulled and create a fizzing noise said to imitate the buzzing wings of a drowning insect.  

Sizeable fish can create a sudden, noisy and spectacular explosion when they take a surface lure, usually giving the fisherman a fright in the process.  Catching fish on surface lures is therefore considered a fairly exciting form of fishing.

'''''The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies''''' is a 2014 book by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Andrew McAfee]] which is a continuation of their book ''[[Race Against the Machine]]''. They argue that the Second Machine Age involves the automation of a lot of cognitive tasks that make humans and software-driven machines substitutes, rather than complements. They contrast this with what they call the "First Machine Age", or [[Industrial Revolution]], which helped make labor and machines complementary.&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_New_York_Times_July_8_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/opinion/sunday/friedman-if-i-had-a-hammer.html |title=If I Had a Hammer |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 11, 2014 |author= |accessdate= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples that the book cites include "software that grades students' essays more objectively, consistently and quickly than humans" and "news articles on Forbes.com about corporate earnings previews" — "all generated by algorithms without human involvement."&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_Huffington_Post_July_8_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-teuber/the-coming-of-the-second-machine-age_b_4648207.html |title=The Coming of the Second Machine Age |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date= January 22, 2014 |author=Bill Teuber |accessdate= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the authors, the book has three sections. Chapters 1 through 6 describe "the fundamental characteristics of the second machine age," based on many examples of modern use of technology. Then chapters 7 through 11 describe economic impacts of technology in terms of two concepts the authors call "bounty" and "spread." What the authors call "bounty" is their attempt to measure the benefits of new technology in ways reaching beyond such measures as [[GDP]], which they say is inadequate. They use "spread" as a shorthand way to describe the increasing inequality that is also resulting from widespread new technology.

Finally, in chapters 12 through 15, the authors prescribe some policy interventions that could enhance the benefits and reduce the harm of new technologies.

==Reception==
The ''[[Washington Post]]'' says that its strength is how it weaves micro and macroeconomics with insights from other disciplines into an accessible story. It says that the weaknesses of the book are that its policy prescriptions are "straight from the talking points that tech executives have been peddling for years on their visits to the capital", even though they are "perfectly reasonable".&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_Washington_Post_July_8_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/review-the-second-machine-age-by-erik-brynjolfsson-and-andrew-mcafee/2014/01/17/ace0611a-718c-11e3-8b3f-b1666705ca3b_story.html |title=Review: ‘The Second Machine Age,' by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''threshing stone''' is a [[roller (agricultural tool)|roller]]-like tool used for the [[threshing]] of [[wheat]]. Similar to the use of [[threshing-board|threshing boards]], the stone was pulled by horses over a circular pile of harvested wheat on a hardened dirt surface ([[threshing floor]]), and the rolling stone knocked the grain from the head of wheat.  The [[straw]] was removed from the pile and the remaining grain and [[chaff]] was collected.  By a process called [[winnowing]], the grain was tossed into the air to allow the chaff and dirt to be blown away, leaving only the grain.&lt;ref name="Kauffman-Research"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksmuseums.org/news/researching-threshing-stones|title=Kauffman Museum - Researching Threshing Stones|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807172430/http://ksmuseums.org/news/researching-threshing-stones|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Threshing stone cross section, Santa Fe Park, Peabody, Kansas.jpg|thumb|Cross sections of a threshing stone on a monument in [[Peabody, Kansas]]. (2010)]]
Evidence of the use of threshing stones in various forms date from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era, but eventually it became the method of threshing grain by the [[Molotschna]] [[Mennonite]] farmers in the [[Ukraine]] from about 1840 to 1900.  The threshing stone became the preferred method used to knock the grain from the head because it was less labor-intensive than the use of the traditional [[flail|threshing flail]].&lt;ref name="TheshingStone-History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threshingstone.com/History.php|title=The Threshing Stone|date=21 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221073956/http://www.threshingstone.com/History.php|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, approximately one-third of all [[Russian Mennonite]]s immigrated to the [[Great Plains]] of North America.  The immigrants in central [[Kansas]] brought the threshing stone technology with them, and contracted [[stone mason]]s in the [[Florence, Kansas]] area to construct stones made of [[limestone]].&lt;ref name="TheshingStone-History" /&gt;

The use of threshing stones quickly faded as they were superseded by mechanized forms of threshing, especially by [[threshing machine]]s, and eventually all farmers quit using them by around 1900 to 1905.&lt;ref name="TheshingStone-History" /&gt;

==Physical description==
The threshing stone is a [[cylindrical]] stone with teeth carved into it.  Stones made in [[Kansas]] were approximately 29 to 30 inches long, 23 to 24 inches in diameter, with 7 notches (and rarely 8) resembling [[gear]] teeth, made of [[limestone]], and 600 to 800 pounds in weight.&lt;ref name="TheshingStone-History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kauffman-Research" /&gt;  Some smaller stones may weigh less than 400 pounds.&lt;ref name="InmanMuseum" /&gt;

==Locations==
[[File:Santa Fe Park in Peabody, Kansas.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Mennonite Centennial Memorial Monument in Santa Fe Park of [[Peabody, Kansas]].  A threshing stone was cut and placed on 4 sides of this monument. (2010)]]
In 2011, over 90 threshing stones have been located.  Numerous stones in [[Kansas]] are located at private residences as family historic artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threshingstone.com/|title=The Threshing Stone|date=10 January 2014|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110180406/http://threshingstone.com/|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following is a list of locations where threshing stones may be viewed by the public.

[[File:Frutiger MD Quick.jpg|thumb|250px|Drive-through system ''MobyDick Quick'']]
[[File:Frutiger MD Duo.jpg|thumb|250px|Roller ''MobyDick Duo'']]
A '''wheel washing system''' is a device for cleaning the [[tire]]s of [[truck]]s when they are leaving a site, to control and eliminate the pollution of public roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquatechdewatering.com/rentals_sales_wheel.php |title=WHEEL WASH SYSTEMS |publisher=www.aquatechdewatering.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation can be made in or above the ground for either temporary or permanent applications. There are two types of wheel washing systems: roller and drive-through systems.

== Roller system ==
At a roller unit, the truck places each set of wheels on the rollers as it leaves the plant. At this point the washing process is automatically triggered. While the wheels of each axle are rotated automatically, water is sprayed out from strategically placed [[nozzle]]s to clean the tires, wheel wells and mud flaps.

== Drive-through system ==
The advantage of drive-through systems is that the vehicle does not have to stop for cleaning. As the vehicle passes the magnetic-[[sensor]] or photo-sensor at the entrance, the washing process is triggered. During the slow passage (5&amp;nbsp;mph speed) through the wash platform, the vehicle's tires, wheel wells and mud flaps are cleaned by water sprayed from many strategically placed nozzles (spray bar). The nozzles are mounted angle-iron grids which open the [[Tire#Tire tread|tire treads]] and flushing the mud for a high cleaning performance. The washing platform is usually of [[galvanized]] steel.  The first modern systems were introduced as the MobyDick “Quick” series at a German construction industry trade exhibition. The Quick system was a significant design improvement from the modified high pressure truck wash systems that were used as wheel and tire wash systems before. Today all modern drive through systems are based on the engineering and design development of the Quick series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopianreview.com/business/122644 |title=4.9 million tons less dirt on the roads |publisher=www.ethiopianreview.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
A key aspect of the philosophy of wheel and tire cleaning is the use of high volume water flow at low pressure. The high volume flow of water flow serves to clean the tires and effectively remove the wash sludge slurry from the wash platform into the recycling and solids collection tanks. Mist and overspray from high pressure systems would not be an effective method of cleaning and removing the wash sludge into the recycling and solids collections tanks. Other disadvantages of high pressure cleaning are wasted water, energy and obstruction of driver visibility.

==Recycling tank==
Once the wash sludge arrives to a recycling tank the solids typically sink by gravity to the bottom. To accelerate the [[sedimentation]] of the solids, [[flocculants]] are used.  Periodically the settled solids at the bottom of the recycling tank are removed from the tank with an automatic scraper conveyor system or by other means such as a [[wheel loader]], an [[excavator]] with bucket or a [[vacuum truck]]. After the solids settlement process the wash water is ready for the next washing cycle. The goal of the sedimentation process is to deliver clean and optically clear water for every wash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobydick.com/en/water-treatment |title=Water treatment |publisher=www.mobydick.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">The '''Y-factor''' method is a widely used technique for measuring the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] and [[noise temperature]] of an [[Electronic amplifier|amplifier]]. It is based on the [[Johnson-Nyquist noise]] of a [[resistor]] at two different, known temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Noise Figure Measurement Accuracy – The Y-Factor Method|url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-3706E.pdf|volume=|pages=|year=2010|series=Application Note 57-2|publisher=Keysight Technologies|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Y-factor_sketch.jpg|thumb|alt=Plot used in the Y-factor method for determining the gain and noise temperature of an amplifier.|Plot used in the Y-factor method for determining the gain and noise temperature of an amplifier]] 

Consider a [[microwave]] amplifier with a 50-[[ohm]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] with a 50-ohm resistor connected to the amplifier input. If the resistor is at a physical [[temperature]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, then the Johnson–Nyquist noise power coupled to the amplifier input is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; = ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''B'', where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann’s constant]], and ''B'' is the bandwidth. The noise power at the output of the amplifier (i.e. the noise power coupled to an impedance-matched load that is connected to the amplifier output) is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Gk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; + ''T''&lt;sub&gt;amp&lt;/sub&gt;)''B'', where ''G'' is the amplifier power gain, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;amp&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplifier [[noise temperature]]. In the Y-factor technique, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is measured for two different, known values of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is then converted to an effective temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; (in units of [[kelvin]]) by dividing by ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and the measurement bandwidth ''B''. The two values of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; are then plotted as a function of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; (also in units of kelvin), and a line is fit to these points (see figure). The slope of this line is equal to the amplifier power gain. The ''x'' intercept of the line is equal to the negative of the amplifier noise temperature −''T''&lt;sub&gt;amp&lt;/sub&gt; in kelvins. The amplifier noise temperature can also be determined from the ''y'' intercept, which is equal to ''T''&lt;sub&gt;amp&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by the gain.
