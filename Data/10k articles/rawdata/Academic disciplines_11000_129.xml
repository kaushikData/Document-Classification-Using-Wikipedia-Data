[[Image:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.6|A [[vortex]] is created by the passage of an aircraft wing, revealed by smoke. Vortices are one of the many phenomena associated with the study of aerodynamics.]]

'''Aerodynamics''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀήρ ''aer'' (air) + δυναμική (dynamics), is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.  The term ''aerodynamics'' is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that "gas dynamics" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. 
The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as [[aerodynamic drag]] were recorded much earlier.  Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving [[Aircraft#Heavier than air – aerodynes|heavier-than-air flight]], which was first demonstrated by [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Stork Inspired Human Flight |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/how-stork-inspired-human-flight.html|publisher= flyingmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the use of aerodynamics through [[mathematical]] analysis, empirical approximations, [[wind tunnel]] experimentation, and [[computer simulation]]s has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies.  Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to [[compressible flow]], [[turbulence]], and [[boundary layer]]s and has become increasingly [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational]] in nature.

==History==
{{main article|History of aerodynamics}}
Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wind Power's Beginnings (1000 BC – 1300 AD) Illustrated History of Wind Power Development |url=http://telosnet.com/wind/early.html|publisher= Telosnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Don |last=Berliner |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Efr2Ll1OdqMC&amp;pg=PA128 |title=Aviation: Reaching for the Sky |publisher= The Oliver Press, Inc. |page=128 |isbn= 1-881508-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Ancient Greek]] legend of [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ovid |author2=Gregory, H. | title=The Metamorphoses | publisher=Signet Classics | year=2001 | isbn=0-451-52793-3 | oclc=45393471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fundamental concepts of [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[pressure gradient]]s appear in the work of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"/&gt;

In 1726, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book II | year=1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him one of the first aerodynamicists. [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] followed in 1738 with ''Hydrodynamica'' in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as [[Bernoulli's principle]], which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Hydrodynamica%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title= Hydrodynamica | accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757, [[Leonhard Euler]] published the more general [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Navier, C. L. M. H. | title=Memoire sur les lois du mouvement des fluides | journal=Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=6|pages=389–440 | year=1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stokes, G. | title=On the Theories of the Internal Friction of Fluids in Motion|url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_39179_onthetheoriesoftheinternalfric1849 | journal=Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume=8|pages=287–305 | year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navier-Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and but are difficult to solve for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes.

[[Image:WB Wind Tunnel.jpg|thumb|A replica of the [[Wright brothers]]' [[wind tunnel]] is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center. Wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of the laws of aerodynamics.]]

In 1799, [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight ([[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[thrust]]), as well as the relationships between them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S Centennial of Flight Commission – Sir George Cayley. |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |publisher= |accessdate=2008-09-10 |quote=Sir George Cayley, born in 1773, is sometimes called the Father of Aviation. A pioneer in his field, he was the first to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight – weight, lift, drag, and thrust and their relationship. He was also the first to build a successful human-carrying glider. Cayley described many of the concepts and elements of the modern airplane and was the first to understand and explain in engineering terms the concepts of lift and thrust. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920052758/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |archivedate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;''Cayley, George''.

Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so outlined the path toward achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century.  In 1871, [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] constructed the first [[wind tunnel]], allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces.  Drag theories were developed by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=d'Alembert, J. | title=Essai d'une nouvelle theorie de la resistance des fluides | year=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kirchhoff, G. | title=Zur Theorie freier Flussigkeitsstrahlen | journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik |volume=70|pages=289–298 | year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rayleigh, Lord | title=On the Resistance of Fluids | journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=2| issue=13 |pages=430–441 |doi=10.1080/14786447608639132| year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Charles Renard]], a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Renard, C. | title=Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance de l'air | journal=L'Aéronaute |volume=22|pages= 73–81 | year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Lilienthal]], the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag.  Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.

During the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragflügeltheorie | publisher=Göttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451–477 | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s.

As aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air [[compressibility]] at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound.  The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to [[shock wave]]s, and the threat of structural failure due to [[Aeroelasticity|aeroelastic flutter]].  The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]] who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]], while [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | journal=Zeitschrift für Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt |volume=16|pages=72–74 | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the [[sound barrier]] was broken for the first time in 1947 using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The [[Cold War]] prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.  Understanding of [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts pedictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

==Fundamental concepts==
[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces of flight on an [[airfoil]]]]
Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)  enables the calculation of forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on the object.  In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], [[thrust]], and [[weight]].  Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body.  Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, [[momentum]], and energy in air flows.  Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, [[viscosity]], are used to classify flow fields. 

===Flow classification===
Flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.  Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.

[[Compressibility|Compressible flow]] accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.

Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).

====Continuum assumption====
Unlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete [[molecule]]s which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.

The validity of the [[continuum assumption]] is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the [[mean free path]] length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000&amp;nbsp;ft/90&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"&gt;{{cite book|last = Anderson|first = John David | title = A History of Aerodynamics and its Impact on Flying Machines| publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1997| location=New York, NY | isbn=0-521-45435-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or satellites in [[Low Earth orbit]]. In those cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The [[Knudsen number]] can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.

===Conservation laws===
The assumption of  a [[Continuum mechanics|fluid continuum]] allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using [[Fluid dynamics#Conservation laws|fluid dynamics conservation laws]]. Three conservation principles are used: 
# [[Conservation of mass]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|mass continuity equation]], which requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest.
# [[Conservation of momentum]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of [[Newton's Second Law]]. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both [[surface force]]s, such as viscous ([[friction]]al) forces, and [[body force]]s, such as [[gravity|weight]].  The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a [[Vector space|vector]] equation or separated into a set of three [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].  The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using [[computational fluid dynamics|computational techniques]]. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and may be used in cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow that neglects gravity.
# [[Conservation of energy]]: The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by the fluid flow, by [[heat transfer]], or by [[Work (physics)|work]] into and out of the region of interest.

The [[ideal gas law]] or another such [[equation of state]] is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.

==Branches of aerodynamics==
Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including [[flow speed]], [[compressibility]], and [[viscosity]]. ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[airplane]] or the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] are examples of external aerodynamics. ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.

Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the [[flow speed]] is below, near or above the [[speed of sound]]. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with [[Mach number]]s above 5 to be hypersonic.&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"/&gt;

The influence of [[viscosity]] on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.

===Incompressible aerodynamics===
{{further information|incompressible flow}}
An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space.  Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound.  The [[Mach number]] is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.

====Subsonic flow====
Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is [[inviscid]], [[Compressibility|incompressible]] and [[irrotational]]. This case is called [[potential flow]] and allows the [[differential equations]] that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of [[fluid dynamics]], thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Joseph|title=Low-speed aerodynamics: From wing theory to panel methods|series=McGraw-Hill series in aeronautical and aerospace engineering|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill
|location=New York|isbn=0-07-050446-6|oclc=21593499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of [[density]] in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102&amp;nbsp;m) per second or 228 miles (366&amp;nbsp;km) per hour at 60&amp;nbsp;°F (16&amp;nbsp;°C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.

===Compressible aerodynamics===
{{main article|Compressible flow}}
According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the [[density]] changes along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the [[Mach number]] in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the [[stagnation point]] (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.

====Transonic flow====
{{main article|Transonic}}
The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local [[speed of sound]] (generally taken as [[Mach Number|Mach]] 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical mach|critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near [[Mach number|Mach 1.2]], when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.

{{anchor|Supersonic aerodynamics}}&lt;!-- anchor for the link that leads directly to the section --&gt;

====Supersonic flow====
{{main article|Supersonic}}
Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the [[Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.

Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is "told" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since [[sound]] is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that "information" can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a [[stagnation pressure]] as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid "knows" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – [[temperature]], [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[Mach number]]—in an extremely violent and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]] fashion called a [[shock wave]]. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see [[Reynolds number]]) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.

====Hypersonic flow====
{{main article|Hypersonic}}
In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.

The incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.

===Boundary layers===
{{main article|Boundary layer}}
The concept of a [[boundary layer]] is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.

===Turbulence===
{{main article|Turbulence}}
In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called [[laminar flow]].

==Aerodynamics in other fields==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
===Engineering design===
{{Further information|Automotive aerodynamics}}
Aerodynamics is a significant factor in [[Automotive engineering|vehicle design]], including [[automobile]]s, and in the prediction of forces and moments acting on [[sailing|sailing vessels]]. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as [[hard drive]] heads. [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] resort to aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], when calculating [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings, [[bridge]]s, and [[Wind turbine design|wind turbines]] 

The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in [[HVAC|heating/ventilation]], [[Duct (HVAC)|gas piping]], and in [[Internal combustion engine|automotive engines]] where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.

===Environmental design===
Urban aerodynamics are studied by [[Urban planning|town planners]] and designers seeking to improve [[amenity]] in outdoor spaces, or in creating urban microclimates to reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes ways in which [[atmospheric circulation]] and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. 

Aerodynamic equations are used in [[numerical weather prediction]].

===Ball-control in sports===
Sports in which aerodynamics are of crucial importance include [[Association football|soccer]], [[cricket]] and golf, in which control over the trajectory of ball movement is sought by expert players who can, for instance, exploit the "[[Magnus effect#In sport|Magnus effect]]" and other environmental conditions to advantage.

The term is often used for a group that authors are studying in further detail in order to refine the complex taxonomy.

Historically, some 19th century botanical authors used alliance to denote groups that would now be considered [[Order (biology)|orders]]. This usage is now obsolete, and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]] (Article 17.2) specifies that such taxa are treated as orders.

== Overview  ==
India’s [[rhetoric]] could be said to be a link between the [[West]] and [[East]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Rhetoric: An Historical and Cross-Cultural Introduction|last=Kennedy|first=George A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0195109333|location=New York|pages=171–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Greek [[sophist]]s, some Indian rhetors in the seventh century BCE held public debates on religion to the public’s amusement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Vedic verses]], composed over three thousand years ago, use similes, similar to [[ancient Greek poetry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Indian rhetoric utilizes systems of categorization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These categorizations appear in early Buddhist writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, India’s Hindu [[caste system]] led to differences in how member of different castes addressed each other, with people from lower castes referring to themselves in a derogatory manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the [[Upanishads]], a collection of ancient Brahmin dialogues, place value in categorizing technical terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[History of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhist]] rhetoric places value in calm and humorous discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nyanya Rhetoric ===
Lloyd (2007) has proposed [[Nyaya]]’s inclusion in the field of rhetorical studies, exploring its methods within their historical context, comparing its approach to the “traditional logical syllogism, and relating it to the contemporary perspectives [[Stephen Toulmin]], [[Kenneth Burke]], and [[Chaïm Perelman|Chaim Perelman]].”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=2007|title=Rethinking Rhetoric from an Indian Perspective: Implications in the ‘Nyaya Sutra.’|url=|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=26|issue=4|page=365|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyaya is a [[Sanskrit]] word which means just or right and refers to “the science of right and wrong reasoning” (Radhakrishnan &amp; Moore, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;356).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=A Source Book in Indian Philosophy|last=Radhakrishnan|first=Sarvepalli|last2=Moore|first2=Charles Alexander|date=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|isbn=|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sutra]] is also a Sanskrit word which means string or thread. Here Sutra refers to a collection of [[aphorism]] in the form of a manual. Each Sutra is a short rule usually consisted of one or two sentences. Example of a Sutra: “Reality is truth, and what is true is so, irrespective of whether we know it is, or are aware of that truth.” The [[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyaya Sutra]] is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Aksapada Gautama.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nyaya Sutras of Gotama|last=Vidyabhusana|first=M.M. Satisa Chandra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1930|isbn=8120807480|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the foundational text of the Nyaya School of Hindu Philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown. It is estimated that the text was composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zimmer (2013) has said that the text may have been composed by more one author, over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophies of India|last=Zimmer|first=Heinrich|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415462327|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishan and Moore (1957) placed its origin in the “third century BC…..though some of the contents of the Nyaya Sutra are certainly a post-Christian era” (p.&amp;nbsp;36).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Vidyabhushana|Vidyabhusana]] (1930) stated that the ancient school of Nyaya extended over a period of one thousand years, beginning with Gotama about 550 BC and ending with Vatsyayana about 400 AD.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''Nyaya'' provides significant insight into the Indian rhetoric.  Naya presents an argumentative approach that works a [[rhetor]] how to decide about any argument. In addition, it proposes a new approach of thinking of a cultural tradition which is different from the Western rhetoric. It also broadens the view of rhetoric and the relationship among human beings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  ''Nyaya'' proposes an enlightenment of reality which is associated with situations, time, and places. Toulmin emphasizes on the situational dimension of argumentative genre as the fundamental component of any rhetorical logic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the contrary, ''Nyaya'' views this situational rhetoric in a new way which offers context of practical arguments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Wheelbase and Track.png|thumb|320px|Track (measured between center line of wheels)]]
The '''axle track''' in [[automobile]]s and other [[wheel]]ed [[vehicle]]s which have two or more wheels on an [[axle]], is the distance between the centerline of two roadwheels on the same axle. In a case of the axle with dual wheels, the centerline in the middle of the dual wheel is used for the axle track specification. 

In a vehicle with two axles, this is expressed as "front track" and "rear track".

However the front wheels and/or rear wheels on either side of a vehicle do not necessarily have to be mounted on the same axle for the distance that they are apart to be called the "track".

== Rail ==
In the case of a [[Wheelset (rail transport)|rail wheelset]] the "track" is called "wheel gauge" and is measured from [[Flange|wheel flange reference line]] to wheel flange reference line wheels of any [[Railroad car|rail car]] or [[tram]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10611">[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', act 3, scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]The '''ballad opera''' is a genre of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]] that originated in the early 18th century, and continued to develop over the following century and later.  Like the earlier ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'' and the later ''[[Singspiel]]'', its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were '[[opera]]s' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported ''[[opera seria]]''.   Music critic [[Peter Gammond]] describes the ballad opera as "an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song."&lt;ref name="gammond"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Peter| last1= Gammond| year= 1991| title= The Oxford Companion to Popular Music| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford| pages=35–36 | isbn= 0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest ballad operas==
Ballad opera has been called an "eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene."&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.

It is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milling, P. Thomson, J. W. Donohue, eds, ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre: 1660 to 1895'' / edited by Joseph Donohue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[Johann Christoph Pepusch]], both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in [[Paris]], and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form.  They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas D'Urfey]] (1653–1723) who had a reputation for [[parody music|fitting new words to existing songs]]; [[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy|a popular anthology of these settings]] was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "D'Urfey, Thomas".&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in ''The Beggar's Opera''.

After the success of ''The Beggar's Opera'', many similar pieces were staged.  The actor [[Thomas Walker (actor)|Thomas Walker]], who played [[Macheath]] in the original production, wrote several ballad operas,&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt; and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, ''Polly''.  [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], [[Charles Coffey]], [[Thomas Arne]], [[Charles Dibdin]], Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref name=Lubbock/&gt; By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarwickWest1992&gt;J. Warwick and E. West, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in ''The Beggar's Opera'' the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir [[Robert Walpole]]. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to ''The Beggar's Opera'', ''Polly''.

The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern "[[jukebox musical]]"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including [[folk music|folk melodies]], popular airs by classical composers (such as [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]) and even children's [[nursery rhymes]]. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London [[broadside (music)|broadside ballad]]s are set. It is from this connection that the term "ballad opera" is drawn. This ragbag of [[Parody music|"pre-loved" music]] is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms.  Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as "[[Lillibullero]]", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;  In 1762, Thomas Arne's ''[[Love in a Village]]'' presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's ''Lionel and Clarissa'' in 1768.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

''[[The Disappointment]]'' (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.

==Singspiel connection==
In 1736 the [[Prussia]]n ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, ''The Devil to Pay'', by [[Charles Coffey]]. This was successfully performed in [[Hamburg]], [[Leipzig]] and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and [[Johann Adam Hiller]] in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]) "the fathers of the German Singspiel". (The storyline of ''The Devil to Pay'' was also adapted for [[Gluck]] for his 1759 French opera ''[[Le diable à quatre (opera)|Le diable à quatre]]'').

==Pastoral ballad opera ==
A later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more "pastoral" form. In subject matter, especially, these "ballad operas" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) ''The Beggar's Opera'', the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'', and [[William Shield]]'s ''Rosina'' (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.

Later in the century broader comedies such as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Duenna'' and the innumerable works of [[Charles Dibdin]] moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.

==19th century==
English 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of "serious" practitioners such as [[John Barnett]]. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert's]] contribution to the [[Savoy opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbrook|first=H. M.|year=1922|title=Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/index.html|location=|accessdate=24 June 2009|publisher=F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd|chapter=IV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043908/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/index.html|archive-date=2008-05-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balfe's opera ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' (1843) is one of the few British Ballad operas of the 20th century to gain international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, Donald Jay, Hermine Weigel Williams [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xXZhKagLO4C&amp;pg=PA563 "National Traditions of Opera"], ''A Short History of Opera'', Columbia University Press (2013), p. 563 {{ISBN|0231507720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1928) is a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.

In a completely different vein, ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'', an [[opera]] in two acts by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a "ballad opera". It is plainly much closer to [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' than to ''The Beggar's Opera''.

In the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called "ballad operas". [[Alan Lomax]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Burl Ives]], and others recorded ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]] and others recorded ''The Transports'' in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric ''Beggar's Opera'' type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.

Ironically, it is in the [[Musical theatre|musicals]] of [[Kander and Ebb]]—especially ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''—that the kind of satire embodied in ''The Beggar's Opera'' and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.

While [[Talmudical Hermeneutics|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] Biblical hermeneutics have some [[Judeo-Christian|overlap]] and [[Interfaith|dialogue]], they have distinctly separate interpretative traditions.

==Talmudical==
{{main|Talmudical hermeneutics}}

Talmudical hermeneutics ([[Hebrew]]: approximately, מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהן) refers to Jewish methods for the investigation and determination of the meaning of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], as well as rules by which [[Halakhah|Jewish law]] could be established.  One well-known summary of these principles appears in the [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Methods by which the [[Talmud]] explores the meaning of scripture:
:* [[grammar]] and [[exegesis]]
:* the interpretation of certain words and letters and apparently superfluous and/or missing words or letters, and prefixes and suffixes
:* the interpretation of those letters which, in certain words, are provided with points
:* the interpretation of the letters in a word according to their numerical value (see [[Gematria]])
:* the interpretation of a word by dividing it into two or more words (see [[Notarikon]])
:* the interpretation of a word according to its consonantal form or according to its vocalization
:* the interpretation of a word by transposing its letters or by changing its vowels
:* the logical deduction of a ''[[halakah]]'' from a Scriptural text or from another law

The rabbis of the Talmud considered themselves to be the receivers and transmitters of an [[Oral Torah]] as to the meaning of the scriptures. They considered this [[oral tradition]] to set forth the precise, original meanings of the words, revealed at the same time and by the same means as the original scriptures themselves. Interpretive methods listed above such as word play and letter counting were never used as logical proof of the meaning or teaching of a scripture. Instead they were considered to be an ''asmakhta'', a validation of a meaning that was already set by tradition or a [[Homiletics|homiletic]] backing for rabbinic rulings.

==Christian==

Until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], biblical hermeneutics was usually seen as a form of special hermeneutics (like legal hermeneutics); the status of scripture was thought to necessitate a particular form of understanding and interpretation.

In the nineteenth century it became increasingly common to read scripture just like any other writing, although the different interpretations were often disputed. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] argued against a distinction between "general" and "special" hermeneutics, and for a general theory of hermeneutics applicable to all [[Text (literary theory)|texts]], including the Bible. Various methods of [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] sought to understand the Bible purely as a human, historical document.

The concept of hermeneutics has acquired at least two different but related meanings which are in use today. Firstly, in the older sense, biblical hermeneutics may be understood as the theological principles of exegesis which is often virtually synonymous with 'principles of biblical interpretation' or methodology of [[biblical exegesis]]. Secondly, the more recent development is to understand the term 'biblical hermeneutics' as the broader [[philosophical|philosophy]] and [[linguistic]] underpinnings of interpretation. The question is posed: "How is understanding possible?" The rationale of this approach is that, while Scripture is "more than just an ordinary text," it is certainly "no less than an ordinary text." Scripture is in the first analysis "text" which human beings try to understand; in this sense, the principles of understanding any text apply to the Bible as well (regardless of whatever other additional, specifically theological principles are considered).

In this second sense, all aspects of philosophical and linguistic hermeneutics are considered to be applicable to the biblical texts, as well. There are obvious examples of this in the links between [[20th-century philosophy]] and Christian [[theology]]. For example, [[Rudolf Bultmann]]'s hermeneutical approach was strongly influenced by [[existentialism]], and in particular by the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]]; and since the 1970s, the philosophical hermeneutics of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] have had a wide-ranging influence on biblical hermeneutics as developed by a wide range of Christian theologians. The French-American philosopher [[René Girard]] follows a similar trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=Resurrecting Interpretation|year=2005|publisher=University of Bristol|location=Bristol Baptist College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse interpretations===
Biblical scholars have noted the diversity of interpretations by [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and to a lesser extent by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. In his forward to [[R. C. Sproul]]’s ''Knowing Scripture'', [[J. I. Packer]] observes that Protestant theologians are in conflict about biblical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Sproul, ''Knowing Scripture'' (Rev. ed., InterVarsity Press, 2009), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate the diversity of biblical interpretations, William Yarchin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apu.edu/honors/faculty/byarchin/&lt;/ref&gt; pictures a shelf full of religious books saying different things, but all claiming to be faithful interpretations of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;William Yarchin, ''History of Biblical Interpretation: a Reader'' (Hendrickson, 2004), xi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Ramm]] observed that such diverse interpretations underlie the doctrinal variations in Christendom.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ramm, ''Protestant Biblical Interpretation:A Textbook of Hermeneutics, 3rd rev ed'' (Baker Academic, 1980), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A mid-19th century book on biblical interpretation observed that even those who believe the Bible to be the word of God hold the most discordant views about fundamental doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;''The Interpretation of the Bible'' (Boston; Massachusetts Sabbath School Society, 1844), 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church asserts the capital importance of biblical interpretation and Catholic scholars recognize some diversity in the Bible. This allows for an openness of interpretation as long as it stays within the Catholic Church’s theological Tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Williamson, ''Catholic Principles for Interpreting Scripture: A Study of the Pontifical Biblical Commission’s “The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church”'' (Gregorian Biblical BookShop, 2001), 23, 121, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; So it is that theological factors set the parameters for interpreting the Scripture that Catholics believe to be the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Williams, ''Receiving the Bible in Faith: Historical and Theological Exegesis'' (CUA Press, 2004), 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such parameters disallow the widely differing interpretations that make it possible for Protestants to prove almost anything by the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Roy B. Zuck, ''Basic Bible Interpretation'' (David C. Cook, 1991), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological hermeneutics as traditional Christian Biblical exegesis===

This form of [[theological hermeneutics]] in the mainstream Protestant tradition considers Christian Biblical hermeneutics in the tradition of explication of the text, or [[exegesis]], to deal with various principles that can be applied to the study of [[Scripture]]. If the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of Scripture is considered as an organic whole, rather than an accumulation of disparate individual texts written and edited in the course of history, then any interpretation that contradicts any other part of scripture is not considered to be sound. Biblical hermeneutics differs from hermeneutics and within traditional Protestant [[theology]], there are a variety of interpretive formulae. Such formulae are generally not mutually exclusive, and interpreters may adhere to several of these approaches at once. These formulae include:&lt;ref&gt;This list of "principles" in conservative [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] hermeneutics appears to derive from: Hartill, J E 1960. ''Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics''. Grand Rapids: Zondervan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theological Group of Principles''':

:*The '''[[Historical-grammatical method|Historical-grammatical]]''' principle based on historical, socio-political, geographical, cultural and linguistic / grammatical context
:*Alternate, mutually-exclusive, models of history:
:**The '''[[Dispensationalism|Dispensational model]]''' or The '''Chronometrical Principle''': "During different periods of time, God has chosen to deal in a particular way with man in respect to sin and man's responsibility."
:**The '''[[Covenantalism|Covenantal model]]''': "We differentiate between the various contracts that God has made with his people; specifically their provisions, their parties and their purposes."
:**The '''[[New Covenant Theology|New-Covenantal]]''' model: The Old Testament Laws have been fulfilled and abrogated or cancelled with Christ's death, and replaced with the Law of Christ of the New Covenant, although many of the Old Covenant laws are reinstituted under the New Covenant.
:*The '''Ethnic Division Principle''': "The word of truth is rightly divided in relation to the three classes which it treats, i.e. Jews, [[Gentiles]] and the Church."
:*The '''Breach Principle''': Interpretation of a certain verse or passage in Scripture is aided by a consideration of certain breaches, either breaches of promise or breaches of time.
:*The '''[[Christo-Centric Principle]]''': "The mind of deity is eternally centered in Christ. All angelic thought and ministry are centered in Christ. All Satanic hatred and subtlety are centered at Christ. All human hopes are, and human occupations should be, centered in Christ. The whole material universe in creation is centered in Christ. The entire written word is centered in Christ."
:*The '''Moral Principle'''
:*The '''Discriminational Principle''': "We should divide the word of truth so as to make a distinction where God makes a difference."
:*The '''Predictive Principle'''
:*The '''Application Principle''': "An application of truth may be made only after the correct interpretation has been made"
:*The '''Principle of Human Willingness in Illumination'''
:*The '''Context Principle''': "God gives light upon a subject through either near or remote passages bearing upon the same subject."

'''Sub-divided Context/Mention Principles''':
:*The '''First Mention Principle''': "God indicates in the first mention of a subject the truth with which that subject stands connected in the mind of God."
:*The '''Progressive Mention Principle''': "God makes the revelation of any given truth increasingly clear as the word proceeds to its consummation."
:*The '''Comparative Mention Principle'''
:*The '''Full Mention Principle''' or The '''Complete Mention Principle''': "God declares his full mind upon any subject vital to our spiritual life."
:*The '''Agreement Principle''': "The truthfulness and faithfulness of God become the guarantee that he will not set forth any passage in his word that contradicts any other passage."
:*The '''Direct Statement Principle''': "God says what he means and means what he says."
:*The '''Gap Principle''': "God, in the Jewish Scriptures, ignores certain periods of time, leaping over them without comment."
:*The '''Threefold Principle''': "The word of God sets forth the truths of salvation in a three-fold way: past - justification; present - sanctification/transformation; future - glorification/consummation."
:*The '''Repetition Principle''': "God repeats some truth or subject already given, generally with the addition of details not before given."
:*The '''Synthetic Principle'''
:*The '''Principle of Illustrative Mention'''
:*The '''Double Reference Principle'''

'''Figures of Speech Group of Principles''':
:*The '''Numerical Principle'''
:*The '''Symbolic Principle'''
:*The '''Typical Principle''': "Certain people, events, objects and rituals found in the Old Testament may serve as object lessons and pictures by which God teaches us of his grace and saving power."
:*The '''Parabolic Principle'''
:*The '''Allegorical Principle'''

==Techniques==
In the interpretation of a text, hermeneutics considers the original medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalperformancecriticism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45:wire-conference&amp;catid=3:newsflash|title=Biblical Performance Criticism|first=Peter|last=Perry|date=|website=www.biblicalperformancecriticism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as what language says, supposes, doesn't say, and implies. The process consists of several steps for best attaining the Scriptural author's intended meaning(s).  One such process is taught by Henry A Virkler, in ''Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation'' (1981):

:*'''Lexical-syntactical analysis''': This step looks at the words used and the way the words are used.  Different order of the sentence, the punctuation, the tense of the verse are all aspects that are looked at in the lexical syntactical method.  Here, lexicons and grammar aids can help in extracting meaning from the text.
:*'''Historical/cultural analysis''': The history and culture surrounding the authors is important to understand to aid in interpretation.  For instance, understanding the Jewish sects of the Palestine and the government that ruled Palestine in New Testament times increases understanding of Scripture.  And, understanding the connotations of positions such as the High Priest and that of the tax collector helps us know what others thought of the people holding these positions.
:*'''Contextual analysis''': A verse out of context can often be taken to mean something completely different from the intention.  This method focuses on the importance of looking at the context of a verse in its chapter, book and even biblical context.
:*'''Theological analysis''': It is often said that a single verse usually doesn't make a theology.  This is because Scripture often touches on issues in several books.  For instance, gifts of the Spirit are spoken about in Romans, Ephesians and 1 Corinthians.  To take a verse from Corinthians without taking into account other passages that deal with the same topic can cause a poor interpretation.
:*'''Special literary analysis''': There are several special literary aspects to look at, but the overarching theme is that each genre of Scripture has a different set of rules that applies to it.  Of the genres found in Scripture, there are: narratives, histories, prophecies, apocalyptic writings, poetry, psalms and letters.  In these, there are differing levels of allegory, figurative language, metaphors, similes and literal language.  For instance, the apocalyptic writings and poetry have more figurative and allegorical language than does the narrative or historical writing.  These must be addressed, and the genre recognized to gain a full understanding of the intended meaning.

[[Howard Hendricks]], longtime professor of hermeneutics at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], set out the method of observing the text, interpreting the text, applying the text in his book, ''Living By the Book''. Other major Christian teachers, such as [[Chuck Swindoll|Charles R. (Chuck) Swindoll]], who wrote the foreword, [[Kay Arthur]] and [[David Jeremiah]] have based their hermeneutics on the principles Hendricks teaches.

In his book ''God Centered Biblical Interpretation'' (1999), [[Vern Poythress]], Professor of New Testament Interpretation at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in Philadelphia, presented a hermeneutical technique based on the pattern of "speaker, discourse, and hearer".&lt;ref&gt;Poythress, Vern S. (1999). ''God Centered Biblical Interpretation'', p. 109. P&amp;R Publishing, Phillipsburg, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Poythress, the study of the Bible must acknowledge all three aspects: God as the speaker, the Bible as His speech, and the people to whom He speaks. Thus, context plays a primary role in Poythress's study of Biblical teachings. He lists three general concepts to understand about any passage of Scripture:

:*'''Original time and context''': This includes the personal perspective of the writer, the normative perspective of the text itself, and the situational perspective of the original audience.

:*'''Transmission and its context''': Understanding the transmission of Scripture includes contemplating the message being sent through the text, taking into account the concerns of individual writers/translators as well as its broader role in the unraveling narrative of history. 

:*'''Modern context''': Poythress calls interpreters to understand Scripture as "what God is saying now" to the individual as well as to the modern church.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 121 -122&lt;/ref&gt; 

David L. Barr states there are three obstacles that stand in the way of correctly interpreting the biblical writings: We speak a different language, we live approximately two millennia later, and we bring different expectations to the text.&lt;ref&gt;New Testament Story, Wadsworth Publishing, 1995, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Barr suggests that we approach the reading of the Bible with significantly different literary expectations than those in reading other forms of literature and writing.

===Roman Catholic===
{{see also|Roman Catholic theology of Scripture}} 
The Catholic Encyclopedia lists a number of principles guiding Roman Catholic hermeneutics in the article on Exegesis (note: the Catholic Encyclopedia was written in 1917 and does not reflect the changes set forth by the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' published by Pius XII in 1943, which opened modern Catholic Biblical scholarship) :

:*'''Historico-grammatical interpretation''' - The meaning of the literary expression of the Bible is best learned by a thorough knowledge of the languages in which the original text of Scripture was written, and by acquaintance with the Scriptural way of speaking, including the various customs, laws, habits and national prejudices which influenced the inspired writers as they composed their respective books. [[John Paul II]] said that: "A second conclusion is that the very nature of biblical texts means that interpreting them will require continued use of the historical-critical method, at least in its principal procedures. The Bible, in effect, does not present itself as a direct revelation of timeless truths but as the written testimony to a series of interventions in which God reveals himself in human history. In a way that differs from tenets of other religions [such as Islam, for instance], the message of the Bible is solidly grounded in history.&lt;ref name="Pontifical Biblical Commission--Interpretation of the Bible"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholic-resources.org/ChurchDocs/PBC_Interp5.htm|title=The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church|accessdate=2007-05-21|author=Presented by the Pontifical Biblical Commission|date=1993-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Catholic interpretation''' - Because the Catholic Church is, according to Catholics, the official custodian and interpreter of the Bible, Catholicism's teaching concerning the Sacred Scriptures and their genuine sense must be the supreme guide of the commentator. The Catholic commentator is bound to adhere to the interpretation of texts which the Church has defined either expressly or implicitly.
:*'''Reverence''' - Since the Bible is God's own book, its study must be begun and prosecuted with a spirit of reverence and [[Christian Prayers|prayer]].
:*'''Inerrancy''' - Since God is the principal Author of Sacred Scripture, it can be claimed to contain no error, no self-contradiction, nothing contrary to scientific or historical truth (when the original authors intended historical or scientific truth to be portrayed).  Minor contradictions are due to copyist errors in the codex or the translation. Catholics believe the Scripture is God's message put in words by men, with the imperfections this very fact necessarily implies. Catholic hermeneutics strongly supports inerrancy when it comes to principles but not, for example, when dealing with Evangelists' orthographic mistakes. According to Pope John Paul II, "Addressing men and women, from the beginnings of the Old Testament onward, God made use of all the possibilities of human language, while at the same time accepting that his word be subject to the constraints caused by the limitations of this language. Proper respect for inspired Scripture requires undertaking all the labors necessary to gain a thorough grasp of its meaning.&lt;ref name="Pontifical Biblical Commission--Interpretation of the Bible"/&gt;
:*'''Patristics''' - The Holy Fathers are of supreme authority whenever they all interpret in one and the same manner any text of the Bible, as pertaining to the doctrine of faith or morals; for their unanimity clearly evinces that such interpretation has come down from the Apostles as a matter of Catholic faith.
Pope Benedict XVI has indicated in Verbum Domini, the post-synodal apostolic exhortation on the Word of God, that "Christianity...perceives in the words the Word himself, the Logos who displays his mystery through this complexity and the reality of human history". He encourages a “faith-filled interpretation of Sacred Scripture”. He emphasizes that this manner of interpretation, “practiced from antiquity within the Church’s Tradition...recognizes the historical value of the biblical tradition". It "seeks to discover the living meaning of the Sacred Scriptures for the lives of believers today while not ignoring the human mediation of the inspired text and its literary genres". Verbum Domini #44.

===Eastern Orthodox===
:*'''God is real and is incarnated in our [[Lord]] Jesus Christ.'''  Everything pertaining to the Scriptures must be understood [[Christology|Christologically]].  [[Jesus Christ]], the incarnate Second Person of the [[Holy Trinity]], is the center of all that we as Christians do, and being Himself the very Truth, He is the only gate through which we may enter into understanding of the Bible, both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s (though not all that is contained in the Old Testament is directly relevant for Christians).  The Bible ultimately is about Christ and assists us in our union with Him.

:*'''Only the pure in heart "shall see God."'''  That is, our spiritual state has a direct bearing on our interpretation of the Scriptures.  As St. [[Athanasius the Great|Athanasius]] said, "One cannot possibly understand the teaching of the saints unless one has a pure mind and is trying to imitate their life."  Because the Scripture is a book inspired by the [[Holy Spirit]] and given through holy men, one's own holiness is directly relevant to the ability to interpret the book correctly.  Unlike any other book, the Bible's words are "spirit and life," and so we must live spiritually in order to drink from this spiritual well.  Clearly, [[prayer]] and spiritual discipline are necessary in order to understand Scripture properly.

:*'''Understanding of the Scripture comes with living its contents.'''  As the quote from St. [[Athanasius the Great|Athanasius]] illustrates, one must both have a pure mind and be trying to imitate the saints' lives in order to understand their teaching, a dual principle which applies most of all to the teaching of the saints in the Bible.  This life is particularly expressed in terms of living out the commandments and attempting to imitate Christ's life of the Gospel.

:*'''The primary end of Scriptural hermeneutics is that of the whole Christian life, [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] (deification/divinization).'''  That is, our purpose in attempting to understand the Bible must not be merely for academic inquiry but rather must be in order to become fully divinized human beings, soaked with the life of God, participating in His [[divine energies]], growing to the fullness of the stature of Christ.  We interpret Scripture in order to become by grace what Christ is by nature, to "become god."

:*'''Only within the community of the Church can the Bible be understood.'''  It was written by the Church, in the Church and for the Church.  Thus, it is a "family document" which is the highest point of [[Holy Tradition]], taken with faith alongside the writings of the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]], the [[Divine Liturgy|Liturgy]], the [[Icons]], the Lives of the [[Saints]], and so on.

:*'''The Scripture is a witness to the truth, not an exhaustive tome on Christian living.''' Nowhere in the words of Scripture itself can we find the teaching that it is all-sufficient for Christian life.  What we as Orthodox Christians do must always be consonant with the Scriptures, but explicit mention of a practice or teaching in the Scripture is not a requirement for its inclusion in the life of the Church.  The [[Apostle Paul]] himself mentions the reality of unwritten sources of Church Tradition being equally in force for the believer in [[II Thessalonians]] 2:15, that these traditions to which we must "stand fast and hold" may be "by word or by our epistle."  Examples of practices not explicit in Scripture are making the [[Sign of the Cross]], triple immersion for [[baptism]], and having [[monasticism]].  St. [[Basil the Great]] even says that without maintaining the unwritten traditions of the Church, we "mutilate the Gospel" (''On the Spirit'' 66).

:*'''We must respect the integrity of the canon of the Bible as given to us in the Church's Tradition.'''  Searches for other texts written by apostles or prophets may be interesting and of scholarly merit, but they are not part of the hermeneutical project within the Church. Or conversely, attempts to debunk the authorship or authenticity of the books in the canon are also outside the Church's life.  If we were to find a verifiable "new" work by St. Paul or to discover that [[Moses]] did not in fact write [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], neither finding would have any bearing on the [[Biblical canon|canon]].  It is what it is.

:*'''We must use every resource at our disposal in interpreting the Scripture to bring ourselves and others to the knowledge of the truth.'''  Certainly, there must be spiritual discernment in knowing how to use those resources, but at least theoretically, anything can be used to come to know the truth better as it is revealed in Holy Writ.

:*'''We must have humility when approaching Scripture.'''  Even some of the Church's greatest and most philosophically sophisticated [[saints]] stated that some passages were difficult for them.  We must therefore be prepared to admit that our interpretations may be wrong, submitting them to the judgment of the Church.

:*'''We may make use in a secondary fashion of the resources of academic scholarship, whether logic, archaeology, linguistics, et cetera.'''  These resources can be helpful in terms of illuminating our understanding of Scripture, but they must always be given only secondary prominence in the project and always only in conjunction with all these other hermeneutic principles.  Primary must always be our life in the Church, living, studying and knowing the Bible within that vivified and salvific [[Holy Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archpriest Michael Dahulich|title=OrthodoxWiki article on Hermeneutics|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Hermeneutics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary reader of Scripture is in some way envisaged by the Biblical text as standing in continuity with a developing theme therein. The reader, then, is left to discern this trajectory and appropriate it accordingly.

[[William J. Webb]] employed such a hermeneutic, in his ''Slaves, Women &amp; Homosexuals''. Webb shows how the moral commands of the Old and New Testament were a significant improvement over the surrounding cultural values and practices. Webb identified 18 different ways in which God dealt with his people moving against the current of popular cultural values. While for Webb the use of this hermeneutic moves to highlight the progressive liberation of women and slaves from oppressive male/bourgeois dominance, the prohibition of [[homosexual]] acts consistently moves in a more conservative manner than that of the surrounding [[Ancient Near East]] or [[Graeco-Roman]] societies. While Paul does not explicitly state that [[slavery]] should be abolished, the trajectory seen in Scripture is a progressive liberation of slaves. When this is extended to modern times, it implies that the Biblical witness supports the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. The progressive [[Women's rights|liberation of women]] from oppressive patriarchalism, traced from Genesis and Exodus through to Paul's own acknowledgement of women as 'co-workers' ({{bibleref2|Romans|16:3|NLT|Rom. 16:3}}), sets a precedent that when applied to modern times suggests that women ought to have the same rights and roles afforded to men. Historically, the Biblical witness has become progressively more stringent in its views of homosexual practice and the implications of this are not commented upon by Webb.

The '''Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics''' ('''BINP''') is one of the major centres of advanced study of [[nuclear physics]] in [[Russia]]. It is located in the [[Siberian]] town [[Akademgorodok]], on [[Academician Lavrentyev Avenue, Novosibirsk|Academician Lavrentiev Avenue]]. The institute was founded by [[Gersh Itskovich Budker]] in 1959. Following his death in 1977, the institute was renamed in honour of Academician Budker.

Despite its name, the centre was not involved either with military atomic science or nuclear reactors{{mdash}} instead, its concentration was on high-energy physics (particularly [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]]) and particle physics. In 1961 the institute began building [[:ru:ВЭП-1|VEP-1]],&lt;ref name="BINP-history"&gt;A. N.

The '''Chemical Society of Japan''' (CSJ) is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1878 in order to advance research in chemistry.  The mission of the CSJ is to promote chemistry for science and industry in collaboration with other domestic and global societies.&lt;ref name="about_csj"&gt;Chemical Society of Japan (CSJ), [http://www.csj.jp/csj-en/about/about.html  About CSJ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The organization was modeled after the British Chemical Society.  This [[learned society]] in London was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, the Japanese association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout Japan and across international borders. &lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"&gt;Lagowski, J. J. (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Membership was expanded in 1948 in a merger with the Society of Chemical Industry.&lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"/&gt; In 2018 the first woman was announced as president, the distinguished chemist [[Maki Kawai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chemistry.or.jp/en/aboutus/message.html|title=President Message|work=The Chemical Society of Japan|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Activities==

'''Chemical cycling''' describes systems of repeated circulation of chemicals between other compounds, states and materials, and back to their original state, that occurs in space, and on many objects in space including the Earth. Active chemical cycling is known to occur in stars, many planets and natural satellites.

Chemical cycling plays a large role in sustaining planetary atmospheres, liquids and biological processes and can greatly influence weather and climate. Some chemical cycles release [[renewable energy]], others may give rise to complex chemical reactions, organic compounds and [[Prebiotic (chemistry)|prebiotic chemistry]]. On terrestrial bodies such as the Earth, chemical cycles involving the [[lithosphere]] are known as [[geochemical cycle]]s. Ongoing geochemical cycles are one of the main attributes of geologically active worlds. A chemical cycle involving a biosphere is known as a [[biogeochemical cycle]].

== The Sun, other stars and star systems ==
In most hydrogen-fusing stars, including the [[Sun]], a chemical cycle involved in stellar nucleosynthesis occurs which is known as a carbon-nitrogen-oxygen or ([[CNO cycle]]). In addition to this cycle, stars also have a helium cycle.&lt;ref name="Fortov2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vladimir E.

== Earth ==
[[Image:Water cycle.png|thumb|320px|right|Earth's [[water cycle]].]]
A number of different types of chemical cycles geochemical cycles occur on Earth. Biogeochemical cycles play an important role in sustaining the biosphere.
Notable active chemical cycles on Earth include:

* [[Carbon cycle]] – consisting of an [[atmospheric carbon cycle]] (and carbon dioxide cycle), [[terrestrial biological carbon cycle]], [[oceanic carbon cycle]] and [[Carbon sink|geological carbon cycle]]
* [[Nitrogen cycle]] – which converts nitrogen between its forms through  [[nitrogen fixation|fixation]], [[ammonification]], [[nitrification]], and [[denitrification]]
* [[Oxygen cycle]] and [[Ozone–oxygen cycle]] – a [[biogeochemical cycle]]  of circulating oxygen between the atmosphere, [[biosphere]] (the global sum of all ecosystems), and the lithosphere
* [[Ozone-oxygen cycle]] – continually regenerates ozone in the atmosphere and converts [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) into heat
* [[Water cycle]] – moves water continuously on, above and below the surface shifting between states of liquid, solution, ice and vapour
* [[Methane cycle]] – moves methane between geological and biogeochemical sources and reactions in the atmosphere
* [[Hydrogen cycle]] – a biogeochemical cycle brought about by a combination of biological and abiological processes
* [[Phosphorus cycle]] – the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere
* [[Sulfur cycle]] – a biogeochemical process resulting form the mineralization of organic sulfur, oxidation, reduction and incorporation into organic compounds
* [[Carbonate–silicate cycle]] transforms [[silicate]] rocks to [[Carbonate rock|carbonate]] rocks by [[weathering]] and [[sedimentation]] and transforms carbonate rocks back into silicates by [[metamorphism]] and [[magmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~jean/paleo/Berner_1983.pdf|title = The Carbonate-Silicate Geochemical Cycle and its Effect on Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide over the Past 100 Million Years|last = Berner|first = Robert|date = September 1983|journal = American Journal of Science|doi = 10.2475/ajs.283.7.641|pmid = |access-date = Feb 3, 2015|first2 = Antonio|last2 = Lasaga|volume = 283|issue = 7|pages = 641–683|last3 = Garrels|first3 = Robert|bibcode = 1983AmJS..283..641B|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160326032613/http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~jean/paleo/Berner_1983.pdf#|archive-date = 2016-03-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rock cycle]] – switches rock between its three forms: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous
* [[Mercury cycle]] – a biogeochemical process in which naturally occurring mercury is bioaccumulated before recombining with sulfur and returning to geological sources as sediments

Other chemical cycles include [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref name="AllenGonzález Abad2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Nicholas D.C.|last2=González Abad|first2=Gonzalo|last3=Bernath|first3=Peter F.|last4=Boone|first4=Chris D.|title=Satellite observations of the global distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from ACE|journal=Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer|volume=115|year=2013|pages=66–77|issn=0022-4073|doi=10.1016/j.jqsrt.2012.09.008|bibcode = 2013JQSRT.115...66A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PIA19088-MarsCuriosityRover-MethaneSource-20141216.png|thumb|Possible sources of a hypothesized [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|Martian Methane]] cycle.]]

If the individual recombination rates (between A and B; and between B and C) are known, then the c.o.c. between the regions AB and BC can be calculated from the rate of double recombination.]]

In genetics, the '''coefficient of coincidence (c.o.c.)''' is a measure of '''interference''' in the formation of [[chromosomal crossover]]s during [[meiosis]]. It is generally the case that, if there is a crossover at one spot on a chromosome, this decreases the likelihood of a crossover in a nearby spot.&lt;ref name="itga"&gt;[[Anthony J. F. Griffiths|Griffiths AJF]], [[Susan R. Wessler|Wessler SR]], [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin RC]], [[Sean B. Carroll|Carroll SB]] (2008) ''Introduction to Genetic Analysis''. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; This is called interference.

The coefficient of coincidence is typically calculated from recombination rates between three genes. If there are three genes in the order A B C, then we can determine how closely [[genetic linkage|linked]] they are by frequency of recombination. Knowing the recombination rate between A and B and the recombination rate between B and C, we would naively expect the double recombination rate to be the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of these two rates.

The coefficient of coincidence is calculated by dividing the ''actual'' frequency of double recombinants by this expected frequency:&lt;ref name="itga" /&gt;

:'''c.o.c.''' = actual double recombinant frequency / expected double recombinant frequency

Interference is then defined as follows:&lt;ref name="itga" /&gt;

:'''interference''' = 1 − c.o.c.

This figure tells us how strongly a crossover in one of the DNA regions (AB or BC) interferes with the formation of a crossover in the other region.

==Worked example==

[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]] females of [[genotype]] ''a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;a b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;b c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c'' were crossed with males of genotype ''aa bb cc''. This led to 1000 progeny of the following [[phenotype]]s:

:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''244''' (parental genotype, shows no recombination)
:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c: '''81''' (recombinant between B and C)
:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;bc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''23''' (double recombinant)
:a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;bc: '''152''' (recombinant between A and B)
:ab&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''148''' (recombinant between A and B)
:ab&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;c: '''27''' (double recombinant)
:abc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: '''89''' (recombinant between B and C)
:abc: '''236''' (parental genotype, shows no recombination)

From these numbers it is clear that the b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/b [[locus (genetics)|locus]] lies between the a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/a locus and the c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/c locus.

There are 23 + 152 + 148 + 27 = 350 progeny showing recombination between genes A and B. And there are 81 + 23 + 27 + 89 = 220 progeny showing recombination between genes B and C. Thus the expected rate of double recombination is (350 / 1000) * (220 / 1000) = 0.077, or 77 per 1000.

However, there are actually only 23 + 27 = 50 double recombinants. The coefficient of coincidence is therefore 50 / 77 = 0.65.

Interference is 1 − 0.65 = 0.35.

Its use in designing electronic systems is known as [[electronic design automation]] ('''EDA'''). In [[mechanical design]] it is known as [[mechanical design automation]] ('''MDA''') or '''computer-aided drafting''' ('''CAD'''), which includes the process of creating a [[technical drawing]] with the use of [[computer software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=David A.|title=Engineering Drawing &amp; Design|year=2012|publisher=Delmar|location=Clifton Park, NY|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdtJDEPZrrkC&amp;pg=PA2|isbn=1111309574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAD software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting, or may also produce [[raster graphics]] showing the overall appearance of designed objects. However, it involves more than just shapes. As in the manual [[wikt:drafting|drafting]] of [[technical drawing|technical]] and [[engineering drawing]]s, the output of CAD must convey information, such as [[material]]s, [[manufacturing process|process]]es, [[dimension]]s, and [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]]s, according to application-specific conventions.

CAD may be used to design curves and figures in [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] (2D) space; or curves, surfaces, and solids in [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3D) space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farin, Gerald |author2=Hoschek, Josef |author3=Kim, Myung-Soo |title=Handbook of computer aided geometric design [electronic resource]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SV5G8fgxLoC|year=2002|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51104-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAD is an important [[industrial arts|industrial art]] extensively used in many applications, including [[automotive]], [[shipbuilding]], and [[aerospace]] industries, industrial and [[architectural design]], [[prosthesis|prosthetics]], and many more. CAD is also widely used to produce [[computer animation]] for [[special effect]]s in movies, [[advertising]] and technical manuals, often called DCC [[digital content creation]]. The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the 1960s. Because of its enormous economic importance, CAD has been a major driving force for research in [[computational geometry]], [[computer graphics]] (both hardware and software), and [[discrete differential geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Pottmann, H.; Brell-Cokcan, S. and Wallner, J.

==Overview of CAD software==
Starting around the mid 1960s, with the IBM Drafting System, computer-aided design systems began to provide more capability than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting, the cost-benefit for companies to switch to  CAD became apparent. The benefits of CAD systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today;  automated generation of [[Bill of Material]], auto layout in [[integrated circuits]], interference checking, and many others. Eventually, CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations. During this transition, calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs. CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry, where draftsmen, designers and engineering roles begin to merge. It did not eliminate departments, as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman, designers and engineers. CAD is an example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry.
Current computer-aided design software packages range from 2D [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drafting systems to 3D [[Solid modeling|solid]] and [[Freeform surface modelling|surface]] modelers. Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions, allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle, even from the inside looking out. Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling.

CAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings, from small residential types (houses) to the largest commercial and industrial structures (hospitals and factories).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAD is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3D models or 2D drawings of physical components, but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products, through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components. It can also be used to design objects such as jewelry, furniture, appliances, etc. Furthermore, many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs. [[4D BIM]] is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management.

CAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of [[CAx|computer-aided technologies]], with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened [[Systems_development_life_cycle#Design|design cycle]]. CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen, print it out and save it for future editing, saving time on their drawings.

==Uses==
Computer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question.

CAD is one part of the whole Digital Product Development (DPD) activity within the [[Product Lifecycle Management]] (PLM) processes, and as such is used together with other tools, which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products, such as:

*[[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) and [[Finite element analysis]] (FEA)
*[[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) including instructions to [[Computer Numerical Control]] (CNC) machines
*[[Photorealistic rendering]] and Motion Simulation.
*Document management and [[revision control]] using [[Product Data Management]] (PDM).

CAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports, in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like, where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built. Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD.

CAD has been proven to be useful to engineers as well. Using four properties which are history, features, parametrization, and high-level constraints. The construction history can be used to look back into the model's personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model. Parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size, shape, and other properties of the different modeling elements. The features in the CAD system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength, yield strength, electrical or electromagnetic properties. Also its stress, strain, [[Timing closure|timing]] or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures, etc.

==Types==
[[File:CAD Modeling.gif|thumb|A simple procedure]]
{{see also|Comparison of computer-aided design editors}}
There are several different types of CAD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner for each.

There are many producers of the lower-end 2D systems, including a number of free and open-source programs. These provide an approach to the drawing process without all the fuss over scale and placement on the drawing sheet that accompanied hand drafting since these can be adjusted as required during the creation of the final draft.

''3D [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]]'' is basically an extension of 2D drafting (not often used today). Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing. The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it, such as holes. The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems, although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views.

''3D "dumb" solids'' are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real-world objects (not often used today). Basic three-dimensional geometric forms (prisms, cylinders, spheres, and so on) have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects. Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models. Basic 3D solids don't usually include tools to easily allow motion of components, set limits to their motion, or identify interference between components.

There are two types of ''[[solid modeling|3D Solid Modeling]]''

# ''Parametric modeling'' allows the operator to use what is referred to as "design intent". The objects and features created are modifiable. Any future modifications can be made by changing how the original part was created. If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part, the operator should locate it from the center of the model. The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part, but this random placement would defeat the design intent. If the operator designs the part as it functions the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships.
# ''[[Explicit modeling|Direct or Explicit modeling]]'' provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree. With direct modeling, once a sketch is used to create geometry the sketch is incorporated into the new geometry and the designer just modifies the geometry without needing the original sketch. As with parametric modeling, [[direct modeling]] has the ability to include relationships between selected geometry (e.g., tangency, concentricity).

Top end systems offer the capabilities to incorporate more organic, aesthetics and ergonomic features into designs. [[Freeform surface modeling]] is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine.

==Technology==
[[File:cad mouse 1.svg|right|thumb|A CAD model of a [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]].]]

Originally software for Computer-Aided Design systems was developed with computer languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL]] but with the advancement of [[object-oriented programming]] methods this has radically changed. Typical modern [[parametric feature-based modeler]] and [[freeform surface]] systems are built around a number of key [[C (programming language)|C]] modules with their own [[application programming interface|API]]s. A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) with [[NURBS]] geometry or [[boundary representation]] (B-rep) data via a [[geometric modeling kernel]]. A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry, such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly.

Unexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of [[prototyping]] called [[digital prototyping]]. In contrast to physical prototypes, which entail manufacturing time in the design. That said, CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an [[industrial CT scanning]] machine. Depending on the nature of the business, digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs.

Today, CAD systems exist for all the major platforms ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[UNIX]] and [[Mac OS X]]); some packages support multiple platforms.

Right now, no special hardware is required for most CAD software. However, some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks, so a modern [[graphics card]], high speed (and possibly multiple) [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s and large amounts of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] may be recommended.

The human-machine interface is generally via a [[computer mouse]] but can also be via a pen and digitizing [[graphics tablet]]. Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a [[3Dconnexion|Spacemouse/SpaceBall]]. Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for [[Scientific visualization|viewing the 3D model]].Technologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users. These include the [[Cave automatic virtual environment|CAVE]] or [[Virtual reality|HMDs]] and interactive [[Leap Motion|devices]] like motion-sensing [[Kinect|technology]]

==Software==
CAD software enables engineers and architects to design, inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) on a [[personal computer]] system. Most applications support [[solid modeling]] with [[boundary representation]] (B-Rep) and [[NURBS]] geometry, and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats. A [[geometric modeling kernel]] is a software component that provides solid modeling and surface modeling features to CAD applications.

But "we used it for our own personal workstation.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/107611/oh178dtr.pdf?sequence=1|title=oh178dtr.pdf|author=|date=|website=umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The designers of these very early computers built utility programs so that programmers could debug programs using flowcharts on a display scope with logical switches that could be opened and closed during the debugging session. They found that they could create electronic symbols and geometric figures to be used to create simple circuit diagrams and flowcharts.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J.

This suggested numerous possibilities to them. It took ten years of interdisciplinary development&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Writer, Scopewriter pp. 3–17 Weisberg, David E. [http://www.cadhistory.net/toc.htm The Engineering Design Revolution].&lt;/ref&gt; work before SKETCHPAD sitting on evolving math libraries emerged from MIT's labs. Additional developments were carried out in the 1960s within the aircraft, automotive, industrial control and electronics industries in the area of 3D surface construction, NC programming, and design analysis, most of it independent of one another and often not publicly published until much later. Some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by Robert Issac Newton from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his 1957 novel ''The Door into Summer'' suggested the possibility of a robotic ''Drafting Dan''. However, probably the most important work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by [[Pierre Bézier]], [[Paul de Casteljau]] ([[Citroen]]), [[Steven Anson Coons]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]), James Ferguson ([[Boeing]]), [[Carl de Boor]] ([[General Motors|GM]]), Birkhoff (GM) and Garibedian (GM) in the 1960s and W. Gordon (GM) and R. Riesenfeld in the 1970s.

The invention of the 3D CAD/CAM is attributed to a French engineer, [[Pierre Bézier]] ([[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]], Renault). After his mathematical work concerning surfaces, he developed [[UNISURF]], between 1966 and 1968, to ease the design of parts and tools for the automotive industry. Then, UNISURF became the working base for the following generations of CAD software.

It is argued{{by who|date=June 2017}} that a turning point was the development of the [[Sketchpad|SKETCHPAD]] system at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;Yares, Evan (February 13, 2013) [http://www.designworldonline.com/50-years-of-cad/#_ 50 Years of CAD]. DesignWorld&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/labnotes/LookingBack_19_1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107151904/http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/labnotes/LookingBack_19_1.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-07 |title=Looking Back: The TX-2 Computer and Sketchpad 82|journal=Lincoln Laboratory Journal|volume=19|issue=1|year =2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ivan Sutherland]] (who later created a graphics technology company with David Evans). The distinctive feature of SKETCHPAD was that it allowed the designer to interact with his computer graphically: the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[Computer display|monitor]] with a [[light pen]]. Effectively, it was a prototype of [[graphical user interface]], an indispensable feature of modern CAD. Sutherland presented his paper Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System in 1963 at a [[Joint Computer Conference]] having worked on it as his PhD thesis paper with Doctoral advisor Claude Shannon . Quoting, "For drawings where motion of the drawing or analysis of a drawn problem is of value to the user, Sketchpad excels. For highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required, Sketchpad is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile. For drawings which merely communicate with shops, it is probably better to use conventional paper and pencil." Over time efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the [[Computer-automated design|designers drawings communicate]] not just with shops but with the [[STEP-NC|shop tool]] itself. This goal would be a long time arriving.

The first commercial applications of CAD were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as in electronics. Only large corporations could afford the computers capable of performing the calculations. Notable company projects were, a joint project of [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] ([[Patrick J. Hanratty]]) and [[IBM]] ([http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/v32n1/columns/machover.html Sam Matsa], Doug Ross's [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] APT research assistant) to develop a prototype system for design engineers [[DAC-1]] (Design Augmented by Computer) 1964; [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] projects; [[Nokia Bell Labs|Bell]] GRAPHIC 1 and [[Renault]].

One of the most influential events in the development of CAD was the founding of MCS (Manufacturing and Consulting Services Inc.) in 1971 by Patrick J. Hanratty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote the system ADAM (Automated Drafting And Machining) but more importantly supplied code to companies such as [[McDonnell Douglas]] ([[Unigraphics]]), [[Computervision]] ([[CADDS]]), [[Calma]], [[Gerber Scientific|Gerber]], [[Auto-Trol Technology|Autotrol]] and [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]].

As computers became more affordable, the application areas have gradually expanded. The development of CAD software for personal desktop computers was the impetus for almost universal application in all areas of construction.

Other key points in the 1960s and 1970s would be the foundation of CAD systems [[UGS Corp.|United Computing]], [[Intergraph]], [[IBM]], Intergraph IGDS in 1974 (which led to [[Bentley Systems]] [[MicroStation]] in 1984).

CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since then. Initially, with 3D in the 1970s, it was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings. Advances in programming and computer hardware,&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, Kurt (1981) [http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/WS/EGGH/EGGH91/003-005.pdf Issues and Directions for Graphics Hardware Accelerators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019203041/http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/WS/EGGH/EGGH91/003-005.pdf |date=2014-10-19 }}. Eurographics Digital Laboratory, diglib.eg.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Computer1984_6 Computer Graphics (4/5/1984)]. archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; notably solid modeling in the 1980s have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities.

Key products for 1981 were the solid modeling packages - [[Romulus (b-rep solid modeler)|Romulus]] (ShapeData) and Uni-Solid (Unigraphics) based on PADL-2 and the release of the surface modeler [[CATIA]] ([[Dassault Systemes]]). Autodesk was founded 1982 by John Walker, which led to the 2D system [[AutoCAD]]. The next milestone was the release of [[Pro/ENGINEER]] in 1987, which heralded greater usage of feature-based modeling methods and parametric linking of the parameters of features. Also of importance to the development of CAD was the development of the B-rep solid modeling kernels (engines for manipulating geometrically and topologically consistent 3D objects) [[Parasolid]] (ShapeData) and [[ACIS]] (Spatial Technology Inc.) at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, both inspired by the work of Ian Braid. This led to the release of mid-range packages such as [[SolidWorks]] and TriSpective (later known as [[Ironcad|IRONCAD]]) in 1995, [[Solid Edge]] (then [[Intergraph]]) in 1996 and [[Autodesk Inventor]] in 1999. An independent [[geometric modeling kernel]] has been evolving in Russia since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Cobalt Qube 3 Front.jpg|thumb|[[Cobalt Qube]] 3 - a computer [[server appliance]] (2002, discontinued)]]

A '''computer appliance''' is a [[computer]] with software or [[firmware]] that is specifically designed to provide a specific computing resource. Such devices became known as ''appliances'' because of the similarity in role or management to a [[home appliance]], which are generally ''closed and sealed'', and are not serviceable by the user or owner. The hardware and software are delivered as an integrated product and may even be pre-configured before delivery to a customer, to provide a turn-key solution for a particular application. Unlike general purpose [[computer]]s, appliances are generally not designed to allow the customers to change the software and the underlying [[operating system]], or to flexibly reconfigure the hardware.

Another form of appliance is the [[virtual appliance]], which has similar functionality to a dedicated hardware appliance, but is distributed as a software [[virtual machine]] image for a hypervisor-equipped device.

==Overview==
Traditionally, [[software applications]] run on top of a general-purpose [[operating system]], which uses the hardware resources of the computer (primarily memory, disk storage, processing power, and networking bandwidth) to meet the computing needs of the user. The main issue with the traditional model is related to complexity. It is complex to integrate the operating system and applications with a hardware platform, and complex to support it afterwards.

By tightly constraining the variations of the hardware and software, the appliance becomes easily deployable, and can be used without nearly as wide (or deep) IT knowledge. Additionally, when problems and errors appear, the supporting staff very rarely needs to explore them deeply to understand the matter thoroughly. The staff needs merely training on the appliance management software to be able to resolve most of problems.

In all forms of the computer appliance model, customers benefit from easy operations. The appliance has exactly one combination of hardware and operating system and application software, which has been pre-installed at the factory. This prevents customers from needing to perform complex integration work, and dramatically simplifies troubleshooting. In fact, this "turnkey operation" characteristic is the driving benefit that customers seek when purchasing appliances.

To be considered an appliance, the (hardware) device needs to be integrated with software, and both are supplied as a package.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} This distinguishes appliances from "home grown" solutions, or solutions requiring complex implementations by integrators or [[Value-added reseller]]s (VARs).

The appliance approach helps to [[wikt:decouple|decouple]] the various systems and applications, for example in the data center. Once a resource is decoupled, in theory it can be also centralized to become shared among many systems, centrally managed and optimized, all without requiring changes to any other system.

==Tradeoffs of the computer appliance approach==
The major{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} disadvantage of deploying a computer appliance is that since they are designed to supply a specific resource, they most often include a customized operating system running over specialized hardware, neither of which are likely to be compatible with the other systems previously deployed. Customers lose flexibility.

On the other hand, a proprietary embedded operating system, or operating system within an application, can make the appliance much more secure from common cyber attacks. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Types of appliances==
The variety of computer appliances reflects the wide range of computing resources they provide to applications.  Some examples:
;Storage appliances: provide massive amounts of storage and additional higher level functionality (ex: [[Disk mirroring]] and [[Data striping]]) for multiple attached systems using the transparent local [[storage area networks computer]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.networkworld.com/topics/sans.html SAN Data Center]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502092915/http://www.networkworld.com/topics/sans.html |date=2005-05-02 }}''- Network World&lt;/ref&gt;
;Network appliances: are general purpose [[Router (computing)|router]]s&lt;ref&gt;''[http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/routers/g/bldef_router.htm Routers]''- About.com&lt;/ref&gt; which provide [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] protection, [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS), [[message oriented middleware|messaging]], access to specialized networking protocols (like the [[ebXML]] Message Service) and bandwidth [[multiplexing]] for the multiple systems they front-end.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/47861/network-appliance Definition of:network appliance]''- Pcmag.com&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Backup appliance]]s and [[Backup and Disaster Recovery appliance]]s: computer appliances that are integrated backup software and backup targets, sometimes with hypervisors to support local DR of protected servers. They are often a gateway to a full DRaaS solution.
;[[Firewall (computing)|Firewall-]] and [[Security appliance]]s: computer appliances that are designed to protect computer networks from unwanted traffic.
;IIoT and MES Gateway appliances: Computer appliances that are designed to translate data bidirectionally between control systems and enterprise systems.  Proprietary, embedded, firmware applications running on the appliance use point-to-point connections to translate data between field devices in their native [[automation protocol]]s and [[Manufacturing execution system|MES]] systems through their [[API]]s, [[ODBC]], or [[REST]]ful interfaces.
;[[Anti-spam appliances]]: for [[e-mail spam]]
;[[Software appliance]]s: a software application that might be combined with [[just enough operating system]] (JeOS) for it to run on industry standard hardware or in a virtual machine. In essence, the software distribution or the firmware that is running a computer appliance.
;[[Virtual appliance|Virtual machine appliances]]: consist of a "hypervisor style" embedded operating system running on appliance hardware. The hypervisor layer is matched to the hardware of the appliance, and cannot be varied by the customer, but the customer may load other operating systems and applications onto the appliance in the form of virtual machines.

==Consumer appliances==
Aside from its deployment within data centers, many computer appliances are directly used by the general public. These include:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Appliances in industrial automation==
The world of [[industrial automation]] has been rich in appliances.  These appliances have been hardened to withstand temperature and vibration extremes.  These appliances are also highly configurable, enabling customization to meet a wide variety of applications.  The key benefits of an appliance in automation are:
# '''Reduced [[downtime]]''' - a failed appliance is typically replaced with a COTS "[[commercial off-the-shelf]]" replacement and its task is quickly and easily reloaded from a backup.
# '''Highly scalable''' - appliances are typically targeted solutions for an area of a plant or process.  As the requirements change, scalability is achieved through the installation of another appliance.  Automation concepts are easily replicated throughout the enterprise by standardizing on appliances to perform the needed tasks, as opposed to the development of custom automation schemes for each task.
# '''Low TCO ([[total cost of ownership]])''' - appliances are developed, tested and supported by automation product vendors and undergo a much broader level of quality testing than custom designed automation solutions.  The use of appliances in automation reduce the level of testing needed in each individual application.
# '''Reduced design time''' - appliances perform specific functions and although they are highly configurable, they are typically self documenting.  This enables appliance based solutions to be transferred from engineer to engineer with minimal need for training and documentation.

Types of automation appliances:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# '''PLC (programmable logic controller)''' - [[Programmable logic controller]]s are appliances that are typically used for discrete control and offer a wide range of Input and Output options.  They are configured through standardized programming languages such as IEC-1131.
# '''SLC (single loop controller)''' - [[PID controller|Single loop controllers]] are appliances that monitor an input variable and effect change on a control output (manipulated variable) to hold the input variable to a setpoint.
# '''PAC (programmable automation controller)''' - Programmable automation controllers are appliances that embody properties of both PLCs and SLCs enabling the integration of both analog and discrete control.
# '''Universal gateway''' - A [[universal gateway]] appliance has the ability to communicate with a variety of devices through their respective [[communication protocol]]s, and will affect data transactions between them.  This in increasingly important as manufacturing strives to improve agility, quality, production rates, production costs and reduce downtime through enhanced M2M ([[machine to machine]]) communications.
# '''EATMs (Enterprise Appliance Transaction Modules)''' - Enterprise appliance transaction modules are appliances that affect data transactions from plant floor automation systems to enterprise business systems.  They communicate to plant floor equipment through various vendor automation protocols, and communicate to business systems through database communication protocols such as JMS ([[Java Message Service]]) and SQL ([[SQL|Structured Query Language]]).

==Internal structure==
{{original research|section|date=September 2011}}
There are several [[design patterns]] adopted by computer appliance vendors, a few of which are shown below.  Since the whole concept of an appliance rests on keeping such implementation details away from the end user, it is difficult to match these patterns to specific appliances, particularly since they can and do change without affecting external capabilities or performance.
# '''Special chip'''  - the vendor builds an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]], without any separate "software" or operating system.  The appliance has a limited interface, usually terminal console or web-based, to allow some basic configuration by the IT staff.  The manufacturer often provides some way of accessing deeper configuration mechanisms. [[Azul Systems]]' Vega 3 Java Compute Appliance is an example; special hardware modifications to the chip enable Java application scaling.
# '''Special software kernel'''  - the vendor uses or creates a general-purpose computer, and designs a new operating system that integrates the application into the operating system. [[Cisco Systems|Cisco's]] [[Cisco IOS|IOS]] is an example; the Unix-like operating system has firewall functions and network/firewall configuration commands built into it. Sometimes, the device is also sealed, so the consumer has no access to reinstall the operating system or replace it with another operating system. The consumer may also be restricted to a small group of configuration commands, while the more detailed and lower level functions of the operating system are only available to the vendor. The more this "locked down" approach is carried out, the closer this type of device comes to appearing like an ASIC device.
# '''Specialized application'''  - off-the-shelf computers and operating systems are used, but the user interface and "box" are designed so the user cannot access anything on the computer, except for the application interface that the vendor has created. Since the underlying computing architecture is locked down and essentially invisible, it becomes difficult to discern that the device really functions on top of general purpose hardware and operating systems. Linux, and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] to a lesser degree, has become the operating system of choice for this type of appliance. Recently the term [[software appliance]] has also been used to describe such a pre-packaged, black-box combination.
# '''Virtual appliance''' - here the hardware itself has disappeared entirely and become a so-called [[virtual appliance]] (also known as a virtual software appliance) using any one of a number of [[virtual machine]] technologies. Within this virtual machine is essentially the same stack of software plus the operating system as in the "specialized application" alternative.

Sometimes, these techniques are mixed. For example, a [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]] appliance might contain a limited access software firewall running on Linux, with an encryption ASIC to speed up VPN access.

Some computer appliances use [[solid state storage]], while others use a hard drive to load an operating system. Again, the two methods might be mixed—an ASIC print server might allow an optional hard drive for job queueing, or a Linux-based device may encode Linux in [[firmware]], so that a hard drive is not needed to load the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Smith, Bob |author2=Hardin, John A |author3=Phillips, Graham |author4=Pierce, Bill | title=Linux Appliance Design: A Hands-On Guide to Building Linux Appliances | date= | publisher=No Starch Press | location= | isbn=1-59327-140-9 | pages=xvii | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVu0ax6C3uIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22network+appliance%22+date:2003-2009&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=QE5mXmjxjbgmQtw11DsRYlnewnE#PPR17,M1  | accessdate=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Natura Deorum''''' ('''''On the Nature of the Gods''''') is a philosophical dialogue by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] written in 45 BC. It is laid out in three books, each of which discusses the theology of different Roman and [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]. The dialogue uses a discussion of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]], and [[Platonism|skeptical (Platonist)]] theories to examine fundamental questions of [[theology]].

==Writing==
''De Natura Deorum'' belongs to the group of philosophical works which Cicero wrote in the two years preceding his death in 43 BC.&lt;ref name="brooks1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states near the beginning of ''De Natura Deorum'' that he wrote them both as a relief from the political inactivity to which he was reduced by the supremacy of [[Julius Caesar]], and as a distraction from the grief caused by the death of his daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].&lt;ref name="brooks1"/&gt;

The dialogue is supposed to take place in Rome at the house of [[Gaius Aurelius Cotta]].&lt;ref name="brooks4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue he appears as pontiff, but not as consul.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt; He was made pontiff soon after 82 BC, and consul in 75 BC, and as Cicero, who is present at the dialogue as a listener, did not return from Athens till 77 BC, its fictional date can be set between the years 77 and 75 BC, when Cicero was about thirty years of age, and Cotta about forty-eight.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt;

The book contains various obscurities and inconsistencies which demonstrate that it was probably never revised by Cicero, nor published until after his death.&lt;ref name="brooks5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the content, Cicero borrowed largely from earlier Greek sources.&lt;ref name="brooks5"/&gt; However, the hasty arrangement by Cicero of authorities who themselves wrote independently of one another means that the work lacks cohesion,&lt;ref name="brooks7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and points raised by one speaker are sometimes not countered by subsequent speakers.&lt;ref name="brooks6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The dialogue is on the whole narrated by Cicero himself, though he does not play an active part in the discussion. [[Gaius Velleius]] represents the Epicurean school, [[Quintus Lucilius Balbus]] argues for the Stoics, and [[Gaius Cotta]] speaks for Cicero's own [[Academic skepticism]]. The first book of the dialogue contains Cicero's introduction, Velleius' case for the Epicurean theology and Cotta's criticism of Epicureanism. Book II focuses on Balbus' explanation and defense of Stoic theology. Book III lays out Cotta's criticism of Balbus' claims. Cicero's conclusions are ambivalent and muted, "a strategy of civilized openness";&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]'', 2011:69ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he does, however, conclude that Balbus' claims, in his mind, more nearly approximate the truth (3.95).

===Book 1===
In Book 1 Cicero visits the house of Cotta the [[Pontifex Maximus]], where he finds him with Velleius &amp;ndash; a Senator and Epicurean, and Balbus supporter of the Stoics. Cotta himself is an Academic, and he informs Cicero that they were discoursing on the nature of the gods. Velleius had been stating the sentiments of [[Epicurus]] upon the subject.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius is requested to go on with his arguments after recapitulating what he had already said.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"/&gt; The discourse of Velleius consists of three parts: a general attack on [[Platonist]] and Stoic cosmology; a historical review of the earlier philosophers; and an exposition of Epicurean theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rackham|first=H.|title=Cicero: De Natura Deorum; Academica|page=xvi|publisher=Loeb Classical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius raises the difficulty of supposing the creation of the universe to have taken place at a particular period of time, and questions the possible motive of a God in undertaking the work.&lt;ref name="brooks6"/&gt; The historical section (10-15), is full of inaccuracies and mis-statements, of which it is likely that Cicero himself was ignorant, since he has Cotta later praise this account.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; The purpose however is for Velleius to show that the Epicurean idea of God as a [[Divine happiness|perfectly happy]], [[God and eternity|eternal being]], possessed of reason, and in human form, is the only tenable one, and the other differing opinions is regarded as proof of their worthlessness.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; In the remainder of the book, Cotta attacks the positions of Velleius with regard to the form of the gods, and their exemption from creation and providence.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 2===
In Book 2, Balbus gives the Stoics position on the subject of the gods.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; He alludes to the magnificence of the world, and the prevalence of belief, and refers to the frequent appearance of the gods themselves in history.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; After referring to the practice of [[divination]], Balbus proceeds to the "four causes" of [[Cleanthes]] as to how the idea of the gods is implanted in the minds of people: (1) a pre-knowledge of future events; (2) the great advantages we enjoy from nature; (3) the terror with which the mind is affected by thunder, tempests, and the like; (4) and the order and regularity in the universe. Balbus further contends that the world, or universe itself, and its parts, are possessed of reason and wisdom.&lt;ref name="dunlop246"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally discusses the creation of the world, the [[Divine providence|providence]] of the gods, and denies "that a world, so beautifully adorned, [[Teleological argument|could be formed by chance]], or by a fortuitous concourse of atoms."&lt;ref name="dunlop246"/&gt; The problem of [[Problem of evil|how to account for the presence of misery]] and disaster in a world providentially governed is only hurriedly touched upon at the end of the book.&lt;ref name="brooks8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 3===
In book 3 Cotta refutes the doctrines of Balbus.&lt;ref name="dunlop247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of this book, probably more than one third, has been lost.&lt;ref name="brooks8"/&gt; Cotta represents the appearances of gods as idle tales.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a gap in the text, following which Cotta attacks the four causes of Cleanthes.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"/&gt; Cotta refutes the Stoic ideas on reason attributed to the universe and its parts.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten chapters (16-25) are devoted to a disproportionately lengthy discussion of [[mythology]], with examples multiplied to an inordinate extent.&lt;ref name="brooks9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows another major gap in the text, at the end of which Cotta is seen attacking the doctrine of providential care for humans.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brooks9"/&gt; Cicero states "The conversation ended here, and we parted. Velleius judged that the arguments of Cotta were the truest, but those of Balbus seemed to me to have the greater probability."&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;

==Influence==
The Christian writers [[Tertullian]], [[Minucius Felix]], [[Lactantius]], and [[Augustine]] were acquainted with ''De Natura Deorum'', and their arguments against polytheism were largely borrowed from it.&lt;ref name="brooks10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work, alongside ''[[De Officiis]]'' and ''[[De Divinatione]]'', was highly influential on the [[philosophes]] of the 18th century. [[David Hume]] was familiar with the work and used it to style his own ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=Thomas|title=Spectres of Fasle Divinity: Hume's Moral Atheism|year=2010|page=28|publisher=Oxford Universoty Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] described ''De Natura Deorum'' and the ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'' as "the two most beautiful books ever produced by the wisdom of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;'Les deux plus beaux ouvrages qu’ait jamais écrits la sagesse qui n’est qu’humaine' [Voltaire, "Cicéron", ''Dictionnaire philosophique'' (1764); ''Œuvres complètes'' (Garnier) 18:181]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811 a fourth book was 'discovered' and published by one 'P. Seraphinus' in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="farrer"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Farrer|first=James Anson|title=Literary Forgeries|pages=10-12|year=1907|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this forgery Cicero asserts many points compatible with Christian and Catholic dogma, and even argues in favour of an authority equivalent to the Papacy.&lt;ref name="farrer"/&gt;

==Scholarship==
This work, although not written by an orthodox Epicurean or Stoic, is important because it supplements the scant primary texts that remain from Epicureans and Stoics discussing their views on religion and theology. In particular, heated scholarly debate has focused on this text's discussion at 1.43-44 of how the Epicurean gods may be said to "exist"; David Sedley, for example, holds that Epicureans, as represented in this text and elsewhere, think that "gods are our own graphic [[Ideal (ethics)|idealization]] of the life to which we aspire",&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sedley]], ''Epicurus’ Theological Innatism.'' In Fish and Saunders 2011: 29-52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas David Konstan maintains that "the Epicurean gods are real, in the sense that they exist as atomic compounds and possess the properties that pertain to the concept, or prolēpsis, that people have of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Konstan]], ''Epicurus on the Gods''. In Fish and Saunders 2011: 53-71&lt;/ref&gt;

* There is in fact no subject upon which so much difference of opinion exists, not only among the unlearned but also among educated men; and the views entertained are so various and so discrepant, that, while it is no doubt a possible alternative that none of them is true, it is certainly impossible that more than one should be so.

'''Dhauli''' hills ({{lang-or|[[:or:ଧଉଳି|'''ଧଉଳିଗିରି''']]}}) are located on the banks of the river [[Daya River|Daya]], 8&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Bhubaneswar]] in [[Odisha]] ([[India]]). It is a hill with vast open space adjoining it, and has major [[Edict]]s of [[Ashoka]] engraved on a mass of rock, by the side of the road leading to the summit of the hill.

== Significance ==
Dhauli hill is presumed to be the area where the [[Kalinga War]] was fought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.indiavideo.org/text/maurya-dynasty-kalinga-war-ashoka-49.php | title= Kalinga War and its impact on Ashoks | publisher= India Video |accessdate= April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rock Edicts]] found here include Nos. I-X, XIV and two separate [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] Edicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lahiri |first1=Nayanjot |title=Ashoka in Ancient India |date=2015 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674915251 |page=425 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaVRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT425 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kalinga Edict VI, he expresses his concern for the "''welfare of the whole world''". The rock-cut elephant above the Edicts is the earliest [[Buddhist]] sculpture of Odisha. The stone elephant shows the animal's foreparts only, though it has a fine sense of form and movement.&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131711200 |page=361 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA361 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered as one of the few remains of [[Mauryan art]].&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

[[Ashoka]] had a special weakness for Dhauli, where the battle was fought. The [[Daya River|Daya river]] is said to have turned red with the blood of the many deceased after the battle, and enabled Ashoka to realize the magnitude of horror associated with war. He saw to it that Dhauli became an important centre of Buddhist activities. He built several [[chaitya]]s, [[stupa]]s and [[Column|pillars]] there. He got abodes excavated for the recluse, instructions inscribed for officials, expounded the main principles of '''dandaniti''' (strict enforcement of laws) for the public, provided special status to his new kingdom including the stupas at Dhauli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dhauli.net/ | title= Dhauli Hills, Bhubaneswar, Odisha |publisher= |accessdate= April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the top of the hill, a dazzling white peace pagoda has been built by the ''Japan Buddha Sangha'' and the ''Kalinga Nippon Buddha Sangha'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://odishatourism.gov.in/?q=node/210 | title= Dhauli | publisher= Odisha Tourism, Government of Odisha |accessdate= August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby region also houses Ashokan edicts and possibly a [[Stupa]] at Bhaskareshwar temple at Tankapani road as arglars.
The Dhauligiri hills also has an ancient [[Shiva]] temple which is the place for mass gathering during [[Maha Shivaratri|Shiva Ratri]] Celebrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11390">'''Eukaryotic translation''' is the biological process by which [[messenger RNA]] is [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into [[protein]]s in [[eukaryotes]]. It consists of four phases: initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling.

==Initiation==

[[Image:Eukaryotic Translation Initiation.png|thumb|right|450px|The process of initiation of translation in eukaryotes.]]

===Cap-dependent initiation===

Initiation of translation usually involves the interaction of certain key proteins, the [[initiation factor]]s, with a special tag bound to the 5'-end of an mRNA molecule, the [[5' cap]], as well as with the [[5' UTR]]. These proteins bind the small (40S) [[ribosome|ribosomal]] subunit and hold the mRNA in place. [[Eukaryotic initiation factor 3|eIF3]] is associated with the 40S ribosomal subunit and plays a role in keeping the large ([[60S]]) ribosomal subunit from prematurely binding. eIF3 also interacts with the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor 4F|eIF4F]] complex, which consists of three other initiation factors: [[eIF4A]], [[eIF4E]], and [[eIF4G]]. [[eIF4G]] is a scaffolding protein that directly associates with both eIF3 and the other two components. [[eIF4E]] is the cap-binding protein. Binding of the cap by eIF4E is often considered the rate-limiting step of cap-dependent initiation, and the concentration of eIF4E is a regulatory nexus of translational control. Certain viruses cleave a portion of eIF4G that binds eIF4E, thus preventing cap-dependent translation to hijack the host machinery in favor of the viral (cap-independent) messages. [[eIF4A]] is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that aids the ribosome by resolving certain secondary structures formed along the mRNA transcript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Internal ribosome entry sites in eukaryotic mRNA molecules|url = http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/15/13/1593|journal = Genes &amp; Development|date = 2001-07-01|issn = 0890-9369|pmid = 11445534|pages = 1593–1612|volume = 15|issue = 13|doi = 10.1101/gad.891101|language = en|first = Christopher U. T.|last = Hellen|first2 = Peter|last2 = Sarnow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[poly(A)-binding protein]] (PABP) also associates with the [[eIF4F]] complex via eIF4G, and binds the [[poly-A tail]] of most eukaryotic mRNA molecules. This protein has been implicated in playing a role in circularization of the mRNA during translation.&lt;ref name=Malys&gt;{{cite journal | author = Malys N, McCarthy JEG | title = Translation initiation: variations in the mechanism can be anticipated |journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | year = 2011 | doi =10.1007/s00018-010-0588-z | pmid=21076851 | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 991–1003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wells, SE | title = Circularization of mRNA by Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factors | journal = Molecular Cell | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80122-7 | volume = 2 | pages = 135–140|pmid=    9702200|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[43S preinitiation complex]] (43S PIC) accompanied by the protein factors moves along the mRNA chain toward its 3'-end, in a process known as 'scanning', to reach the [[start codon]] (typically AUG). In [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]] and [[archaea]], the [[amino acid]] encoded by the start codon is [[methionine]]. The Met-charged initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt;) is brought to the P-site of the small ribosomal subunit by [[eIF2|eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)]]. It hydrolyzes GTP, and signals for the dissociation of several factors from the small ribosomal subunit, eventually leading to the association of the large subunit (or the [[60S]] subunit). The complete ribosome ([[80S]]) then commences translation elongation.

Regulation of protein synthesis is partly influenced by phosphorylation of [[eIF2]] (via the α subunit), which is a part of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt; ternary complex (eIF2-TC). When large numbers of eIF2 are phosphorylated, protein synthesis is inhibited. This occurs under amino acid starvation or after viral infection. However, a small fraction of this initiation factor is naturally phosphorylated. Another regulator is [[eIF4EBP1|4EBP]], which binds to the initiation factor [[eIF4E]] and inhibits its interactions with [[eIF4G]], thus preventing cap-dependent initiation. To oppose the effects of 4EBP, growth factors phosphorylate 4EBP, reducing its affinity for eIF4E and permitting protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberts et al |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |date=2017 |publisher=Garland Science |pages=1107-1112 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While protein synthesis is globally regulated by modulating the expression of key initiation factors as well as the number of ribosomes, individual mRNAs can have different translation rates due to the presence of regulatory sequence elements. This has been shown to be important in a variety of settings including yeast meiosis and ethylene response in plants. In addition, recent work in yeast and humans suggest that evolutionary divergence in cis-regulatory sequences can impact translation regulation.&lt;ref name="Cenik2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenik|first1=Can|last2=Cenik|first2=Elif Sarinay|last3=Byeon|first3=Gun W|last4=Candille|first4=Sophie P.|last5=Spacek|first5=Damek|last6=Araya|first6=Carlos L|last7=Tang|first7=Hua|last8=Ricci|first8=Emiliano |last9=Snyder|first9=Michael P.|title=Integrative analysis of RNA, translation, and protein levels reveals distinct regulatory variation across humans.|journal=Genome Research|doi=10.1101/gr.193342.115|pmid=26297486|volume=25|date=Nov 2015|pages=1610–21|pmc=4617958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, RNA [[helicase|helicases]] such as [[DHX29]] and [[DDX3X|Ded1/DDX3]] may participate in the process of translation initiation, especially for mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs.&lt;ref name="Pisareva Pisarev Komar Hellen 2008 pp. 1237–1250"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pisareva | first=Vera P. | last2=Pisarev | first2=Andrey V. | last3=Komar | first3=Anton A. | last4=Hellen | first4=Christopher U.T. | last5=Pestova | first5=Tatyana V. | title=Translation Initiation on Mammalian mRNAs with Structured 5′UTRs Requires DExH-Box Protein DHX29 | journal=Cell | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=135 | issue=7 | year=2008 | issn=0092-8674 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.037 | pages=1237–1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cap-independent initiation===

The best-studied example of cap-independent translation initiation in eukaryotes is that by the [[Internal ribosome entry site]] (IRES). What differentiates cap-independent translation from cap-dependent translation is that cap-independent translation does not require the 5' cap to initiate scanning from the 5' end of the mRNA until the start codon. The ribosome can be trafficked to the start site by direct binding, initiation factors, and/or ITAFs (IRES trans-acting factors) bypassing the need to scan the entire [[5' UTR]]. This method of translation has been found important in conditions that require the translation of specific mRNAs during cellular stress, when overall translation is reduced. Examples include factors responding to apoptosis and stress-induced responses.&lt;ref name=LopezLastra&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = López-Lastra | first1 = M | last2 = Rivas | first2 = A | last3 = Barría | first3 = MI | title = Protein synthesis in eukaryotes: the growing biological relevance of cap-independent translation initiation | journal = Biological research | volume = 38 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 121–46 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16238092 | doi=10.4067/s0716-97602005000200003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elongation==

 [[File:Protein translation.gif|thumb|The elongation and membrane targeting stages of eukaryotic translation. The ribosome is green and yellow, the tRNAs are dark-blue, and the other proteins involved are light-blue]]

Elongation depends on [[eukaryotic elongation factors]]. At the end of the initiation step, the mRNA is positioned so that the next codon can be translated during the elongation stage of protein synthesis. The initiator tRNA occupies the P site in the ribosome, and the A site is ready to receive an aminoacyl-tRNA. During chain elongation, each additional amino acid is added to the nascent polypeptide chain in a three-step microcycle. The steps in this microcycle are (1) positioning the correct aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site of the ribosome, (2) forming the peptide bond and (3) shifting the mRNA by one codon relative to the ribosome.

Unlike bacteria, in which translation initiation occurs as soon as the 5' end of an mRNA is synthesized, in eukaryotes such tight coupling between transcription and translation is not possible because transcription and translation are carried out in separate compartments of the cell (the nucleus and cytoplasm). Eukaryotic mRNA precursors must be processed in the nucleus (e.g., capping, polyadenylation, splicing) before they are exported to the cytoplasm for translation.

Translation can also be affected by [[Ribosomal pause|ribosomal pausing]], which can trigger endonucleolytic attack of the mRNA, a process termed mRNA no-go decay. Ribosomal pausing also aids co-translational folding of the nascent polypeptide on the ribosome, and delays protein translation while it is encoding mRNA. This can trigger ribosomal frameshifting.&lt;ref&gt;Buchan JR, Stansfield I. Halting a cellular production line: responses to ribosomal pausing during translation. Biol Cell. 2007 Sep;99(9):475-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==

Termination of elongation depends on [[eukaryotic release factors]]. The process is similar to that of [[prokaryotic translation#Termination|prokaryotic termination]], but unlike prokaryotic termination, there is a universal [[release factor]], eRF1, that recognizes all three stop codons. Upon termination, the ribosome is disassembled and the completed polypeptide is released. eRF3 is a ribosome-dependent GTPase that helps eRF1 release the completed polypeptide. The human genome encodes a few genes whose mRNA stop codon are surprisingly leaky: In these genes, termination of translation is inefficient due to special RNA bases in the vicinity of the stop codon. Leaky termination in these genes leads to [[Stop codon#Translational readthrough|translational readthrough]] of up to 10% of the stop codons of these genes. Some of these genes encode functional [[protein domain]]s in their readthrough extension so that new protein [[isoform]]s can arise. This process has been termed 'functional translational readthrough'.&lt;ref name="readthrough"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schueren F and Thoms S |title=Functional Translational Readthrough: A Systems Biology Perspective |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=12 |issue=e1006196 |pages=12 |date=2016 |pmid=27490485 |pmc=4973966 |doi=10.1371/JOURNAL.PGEN.1006196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food microbiology''' is the study of the [[microorganism]]s that inhibit, create, or [[Food contaminant|contaminate]] [[food]], including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage, [[pathogen]]s that may cause disease especially if food is improperly cooked or stored, those used to produce [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented foods]] such as [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[bread]], [[beer]], and [[wine]], and those with other useful roles such as producing [[probiotics]].&lt;ref name=FratamicoBayles&gt;{{cite book | author = Fratamico PM |editor=Bayles DO | title = Foodborne Pathogens: Microbiology and Molecular Biology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 |  isbn = 978-1-904455-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tannockpro3&gt;{{cite book | editor = Tannock GW | title = Probiotics and Prebiotics: Scientific Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 | isbn =  978-1-904455-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= LjunghWadstrom&gt;{{cite book |veditors= Ljungh A, Wadstrom T | year=2009 |title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= MayoB&gt;{{cite book |author= Mayo, B |editor= van Sinderen, D | year=2010 |title=Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-68-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food safety ==
[[File:FDA microbiologist working in a biosafety laboratory tests for high risk pathogens in food.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A microbiologist working in a biosafety laboratory tests for high risk pathogens in food.]]

[[Food safety]] is a major focus of food microbiology. Numerous agents of disease, [[pathogen]]s, are readily transmitted via food, including [[bacterium|bacteria]], and [[virus]]es. Microbial [[toxin]]s are also possible contaminants of food. However, [[microorganisms]] and their products can also be used to combat these pathogenic microbes. [[Probiotic]] bacteria, including those that produce [[bacteriocin]]s, can kill and inhibit [[pathogen]]s. Alternatively, purified [[bacteriocin]]s such as [[nisin]] can be added directly to food products. Finally, [[bacteriophage]]s, viruses that only infect [[bacterium|bacteria]], can be [[phage therapy|used to kill bacterial pathogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sillankorva|first1=Sanna M.|last2=Oliveira|first2=Hugo|last3=Azeredo|first3=Joana|title=Bacteriophages and Their Role in Food Safety|journal=International Journal of Microbiology|date=2012|volume=2012|pages=1–13|doi=10.1155/2012/863945|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijmicro/2012/863945/|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorough preparation of [[food]], including proper [[cooking]], eliminates most bacteria and viruses. However, ''toxins produced'' by contaminants may not be liable to change to non-toxic forms by heating or [[cooking]] the contaminated food due to other safety conditions.

== Fermentation ==
{{see also|Fermentation in food processing|Yeast in winemaking}}

[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] is one of the methods to preserve food and alter its quality. [[Yeast]], especially ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', is used to leaven [[bread]], [[brewing|brew]] [[beer]] and make [[wine]]. Certain [[bacteria]], including [[lactic acid bacteria]], are used to make [[yogurt]], [[cheese]], [[hot sauce]], [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]], fermented sausages and dishes such as [[kimchi]]. A common effect of these fermentations is that the food product is less hospitable to other [[microorganism]]s, including [[pathogen]]s and [[Food spoilage|spoilage]]-causing microorganisms, thus extending the food's [[shelf-life]]. Some [[cheese]] varieties also require [[mold]]s to ripen and develop their characteristic [[flavor]]s.

==Microbial biopolymers==
Several microbially produced [[biopolymers]] are used in the [[food industry]].&lt;ref name=BerndRehm&gt;{{cite book | editor = Rehm BHA | title = Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors: Applications and Perspectives | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alginate===
[[Alginates]] can be used as [[thickening agents]].&lt;ref name=2Remminghorst&gt;{{cite book |author=Remminghorst |author2=Rehm |last-author-amp=yes|year=2009|chapter=Microbial Production of Alginate: Biosynthesis and Applications|title=Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although listed here under the category 'Microbial [[polysaccharides]]', commercial alginates are currently only produced by extraction from [[brown seaweeds]] such as ''[[Laminaria hyperborea]]'' or ''[[Laminaria japonica|L. japonica]]''.

===Poly-&amp;gamma;-glutamic acid===
[[Polyglutamic acid|Poly-γ-glutamic acid]] (γ-PGA) produced by various strains of ''[[Bacillus]]'' has potential applications as a thickener in the food industry.&lt;ref name=5shih&gt;{{cite book |author=Shih |author2=Wu |last-author-amp=yes|year=2009|chapter=Biosynthesis and Application of Poly(gamma-glutamic acid)|title=Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food testing==

[[File:LUA, Faculty of Food Technology Food microbiology laboratory.jpg|thumb|250px|Food microbiology laboratory at the [[Faculty of Food Technology, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies|Faculty of Food Technology]], [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]].]]
To ensure [[Food safety|safety of food products]], microbiological tests such as testing for [[pathogen]]s and spoilage organisms are required. This way the risk of contamination under normal use conditions can be examined and [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] outbreaks can be prevented. Testing of food products and ingredients is important along the whole [[supply chain]] as possible flaws of products can occur at every stage of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodsciencetechnologynetwork.com/food-industry-directory/food-testing-laboratories  Food Testing Laboratories]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from detecting spoilage, microbiological tests can also determine germ content, identify yeasts and molds, and [[salmonella]]. For salmonella, scientists are also developing rapid and portable technologies capable of identifying unique variants of Salmonella .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/FDATrack/track-proj?program=cfsan&amp;id=CFSAN-ORS-Rapid-Testing-and-Identification-of-Salmonella-in-Foods  Rapid Testing and Identification of Salmonella in Foods]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polymerase chain reaction|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) is a quick and inexpensive method to generate numbers of copies of a DNA fragment at a specific band ("PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)," 2008). For that reason, scientists are using PCR to detect different kinds of viruses or bacteria, such as HIV and anthrax based on their unique DNA patterns. Various kits are commercially available to help in food pathogen nucleic acids extraction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortiusbio.com/Food_Pathogen_DNA_Extraction FOOD PATHOGEN DNA EXTRACTION filter paper card]&lt;/ref&gt; PCR detection, and differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/en/US/adirect/lt?cmd=catDisplayStyle&amp;catKey=601456&amp;filterDispName=Microbial%2BDetection%2B%2526amp%253B%2BIdentification%2BKits&amp;_bcs_=H4sIAAAAAAAAAI1P0QrCMAz8mr44HN0KutfpUEQQQfS9dNEVWitt5tjfe0MEn0QId01y9C7zQsjq%0AGEPbG06ZKBfZieLTGko%2F5h3zQ6halBvUMAy5s1diMt09uHCzlHITPFZ9AtAd0AVPoBBbinnH3uEX%0AUaqpZMWxp6mXSwkqZAFlVcpihm5v3%2Fbaw3GV1Snp8f8Iqq7kxxZsNGtsP6HOJ4BubSTDeDkWamN8%0AK1Szu2wPEDc2PZwe15rpFuKIGBjuaYRiyvd9w1W7NB3xAijCMNBQAQAA]&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of bacterial strands in food products is very important to everyone in the world, for it helps prevent the occurrence of food borne illness. Therefore, PCR is recognized as a DNA detector in order to amplify and trace the presence of pathogenic strands in different processed food.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6661">'''Formability''' is the ability of a given [[metal]] workpiece to undergo [[plastic deformation]] without being damaged. The plastic deformation capacity of [[metal]]lic materials, however, is limited to a certain extent, at which point, the material could experience tearing or fracture (breakage).

Processes affected by the formability of a material include: [[rolling]], [[extrusion]], [[forging]], [[rollforming]], [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], and [[hydroforming]].

== Fracture strain ==
A general parameter that indicates the formability and [[ductility]] of a material is the [[fracture]] strain which is determined by a uniaxial [[tensile test]] (see also [[fracture toughness]]). The strain identified by this test is defined by elongation with respect to a reference length. For example, a length of {{convert|abbr=on|80|mm|in}} is used for the standardized uniaxial test of flat specimens, pursuant to [[EN 10002]]. It is important to note that deformation is homogeneous up to uniform elongation. Strain subsequently localizes until fracture occurs. Fracture strain is not an engineering strain since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the reference length. Fracture strain is nevertheless a rough indicator of the formability of a material. Typical values of the fracture strain are: 7% for ultra-high-strength material, and over 50% for mild-strength steel.

== Forming limits for sheet forming ==
One main failure mode is caused by tearing of the material. This is typical for sheet-forming applications.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;Pearce, R.: “Sheet Metal Forming”, Adam Hilger, 1991, {{ISBN|0-7503-0101-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koist"&gt;Koistinen, D. P.; Wang, N.-M. edts.: „Mechanics of Sheet Metal Forming – Material Behavior and Deformation analysis“, Plenum Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0-306-40068-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marc"&gt;Marciniak, Z.; Duncan, J.: “The Mechanics of Sheet Metal Forming”, Edward Arnold, 1992, {{ISBN|0-340-56405-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A neck may appear at a certain forming stage. This is an indication of localized [[plastic deformation]]. Whereas more or less homogeneous deformation takes place in and around the subsequent neck location in the early stable deformation stage, almost all deformation is concentrated in the neck zone during the quasi-stable and instable deformation phase. This leads to material failure manifested by tearing. Forming-limit curves depict the extreme, but still possible, deformation which a sheet material may undergo during any stage of the stamping process. These limits depend on the deformation mode and the ratio of the surface strains. The major surface strain has a minimum value when plane strain deformation occurs, which means that the corresponding minor surface strain is zero. Forming limits are a specific material property. Typical plane strain values range from 10% for high-strength grades and 50% or above for mild-strength materials and those with very good formability.
[[Forming limit diagram]]s are often used to graphically or mathematically represent formability. It is recognized by many authors that the nature of fracture and therefore the [[Forming limit diagram]]s are intrinsically non-deterministic, since large variations might be observed even within a single experimental campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strano|first=M.|author2=Colosimo, B.M.|title=Logistic regression analysis for experimental determination of forming limit diagrams|journal=International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture|date=30 April 2006|volume=46|issue=6|pages=673–682|doi=10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2005.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deep drawability ==
A classic form of sheetforming is [[deep drawing]], which is done by drawing a sheet by means of a [[punch tool]] pressing on the inner region of the sheet, whereas the side material held by a blankholder can be drawn toward the center. It has been observed that materials with outstanding deep drawability behave anisotropically (see: [[anisotropy]]). Plastic deformation in the surface is much more pronounced than in the thickness. The [[lankford coefficient]] (r) is a specific material property indicating the ratio between width deformation and thickness deformation in the uniaxial tensile test. Materials with very good deep drawability have an ''r'' value of 2 or below. The positive aspect of formability with respect to the forming limit curve ([[forming limit diagram]]) is seen in the deformation paths of the material that are concentrated in the extreme left of the diagram, where the forming limits become very large.

== Ductility ==
Another failure mode that may occur without any tearing is [[ductile]] fracture after plastic deformation ([[ductility]]). This may occur as a result of bending or shear deformation (inplane or through the thickness). The failure mechanism may be due to void [[nucleation]] and expansion on a microscopic level. Microcracks and subsequent [[macrocrack]]s may appear when deformation of the material between the voids has exceeded the limit. Extensive research has focused in recent years on understanding and modeling [[ductile]] fracture. The approach has been to identify [[ductile]] forming limits using various small-scale tests that show different strain ratios or stress triaxialities.&lt;ref name="Hoop"&gt;Hooputra, H.; Gese, H.; Dell, H.; Werner, H.: "A comprehensive failure model for crashworthiness simulation of aluminium extrusions", IJ Crash 2004 Vol 9, No. 5, pp. 449-463.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wierz"&gt;Wierzbicki, T.; Bao, Y.; Lee, Y.-W.; Bai, Y.: “Calibration and Evaluation of Seven Fracture Models”, Int. J. Mech. Sci., Vol. 47, 719 – 743, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective measure of this type of forming limit is the minimum radius in roll-forming applications (half the sheet thickness for materials with good and three times the sheet thickness for materials with low formability).

== Use of formability parameters ==
Knowledge of the material formability is very important to the layout and design of any industrial forming process. Simulations using the [[finite-element method]] and use of formability criteria such as the forming limit curve ([[forming limit diagram]]) enhance and, in some cases, are indispensable to certain tool design processes (also see: [[Sheet metal forming simulation]] and [[Sheet metal forming analysis]]).

== IDDRG ==
One major objective of the International Deep Drawing Research Group ([[IDDRG]], from 1957) is the investigation, exchange and dissemination of knowledge and experience about the formability of sheet materials.

'''Formins (formin homology proteins)''' are a group of [[proteins]] that are involved in the [[polymerization]] of [[actin]] and associate with the fast-growing end (barbed end) of actin filaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evangelista M, Zigmond S, Boone C | title = Formins: signaling effectors for assembly and polarization of actin filaments | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 13 | pages = 2603–11 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12775772 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most formins are [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho-GTPase]] effector proteins.

Formins are characterised by the presence of three formin homology (FH) [[protein domain|domains]] (FH1, FH2 and FH3), although members of the formin family do not necessarily contain all three [[protein domains|domains]].&lt;ref name="pmid12538772"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitayama C, Uyeda TQ | title = ForC, a novel type of formin family protein lacking an FH1 domain, is involved in multicellular development in Dictyostelium discoideum | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 711–23 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12538772 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallar BJ, Alberts AS | title = The formins: active scaffolds that remodel the cytoskeleton | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 435–46 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12888296 | doi = 10.1016/S0962-8924(03)00153-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other domains are usually present, such as PDZ, DAD, WH2, or FHA domains.

The [[proline]]-rich FH1 domain mediates [[Protein interactions|interactions]] with a variety of proteins, including the [[actin-binding protein]] [[profilin]], [[SH3 domain|SH3]] (Src homology 3) domain proteins,&lt;ref name="Uetz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uetz P, Fumagalli S, James D, Zeller R | title = Molecular interaction between limb deformity proteins (formins) and Src family kinases | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 52 | pages = 33525–30 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8969217 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.271.52.33525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[WW domain]] proteins.

Formins also directly bind to [[microtubules]] via their FH2 domain.

In [[ecology]], a '''habitat''' is the type of [[natural environment]] in which a particular [[species]] of [[organism]] lives. It is characterized by both physical and biological features. A species' habitat is those places where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction.

The physical factors are for example [[soil]], [[moisture]], range of [[temperature]], and [[light]] intensity as well as [[Biotic index|biotic]] factors such as the availability of [[food]] and the presence or absence of [[Predation|predators]]. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of [[moss]], and for a [[Parasitism|parasitic organism]] it is the body of its [[Host (biology)|host]], part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a [[Cell (biology)|single cell]] within the host's body.

Habitat types include [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]], [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[Subtropics|subtropical]] and [[Tropics|tropical]]. The terrestrial [[vegetation type]] may be [[forest]], [[steppe]], [[grassland]], semi-arid or [[desert]]. [[Fresh water]] habitats include [[marsh]]es, [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[pond]]s and [[Estuary|estuaries]], and marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the [[intertidal zone]], [[reef]]s, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and [[Hydrothermal vent|submarine vents]].

Habitats change over time. This may be due to a violent event such as the eruption of a [[volcano]], an [[earthquake]], a [[tsunami]], a [[wildfire]] or a change in oceanic currents; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the [[climate]], as [[ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of [[precipitation]] and [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Other changes come as a direct result of human activities; [[deforestation]], the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The [[Introduced species|introduction of alien species]] can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased [[predation]], through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the native species have no immunity.

==Definition and etymology==
The word "habitat" has been in use since about 1755 and derives from the [[Latin]] ''habitāre'', to inhabit, from ''habēre'', to have or to hold. Habitat can be defined as the natural environment of an [[organism]], the type of place in which it is natural for it to live and grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/habitat |title=Habitat |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]|title=Habitat |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habitat|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in meaning to a [[biotope]]; an area of uniform environmental conditions associated with a particular community of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biotope |title=Biotope |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental factors==
The chief environmental factors affecting the distribution of living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and the presence or absence of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities.&lt;ref name=Everyman&gt;{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia; Volume 4 |year=1967 |publisher=J.M. Dent |asin=B0015GRC04 |page=581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plants and animals are generalists, and their habitat requirements are met in a wide range of locations. The [[Pieris rapae|small white butterfly]] (''Pieris rapae'') for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of ''[[Brassica]]s'' and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richards |first=O.W. |title=The biology of the small white butterfly (''Pieris rapae''), with special reference to the factors controlling its abundance|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|year=1940 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=243–288 |doi=10.2307/1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on ''[[Thymus (plant)|Thymus]]'' species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which ''[[Myrmica]]'' ants live.&lt;ref name=Spitzer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spitzer|first=L.|author2=Benes, J.|author3=Dandova, J.|author4=Jaskova, V. |author5= Konvicka, M.|title=The Large Blue butterfly ("Phengaris [Maculinea] arion"), as a conservation umbrella on a landscape scale: The case of the Czech Carpathians|journal=Ecological Indicators |year=2009 |volume=9 |pages=1056–1063 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2008.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disturbance is important in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. [[Wildflower]] meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either [[Annual plant|annuals]] or [[Biennial plant|biennials]] and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow.&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sutherland, William J. |author2=Hill, David A. |title=Managing Habitats for Conservation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcRZodbd9oQC&amp;pg=PA6 |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44776-8 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] move in to fill the gaps created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Huggett|title=Fundamentals of Biogeography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZR68HCMmPjoC&amp;pg=PA146 |year=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-32347-5 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for [[Colonisation (biology)|colonisation.]] Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an [[Invasive species|invasive introduced species]] which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Threats-to-Wildlife/Invasive-Species.aspx |title=Invasive species |publisher=National Wildlife Federation |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Epiphytes (Dominica).jpg|thumb|left|Rich rainforest habitat in Dominica]]
Terrestrial habitat types include forests, grasslands, wetlands and deserts. Within these broad [[biome]]s are more specific habitats with varying climate types, temperature regimes, soils, altitudes and vegetation types. Many of these habitats grade into each other and each one has its own typical communities of plants and animals. A habitat may suit a particular species well, but its presence or absence at any particular location depends to some extent on chance, on its dispersal abilities and its efficiency as a coloniser.&lt;ref name=Breed&gt;{{cite book|author1=Breed, Michael D.|author2=Moore, Janice|title=Animal Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGe6UzHNcp8C&amp;pg=PT248 |year=2011|publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-091992-8 |page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Danau Sentarum 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Wetland habitats in Borneo]]
Freshwater habitats include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, marshes and bogs.&lt;ref name=BBCNature&gt;{{cite news |title=Habitats |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/habitats |newspaper=BBC Nature |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some organisms are found across most of these habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, [[bayou]]s and [[Backwater (river)|backwaters]] which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, [[aquatic plant]]s can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and play a part in the reduction of pollution.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cook, C.D.K.|author2=Gut, B.J.|author3=Rix, E.M.|author4=Schneller, J.|title=Water Plants of the World: A Manual for the Identification of the Genera of Freshwater Macrophytes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRFTK3T4WTUC&amp;pg=PR7 |year=1974 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-90-6193-024-2 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine habitats include brackish water, estuaries, bays, the open sea, the intertidal zone, the sea bed, reefs and deep / shallow water zones.&lt;ref name=BBCNature/&gt; Further variations include [[Tide pool|rock pools]], [[Shoal|sand banks]], [[mudflat]]s, [[Brackish water|brackish]] lagoons, sandy and pebbly beaches, and [[seagrass]] beds, all supporting their own flora and fauna. The [[benthic zone]] or seabed provides a home for both static organisms, anchored to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], and for a large range of organisms crawling on or burrowing into the surface. Some creatures float among the waves on the surface of the water, or raft on floating debris, others swim at a range of depths, including organisms in the [[demersal zone]] close to the seabed, and myriads of organisms drift with the currents and form the [[plankton]].&lt;ref name=Roff&gt;{{cite book|author=Roff, John|title=Marine Conservation Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSLGGARRtfYC&amp;pg=PA105 |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-53838-4 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marsa Alam R18.jpg|thumb|left|Desert scene in Egypt]]
A [[desert]] is not the kind of habitat that favours the presence of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. [[Couch's spadefoot toad]] (''Scaphiopus couchii'') emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo [[metamorphosis]], and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_spadefoot.php |title=Couch’s spadefoot (''Scaphiopus couchi'') |publisher=Arizona–Sonora Desert Museum |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organisms cope with the drying up of their aqueous habitat in other ways. [[Vernal pool]]s are ephemeral ponds that form in the rainy season and dry up afterwards. They have their specially-adapted characteristic flora, mainly consisting of annuals, the seeds of which survive the drought, but also some uniquely adapted perennials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems |author=Witham, Carol W. |year=1998 |publisher=California Native Plant Society |isbn=978-0-943460-37-6 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals adapted to these extreme habitats also exist; [[Anostraca|fairy shrimps]] can lay "winter eggs" which are resistant to [[desiccation]], sometimes being blown about with the dust, ending up in new depressions in the ground. These can survive in a dormant state for as long as fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernalpool.org/inf_fs.htm |title=Fairy shrimp |author=Green, Scott |publisher=The Vernal Pool Association |accessdate=17 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423074123/http://www.vernalpool.org/inf_fs.htm |archivedate=23 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[killifish]] behave in a similar way; their eggs hatch and the juvenile fish grow with great rapidity when the conditions are right, but the whole population of fish may end up as eggs in [[diapause]] in the dried up mud that was once a pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The most extreme fish on Earth |author=Walker, Matt |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150519-the-most-extreme-fish-on-earth |newspaper=BBC Earth |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals and plants have taken up residence in urban environments. They tend to be adaptable generalists and use the town's features to make their homes. [[Rat]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] have followed man around the globe, [[pigeon]]s, [[Peregrine falcon|peregrines]], [[sparrow]]s, [[swallow]]s and [[house martin]]s use the buildings for nesting, [[bat]]s use roof space for roosting, [[fox]]es visit the garbage bins and [[squirrel]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[raccoon]]s and [[skunk]]s roam the streets. About 2,000 coyotes are thought to live in and around [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Read, Nicholas |title=City Critters: Wildlife in the Urban Jungle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED0O1Gj0froC |year=2012 |publisher=Orca Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-55469-394-8 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of dwelling houses in northern European cities in the twentieth century found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them, including 53 species of beetle, 21 flies, 13 butterflies and moths, 13 mites, 9 lice, 7 bees, 5 wasps, 5 cockroaches, 5 spiders, 4 ants and a number of other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John G.

==Microhabitats==
A microhabitat is the small-scale physical requirements of a particular organism or population. Every habitat includes large numbers of microhabitats with subtly different exposure to light, humidity, temperature, air movement, and other factors. The [[lichen]]s that grow on the north face of a boulder are different to those that grow on the south face, from those on the level top and those that grow on the ground nearby; the lichens growing in the grooves and on the raised surfaces are different from those growing on the veins of quartz. Lurking among these miniature "forests" are the [[microfauna]], each species of [[invertebrate]] with its own specific habitat requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/lichen/ecology-habitats-micro.html |title=Microhabitats |accessdate=18 May 2016 |publisher=Government of the Commonwealth of Australia|work=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research (An Australian Government Initiative)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous different microhabitats in a wood; coniferous forest, broad-leafed forest, open woodland, scattered trees, woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern and moss.&lt;ref name=Offwell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/woodland_manage/woodbio3.htm |title=Woodlands &amp; Biodiversity  |publisher=Offwell Woodland &amp; Wildlife Trust |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the structural diversity in the wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, and a range of features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain it has been estimated that various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.&lt;ref name=Offwell/&gt;

For a parasitic organism, its habitat is the particular part of the outside or inside of its [[Host (biology)|host]] on or in which it is adapted to live. The [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis, E.E.|author2=Campbell, J.F.|author3=Sukhdeo, M.V.K.|title=The Behavioural Ecology of Parasites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKSyEsRTk5kC&amp;pg=PA183 |year=2002 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-0-85199-754-4 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) ''[[Microphallus turgidus]]'', present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States.

==Extreme habitats==
{{main|Extremophile}}
[[File:Cryptoendolith.jpg|thumb|right|An Antarctic rock split apart to show an endolithic lifeform showing as a green layer a few millimetres thick]]
Although the vast majority of life on Earth lives in [[Mesophile|mesophyllic]] (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them [[Microorganism|microbes]], have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are [[bacteria]], for example, living in [[Lake Whillans]], half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorman |first=James |title=Bacteria Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice, Scientists Say |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html |date=6 February 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the [[Mariana Trench]], the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; [[marine snow]] drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Microbes Thrive in Deepest Spot on Earth |url=http://www.livescience.com/27954-microbes-mariana-trench.html |date=17 March 2013 |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other microbes live in habitats lacking in oxygen, and are dependent on chemical reactions other than photosynthesis. Boreholes drilled {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} into the rocky seabed have found microbial communities apparently based on the products of reactions between water and the constituents of rocks. These communities have been little studied, but may be an important part of the global [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oskin |first=Becky |title=Intraterrestrials: Life Thrives in Ocean Floor |url=http://www.livescience.com/27899-ocean-subsurface-ecosystem-found.html |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock in mines two miles deep also harbour microbes; these live on minute traces of hydrogen produced in slow oxidizing reactions inside the rock. These metabolic reactions allow life to exist in places with no oxygen or light, an environment that had previously been thought to be devoid of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schultz|first1=Steven |title=Two miles underground|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/99/1213/microbe.shtml |publisher=Princeton Weekly Bulletin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113130655/http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/99/1213/microbe.shtml|archivedate=13 January 2016|date=13 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[intertidal zone]] and the [[photic zone]] in the oceans are relatively familiar habitats. However the vast bulk of the ocean is unhospitable to air-breathing humans, with [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]] limited to the upper {{convert|50|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cole |first=Bob |title=The SAA BUhlmann DeeP-Stop System Handbook |date=March 2008 |publisher=Sub-Aqua Association |isbn=978-0-9532904-8-2 |pages=vi–1 |chapter=Appendix 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower limit for photosynthesis is {{convert|100|to|200|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and below that depth the prevailing conditions include total darkness, high pressure, little oxygen (in some places), scarce food resources and extreme cold. This habitat is very challenging to research, and as well as being little studied, it is vast, with 79% of the Earth's [[biosphere]] being at depths greater than {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=DeepSea&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marinebio.org/oceans/deep/ |title=The Deep Sea |date=29 December 2011 |publisher=MarineBio Conservation Society |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no plant life, the animals in this zone are either [[detritivore]]s, reliant on food drifting down from surface layers, or they are [[Predation|predators]], feeding on each other. Some organisms are [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]], swimming or drifting in mid-ocean, while others are benthic, living on or near the seabed. Their growth rates and metabolisms tend to be slow, their eyes may be very large to detect what little illumination there is, or they may be blind and rely on other sensory inputs. A number of deep sea creatures are [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]]; this serves a variety of functions including predation, protection and social recognition.&lt;ref name=DeepSea/&gt; In general, the bodies of animals living at great depths are adapted to high pressure environments by having pressure-resistant biomolecules and small organic molecules present in their cells known as [[piezolyte]]s, which give the proteins the flexibility they need. There are also unsaturated fats in their membranes which prevent them from solidifying at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150129-life-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean |title=What does it take to live at the bottom of the ocean?|year=2016 |publisher=BBC Earth |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dense mass of anomuran crab Kiwa around deep-sea hydrothermal vent.jpg|thumb|right|Dense mass of white crabs at a hydrothermal vent, with stalked barnacles on right]]
[[Hydrothermal vent]]s were first discovered in the ocean depths in 1977.&lt;ref name=Vent/&gt; They result from seawater becoming heated after seeping through cracks to places where hot [[magma]] is close to the seabed. The under-water hot springs may gush forth at temperatures of over {{convert|340|°C|°F|-1}} and support unique communities of organisms in their immediate vicinity.&lt;ref name=Vent&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/vents.html |title=A hydrothermal vent forms when seawater meets hot magma |date=11 January 2013 |work=Ocean facts |publisher=National Ocean Service |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for this teeming life is [[chemosynthesis]], a process by which microbes convert such substances as [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[ammonia]] into organic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-videos/hydrothermal-vent-creatures |title=Hydrothermal Vent Creatures |work=Ocean Portal |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria and [[Archaea]] are the primary producers in these ecosystems and support a diverse array of life. About 350 species of organism, dominated by [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[crustacean]]s, had been discovered around hydrothermal vents by the end of the twentieth century, most of them being new to science and [[Endemism|endemic]] to these habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Desbruyères, Daniel |author2=Segonzac, Michel|title=Handbook of Deep-sea Hydrothermal Vent Fauna |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZbLHpstfrwC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1997 |publisher=Editions Quae |isbn=978-2-905434-78-4| page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides providing locomotion opportunities for winged animals and a conduit for the dispersal of [[pollen]] grains, [[spore]]s and [[seed]]s, the [[atmosphere]] can be considered to be a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial community may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. [[Aerobiology]] has been little studied, but there is evidence of [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen fixation]] in [[cloud]]s, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Womack, Ann M. |author2=Bohannan, Brendan J.M. |author3=Green, Jessica L. |year=2010 |title=Biodiversity and biogeography of the atmosphere |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=365 | issue = 1558  |pages=3645–3653 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0283 |pmc=2982008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat change==
{{see also|Habitat conservation}}
[[File:Mt st helens Johnston ridge 25 years later.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty five years after the devastating eruption at [[Mount St. Helens]], United States, [[pioneer species]] have moved in.]]
Whether from natural processes or the activities of man, landscapes and their associated habitats change over time. There are the slow [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] changes associated with the geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and the more rapid changes associated with earthquakes, landslides, storms, flooding, wildfires, coastal erosion, deforestation and changes in land use.&lt;ref name=Lindenmayer&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lindenmayer, David B. |author2=Fischer, Joern |title=Habitat Fragmentation and Landscape Change: An Ecological and Conservation Synthesis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpMKTIoJixMC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2013 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-59726-606-2|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then there are the changes in habitats brought on by alterations in farming practices, tourism, pollution, [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] and climate change.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miller, G. Tyler |author2=Spoolman, Scott |title=Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gC9Dy1YWfkC&amp;pg=PA193 |year=2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-55671-8 |pages=193–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to any species. If an island on which an endemic organism lives becomes uninhabitable for some reason, the species will become [[Extinction|extinct]]. Any type of habitat surrounded by a different habitat is in a similar situation to an island. If a forest is divided into parts by logging, with strips of cleared land separating woodland blocks, and the distances between the remaining fragments exceeds the distance an individual animal is able to travel, that species becomes especially vulnerable. Small populations generally lack genetic diversity and may be threatened by increased predation, increased competition, disease and unexpected catastrophe.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; At the edge of each forest fragment, increased light encourages secondary growth of fast-growing species and old growth trees are more vulnerable to logging as access is improved. The birds that nest in their crevices, the [[epiphyte]]s that hang from their branches and the invertebrates in the leaf litter are all adversely affected and biodiversity is reduced.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Habitat fragmentation can be ameliorated to some extent by the provision of [[wildlife corridor]]s connecting the fragments. These can be a river, ditch, strip of trees, hedgerow or even an underpass to a highway. Without the corridors, seeds cannot disperse and animals, especially small ones, cannot travel through the hostile territory, putting populations at greater risk of [[local extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holland, Matthew D. |author2=Hastings, Alan |year=2008 |title=Strong effect of dispersal network structure on ecological dynamics |journal=Nature |volume=456 |pages=792–794 |doi=10.1038/nature07395 |bibcode=2008Natur.456..792H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat disturbance can have long-lasting effects on the environment. ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'' is a vigorous grass from Europe which has been introduced to the United States where it has become invasive. It is highly adapted to fire, producing large amounts of flammable detritus and increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires. In areas where it has become established, it has altered the local fire regimen to such an extant that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing it to become even more dominant.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |last2=D'Antonio |first2=C.M. |last3=Richardson |first3=D.M. |last4=Grace |first4=J.B. |last5=Keeley |first5=J.E. |last6=DiTomaso |first6=J.M. |last7=Hobbs |first7=R.J. |last8=Pellant |first8=M. |last9=Pyke |first9=D. |year=2004 |title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire |journal=BioScience |issue=7 |pages=677–688 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:EOIAPO]2.0.CO;2 |volume=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A marine example is when [[sea urchin]] populations "[[Population ecology|explode]]" in coastal waters and destroy all the [[Seaweed|macroalgae]] present. What was previously a [[kelp forest]] becomes an [[urchin barren]] that may last for years and this can have a profound effect on the [[food chain]]. Removal of the sea urchins, by disease for example, can result in the seaweed returning, with an over-abundance of fast-growing kelp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence, John M. |title=Sea Urchins: Biology and Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B322HrCUvNEC&amp;pg=PA196 |year=2013|publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-397213-2 |pages=196–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat protection==
The protection of habitats is a necessary step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may take the form of the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the protection of habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.&lt;ref name=Klemm&gt;{{cite book|author=de Klemm, Cyrille |title=Comparative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Legislation for the Protection of Wild Flora in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oadPwh_8wqMC&amp;pg=PA65 |year=1997 |publisher=Council of Europe |isbn=978-92-871-3429-5 |pages=65–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International treaties may be necessary for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the [[Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals]], protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection in more than one country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.int/ |title=Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals |publisher=UNEP/CMS Secretariat |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the protection of habitats needs to take into account the needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the [[San Quintin kangaroo rat]], and even kill the animal as a pest.&lt;ref name=endangered&gt;{{cite book|title=Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YYqd4ROFfkC&amp;pg=PA750 |year=2001 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7200-1 |page=750}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of [[ecotourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Honey | first = Martha | year = 2008 | title = Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Who Owns Paradise? | publisher = Island Press | isbn =  1-59726-125-4 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monotypic habitat==
A monotypic habitat is one in which a single species of animal or plant is so dominant as to virtually exclude all other species. An example would be sugarcane; this is planted, burnt and harvested, with herbicides killing weeds and pesticides controlling invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rio Guanajibo River Basin Flood Protection Project, Mayaguez, Hormigueros, San German: Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jk0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA94-IA29 |year=1994 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monotypic habitat occurs in botanical and zoological contexts, and is a component of [[conservation biology]]. In [[restoration ecology]] of native plant communities or habitats, some [[invasive species]] create monotypic stands that replace and/or prevent other species, especially indigenous ones, from growing there. A dominant [[Colonisation (biology)|colonization]] can occur from retardant chemicals exuded, nutrient monopolization, or from lack of natural controls such as [[herbivore]]s or climate, that keep them in balance with their native habitats. The [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle, ''Centaurea solstitialis'']], is a botanical monotypic-habitat example of this, currently dominating over {{convert|15000000|acre|km2}} in California alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/images/none/nc4.JPG |title=1970 distribution of yellow starthistle in the U.S. |publisher=[[University of California, Davis|UCD]] |work=Yellow Starthistle Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231024708/http://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/images/none/nc4.JPG |archivedate=2006-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-native freshwater [[Zebra mussel|zebra mussel, ''Dreissena polymorpha'']], that colonizes areas of the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Mississippi River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]], is a zoological monotypic-habitat example; the predators that control it in its home-range in Russia are absent and it proliferates abundantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Threats-to-Wildlife/Invasive-Species/Invasive-Mussels.aspx |title=Invasive Mussels |publisher=National Wildlife Federation |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though its name may seem to imply simplicity as compared with [[Wiktionary:polytypic|polytypic]] habitats, the monotypic habitat can be complex. Aquatic habitats, such as exotic ''[[Hydrilla]]'' beds, support a similarly rich fauna of macroinvertebrates to a more varied habitat, but the creatures present may differ between the two, affecting small fish and other animals higher up the [[food chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Theel, Heather J. |author2=Dibble, Eric D. |author3=Madsen, John D. |year=2008 |title=Differential influence of a monotypic and diverse native aquatic plant bed on a macroinvertebrate assemblage; an experimental implication of exotic plant induced habitat |journal=Hydrobiologia |volume=600 |pages=77–87 |doi=10.1007/s10750-007-9177-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hovenring''' is a suspended [[bicycle path|cycle path]] [[roundabout]] in the province of [[North Brabant]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/167810712/Fietsrotonde+Hovenring+Eindhoven+afgesloten+kabels+op+knappen+-+fotos+en+video.aspx |title=Fietsrotonde Hovenring Eindhoven afgesloten: kabels op knappen |author=Jan de Vries |date=11 January 2012 |work=Omroep Brabant |publisher=[[Omroep Brabant]] |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in between the localities of [[Eindhoven]], [[Veldhoven]], and [[Meerhoven]], which account for its name.

The Hovenring was first conceived of in 2008, when increased traffic between Eindhoven and Veldhoven was starting to overwhelm the capacity of the [[roundabout]] on the crossing of the roads known as ''Heerbaan'' in Veldhoven and the ''Meerenakkerweg'' (''Heistraat'').&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectenweb.nl/aweb/redactie/redactie_detail.asp?iNID=13468 |title=Eindhoven krijgt markante fietsbrug |date= 1 April 2008 |publisher=Architectenweb |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/verkeer-vervoer/de-hovenring-3/De-Hovenring-verbetert-infrastructuur.htm |title=De Hovenring verbetert infrastructuur |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Municipality of Eindhoven |accessdate=17 July 2012 |language=nl }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to improve the flow of traffic and improve safety, it was decided to completely separate motorized and bicycle traffic.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb0"/&gt; In addition, it was decided to transform the roundabout for cars into a regular crossing of streets, to improve the flow of traffic.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv0"/&gt; This left a decision to be made about what to do about the bicycle traffic. The city council of Eindhoven decided that they wanted to develop an eye-catching project, in keeping with ambitions of the ''Brainport'' top technology region (a [[knowledge economy]]-driven cooperative of the [[municipality|municipalities]] in the Eindhoven metropolitan area).&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv0"/&gt;

The design for the Hovenring was made by the ''ipv Delft'' [[design|design agency]].&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb0"/&gt; The name was chosen through a competition held among the population of Eindhoven and Veldhoven. Literally the name means "ring of the Hovens", referring to Eindhoven, Veldhoven and Meerhoven (the [[residential area]] where the Hovenring is). In addition, the name refers to the suspended ring of the Hovenring, as well as to the ring and needle (the central pylon) of lights that are formed by the lights that adorn the construction.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/verkeer-vervoer/de-hovenring-3/Het-ontstaan-van-de-naam-de-Hovenring.htm |title=Het ontstaan van de naam de Hovenring |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Municipality of Eindhoven |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of the lights, the name also refers to Eindhoven's unofficial designation of "city of lights".&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bike-infrastructure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/bike-the-netherlands/|title=Bike The Netherlands|accessdate=2012-10-15|author=John Tarantino |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |publisher=The Environmental Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction started on 11 February 2011. The new crossing was opened on 30 December 2011.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectenweb.nl/aweb/redactie/redactie_detail.asp?iNID=25406 |title=Start bouw tuibrug Eindhoven van ipv Delft
 |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Architectenweb |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a week later, the crossing was again closed for all traffic, because the suspension cables were found to vibrate in a manner that was considered harmful. The Hovenring was finally opened to the public on 29 June 2012.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/176811762/Hovenring+tussen+Eindhoven+en+Veldhoven+officieel+geopend.aspx |title=Hovenring tussen Eindhoven en Veldhoven officieel geopend

==Construction==

===Design===
The Hovenring is officially a roundabout, but in fact it is a [[circle|circular]] [[cable-stayed bridge]]&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_tw0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technischweekblad.nl/zwevende-fietsrotonde-in-eindhoven.275611.lynkx |title='Zwevende' fietsrotonde in Eindhoven |date=13 July 2012 |publisher=Technish Weekblad |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the {{convert|72|m}} diameter deck suspended from a single {{convert|70|m}} tall central pylon by 24 cables.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/18995/fietsbrug-hovenring-eindhoven-gaat-weer-open.html |title=Fietsbrug Hovenring Eindhoven gaat weer open |date=27 June 2012 |publisher=De Ingenieur |accessdate=17 July 2012 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806011225/http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/18995/fietsbrug-hovenring-eindhoven-gaat-weer-open.html |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire construction is made of steel.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_tw0"/&gt;

===Vibration issues===
The suspension bridge had to be closed almost immediately after delivery due to unexpected vibrations in the cables caused by the wind.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_tw0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/17926/tuien-fietsbrug-eindhoven-onderzocht.html |title=Tuien fietsbrug Eindhoven onderzocht |date=30 January 2012 |publisher=De Ingenieur |accessdate=17 July 2012 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117114055/http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/17926/tuien-fietsbrug-eindhoven-onderzocht.html |archivedate=17 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation of the problem was undertaken during the next several weeks by professors of [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], the [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[professor]] [[Albert Zasso]] of the [[Politecnico di Milano]].&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing1"/&gt;

It was finally determined that the problem was [[vortex|vortices]] of wind forming in the lee of the cables, causing far heavier [[vibration]]s than expected during design. A solution was found by applying additional [[Shock absorber|damper]]s on the cables. Unfortunately this caused an extra delay of a month in the opening of the bridge, since the [[General contractor|contractor]] initially mounted the dampers incorrectly.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing0"/&gt;

==Comparison==
[[File:View2FromPearlTower.jpg|thumb|Circular Pedestrian Bridge in Lujiazui, China]]
An important predecessor to the Dutch design is the cycle [[overpass]] roundabout of [[Tjensvollkrysset]] in [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]]. Opened in 2010, it bears remarkable resemblance to the Hovenring, sharing for instance its 72m diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/spectacular-new-floating-cycle-roundabout/ |title=Spectacular New Floating Cycle Roundabout &amp;#124; Bicycle Dutch |last=Wagenbuur |first=Mark |date=23 August 2012 |website=http://bicycledutch.wordpress.com |publisher=BICYCLE DUTCH |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction is out of concrete rather than steel, and support is more conventional. Considering the Eindhoven ring was designed from 2008 onwards, the designs may very well have been conceived independently of each other.

A comparison must also be made with the 2011 circular pedestrian overpass of [[Lujiazui]] in the [[Pudong]] district of [[Shanghai]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciprianicharlesdesigns.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/elevating-the-concept-of-roundabouts/ Elevating the concept of Roundabouts &amp;#124; Cipriani Charles Designs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/12/circular-pedestrian-bridge-in-lujiazui.html Circular Pedestrian Bridge in Lujiazui, China &amp;#124; Amusing Planet]&lt;/ref&gt; and with a similar overpass from 2012 in [[Rzeszów]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inzynierbudownictwa.pl/biznes,inwestycje,artykul,pierwsza_w_polsce_okragla_kladka_dla_pieszych_otwarta,6068&lt;/ref&gt;

|discuss=Talk:Cross-cultural_communication#Merger_proposal|date=September 2018}}

'''Intercultural communication''' (or [[cross-cultural communication|'''cross-cultural communication''']]) is a discipline that studies [[communication]] across different [[culture]]s and [[social group]]s, or how culture affects communication. It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and [[perception|perceive]] the world around them. Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauring|first=Jakob|title=Intercultural Organizational Communication: The Social Organizing of Interaction in International Encounters|journal=Journal of Business and Communication|year=2011|volume=48 |issue=3|pages=231–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds ''interact''. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. Intercultural communication plays a role in [[social science]]s such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[communication studies]]. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | title=3 Tips For Effective Global Communication | date=April 9, 2010 | author=Drary, Tom | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232213/http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | archivedate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/intercultural-communication// |title=Intercultural Communication Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity, within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.

The study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. “Intercultural Communication in a Globalized World.” In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A. Samovar, Richard E. Porter, and Edwin R. McDaniel, 13 edition, 45-53. Boston, Mass: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intercultural communication'' is in a way the 'interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities'.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, Gribkova &amp; Starkey, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of interest ==

=== Cross-cultural business communication ===
Cross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content.  The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.

====Management====
Important points to consider:

* Develop cultural sensitivity
* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.
* Careful encoding
* Use words, pictures, and gestures.
* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.
* Selective transmission 
* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.
* Careful decoding of feedback
* Get feedback from multiple parties.
* Improve listening and observation skills.
* Follow-up actions

====Facilitation====
There is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment—including the ability to communicate within that environment.

Two key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extrovertedness, and open-mindedness. Resilience includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.

These factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of preparedness for change, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.

=== Cultural&amp;nbsp;perceptions ===
There are common conceptualizations of attributes that define [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] and [[Individualism|individualistic]] cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.&lt;ref&gt;Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. “Rethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.” Communication Theory 14 (1):78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.

The Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and also what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.[https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/field_download/page/Difficult%20Dialogues%20Learning%20Activity%20-%20Kathryn%20Sorrells.pdf]

== Problems ==
The problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.

Nonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13"&gt;Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13" /&gt;

Effective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.

==Theories==
The following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaption, on [[identity negotiation]] and management, on [[communication network]]s,on [[acculturation]] and [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gudykunst 2003 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social engineering effective outcomes ===
*Cultural convergence
**In a relatively closed social system in which communication among members is unrestricted, the system as a whole will tend to ''converge'' over time toward a state of greater cultural ''uniformity''. The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, D. L. (1988). The convergence theory of intercultural communication. In Y. Y. Kim &amp; W. B. Gudykunst (Eds.), Theories in intercultural communication (pp. 280–298). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. p.289&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Communication accommodation theory]]
**This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances.Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction, and what social consequences result from these adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/9781118540190.wbeic006|chapter=Communication Accommodation Theory|title=The International Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Communication|pages=1–21|year=2015|last1=Dragojevic|first1=Marko|last2=Gasiorek|first2=Jessica|last3=Giles|first3=Howard|isbn=9781118540190|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306556/files/2007_gilesogay_cat.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intercultural adaption
**Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means "the need to conform" to mainstream "objective reality" and "accepted modes of experience".&lt;ref name="Gudykunst, W. 2003"&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed., 378. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Co-cultural communication theory|Co-cultural theory]]
**In its most general form, co-cultural communication refers to interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Co-cultures include but are not limited to people of color, women, people with disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and those in the lower social classes. Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors.

===Identity negotiation or management===
*[[Identity management theory]]
*[[Identity negotiation]]
*Cultural identity theory
*[[Double-swing model]]

=== Communication networks ===
*Networks and outgroup communication competence
*[[Intracultural]] versus intercultural networks
*Networks and acculturation

=== Acculturation and adjustment ===
*Communication acculturation
**This theory attempts to portray "cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Y.Y.(1995), p.192&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety/Uncertainty management
**When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts' behaviors.
*[[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]], [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]] states
**Assimilation and adaption are not permanent outcomes of the adaption process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. "Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication."&lt;ref&gt;Mc.Guire and Mc.Dermott, 1988, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assimilation
** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pauls|first1=Elizabeth|title=Assimilation|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/assimilation-society|website=www.britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alienation
** Alienation  frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says: " alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giffin|first1=Kim|title=Social alienation by communicaton denial|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=56|issue=4|pages=347–357|doi=10.1080/00335637009383022|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
* [[Meaning of meanings theory]] – "A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent. A common past reduces misunderstanding. Definition, metaphor, feedforward, and Basic English are partial linguistic remedies for a lack of shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Face negotiation theory]] – "Members of collectivistic, high-context cultures have concerns for mutual face and inclusion that lead them to manage conflict with another person by avoiding, obliging, or compromising. Because of concerns for self-face and autonomy, people from individualistic, low-context cultures manage conflict by dominating or through problem solving"&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Standpoint theory]] – An individual's experiences, knowledge, and communication behaviors are shaped in large part by the social groups to which they belong. Individuals sometimes view things similarly, but other times have very different views in which they see the world. The ways in which they view the world are shaped by the experiences they have and through the social group they identify themselves to be a part of.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social group]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, P. H. (1990). Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment. Boston: Unwin Hyman.&lt;/ref&gt; "Feminist standpoint theory claims that the social groups to which we belong shape what we know and how we communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2005 {{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is derived from the Marxist position that economically oppressed classes can access knowledge unavailable to the socially privileged and can generate distinctive accounts, particularly knowledge about social relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B00DG8M7EU | title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice | publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc | year=2013 | isbn=978-1412927444 | edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stranger theory]] – At least one of the persons in an intercultural encounter is a stranger.  Strangers are a 'hyperaware' of cultural differences and tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions.
* [[Feminist genre theory]] – Evaluates communication by identifying feminist speakers and reframing their speaking qualities as models for women's liberation.
* [[Genderlect theory]] – "Male-female conversation is cross-cultural communication. Masculine and feminine styles of discourse are best viewed as two distinct cultural dialects rather than as inferior or superior ways of speaking. Men's report talk focuses on status and independence. Women's support talk seeks human connection."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cultural critical studies theory]] – The theory states that the mass media impose the dominant ideology on the rest of society, and the connotations of words and images are fragments of ideology that perform an unwitting service for the ruling elite.
* [[Marxism]] – aims to explain class struggle and the basis of social relations through economics.

==History of assimilation==
* Forced assimilation was very common in the European colonial empires the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. 
Voluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"/&gt;

== Intercultural competence ==

Intercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt; Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Facts and Figures| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Appropriateness:''' Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.
*'''Effectiveness:''' Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.

'''Competent communication''' is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"&gt;(Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

Intercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

Ethnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.

People must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.
* Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.
* Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.
* Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

=== Basic tools for improvement ===

The following are ways to improve communication competence:
* Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person.
* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves  and their perception of the world.
* Empathy:  Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others
* Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.
* Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation.
* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.
* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;
* Patience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geldart|first1=Phil|title=Excellent Communication Requires Patience|url=https://www.eaglesflight.com/blog/bid/153152/Excellent-Communication-Requires-Patience|website=eaglesflight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Active listening&lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Importance of Communication Skills at Work Place|url=https://www.linguasoftech.com/blog/importance-of-communication-skills-at-work-place/|website=linguasofttech|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clarity  &lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"/&gt;

=== Important factors===

* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.
* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.
* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.
* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture.
* Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"&gt;(Intercultural Communication)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traits ===

* Flexibility.
* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.
* Self-reflection.
* Open-mindedness.
* Sensitivity.
* Adaptability.
* "[[Thinking outside the box]]" and [[lateral thinking]]&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"/&gt;

==Verbal communication==
Verbal communication consist of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.

'''Factors that affect verbal communication:'''

* Tone of voice
* Use of descriptive words
* Emphasis on certain phrases
* Volume of voice

The way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.

Along with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.&lt;ref&gt;Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example of non-verbal cues'''

* Facial expressions
* Hand gestures
* Use of objects
* Body movement

In terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, A. (2007). Verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours [electronic resource] : COST Action 2102 International Workshop, Vietri sul Mare, Italy, March 29–31, 2007 : revised selected and invited papers / Anna Esposito ... [et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, R., &amp; Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonverbal communication ==
Nonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words—though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties.

Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement—e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries.

Occulesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages.

[[Proxemics]] concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.

[[Paralanguage]] refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said—e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.

Object language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts—e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.

Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as [[cultural anthropology]] and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

'''Isodar''' is a theory of habitat selection in [[population biology]] proposed by [[Douglas W. Morris]]. The theory underscores the importance of the abundance and thus competition between the members of the same species in selecting habitats. The name "isodar" stems from "iso" in Latin meaning same and "dar" from Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Morris DW. Habitat-dependent estimates of competitive interaction. Oikos, 55, 111-120&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals displaying an [[ideal free distribution]] distribute themselves among patches (sources of a resource) in such a way that each individual get the same amount of the resource.  For example, if food is twice as abundant in habitat A compared to habitat B, the ideal free distribution-based model would predict that there will accordingly be twice as many animals competing for food in habitat A compared to habitat B.  If the total number of animals is considered to be variable, there are two ways this can be plotted on a two-dimensional Cartesian graph.  One way is to plot two lines on a graph of fitness vs. density of individuals.  This graph can be used to predict the density of individuals at any given level of fitness.  The second is to plot the density of individuals in habitat A vs. the density of individuals in habitat B when the fitness of all individuals is equal.  The line in this second graph is an isodar line.

An isodar, or habitat isodar, is a theory in [[evolutionary ecology]] developed in the late 1980s by Douglas W. Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas|title=Spatial scale and the cost of density-dependent habitat selection.|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|year=1987|volume=1|pages=379–388|doi=10.1007/bf02071560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas|title=Habitat-dependent population regulation and community structure.|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|year=1988|volume=2|pages=253–269|doi=10.1007/bf02214286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Isodars model density-dependent habitat selection for one or two species in two habitats according to the [[Ideal free distribution|ideal free]] and ideal despotic distributions.  Isodar is a two-part word: "iso" meaning equal in Latin; "dar" for Darwinian evolution, and is defined as ''all combinations of population densities in habitats A and B such that both habitats offer the same fitness reward.''

Ideal free isodars predict that a species density in habitat A will increase linearly with its density in habitat B so that each individual in the species has the same fitness.  If habitat A has higher quality resources than habitat B, then proportionately more individuals would be in habitat A then in habitat B.  This can be shown on either a Fitness-Density graph (Figure 1) or a graph of density in two habitats (Figure 2).

&lt;/center&gt;

Isodars can also be used to study density-dependent habitat selection between two species competing for two habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas |author2=D.L.

Isodars have also been used to show the effect of human habitat selection on biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Douglas|author2=S.R.

[[File:Gemeentehuis Tegelen.JPG|thumb|The former town hall of Tegelen]]

'''Ithaka Science Center''', a hands-on science education center in [[Tegelen]] in the [[Netherlands]] was founded in 2008 as a [[non-profit]] organization by Vaggelis E. Fragiadakis and Margriet van Tulder and funded as a [[public-private partnership]]. Its goal: to present interactive [[exhibits]], programs, public lectures, and other events for schools and the general public. 

==Building==
The [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] location at Raadhuislaan 11, in [[Tegelen]], the Netherlands, is a historic building that served as the [[city hall]] for Tegelen. The historic façade and many internal architectural details have been preserved.

==Exhibits==
A major feature of the center is a mixture of permanent and temporary exhibits that demonstrate scientific and technical principles. Exhibits are labeled in Dutch, English and in German, as the center is within 2&amp;nbsp;km of the border with Germany, and was designed to host visitors and schools from both countries. The first series of exhibits dealt with [[energy]], [[light]], and [[gravity]]. The center integrated science exhibits with art displays inspired by scientific themes. The art shown changes periodically.

==Science education==
Before the center moved into the former townhall, Ithaka created [[science education]] programs and conferences, such as energy exhibitions, science clubs, school activities, master classes, and other special events.

For classroom teachers, the Ithaka Science Center has assembled and provides science activity kits which included instruments, materials and instructions for topics including [[electricity]], [[air]], [[mechanics]], [[magnetism]], properties of [[solids]], [[liquids]] and [[gases]].

The center has hosted numerous speakers on science, [[technology]], and science education. Among them have been Nobel Laureates [[George Smoot]], [[Douglas Osheroff]], and [[Eric Maskin]].

The center has online activities for children, and had produced a children's science exploration [[television program]].

Quirarte was born during the [[Great Depression]], in [[Jerome, Arizona|Jerome]], a small mining town in Arizona.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-jacinto-quirarte-13553|title = Oral History Interview with Jacinto Quirarte, 1996 Aug. 15-16|date = 1996|accessdate = 8 April 2015|website = Archives of American Art|publisher = Smithsonian Institution|last = Karlstrom|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Francisco, was originally from a town outside of [[Guadalajara|Guadalajara, Jalisco]]. His mother, Frutosa, was born in Jerome, and her family had come from the same area of Jalisco.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quirarte's family lived in the part of town in Jerome known as El Barrio Mexicano or sometimes El Barrio Chicano.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He didn't learn to speak English until he started school. He enjoyed his studies from an early age and began drawing Arizona landscapes as a young child.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Quirarte moved with his family to [[San Francisco]] at age 16.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They eventually settled into the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] where he attended [[Mission High School (San Francisco, California)|Mission High School]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In high school, he took many challenging courses, especially in critical writing in English.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also played varsity basketball for Mission High School.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even though Quirarte excelled at sports, he felt that art was the direction he wanted to go in for a career.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Quirarte attended [[San Francisco State University]] (SFSU) where he got his BA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During his time there, he studied with artist, [[John Gutmann]], learning art history, photography and life drawing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Between working towards his bachelor's degree and Master's, which he also received from SFSU, Quirarte served in the [[Korean War]] in the [[United States Air Force]] where he was a [[first lieutenant]] and a [[navigator]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was part of a bomber squadron from 1954 to 1957.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1954, Quirarte met his wife, Sara Bel Farmer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3417700151/quirarte-jacinto-1931.html|title = Quirarte, Jacinto 1931-|date = |accessdate = 8 April 2015|website = Enclyclopedia.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was at navigator training in [[Harlingen, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They married within two months of meeting one another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sara had worked as a model in New York and was a student at the University of Texas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quirarte and Sara honeymooned in [[Mexico]] after their marriage in December.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Quirarte went back to SFSU and pursued a masters after leaving the Air Force.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He took art history classes and aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One big reason that Quirarte chose not to become an artist was because he didn't like the dominant art form of the time, [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quirarte felt that he would have had to work in that school of art to be successful and he preferred figurative art.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His Masters thesis was on [[Ancient Maya art|Mayan]] painting and Gutmann was a big help to Quirarte as he worked towards his thesis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After working on his thesis, Quirarte used his [[G.I. Bill|GI Bill]] to pursue a Ph.D. in art history.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quirarte and his wife, Sara, went to Mexico where he attended the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He became "steeped in the artistic traditions of Central and South America" during his time there.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Quirarte became an assistant to [[Alberto Ruz Lhuillier]], a famous archaeologist who studied the Ancient Maya.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quirarte studied under [[Justino Fernández]], an important art historian, during his time in Mexico as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Academic career and authorship==

Quirarte taught at many places before and during his eventual settling into his career at UTSA. He taught at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], Colegio Americano in Mexico City, University of the Americas in Mexico City and [[Yale University]]. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California at Santa Barbara]], [[University of New Mexico|University of New Mexico at Albuquerque]] and the American University of London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Quirarte worked for two years as a cultural affairs representative for the United States Embassy in [[Caracas]], Venezuela.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, he was part of a cultural exchange program which helped bring [[pop art]] to South America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the early 1970s, Quirarte, along with his wife, Sara, interviewed Mexican Artists from around the United States, driving cross-country from [[San Antonio]] to [[New York City|New York]] and then back west to [[California]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He interviewed as many Chicano or Mexican-American artists as he was able to find through networking in order to give a scholarly approach to Chicano art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-mel-casas-5449|title = Oral History Interview with Mel Casas, 1996 Aug. 14 and 16|date = 1996|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Archives of American Art|publisher = Smithsonian Institution|last = Karlstrom|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Quirarte's interest in Chicano art was because of its use of pre-Columbian iconography.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The interviews he took during this trip became the basis of his important book, ''Mexican American Artists''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Most of the interviews were taken in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mexican American Artists|last = Quirarte|first = Jacinto|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 1973|isbn = |location = Austin, Texas|pages = xxv|url = http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/809688/language/en-US/Default.aspx|access-date = 9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was important to many Chicanos and especially Chicano artists because it "gave a reality--a documented reality--to the idea--or concept--of Chicano art."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Quirarte started working for UTSA in 1972 when he was recruited by educator, [[Tomás Rivera]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was one of the founding deans of UTSA and was in charge of what was then called the College of Arts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He lay much of "the groundwork" for modern programs at UTSA.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He retired from UTSA in 1999, but continued teaching until 2008.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Because Quirarte was an expert on pre-Columbian and Latino art, he served on many committees. President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Quirarte to be one of twenty-five people appointed to the American Revolution Bicentennial Advisory Council.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Quirarte served as the chair for the National Task Force on Hispanic Art for the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) from 1982 to 1987.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Quirarte was a founding member and first president of the Association of Latin American Art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Quirarte died in [[Helotes, Texas]] on July 20, 2012.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"This is a roundabout way of saying how important I think education is for Hispanics and everyone else. It provides the necessary insights--analytical tools--which enable all of us to grow personally as well as professionally.

* Physical education teachers are certified
* Students in elementary school have physical education class for a minimum of 150 minutes per week, while students in high school have it for at least 225 minutes per week
* Concrete and achievable standards for students to meet (often for high school graduation)

==Causes==
The causes of lack of physical education vary from country to country.  These include a shortage in facilities and [[Sports equipment|equipment]], a paucity of [[Gym teacher|physical education teachers]], large [[Student–teacher ratio|class sizes]], and budgetary constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some African countries such as [[Botswana]] and [[Malawi]], where children attend school for a minimal amount of time, the budgets allocated for physical education are instead used to concentrate on subjects such as [[language]]s and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A lack of physical education also arises from cultural views: in parts of [[Central America]] (such as the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]) and [[Asia]] (such as [[Pakistan]]), exercise is seen as a form of leisure that should not be featured in an academic [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example exists in [[India]], where girls are often discouraged from engaging in [[sport]]s because such activity is viewed as "unfeminine", as is the possibility of them becoming too muscular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a lack of governmental [[legislation]] and intervention can be to blame. In parts of [[South America]] (with the exception of [[Chile]] and [[Colombia]]), there are no laws that make physical education compulsory: thus, it is omitted from many schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, such as in areas of the [[United States]], the mandated physical education hours are simply not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/education/even-as-schools-battle-obesity-physical-education-is-sidelined.html|title=Even as Obesity Concerns Rise, Physical Education Is Sidelined|last=Baker|first=Al|date=2012-07-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 33 states, students are permitted to be exempt from physical education courses by replacing them with other activities such as marching band practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/2012-shape-of-the-nation-_n_2130115.html|title=Physical Education Programs Stalled By State Loopholes: 2012 Shape Of The Nation Report|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of school, children often fail to engage in physical activity due to lack of [[physical literacy]], inadequate [[Sleep deprivation|sleep]], the increasing attractiveness of rival pastimes such as [[video game]]s, and parents that do not play their part. It is important that parents allow their children the full opportunity to participate in both formal and informal sports and promote healthy physical activity levels. Also, in achievement-oriented populations such as those seen in [[China]], there is an increased emphasis on [[Test (assessment)|academic results]] which also detracts from physical activity time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/05/30/lack_of_physical_education_weighs_heavily_on_many/ |title=Lack of physical education weighs heavily on many |publisher=The Boston Globe |author=Lisa Wangsness |author2= April Simpson |date=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterioration of physical education in schools combined with the elimination of playgrounds and other play facilities forces children to stay inactive and inside for most of the school day which can have serious long-term consequences.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiler|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Is the Lack of Physical Activity Strategy for Children Complicit Mass Child Neglect?|url=|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
[[File:Medical complications of obesity.png|thumb|Physical consequences of obesity]]
An increase in [[sedentary lifestyle]] due to a lack of physical education at home and at school has many physical and psychological consequences on a child in the short and long term.

=== Physical ===
According to a Portuguese study, children with sedentary lifestyles have nine times poorer [[motor coordination]] than active children of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Luís|last2=Santos|first2=Rute|last3=Pereira|first3=Beatriz|last4=Lopes|first4=Vítor Pires|date=2012-11-01|title=Associations between sedentary behavior and motor coordination in children|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22310/abstract|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=746–752|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22310|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have worsened [[bone density]], [[Physical strength|strength]], and [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, they are more likely to use [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[drug]]s than their active peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Health Canada and the Public health Agency of|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedentary behaviour is strongly associated with [[obesity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2011001/article/11397-eng.htm|title=Physical activity of Canadian children and youth: Accelerometer results from the 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this imparts a great health risk. Obese children are more likely to have [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], high [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[sleep apnea]], [[menstrual cycle]] abnormalities, [[bone]] and [[joint]] problems, increased [[cancer]] risk, and reduced balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/surgery/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery/adolescent-weight-loss/Pages/health-risks.aspx|title=Health Risks of Childhood Obesity - Bariatric and Metabolic Institute {{!}} UC San Diego Health|website=UC Health - UC San Diego|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also more likely to be obese adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood physical inactivity has been correlated to cholesterol and fatty streaks in the aorta in the first decade of life and moves to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body in the second and third decade of life, causing health issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A lack of physical activity is one of the main causes for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other physical health issues among children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guedes|first=Claudia|date=2007|title=Physical Education and Physical Activity: A Historical Perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|volume=78|pages=31-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a direct correlation between active participation in physical activity and the health of school age children, therefore a lack of physical education would cause a lack in physical activity in children, leading to worse health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Psychological ===
As exercise is known to improve well-being and reduce [[Stress (biology)|stress]], physical inactivity is correlated with poor psychological health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Donna L|year=1996|title=Cut-backs to physical education consulting services: consequences and concerns.|url=|journal=CAHPER Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as an increase of major [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win|first=Sithu|last2=Parakh|first2=Kapil|last3=Eze-Nliam|first3=Chete M.|last4=Gottdiener|first4=John S.|last5=Kop|first5=Willem J.|last6=Ziegelstein|first6=Roy C.|date=2011-03-15|title=Depressive symptoms, physical inactivity and risk of cardiovascular mortality in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study|url=http://heart.bmj.com/content/97/6/500|journal=Heart|language=en|volume=97|issue=6|pages=500–505|doi=10.1136/hrt.2010.209767|issn=1468-201X|pmc=3044493|pmid=21339320}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a link between obesity and psychiatric illness and the two feed on each other in a vicious cycle.

A lack of physical activity is associated with poorer [[Concentration (psychology)|concentration]] and [[Academic achievement|academic performance]], particularly in [[mathematics]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201501/|title=Physical Activity, Fitness, and Physical Education: Effects on Academic Performance|last=Harold W.

Obesity induced from lack of exercise also contributes to a decrease in general mental health. Overweight children and teens are more likely to suffer from poor [[self-esteem]], negative [[body image]], [[teasing]], and [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher levels of sedentary and lower levels of physical education are linked to worse mental health and lower cognitive function among children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== In Canada ==

=== Current trends ===
The majority of Canadian children aged 5 to 17 years old (91%) do not meet the daily physical activity recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Canadian physical education programs are improving significantly, with 61-80% of schools offering a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education classes per week in 2016, and participation levels in [[organized sport]] are on the rise, Canadian school programs are ineffective in encouraging healthy habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, most Canadian children (56%) lack physical literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they face many issues related to lifestyle. These include sedentary behaviours such as increased screen time averaging 176 minutes a day from TVs and video games to the detriment of active play. There is also the inevitable decrease in [[Human-powered transport|active transportation]], more [[sleep deprivation]], and a poor quality of [[Dieting|diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These lifestyle trends have caused youth obesity rates to nearly triple over the past 30 years. In 2013, this consisted of 28% of Canadian children ages 5–19 that were classified as [[overweight]] or [[Obesity|obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|access-date=2016-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

==== Recommendations and Regulations ====
The Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (CAHPERD) has recommended that Canadian schools and [[Board of education|school boards]] take action through specific academic initiatives to ensuring that their physical education [[curriculum]] is effective at encouraging and instilling healthy exercise habits in young Canadians. CAHPERD has suggested that schools focus on checking the quality (adequate facilities, budget and research-verified techniques) and quantity (minimum 30 minutes a day) of a school's physical education courses as well as the professional qualifications of the educators. The consultants should check that classes meet the needs of all students irrespective of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sex]], [[gender]], and [[Agility|ability level]]. The courses should also encourage participation and [[skill]] development, with a healthy balance of [[Competitiveness|competitive]] and noncompetitive activities. Moreover, it is of utmost importance that [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] and [[physical education]] be encouraged by the [[teacher]]: they should never be used to [[Punishment|punish]] a student (such as what is seen through the common practice of making children run if they misbehave). Outside of class hours, CAHPERD recommends that schools provide opportunities for [[Intramural sports|intramural]] activities and involve [[parent]]s in the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phecanada.ca/advocacy/advocacy-tools/making-case-physical-education-canada-presentation-kit-leaders|title=Making the Case for Physical Education in Canada: A Presentation Kit for Leaders {{!}} PHE Canada|date=2010-07-23|website=www.phecanada.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pan-Canadian Public Health Network first decided to prioritize the issue of childhood obesity in September 2010 by creating the framework ''Curbing Childhood Obesity: An overview of the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights.'' In this project, federal, provincial and territorial Ministers of Health agreed to focus on three goals: increasing the predominance of [[Nutrition|nutritious]] food choices, addressing obesity at an early age, and creating better spaces for children that favour physical activity and [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]]. This has allowed the [[action plan]] ''Towards a Healthier Canada'' to be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hp-ps/hl-mvs/framework-cadre/intro-eng.php|title=Curbing Childhood Obesity: An Overview of the FPT Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights - Public Health Agency of Canada|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Public Health Agency of|website=www.phac-aspc.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Physical Activity guidelines for children ages 5 to 17 consist of at least 1 hour of daily physical activity. Their exercise should range in intensity from [[Moderate exercise|moderate]] (inducing light [[perspiration]] and harder [[breathing]]) to vigorous (inducing heavy perspiration and heavy breathing). Examples of moderate exercise include [[Bicycle|bike]] riding and [[playground]] activities, and examples of vigorous exercise include [[running]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming.]] It is recommended that they engage in both vigorous activities and activities strengthening bone and muscles at least three times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology also recommends that children ages 5 to 17 limit their sedentary activities, such as [[television]] and video games, [[Transport|sedentary transport]], and extensive [[sitting]]. It is advised that children limit their recreational screen time to a maximum of 120 minutes a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Childhood Obesity]] Foundation'', a Canadian initiative, has invented the 5-2-1-0 [[mnemonic]] to remember the national lifestyle recommendations. This consists of 5 [[Serving size|servings]] or more of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]] per day, no more than 2 hours of screen time a day, 1 hour of [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] or more per day, and 0 [[sugary drink]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of ''Towards a Healthier Canada'', many initiatives have been launched to meet the three goals, and they vary from [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] to province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phn-rsp.ca/thcpr-vcpsre-2015/index-eng.php|title=Towards a Healthier Canada : Compilation of Initiatives|last=|first=|date=|website=towardsahealthiercanada.ca|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are projects made in the name of a framework or jurisdictional approach/governmental department that are either targeted at schools, at a community, or in partnership with other organizations or companies.

== In the United States ==

=== Current Trends ===
Nearly 10 million [[Child|children]] and [[Adolescence|adolescents]] in the United States ages 6–19 are considered [[overweight]] because the lack of physical education in schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Physical Education in Schools|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children aged 6–11 have also more than doubled in rate of [[obesity]] over the last twenty years. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Leslie Haub|title=Childhood obesity and the lack of physical education programs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGNXNAAACAAJ|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual states have set requirements for physical education in their schools, but how physical education is conducted across the country has not been established. Yet, physical education has been a common practice of the K-12 education curriculum in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Thomas|date=2017|title=Studies of Physical Education in the United States Using SOFIT: A Review|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=88|pages=492-502|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No Child Left Behind Act has created an environment in which physical education, art and music have been left behind, viewed as "nonessential" courses. Federal funding is more dependent on schools enhancing their math and reading programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sallis|first=James|date=2012|title=Physical Education's Role in Public Health|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=83|pages=125-135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
One program the United States has adopted to decrease obesity are before-school exercise programs with elementary aged children. One in particular consists of reaching 100 miles before the end of the school year. Each milestone of 25 miles the child will earn a check mark on a tee-shirt. They will then be rewarded at 100 miles with a trophy and an announcement over the school loudspeaker. Walking is supervised by teachers and done around school grounds or inside the school. This is a great way for a child to improve health, concentration, confidence and happiness.

Throughout the past two decades, federal support for physical education in the public health sector has increased dramatically. Since 1992, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has funded state education agencies to get them to partner with state health departments to promote physical activity and healthy eating in schools among young people. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In February 2010, first lady Michelle Obama started the "Let's Move" initiative to address the childhood obesity epidemic. Efforts to engage in schools to fight against childhood obesity were taken within 1 year of establishing the program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Budget cuts in the United States have led to less funding and support for physical education because it is not a "core" subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== In China ==

=== Current Trends ===
Even though obesity has increased among most of the population in China, the burden of obesity has shifted onto the lower educated population, likely due to a lack of physical education or health education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huijun|date=2013|title=Program and Policy Options for Preventing Obesity in China|url=|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=14|pages=134-140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students in China are beginning to gain equal opportunities to physical education and sports to further improve their physical health and strength.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Chiung-Tzu Lucetta|date=2017|title=The History of Sports and Physical Education in China|url=|journal=World Leisure Journal|volume=59|pages=326-337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport and physical education in China is extremely influenced by Confucianism which emphasizes collectivism. The values it holds emphasizes self-sacrifice and subordination of one's interests to those of others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
In 2011, The Chinese Ministry of Education has developed standards for physical education in schools. These emphasize enhancing children's health development is the primary goal of physical education in schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ding|first=Haiyong|date=2014|title=A Review of Scholarly and Research Work in Physical Education in China During the First Decade of the 21st Century|url=|journal=Quest|volume=66|pages=117-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards include: 

* "Standard 1: Physical activity participation—Students participate in physical activities and are able to enjoy exercise and experience success."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 2: Mastery of knowledge, skill, and safe exercise methods—Students learn knowledge about exercise, perform physical skills, understand safe exercise principles, and learn self-defense."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The General Administration of Sport in China has been one of the leading government agencies that promotes the development of physical education and physical health in the elementary and college levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The government has for the most part supported physical education and sport in school, but has often abused it as a political tool which leads to ignoring its importance and the needs of individual students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In European (EU) Countries ==

=== Current Trends ===
In the EU, physical education is a mandatory subject in general education. The time dedicated to physical education varies greatly from country to country.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2016|title=Physical Education in EU Schools|url=|journal=Briefing European Parliamentary Research Service|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About half of EU countries devote 10% of their school curriculum to physical education. Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia devote 15%, while Ireland only 4%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matejek|first=Črtomir|date=2014|title=Physical Education in Primary Education in EU Countries|url=|journal=Revija za Elementarno Izobraževanje|volume=7|pages=57-165|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all EU countries, France devotes the most time to physical education in elementary school, a total of 108 hours, which is only 10% of the total teaching time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The primary education designers in European countries view physical education as less important than other subjects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Physical inactivity is responsible for over 500,000 deaths per year in the European Union and accounts for economic costs of over €80 billion per year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Funding for physical education in EU schools is poor, which has led to poor quality physical education. This lack of funding is reflected in poor quality and lack of equipment at EU schools in respectively 26% and 38% of EU countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
In 2007, the European Parliament's Resolution on the Role of Sport in Education helped parliament conclude that physical education is “the only school subject which seeks to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle and focuses on their overall physical and mental development, as well as imparting important social values such as fairness, self-discipline, solidarity, team spirit, tolerance and fair play…” and one of the most important tools for social integration.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardman|first=Ken|date=2008|title=Physical Education in Schools: A Global Perspective|url=|journal=University of Worcester, UK|volume=1|pages=5-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Parliament's Resolution places physical education on the European political agenda, highlighting its importance.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The European Physical Education Association recommends daily physical education in elementary grades up to 11 or 12 years of age and 3 hours per week in post-elementary and high school grades.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Legal cultures''' are described as being temporary outcomes of interactions and occur pursuant to a challenge and response [[paradigm]]. Analyses of core legal paradigms shape the characteristics of individual and distinctive legal cultures.
“Comparative legal cultures are examined by a field of scholarship, which is situated at the line bordering [[comparative law]] and historical [[jurisprudence]].” &lt;ref&gt;Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) p. xix.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal cultures can be examined by reference to fundamentally different legal systems. However, such cultures can also be differentiated between systems with a shared history and basis which are now otherwise influenced by factors that encourage cultural change. Students learn about legal culture in order to better understand how the law works in society. This can be seen as the study of Law and Society. These studies are available at schools such as Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.

== Western legal culture vs non-Western legal culture ==
[[Western legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law’ The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyze non-western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group’s culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level.

Traditional law in Africa is based on natural justice and lacks abstract concepts. This is characteristic of cultures that have an absence of written language which is necessary to elaborate concepts into theory.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"&gt;Max Gluckman (1964) ‘Natural Justice in Africa’ Natural Law Forum vol: 9 (pp. 25-44) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrines of traditional [[African law]] are based on social considerations whereby parties to disputes seek not declarations of right or wrong but rather they seek restitution of social relationships.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The trier of fact and law adjudicates between closely related people from communities as opposed to strangers in commerce. Judgments stress the importance of living together in generous, loving kindness, mutual helpfulness and reciprocity. Evidence suggests that ‘African law demonstrates that all men, because they live in society, have some theory of rules of justice which they believe arise from reason itself; [and Gluckman’s evidence] suggests that Africans may well have formulated, in embryonic form at least, a theory of natural justice coming from human kindness itself.’ &lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The [[Sharia|Islamic legal system]] exemplifies law as part of a larger culture where the concepts of knowledge, right and human nature play a central role. A case study by [[Lawrence Rosen (anthropologist)|Lawrence Rosen]] explains the anthropological, procedural and [[judicial discretion]] aspects of bringing a case to court in [[Sefrou]], [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"&gt;Lawrence Rosen (1989) The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;  The case study makes explicit those fundamentals in Islamic society that shape Islamic legal culture and differentiate this from western legal cultures.

Rigid procedural rules and strict court room decorum or etiquette which is entrenched in western legal cultures clears the way for a more natural process of dispute resolution.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  In Morocco, close attention is paid to social origins, connections and identity where these concepts influence a [[qadi]]’s (judge) judicial interrogation and discretion.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

While the systems of law found in the western world consist of conceptualisation and implementation that mimic the extrajudicial world only slightly, in the Islamic courts of Morocco, the culture of law being propounded reflects the overall culture of its people.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  This is attributable to the goals of law in Islamic society, which is not to hold state or religious power as supreme or to develop an exacting body of legal doctrine, but to restore relationships and then facilitate the resolution of disputes independently of rigid [[precedent]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

== Western comparisons ==
The traditional focus between [[common law]] culture and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] culture has been highlighted by court room procedure, whereby the former nurtures an [[adversarial]] environment and the latter an [[inquisitorial]] one. Indeed no system of court procedure can ever be purely adversarial or purely inquisitorial.

In fact [[France]], which subscribes to a civil legal system, historically gave the [[judge]] a passive role and left the parties to engage in an accusatorial manner.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Jolowicz ‘Civil Procedure and the Common and Civil Law’ (pp. 55-78) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the common law culture predominately consists of oral arguments where legal representors steer the case in search of [[justice]] and reinforcement of rights.

The use of a [[Jury]] in the common law as a judge of fact is unique when compared to civil law systems. The Jury are triers of fact in both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the [[legal framework]]. In France a judge’s role as trier of law and fact is merely as an administrator without creating binding [[legal principle]]. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and [[paternalistic]].

Common law has a culture of judicial inventiveness and even flexibility. Enunciation of principle is not forever paramount but indeed a continuing flow of cases and statutes add to the ebb and flow of the law, whereby ‘case law represented the modern man’s realisation of his own limitations.’ &lt;ref&gt;A. G. Chloros (1978) ‘Common Law, Civil Law and Socialist Law: Three Leading Systems of the World, Three Kinds of Legal Thought’ The Cambridge Law Review (pp. 11-26) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) at 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences include where a civilian [[lawyer]] speaks in terms of the law of nature while the common lawyer speaks to reason. It follows that the culture of these legal systems has been moulded by perceptions of justice and the means available to attain it.

== Common law comparisons ==
Legal culture can differ between countries despite their conformity to a similar if not identical legal system. Both the [[United States]] and [[England]] possess common law systems of law and yet each country embodies a distinctive legal culture. This has been attributable by contrasting both the institutions within the legal system and characteristics of the profession ([[judge]]s, [[barristers]] and [[solicitors]]).&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard A. Posner|Posner]]&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; during 1996 there was about 15 times more American judges than English judges but only about 10 times more American lawyers than English lawyers. Posner suggests that English judges have more prestige than American judges and a related point is that the ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and [[elitism]] not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the [[judiciary]].

In England, and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, barristers are apt candidates for judicial nomination. The reasons for this stem from the common law systems which have a culture to encourage, harness and capture high quality intellect and experience within a concentrated portion of non-judicial officers of the legal profession known as barristers (which includes and accounts for their subsequent appointments to higher ranking [[queens counsel]] and [[senior counsel]]).

Barristers are engaged upon a solicitor's [[Brief (law)|brief]] instead of direct engagement with the client. This insulation avoids lay persons being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lawyers which is evidently "a big problem in the United States, where incompetent lawyers, and known to be such both by judges and by other lawyers, often wow naïve clients." &lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford) at 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of pursuing [[litigation]] influences the culture of each legal system in terms of what society perceives as the net benefit gained from the court and the profession. To litigate similar cases in England and the United States would cost approximately the same; however English courts are not as generous as their American counterparts in awarding [[damages]], especially [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  Therefore the net expected benefit of litigation being greater in the United States encourages a legal culture that is more litigious in nature than England.

National character is inherent in the legal institutions of the [[courts]] and [[parliament]], their formation and their output in terms of [[legislation]] or [[judgments]]. For example it has been said that many factors have contributed to the litigiousness of the United States, including: the rights afforded to the people, a written [[constitution]], immigrant origins of its population, racial and ethnic heterogeneity and the wealth and spoils of its population.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  To this end [[national character]] and [[history]] influence current legal culture.

== Chinese legal culture ==
The legal culture of [[China]], as well as its social and economic culture, continues to undergo dramatic change since the [[People’s Republic of China]]'s reforms of 1978. Transformation has occurred by legal modernisation whereby a rule of law has been suggested to replace the rule of man. The latter is a characteristic of the traditional rural Chinese society where unwritten rules, personal relationships and trust govern citizens' legal relationships; analogous to [[gemeinschaft]]. In the modern society of China, institutional, customary and legal reform (a rule of law that embodies universal rules uniformly enforced by a centralised and bureaucratic state) is necessary to govern legal relations; analogous to [[gesellschaft]].

Direct [[legal transplant|transplants]] of [[western legal systems]] or culture may not provide an adequate rule of law where the life of ordinary Chinese may be marginalised in favour of legal elite who use legal instruments for self-promotion. Furthermore, implanting western legal norms disregards the local culture and relations; thus potentially destroying significant cultural bonds and relationships in the rural community. The traditional [[rural Chinese]] legal culture which is premised on personal and informal relations faces erosion unless [[legal pluralism]] is promoted.

A top down approach in analysing the legal culture of China suggests that both under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], China is "a country under rule by law, not rule of law."&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence comes from post Mao-China, where law is seen as necessary for institutionalising and generalising ad hoc policies for [[economic reform]] and as maintaining party leadership.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;

Further problems with the Chinese legal culture include a piecemeal approach to law making with an imbalance between [[law and policy]]; denials of private law; neglect towards [[human rights]] and individual liberties; and poor enforcement of laws.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;  According to Chen, the consensus in China among scholars is that the lack of [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] are interdependent concepts whereby "the rule of law is legitimate only if it is the product of democratic government." &lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart) at 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is evident with the China experience is that legal culture is susceptible to change in pursuance to [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] forces. While such a change could be beneficial for portions of the society and [[international relations]], traditional and established cultural methods face extinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21894">Even though [[intimacy]] has been broadly defined in terms of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] and [[sexual desire and intimate relationships|sexual desire]], the '''[[neuroanatomy]] of intimacy''' needs further explanation in order to fully understand their neurological functions in different components within intimate relationships, which are romantic love, lust, attachment, and rejection in love.  Also, known functions of the neuroanatomy involved can be applied to observations seen in people who are experiencing any of the stages in intimacy.  Research analysis of these systems provide insight on the [[biological basis of love|biological basis of intimacy]], but the neurological aspect must be considered as well in areas that require special attention to mitigate issues in intimacy, such as violence against a beloved partner or problems with social bonding.

== Components of intimacy and neuroanatomy==

===Attachment===
[[Pair bonding]], or intense social attachment, normally initiates partner preference in sexual situations and monogamy in many mammalian species.  Monogamous species generally exhibit an exclusive responsibility to each other as well as co-parenting to their offspring.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Larry J|author2=Wang, Zuoxin|title=The neurobiology of pair bonding|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=October 2004|volume=7|issue=10|pages=1048–1054|doi=10.1038/nn1327}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies using monogamous [[prairie vole]]s (''Microtus ochrogaster'') showed that forming a pair bond stimulated the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway.  In this pathway, [[dopamine]] is released from the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) to the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[prefrontal cortex]], which then signals the [[ventral pallidum]] to complete reward processing in the pathway.&lt;ref name="Anatomy and neurochemistry - Young"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Larry J.|last2=Murphy Young|first2= Anne Z.|last3= Hammock|first3= Elizabeth A.D.|title=Anatomy and neurochemistry of the pair bond|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=5 December 2005|volume=493|issue=1|pages=51–57|doi=10.1002/cne.20771|pmid=16255009}}&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:Dopamine Pathways.png|thumb|Dopamine Pathways | The dopamine pathway starts at the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and is routed to the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex for ultimate dopamine release that yields reward and reinforcement.  This helps in feeling pleasure or enjoyment of a certain stimuli and reinforcing that positive feeling when that initial stimuli occurs again.]]
Two important neuropeptides that mediated pair bond formation were [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin|arginine vasopressin (AVP)]].  Even though both males and females have both molecules, oxytocin was shown to be predominantly in females and vasopressin predominantly promoted pair bonding in males.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;  Receptor specificity was shown essential for mating by activating the [[dopamine receptor D2|dopamine D2 receptors]] in the nucleus accumbens in both male and female prairie voles.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;  Other locations that were also activated in the study were gender specific, such as oxytocin receptors (OTR) in the prefrontal cortex and AVP 1a receptors (V1aR) in the ventral pallidum.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;

[[File:Love-triangle.jpg|thumb| The [[Triangular theory of love]] by psychologist [[Robert Sternberg]] to describe the interpersonal aspects of love.]]

===Romantic love===
Romantic love is described as involving an individual who pays closer attention to another individual in special ways, involving attention on traits worthy to pursue.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Helen|author2=Aron, Arthur |author3=Brown, Lucy L. |title=Romantic Love: A Mammalian Brain System for Mate Choice|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=29 December 2006|volume=361|issue=1476|pages=2173–2186|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1938|pmid=17118931|pmc=1764845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), studies have shown that the right ventral tegmental area (VTA) is stimulated when subjects are shown a picture of their beloved.  As part of the reward mechanism, the VTA signals to other parts of the brain, such as the [[caudate nucleus]] to release dopamine for reward.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=Arthur|author2=Fisher, Helen |author3=Mashek, Debra J. |author4=Strong, G. |author5=Li, Haifang |author6= Brown, Lucy L. |title=Reward, Motivation, and Emotion Systems Associated with Early-Stage Intense Romantic Love|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=31 May 2005|volume=94|issue=1|pages=327–337|doi= 10.1152/jn.00838.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Constudoverbrain - 2.png|thumb|Constudoverbrain|Neuroanatomical structures involved in romantic love are closely related to structures that are involved in motivation and emotion.]]
Older studies have generally attributed love to the [[limbic system]] consisting of the [[temporal lobe]]s, [[hypothalamus]], [[amygdala]] as well as the [[hippocampus]].  These functional components of the limbic system are important components of emotional processing, motivation, and memory.&lt;ref name=Amen&gt;{{cite book|last=Amen, M.D.|first=Daniel G.|title=Change Your Brain, Change Your Life|year=1998|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8129-2998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, current research also suggests components, such as the hypothalamus, as playing a role in romantic love because it possesses the penchant for bonding in mammals by secreting the neuropeptides, oxytocin and vasopressin.&lt;ref name=Beauregard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beauregard|first=Mario|author2=Courtemanche, Jerome |author3=Paquette, Vincent |author4= St-Pierre, Evelyne L. |title=The neural basis of unconditional love|journal=Psychiatry Research- Neuroimaging|date=15 May 2009|volume=172|issue=2|pages=93–98|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has implicated [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF), a neurotrophin that is fundamental in the neuron survival and development in the nervous system, in early-stage romantic love in subjects experiencing euphoria and emotional dependency, which is often a characteristic in romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emanuele|first=E|author2=Politi, P |author3=Bianchi, M |author4=Minoretti, P |author5=Bertona, M |author6= Geroldi, D |title=Raised plasma nerve growth factor levels associated with early-stage romantic love|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=April 2006|volume=31|issue=3|pages=288–294|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.09.002|pmid=16289361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lust===
[[Lust]], also known as libido, is defined as pursuing [[sexual gratification]].&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Helen E.|author2=Aron, Arthur |author3=Mashek, Debra |author4=Li, Haifang |author5= Brown, Lucy L. |title=Defining the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction, and Attachment|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2002|volume=31|issue=5|pages=413–419|doi=10.1023/A:1019888024255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is primarily driven by the endocrine system, but the brain is also involved in neural processing.  Specifically, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal]] (HPG) and [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA)  axes play primary roles in the priming for sex as well as the stress response, respectively.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sue Carter|first=C|title=Neuroendocrine Perspectives on Social Attachment and Love |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=November 1998|volume=23|issue=8|pages=779–818|doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Larry|title=The chemistry between us : love, sex, and the science of attraction|year=2012|publisher=Current|location=New York|isbn=1591845130|author2=Alexander, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because intimacy is motivated by the reward system, steroid hormones activate desire to promote partner preference and social attachment in the process of sexual union.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt; Dopamine is then released when an individual is aroused, which associates lust as a product of the dopaminergic reward system.

However, interactions of sex and romantic love do not have the same goal orientation, which helps to confirm the difference in brain activation patterns.  Contrasting with the primary goal of romantic love, copulation can occur without two individuals being in romantic love or having a monogamous bond.  Sometimes, copulation might not even occur in romantic love relationships.  However, it still does play a role in successful reproduction when it is supplemented with romantic love.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006" /&gt;

===Rejection in love===
Rejection in love is considered [[unrequited love|unrequited or unreciprocated love]].&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;   Separation from a loved one can cause grief and sometimes lead to an individual expressing characteristics of depression.  In a study, symptoms seen in nine women who had experienced a recent breakup suggested involvement of certain neuroanatomy.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt; Eating, sleeping, and neuroendocrine regulation was associated with the hypothalamus, [[anhedonia]] was associated with the ventral [[striatum]] and the amygdala was associated with emotional processing in these women.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt;   
[[File:Medial surface of cerebral cortex - gyri.png|thumb|Medial surface of cerebral cortex - gyri| The neuroanatomy of the medial surface of the cerebral cortex are implicated in rejection in love.  Regular functions of many of the anatomical structures connect rejection in love to motivation, emotions, deep thinking, and reward.]]
Other neuroanatomy that registered unrequited love included the [[cerebellum]], [[insular cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt;  All of the areas that were activated showed decreased activity when subjects emotionally reflected about the beloved rejecter.&lt;ref name="Women grieving"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Najib|first=A.|title=Regional Brain Activity in Women Grieving a Romantic Relationship Breakup|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 December 2004|volume=161|issue=12|pages=2245–2256|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2245|pmid=15569896}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In contrast, another study observed significant increase in activation in the VTA as well as the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  Further, those rejected in love had higher stimulation in the right nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen/pallidum compared to subjects who were in romantic love &lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=H. E.|author2=Brown, L. L. |author3=Aron, A. |author4=Strong, G. |author5= Mashek, D. |title=Reward, Addiction, and Emotion Regulation Systems Associated With Rejection in Love|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=5 May 2010|volume=104|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1152/jn.00784.2009 |pmid=20445032}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study ultimately showed that areas that are activated in romantic love are also activated in rejection in love.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;  Results from this study suggest that rejected lovers have same stimulation of brain regions because they are still "in love" with their rejecters.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  Since romantic love follows the dopaminergic reward system, the anticipatory nature of receiving a reward as well as deciding on losses and gains in decision making, allows the neural circuitry to become adaptable.  This allows the rejected to change their behavior through two stages.  The first is the "protest" stage where they try to win back the rejecter.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  The second stage or the "rejection" stage is where they feel resignation and despair, eventually leading to continuing life without the rejecter.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love"/&gt; On the other hand, the involvement of the reward gain/loss pathways intrinsic to survival provides insight on behaviors of stalking, suicide, obsessiveness and depression.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;

==Other neurological implications of intimate brain systems ==

===Mother–child pair bond===
An attachment between a mother and child arises from behavioral changes during birth, which includes lactation.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives" /&gt;  Release of oxytocin is important in the birthing process for the mother–child pair bond to occur in both individuals. Lactation relies on the constant release of oxytocin for the release of milk in the breast, which strengthens the first social bond of the infant and the mother.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives" /&gt;

Although this is considered another type of social attachment that activates the same reward system, maternal attachment activates different regions of the brain compared to those in partner attachment.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  In one study, overlap of activated brain regions with romantic love was found to include the nucleus accumbens, [[putamen]], caudate nucleus, which are important in social attachment.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  However, the only regions that were specific to maternal love were the orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal cortex as well as the occipital and lateral fusiform cortex.&lt;ref name="Bartels Maternal Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartels|first=Andreas|author2=Zeki, Semir|title=The neural correlates of maternal and romantic love|journal=NeuroImage|date=March 2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1155–1166|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.11.003|pmid=15006682}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Moreover, oxytocin is important between the mother and her offspring, so it is suggested that oxytocin deficiency can influence how successfully the offspring is able to form a monogamous pair bond with another individual in the future. This may provide insight on issues with formation of pair bonds as well as psychological problems from an inefficient upbringing.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartels Maternal Love"/&gt;

===Addictiveness===

[[File:PET - Human Addiction.jpg|thumb|PET - Human Addiction| [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans of brains that are normal in comparison to brains of an obese subject, alcoholic subject, and cocaine user.  Love is suggested to simulate patterns of a cocaine user in brain activation.]]
Love activates the same neural circuitry as maladaptive drugs, such as cocaine. Dopaminergic reward pathways are involved to elicit a response of gaining a reward and reinforcement, thereby leading some researchers to believe that love is addictive.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  Love and drugs of abuse stimulate similar levels of dopamine for reward and reinforcement from the VTA.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt; Actions between the two mental states are very similar with those in love experiencing excessive exhilaration, insomnia, anxiety, and loss of appetite also seen in drug users.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beauregard|first=Mario|author2=Courtemanche, Jérôme |author3=Paquette, Vincent |author4= St-Pierre, Évelyne Landry |title=The neural basis of unconditional love|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging|date=May 2009|volume=172|issue=2|pages=93–98|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Larry J.|author2=Lim, Miranda M. |author3=Gingrich, Brenden |author4= Insel, Thomas R. |title=Cellular Mechanisms of Social Attachment|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=September 2001|volume=40|issue=2|pages=133–138|doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, brain activity observed through [[single-photon emission computed tomography| single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)]] showed that dopamine release in the [[basal ganglia]] of a subject who was romantically in love appeared similar to a subject addicted to cocaine.&lt;ref name=Amen /&gt;  Although love is suggested to be addictive based on its neurological circuitry, it cannot be simplified as addictive because it is expressed in different ways across a wide spectrum.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Gender differences in the intimate brain===

====Emotional processing====
The amygdala, a key player in emotional processing, is suggested different between men and women.  In males, emotions are considered to be primarily directed from the right hemisphere; on the other hand, it is primarily directed from the left hemisphere in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Medina|first=John|title=Brain rules : 12 principles for surviving and thriving at work, home, and school|year=2009|publisher=Pear Press|location=Seattle, Wash.|isbn=0979777747|edition=1st Pear Press trade pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FrontalCapts.png|thumb|FrontalCapts|Many of the [[gyrus|gyri]] of the brain are implicated in the emotional processing of valenced words in males and females.]]
One study that tested positively and negatively valenced words on both male and female subjects found that emotional processing was indeed gender specific. In males, positively valenced words activated the left sensimotor cortex, angular gyrus, left hippocampus, left frontal eye field and the right cerebellum, while females had activations in the right putamen, right superior temporal gyrus, left [[supramarginal gyrus]], left inferior frontal gyrus and the left sensorimotor cortex.  By contrast, negatively valenced words stimulated greater activation in the right supramarginal gyrus in males, while greater activation in the left part of the hippocampus with negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofer|first=Alex|author2=Siedentopf, Christian M. |author3=Ischebeck, Anja |author4=Rettenbacher, Maria A. |author5=Verius, Michael |author6=Febler, Stephan |author7= Wolfgang Fleischhacker, W. |title=Sex differences in brain activation patterns during processing of positively and negatively valenced emotional words|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=12 October 2006|volume=37|issue=01|pages=109|doi=10.1017/S0033291706008919 |pmid=17038205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, different brain regions in males and females could allude to differential responses emotional processing in intimate situations.

====Jealousy====
[[File:Gender Differences in Jealousy When Looking at Actual Infidelity.png|thumb|Gender Differences in Jealousy When Looking at Actual Infidelity| Induction of jealousy through emotional and sexual imagery of their partner elicited differential responses in males and females.]]

Known as the insecure feeling of a partner in regards to losing their loved one to another,  [[jealousy]] can result in extreme situations such as violence and abuse from the insecure partner to their beloved.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  In one study, men and women were shown sentences that suggested sexual and emotional infidelity and rated the intensity of jealousy that they felt.&lt;ref name="Gender differences"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Hidehiko|author2=Matsuura, Masato |author3=Yahata, Noriaki |author4=Koeda, Michihiko |author5=Suhara, Tetsuya |author6= Okubo, Yoshiro |title=Men and women show distinct brain activations during imagery of sexual and emotional infidelity|journal=NeuroImage|date=September 2006|volume=32|issue=3|pages=1299–1307|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.049 |pmid=16829139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sexual infidelity=====
In males, activation of brain areas that were induced by sexual infidelity laden statements included the [[visual cortex]], middle temporal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, and [[claustrum]].  In females, the visual cortex, middle frontal gyrus, thalamus, and cerebellum were activated.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  It was found that males showed more stimulation in the amygdala in regards to sexual infidelity, while females showed greater activation in the visual cortex and thalamus.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  The regions in the male brain provided insight on neuroanatomy associated with sexual and aggressive behavior.  These regions could be studied further in increased violent cases against partners, which are commonly due to male aggression.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;

=====Emotional infidelity=====
In males, the visual cortex, medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, hypothalamus, and cerebellum were shown to be activated.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  In females, activations in the visual cortex, medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, thalamus, and cerebellum were noted.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt; Male activations were greater in the precentral gyrus, insula, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum, while women shower greater activations in the visual cortex, angular gyrus, and thalamus.  Regions in the female brain have been implicated in detection of intention, deception, and trustworthiness of others.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt; It is ultimately suggested that the different emotional processing in males and females contributes to the different responses in issues in intimate relationships.

'''New Suburbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which intends to improve on existing [[Suburb|suburban]] or [[exurban]] designs.&lt;ref name="The New Suburbanism: A Realist's Guide to the American Future"&gt;[http://www.southbaycities.org/files/12.05%20Kotkin%20New%20Suburbanism%20Report.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Suburbanists seek to establish an alternative between a dichotomy of the centripedal city and centrifugal suburb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23290105?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101999752763|title=The Emerging 'Silicon Savanna': From Old Urbanism to New Suburbanism|author=STEPHEN MARSHALL|date=1978|volume=32|pages=267–280|publisher=Alexandrine Press|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by features such as rear-loading garages and walking-focused landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barternews.com/new_suburbanism_growing_in_southern_california.htm |title=New Suburbanism Growing In Southern California |publisher=Barternews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design strategy for New Suburbanism differs from the traditional postwar suburban development. In contrast to post-war suburbanism where the homebuyer had few options in regards to [[Personalization|customization]], new suburban communities feature customization through packages and add-ons as well as larger homes in denser communities. Postwar suburban developments have since filled in with homes and businesses began emerging there, outside of the city-center. This created new communities, not just suburban housing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Paul and Marc Tsurumaki, David J.

[[Suburban sprawl]] is associated with negative effects because it often takes over farm land, disrupts ecosystems, has low-density housing, and car-dependent communities. Suburban sprawl continues to grow as over 70% of Americans choose to live in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fannie-Mae-Foundation. ''Downtown housing as an urban redevelopment tool: hope or hype (panel discussion).'' Housing Policy Debate, 10 (1997), pp. 477–505. Retrieved: 3 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Planners are currently seeking to make the suburbs more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and New Suburbanism offers a solution. This planning approach seeks to redesign suburban communities by making them more-dense, equitable, and environmentally sustainable while still keeping housing and design preferences of the consumer in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkninson-Palombo|first=Carol|date=2010|title=New housing construction in Phoenix: Evidence of "new suburbanism"?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275109001073|journal=Cities|volume=27|pages=77–86|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to New Urbanism==
[[New Urbanism]] is a style of planning a new neighborhood that focuses on designing aspects that create more [[community engagement]], whereas New Suburbanism is the improving of an existing suburban neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

New urbanism, though a small movement, is more successful than New Suburbanism, as NS only has 1 location and NU has hundreds.

'''Nonstop''' is a series of [[server (computing)|server computers]] introduced to market in 1976 by [[Tandem Computers]] Inc., beginning with the NonStop [[product line]], which was followed by the [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[HP Integrity Servers|Integrity NonStop]] [[product line extension]]. Because NonStop systems are based on an integrated hardware/software stack, HP also developed the NonStop OS [[operating system]] for them.

NonStop systems are, to an extent, self-healing. To circumvent [[single point of failure|single points of failure]], they are equipped with almost only [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] components. When a mainline component fails, the system automatically falls back to the backup.

These systems are often used by [[bank]]s, [[stock exchange]]s, telecommunication providers and other enterprises requiring extremely high [[uptime]].

== History ==
Originally introduced in 1976 by Tandem Computers Inc., the line was later owned by [[Compaq]] (from 1997) and Hewlett-Packard (since 2003). In 2005, the current product line of HP Integrity NonStop servers, based on [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[Itanium]] microprocessors (TNS/E), was introduced. In 2014, the first systems "NonStop X" (or TNS/X) running on the Intel X86 chip were introduced.

Early NonStop applications had to be specifically coded for fault-tolerance. That requirement was removed in 1983 with the introduction of the Transaction Monitoring Facility (TMF), which handles the various aspects of fault tolerance on the system level.

== Software ==
NonStop OS is a [[Message_passing|message-based]] operating system designed for fault tolerance. It works with process pairs and ensures that backup processes on redundant CPUs take over in case of a process or CPU failure. Data integrity is maintained during those takeovers; no transactions or data are lost or corrupted.

The operating system as a whole is branded NonStop OS and includes the Guardian layer, which is a low-level component of the operating system and the so-called OSS personality which runs atop this layer, which implements a Unix-like interface for other components of the OS to use.

The operating system and application are both designed to support the fault tolerant hardware. The operating system continually monitors the status of all components, switching control as necessary to maintain operations. There are also features designed into the software that allow programs to be written as continuously available programs. That is accomplished using a pair of processes where one process performs all the primary processing and the other serves as a “hot backup”, receiving updates to data whenever the primary reaches a critical point in processing. Should the primary stop, the backup steps in to resume execution using the current transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=HP NonStop Server Security: A Practical Handbook|publisher=Digital Press|isbn=978-1555583149|url=https://www.amazon.com/NonStop-Server-Security-Practical-Technologies/dp/1555583148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systems support [[relational database management system]]s like [[NonStop SQL]] and hierarchical databases such as [[Enscribe]].

== Hardware ==
The HP Integrity NonStop computers are a line of [[fault-tolerant]] server computers based on the [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] processor platform, and optimized for transaction processing. Average availability levels of 99.999% have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h20223.www2.hp.com/NonStopComputing/cache/426962-0-0-225-121.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN|title=Compare system availability in the real world|publisher=Hewlett-Packard|date=October 2006|accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NonStop systems feature a [[massively parallel processing]] (MPP) architecture and provide linear scalability. Each CPU (systems can be expanded up to over 4000 CPUs) runs its own copy of the OS. This is a [[shared-nothing architecture]] — a "share nothing" arrangement also known as [[loosely coupled multiprocessing]], and no "diminishing returns" occur as more processors are added (see [[Amdahl's law]]).

Due to the integrated hardware/software stack and a single system image for even the largest configurations, system management requirements for NonStop systems are rather low. In most deployments there is just a single production server, not a complex server farm.

Most customers also have a backup server in a remote location for disaster recovery. There are standard products to keep the data of the production and the backup server in sync, hence there is fast takeover and no data loss also in a disaster situation with the production server being disabled or destroyed.

HP also developed a data warehouse and business intelligence server line, [[HP Neoview]], based on the NonStop line. It acted as a [[database server]], providing NonStop OS and [[NonStop SQL]], but lacked the [[transaction processing]] functionality of the original NonStop systems. The line was [[application retirement|retired]], and no longer [[Marketing|marketed]], as of January 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Timothy Prickett, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/24/hp_kills_neoview_appliance/ The Register "HP euthanizes Neoview data warehouse iron: Itanium death"], ''The Register'', Hardware, 24th January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotic]] analysis (the studies of signs or symbols), an '''open text''' is a text that allows multiple or mediated [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]] by the readers.  In contrast, a closed text leads the reader to one intended interpretation.

The concept of the '''open text''' comes from [[Umberto Eco]]'s collection of essays ''The Role of the Reader'',&lt;ref&gt;Eco, U., 1984,The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Texts, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also derivative of [[Roland Barthes]]'s distinction between 'readerly' (lisible) and 'writerly' (scriptible) texts as set out in his 1968 essay, "[[The Death of the Author]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, R., 1977, 'The Death of the Author' in Image-Music-Text, Fontana&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}
In this essay, [[Umberto Eco]] describes a special kind of musical works that can be organized and re-organized by the performers before they are played to the audience. He then applied this idea of "open works" to literary texts and other works of art.

Every work of art can be read, according to Eco, in three distinct ways: the moral, the allegorical and the [[Anagoge|anagogical]]. Each is not only distinct but can be fully anticipated and directed by the author (or the artist) of the work. An example of this kind of reading is found in the stories by [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], in which his symbolic actions cannot be read in one definitive way; each reading will end up with similar and multiple meanings.

The reader will read a certain work differently every time, depending on his/her emotional state, physical state and political world view. We can find an example of this in plays written by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] , which are "open" in the same way that an argument between two people is open: both sides (the actors and the viewers) want and anticipate a solution at the end, but no solution ever comes, leaving us to wander to find meaning.

[[Umberto Eco]] makes a distinction between these kind of works, which are "open" in their interpretation, to the musical works from the beginning, which are open in their structural sense. These kind of "openness" is not only for musical works, it might be any kind of artistic work (painting, poem, performance etc.)

This kind of "openness" is derived from the science of the time, he says. When people believed in a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] world, they expected every work of art to have only one definitive interpretation, but as people found out about the universe and the magnitude of stars in the sky and their hierarchy, they began to expect more ideas to be interpreted from every work.

He continues by comparing open works to [[Quantum mechanics]], and he arrives at the conclusion that open works are more like [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s idea of the universe, which is governed by precise laws but seems random at first. The artist in those open works arranges  the work carefully so it could be re-organized by another but still keep the original voice or intent of the artist.

Every work can be read in infinite ways, depending on an individual's state of mind and perspective, and it also depends on a third person intervention, either the players of the orchestra or the curator at the museum. Eco understand the difficulties with this perspective, but he ends by saying that this article, as all works, is still a "work in movement", an "open work" and still a "work in progress".

[[File:Ecozone Palearctic.svg|thumb|400px|The Palearctic realm]]

The '''Palearctic''' or '''Palaearctic''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s on the Earth's surface, first identified in the 19th century, and still in use today as the basis for [[Zoogeography|zoogeographic]] classification.  The Palearctic is the largest of the eight realms.  It stretches across all of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] north of the foothills of the [[Himalayas]], [[North Africa]], and the northern and central parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

The realm consists of several [[ecoregion]]s:  the [[Euro-Siberian region]]; the [[Mediterranean Basin]]; the [[Sahara]] and [[Arabian Desert]]s; and [[Western Asia|Western]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[East Asia]]. The Palaearctic realm also has numerous rivers and lakes, forming several freshwater ecoregions. Some of the rivers were the source of water for the earliest recorded civilizations that used irrigation methods.

==History==

In an 1858 paper for the ''Proceedings of the [[Linnean Society]]'', British zoologist [[Philip Sclater]] first identified six terrestrial zoogeographic realms of the world:  [[Palaearctic]], Aethiopian/[[Afrotropic]], [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]]/[[Indomalaya]]n, [[Australasia ecozone|Australasian]], [[Nearctic]], and [[Neotropical]].  The six indicated general groupings of fauna, based on shared biogeography and large-scale geographic barriers to migration.

[[File:Wallace biogeography.jpg|thumb|500px|Frontispiece to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s book ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'']]

[[Alfred Wallace]] adopted Sclater's scheme for his book ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', published in 1876.  This is the same scheme that persists today, with relatively minor revisions, and the additional of two more realms:  [[Oceanian realm|Oceania]] and the [[Antarctic realm]].

==Major ecological regions==

The Palearctic realm includes mostly [[subarctic climate|boreal/subarctic-climate]] and [[temperate climate|temperate-climate]] ecoregions, which run across [[Eurasia]] from western Europe to the [[Bering Sea]].

===Euro-Siberian region===
The boreal and temperate Euro-Siberian region is the Palearctic's largest [[biogeography|biogeographic]] region, which transitions from [[tundra]] in the northern reaches of [[Russia]] and [[Scandinavia]] to the vast [[taiga]], the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent. South of the taiga are a belt of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] and [[temperate coniferous forest]]s. This vast Euro-Siberian region is characterized by many shared plant and animal species, and has many affinities with the temperate and boreal regions of the [[Nearctic]] ecoregion of [[North America]]. Eurasia and North America were often connected by the [[Bering land bridge]], and have very similar [[mammal]] and bird fauna, with many Eurasian species having moved into North America, and fewer North American species having moved into Eurasia. Many zoologists consider the Palearctic and Nearctic to be a single [[Holarctic]] realm. The Palearctic and Nearctic also share many plant species, which botanists call the [[Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora]].

===Mediterranean Basin===
{{main|Mediterranean Basin}}
The lands bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in southern Europe, north Africa, and western Asia are home to the [[Mediterranean Basin]] ecoregions, which together constitute the world's largest and most diverse [[mediterranean climate]] region of the world, with generally mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean basin's mosaic of [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] are home to 13,000 [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species. The Mediterranean basin is also one of the world's most endangered biogeographic regions; only 4% of the region's original vegetation remains, and human activities, including overgrazing, [[deforestation]], and conversion of lands for pasture, agriculture, or urbanization, have degraded much of the region. Formerly the region was mostly covered with forests and woodlands, but heavy human use has reduced much of the region to the [[sclerophyll]] shrublands known as [[chaparral]], [[matorral]], [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], or [[garrigue]]. [[Conservation International]] has designated the Mediterranean basin as one of the world's [[biodiversity hotspot]]s.

===Sahara and Arabian deserts===
[[Horse latitudes|A great belt of deserts]], including the [[Atlantic coastal desert]], [[Sahara]] desert, and [[Arabian desert]], separates the Palearctic and [[Afrotropic]] ecoregions. This scheme includes these desert ecoregions in the palearctic realm; other biogeographers identify the realm boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the Mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north, which places the deserts in the Afrotropic, while others place the boundary through the middle of the desert.

===Western and Central Asia===
The [[Caucasus]] mountains, which run between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], are a particularly rich mix of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, and include the [[temperate rain forest]]s of the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]] ecoregion.

[[Central Asia]] and the [[Iranian plateau]] are home to dry [[steppe]] [[grasslands]] and [[desert]] basins, with montane forests, woodlands, and grasslands in the region's high mountains and plateaux. In southern Asia the boundary of the Palearctic is largely altitudinal. The middle altitude foothills of the [[Himalaya]] between about 2000–2500 m form the boundary between the Palearctic and [[Indomalaya]] ecoregions.

===East Asia===
[[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] are more humid and temperate than adjacent [[Siberia]] and Central Asia, and are home to rich temperate coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, which are now mostly limited to mountainous areas, as the densely populated lowlands and river basins have been converted to intensive agricultural and urban use. East Asia was not much affected by glaciation in the [[ice age]]s, and retained 96 percent of [[Pliocene]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} tree genera, while Europe retained only 27 percent. In the subtropical region of southern China and southern edge of the Himalayas, the Palearctic temperate forests transition to the subtropical and tropical forests of [[Indomalaya]], creating a rich and diverse mix of plant and animal species. The [[mountains of southwest China]] are also designated as a [[biodiversity hotspot]]. In Southeastern Asia, high [[mountain range]]s form tongues of Palearctic flora and fauna in northern [[Indochina]] and southern [[China]]. Isolated small outposts ([[sky island]]s) occur as far south as central Myanmar (on [[Nat Ma Taung]], 3050 m), northernmost [[Vietnam]] (on [[Fan Si Pan]], 3140 m) and the high mountains of [[Taiwan]].

===Freshwater===
The realm contains several important [[freshwater ecoregion]]s as well, including the heavily developed [[rivers of Europe]], the [[rivers of Russia]], which flow into the [[Arctic]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Black Sea|Black]], and [[Caspian sea]]s, [[Siberia]]'s [[Lake Baikal]], the oldest and deepest lake on the planet, and Japan's ancient [[Lake Biwa]].

==Flora and fauna==
One bird family, the [[accentor]]s (Prunellidae) is endemic to the Palearctic region. The Holarctic has four other endemic bird families: the divers or [[loon]]s (Gaviidae), [[grouse]] (Tetraoninae), [[auk]]s (Alcidae), and [[waxwing]]s (Bombycillidae).

There are no endemic [[mammal]] orders in the region, but several families are endemic: Calomyscidae ([[mouse-like hamster]]s), [[Prolagidae]], and Ailuridae ([[red panda]]s). Several mammal species originated in the Palearctic, and spread to the Nearctic during [[Last glacial period|the Ice Age]], including the [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'', known in North America as the grizzly), [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus'') in Europe and the closely related [[elk]] (''Cervus canadensis'') in far eastern Siberia, [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), and [[reindeer]] (''Rangifer tarandus'', known in North America as the [[caribou]]).

===Megafaunal extinctions===
Several large Palearctic animals became extinct from the end of the [[Pleistocene]] into historic times, including the [[Irish elk]] (''Megaloceros giganteus''), [[aurochs]] (''Bos primigenius'') [[woolly rhinoceros]] (''Coelodonta antiquitatis''), [[woolly mammoth]] (''Mammuthus primigenius''), [[North African elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana pharaoensis''), [[Elephants in ancient China|Chinese elephant]] (''Elephas maximus rubridens''), [[cave bear]] (''Ursus spelaeus''), and [[History of lions in Europe|European lion]] (''Panthera leo europaea'').

It is a multi-modal approach which explores through artistic practice how [[writing]] interacts with other art forms and practices — [[visual art]], [[sound art]], [[video art|time-based media]], [[installation art|installation]], [[electronic literature]], [[Artist's book|bookworks]], and [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Performance-Writing/446221925633?v=info&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Performance Writing was inaugurated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] undergraduate course at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in 1994. The course was written, and the field developed, by a number of self-described Performance Writers and academics including John Hall, Ric Allsopp, [[Caroline Bergvall]], Aaron Williamson, Brigid Mc Leer, Alaric Sumner, [[Redell Olsen]], [[cris cheek]], Peter Jager, Barbara Bridger, Melanie Thompson, Jerome Fletcher, and many others, and enriched by an program of visiting artists from around the world.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen"&gt;John Hall, ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing: a Lecture'', Plymouth, UK: Plymouth College of Art Press, 2007. (A more extensive list of performance writers is given on p.35.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the merger of DCA and [[University College Falmouth]] ( now [[Falmouth University]] in 2010, the undergraduate Performance Writing course was relocated to a new performance centre at Tremough Campus (now [[Penryn Campus]]) near [[Penryn, Cornwall]]. The course ceased taking applications for new students from 2010 onwards pending a reconfiguration of its Performance Writing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013037/http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment has not resumed.

The [[Falmouth University]] post-graduate [[Master of Arts]] course in Performance Writing led by Associate Professor of Performance Writing Jerome Fletcher ran for two years at the [[Arnolfini]] in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/201/courses-7/postgraduate-courses-43/performance-writing-ma-1688.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment to the MA Performance Writing was ceased in 2012. Performance Writing continues at the postgraduate and research level at [[Falmouth University]].

The democratic, inclusive, and above all extensible nature of Performance Writing methodology has led to its adoption and adaptation by both independent and academic researchers, practitioners, pedagogs, and institutions in places as far flung as Oakland, California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacket2.org/commentary/what-performance-writing|title= What is performance writing? |publisher=Jacket2|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Banff Centre]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banffcentre.ca//programs/program.aspx?id=1393|title=In(ter)ventions: Literary Practice at the Edge|publisher=The Banff Centre|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, Performance Writing methodologies and sensibilities have spread – primarily through graduates of the program at Dartington – into a rich diversity of artistic forms and institutional formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luckysoap.com/lapsuslinguae/2013/07/writing-on-writing-on-performance-writing/|title=Writing on Writing on Performance Writing |publisher=J. R. Carpenter|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of definition==
As an emerging field, its definition and limits are the subject of ongoing debate. John Hall's lecture ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing'', explores [[definition]] as a process, using playful and precise language to establish the complexity of reflexive descriptions: a performance of writing about writing as such.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen" /&gt;

At the symposium launching the field, Performance Writing was described by Caroline Bergvall as exploring "relationships between textual and text-based work when developed in conjunction with other media and discourses.", and opening "the investigation of formal and ideological strategies which writers and artists develop textually in response or in reaction to their own time and their own fields"&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote"&gt;Caroline Bergvall, [http://www.carolinebergvall.com/content/text/BERGVALL-KEYNOTE.pdf Keynote Paper for Performance Writing Symposium], Dartington, U.K. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

She also understood it as "not primarily [a] unified academic discipline [or] one delineated, hybridic artform", but rather as an "area of joint practical and critical investigation of the many uses writing and language are being put to and push themselves into."&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote" /&gt;

==Events==
Performance Writing events so far include two symposia; one at Dartington College of Arts in 1996 and a second at the Theatre School in Utrecht in 1999.

In May 2010 Bristol's [[Arnolfini]], in collaboration with University College Falmouth, held ''PW10'': a weekend of Performance Writing themed talks, readings, and artistic works exploring [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to language and [[textuality]]. It was timed to coincide with the exhibition ''Say: "Parsley"'' by Performance Writing co-founder [[Caroline Bergvall]] and Ciaran Maher. It included works by [[Allen Fisher]], [[Drew Milne]], [[David Prior (artist)]], [[Jason Nelson]], [[J.R. Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 Arnolfini Programme 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302211816/http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 PW12 was held at [[Arnolfini]].

'''Pine barrens''', '''pine plains''', '''sand plains''', or '''pinelands''' occur throughout the  U.S. from [[Florida]] to [[Maine]] (see [[Atlantic coastal pine barrens]]) as well as the [[Midwest]], [[Western United States|West]], and Canada and parts of [[Eurasia]]. Pine barrens are plant communities that occur on dry, acidic, infertile soils, dominated by [[grasses]], [[forb]]s, low [[shrub]]s, and small to medium-sized [[pine]]s. The most extensive barrens occur in large areas of sandy [[glacial deposit]]s (including [[outwash plain]]s), lakebeds, and outwash [[Fluvial terrace|terraces]] along rivers.

==Description==

===Botany===
The most common trees are the [[jack pine]], [[red pine]], [[pitch pine]], [[blackjack oak]], and [[Quercus ilicifolia|scrub oak]]; a scattering of larger [[oak]]s is not unusual. The [[understory]] includes grasses, [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s, and forbs, many of them common in dry [[prairie]]s, and rare plants such as the sand-plain gerardia (''[[Agalinis acuta]]''). Plants of the [[Ericaceae|heath]] family, such as [[blueberries]] and [[bearberry]], and shrubs, such as prairie willow and [[hazel]], are common. These species have adaptations that permit them to survive or regenerate well after fire.

===Fauna===
Pine barrens support a number of rare species, including [[Lepidoptera]] such as the [[Karner blue]] butterfly (''Lycaeides melissa samuelis'') and the barrens [[buck moth]] (''Hemileuca maia'').

===Fire ecology===
Barrens are dependent on fire to prevent invasion by less fire-tolerant species. In the absence of fire, barrens will proceed through [[Ecological succession|successional stages]] from pine forest to a larger climax forest, such as [[oak-hickory forest]].

European settlers found extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, commonly called "barrens".  The American Indians used fire to maintain such areas as rangeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Hutch|date=Summer 2000|title=Wildland Burning by American Indians in Virginia|journal=Fire Management Today|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service|location=Washington, DC|volume=60|issue=3|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Open barrens are now rare and imperiled globally. Suppression of [[wildfire]]s has allowed larger climax forest vegetation to take over in most one-time barrens. In North America, the largest natural pine barrens exist primarily in parts of the American [[Midwest]] and in dry sandy areas along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].

==In popular culture==
;Literature
[[John McPhee]]'s book, titled ''[[The Pine Barrens]]'' (1968), explores the history, ecology, and geography of the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|New Jersey Pine Barrens]]. His account is also infused with his personal memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McPhee |first=John |title=The Pine Barrens |isbn=978-0-374-51442-6 |year=1968 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book contributed to a reappraisal of the ecological role of pine barrens; in New Jersey and on eastern Long Island, they contribute to preserving the amount and quality of vital groundwater supplies in underground aquifers.

The New Jersey Pine Barrens is the setting of Voltaire's horror novel ''[[Call of the Jersey Devil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voltaire |first1=Aurelio |title=Call of the Jersey Devil |date=May 28, 2013 |publisher=Spence City |pages=352 |edition= 1st|asin=B00CXWC7I6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Television
Season 3, episode 11 of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', titled [[Pine Barrens (The Sopranos)|"Pine Barrens"]] (airdate May 6, 2001), is purportedly set largely in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, although filming of the forest scenes actually took place in [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-sopranos-pine-barrens-50194 |title=''The Sopranos'': "Pine Barrens" |last=VanDerWerff |first=Todd |publisher=Onion Inc. |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|date=December 17, 2000|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/nyregion/sopranos-banned-from-county-property.html|title=The Sopranos banned from County Property}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BookPB"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sopranos: The Complete Book |last1=Martin |first1=Brett |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-933821-18-4 |chapter="This Thing of Ours": Creating ''The Sopranos'' Universe |page=178-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sopranos: The Complete Book |last1=Martin |first1=Brett |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-933821-18-4 |chapter=Welcome to New Jersey: A Sense of Place |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary protection''' is a guiding principle in the design of an [[interplanetary mission]], aiming to prevent biological contamination of both the target [[celestial body]] and the [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] in the case of sample-return missions. Planetary protection reflects both the unknown nature of the space environment and the desire of the scientific community to preserve the pristine nature of celestial bodies until they can be studied in detail.&lt;ref name='Rummel 1989'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Planetary protection policy overview and application to future missions | journal = Advances in Space Research | date = 1989 | first = John D.

There are two types of [[interplanetary contamination]]. '''Forward contamination''' is the transfer of [[Natural selection#Types of selection|viable]] [[organisms]] from Earth to another celestial body.  '''Back contamination''' is the transfer of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] organisms, if such exist, back to the Earth's [[biosphere]].

==History==

The potential problem of lunar and planetary contamination was first raised at the [[International Astronautical Federation]] VIIth Congress in Rome in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/history | author=NASA Office of Planetary Protection | accessdate= 2013-07-13 | title=Planetary Protection History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11381&amp;page=12 Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars (2006) - Page 12 ]&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) passed a resolution stating, “The National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America urges that scientists plan lunar and planetary studies with great care and deep concern so that initial operations do not compromise and make impossible forever after critical scientific experiments.” This led to creation of the ad hoc Committee on Contamination by Extraterrestrial Exploration (CETEX), which met for a year and recommended that interplanetary spacecraft be [[Sterilization (microbiology)#Spacecraft|sterilized]], and stated, “The need for sterilization is only temporary. Mars and possibly Venus need to remain uncontaminated only until study by manned ships becomes possible”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ErBzrnTLfuAC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CThe+need+for+sterilization+is+only+temporary.+Mars+and+possibly+Venus+need+to+remain+uncontaminated+only+until+study+by+manned+ships+becomes+possible. Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, planetary protection was transferred to the newly formed [[Committee on Space Research]] (COSPAR). COSPAR in 1964 issued Resolution 26 affirming that:

{{quotation|the search for extraterrestrial life is an important objective of space research, that the planet of Mars may offer the only feasible opportunity to conduct this search during the foreseeable future, that contamination of this planet would make such a search far more difficult and possibly even prevent for all time an unequivocal result, that all practical steps should be taken to ensure that Mars be not biologically contaminated until such time as this search has been satisfactorily carried out, and that cooperation in proper scheduling of experiments and use of adequate spacecraft sterilization techniques is required on the part of all deep space probe launching authorities to avoid such contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11381&amp;page=12 Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars - p12] quotes from COSPAR 1964 Resolution 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Outer Space Treaty-SVG.svg|400px|right|thumb|Signatories of the Outer Space Treaty - includes all current and aspiring space faring nation states. By signing the treaty, these nation states have all committed themselves to planetary protection.&lt;br&gt;
{{legend|green|[[Signature|Signed]] and [[ratified]]}}
{{legend|yellow|[[Signature|Signed]] only}}
{{legend|lightgray|Not signed}}]]In 1967, the US, USSR, and UK ratified the United Nations [[Outer Space Treaty]].  The legal basis for planetary protection lies in Article IX of this treaty:

{{quotation|"Article IX: ... States Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose...&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the Outer Space Treaty [http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_21_2222.html Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708075800/http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_21_2222.html |date=2013-07-08 }}'' - See Article IX''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CNES'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnes.fr/web/CNES-en/5210-planetary-protection-treaties-and-recommendations.php | title = Planetary protection treaties and recommendations | accessdate = 2012-09-11 | author = Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) | date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This treaty has since been signed and ratified by 104 nation states. Another 24 have signed but not ratified.  All the current space-faring nation states have both signed and ratified it. Amongst nations with space faring aspirations, some have not yet ratified: the United Arab Emirates, Syria and North Korea have signed but not yet ratified.&lt;ref name=unoda&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/outer_space  | title = Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies  | accessdate = 2013-04-18 | publisher= [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Outer Space Treaty has consistent and widespread international support, and as a result of this, together with the fact that it is based on the 1963 declaration which was adopted by consensus in the UN National Assembly, it has taken on the status of customary international law. The provisions of the Outer Space Treaty are therefore binding on all states, even those who have neither signed nor ratified it.&lt;ref name="Meishan GohKazeminejad2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meishan Goh|first1=Gérardine|last2=Kazeminejad|first2=Bobby|title=Mars through the looking glass: an interdisciplinary analysis of forward and backward contamination|journal=Space Policy|volume=20|issue=3|year=2004|pages=217–225|issn=0265-9646|doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2004.06.008|quote=More crucially, because of the consistent and widespread international support for its fundamental tenets, and the fact that it was based on an earlier 1963 Declaration adopted by consensus in the United Nations General Assembly [43], the principles enshrined in the Outer Space Treaty have taken on the status of customary international law [44]. They are therefore binding on all states, even those that have neither signed nor ratified the Outer Space Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
For forward contamination, the phrase to be interpreted is "harmful contamination".  Two legal reviews came to differing interpretations of this clause (both reviews were unofficial). However the currently accepted interpretation is that “any contamination which would result in harm to a state’s experiments or programs is to be avoided”. NASA policy states explicitly that “the conduct of scientific investigations of possible extraterrestrial life forms, precursors, and remnants must not be jeopardized”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11381&amp;page=13 Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars, page 13] Summarizes this para in the book:

{{Quote|A policy review of the Outer Space Treaty concluded that, while Article IX "imposed international obligations on all state parties to protect and preserve the environmental integrity of outer space and celestial bodies such as Mars," there is no definition as to what constitutes harmful contamination, nor does the treaty specify under what circumstances it would be necessary to "adopt appropriate measures" or which measures would in fact be "appropriate" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An earlier legal review, however, argued that "if the assumption is made that the parties to the treaty were not merely being verbose" and "harmful contamination" is not simply redundant, "harmful" should be interpreted as "harmful to the interests of other states," and since "states have an interest in protecting their ongoing space programs," Article IX must mean that "any contamination which would result in harm to a state’s experiments or programs is to be avoided" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Current NASA policy states that the goal of NASA’s forward contamination planetary protection policy is the protection of scientific investigations, declaring explicitly that "the conduct of scientific investigations of possible extraterrestrial life forms, precursors, and remnants must not be jeopardized"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==COSPAR recommendations and categories==

The [[COSPAR|Committee on Space Research]] (COSPAR) meets every two years, in a gathering of 2000 to 3000 scientists,&lt;ref&gt;[https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/events/scientific-assemblies COSPAR scientific assemblies]&lt;/ref&gt; and one of its tasks is to develop recommendations for avoiding interplanetary contamination. Its legal basis is Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty &lt;ref name=marscontaminationOST&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11381&amp;page=13 Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 )  - Page 13]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#History|history below for details]]).

Its recommendations depend on the type of space mission and the celestial body explored.&lt;ref name="COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130306111646/https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/05/04/COSPAR_Planetary_Protection_Policy_v3-24-11.pdf COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY] (20 October 2002; As Amended to 24 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  COSPAR categorizes the missions into 5 groups:
*''Category I:'' Any mission to locations not of direct interest for chemical evolution or the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]], such as  the  [[Sun]] or [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. No planetary protection requirements.&lt;ref name="OPPaboutcategories"&gt;[http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/about-categories/ Office of Planetary Protection - About The Categories]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Category II:'' Any mission to locations of significant interest for chemical evolution and the origin of life, but only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations. Examples include the [[Moon]], [[Venus]], and [[comet]]s. Requires simple documentation only, primarily to outline intended or potential impact targets, and an end of mission report of any inadvertent impact site if such occurred.&lt;ref name="OPPaboutcategories" /&gt;
*''Category III:'' Flyby and orbiter missions to locations of significant interest for chemical evolution or the origin of life, and with a significant chance that contamination could compromise investigations e.g., [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]. Requires more involved documentation than Category II. Other requirements, depending on the mission, may include trajectory biasing, clean room assembly, bioburden reduction, and if impact is a possibility, inventory of organics.&lt;ref name="OPPaboutcategories" /&gt;
*''Category IV:'' Lander or probe missions to the same locations as Category III. Measures to be applied depend on the target body and the planned operations. "Sterilization of the entire spacecraft may be required for landers and rovers with life-detection experiments, and for those landing in or moving to a region where terrestrial microorganisms may survive and grow, or where indigenous life may be present. For other landers and rovers, the requirements would be for decontamination and partial sterilization of the landed hardware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Mission Design And Requirements| url=http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/missiondesign/| website=Office of Planetary Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''Missions to Mars in category IV are subclassified further:'''&lt;ref name="COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY"/&gt;
:*''Category IVa.'' Landers that do not search for Martian life - uses the Viking lander pre-sterilization requirements, a maximum of 300,000 spores per spacecraft and 300 spores per square meter.
:*''Category IVb.'' Landers that search for Martian life.  Adds stringent extra requirements to prevent contamination of samples.
:*''Category IVc.'' Any component that accesses a Martian ''[[Planetary protection#Mars special regions|special region]]'' (see below) must be sterilized to at least to the Viking post-sterilization biological burden levels  of 30 spores total per spacecraft.
*''Category V:'' This is further divided into unrestricted and restricted sample return.
:* Unrestricted Category V: samples from locations judged by scientific opinion to have no indigenous lifeforms. No special requirements. 
:* Restricted Category V: (where scientific opinion is unsure) the requirements include: absolute prohibition of destructive impact upon return, containment of all returned hardware which directly contacted the target body, and containment of any unsterilized sample returned to Earth. &lt;!-- the details of how this is achieved isn't part of the actual guidelines as such, not yet anyway, so better discussed in its own section below I think. --&gt;

For Category IV missions, a certain level of ''biological burden'' is allowed for the mission. In general this is expressed as a 'probability of contamination', required to be less than one chance in 10,000&lt;ref name=EuropaStudy/&gt;&lt;ref name=ColmanSagan/&gt; of forward contamination per mission, but in the case of Mars Category IV missions (above) the requirement has been translated into a count of ''[[Bacillus]]'' spores per surface area, as an easy to use assay method.&lt;ref name="OPPaboutcategories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://astrobio.net/news/print.php?sid=2338 ''Keeping it clean'']&lt;/ref&gt;

More extensive documentation is also required for Category IV. Other procedures required, depending on the mission, may include trajectory biasing, the use of clean rooms &lt;!--(Class 100,000 or better)--&gt;during spacecraft assembly and testing, bioload reduction, partial sterilization of the hardware having direct contact with the target body, a bioshield for that hardware, and, in rare cases, complete sterilization of the entire spacecraft.&lt;ref name="OPPaboutcategories" /&gt;

For restricted Category V missions, the current recommendation&lt;ref name=ESFsection12&gt;[http://www.esf.org/fileadmin/Public_documents/Publications/MarsSampleReturn.pdf Mars Sample Return backward contamination – Strategic advice and requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819141409/http://www.esf.org/fileadmin/Public_documents/Publications/MarsSampleReturn.pdf |date=2013-08-19 }}- foreword and section 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; is that no uncontained samples should be returned unless sterilized. Since sterilization of the returned samples would destroy much of their science value, current proposals involve containment and quarantine procedures. For details, see [[#Containment and quarantine for restricted Category V sample return|Containment and quarantine]] below. Category V missions also have to fulfill the requirements of Category IV to protect the target body from forward contamination.

===Mars special regions===

A ''special region'' is a region classified by COSPAR where terrestrial organisms could readily propagate, or thought to have a high potential for existence of Martian life forms. This is understood to apply to any region on Mars where liquid water occurs, or can occasionally occur, based on the current understanding of requirements for life.

If a [[hard landing]] risks biological contamination of a special region, then the whole lander system must be sterilized to COSPAR category IVc.

==Target categories==
Some targets are easily categorized. Others are assigned provisional categories by COSPAR, pending future discoveries and research.

The 2009 COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Outer Planet Satellites and Small Solar System Bodies covered this in some detail. Most of these assessments are from that report, with some future refinements. This workshop also gave more precise definitions for some of the categories:&lt;ref name=smallsolarsystembodies&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~spi/COSPAR_OP_PP_Workshop_final_Aug2009.pdf COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Outer Planet Satellites and Small Solar System Bodies] European Space Policy Institute (ESPI), 15–17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2011/06/29/Rummel_COSPAR_COPUOS_PPS_9May11_-_TAGGED.pdf COSPAR power point type presentation, gives good overview of the detailed category decisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160210/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2011/06/29/Rummel_COSPAR_COPUOS_PPS_9May11_-_TAGGED.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Category I===

{{quotation|“not of direct interest for understanding the process of chemical evolution or the origin of life.” &lt;ref name=PlanetaryProtectionCategories&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Categories| url=http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/categories|website=Office of Planetary Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Io, Sun, Mercury, undifferentiated metamorphosed asteroids

===Category II===

{{quotation|… where there is only a remote chance that contamination carried by a spacecraft could jeopardize future exploration”. In this case we define “remote chance” as “the absence of niches (places where terrestrial microorganisms could proliferate) and/or a very low likelihood of transfer to those places.” &lt;ref name=smallsolarsystembodies/&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryProtectionCategories/&gt;}}

* Callisto, comets, asteroids of category P, D, and C, Venus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11584 Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Venus Missions -- Letter Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper belt objects (KBO) &lt; 1/2 size of Pluto.

===Provisional Category II===
* Ganymede, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Triton, the Pluto-Charon system, and other large KBOs (&gt; 1/2 size of Pluto),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~spi/COSPAR_OP_PP_Workshop_final_Aug2009.pdf COSPAR Final]&lt;/ref&gt; Ceres,

Provisionally, they assigned these objects to Category II. However, they state that more research is needed, because there is a remote possibility that the tidal interactions of Pluto and Charon could maintain some water reservoir below the surface. Similar considerations apply to the other larger KBOs.

[[Triton (moon)|Triton]] is insufficiently well understood at present to say it is definitely devoid of liquid water. The only close up observations to date are those of [[Voyager 2]].

In a detailed discussion of Titan, scientists concluded that there was no danger of contamination of its surface, except short term adding of negligible amounts of organics, but Titan could have a below surface water reservoir that communicates with the surface, and if so, this could be contaminated.

In the case of Ganymede, the question is, given that its surface shows pervasive signs of resurfacing, is there any communication with its subsurface ocean? They found no known mechanism by which this could happen, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] spacecraft found no evidence of [[cryovolcanism]]. Initially, they assigned it as Priority B minus, meaning that precursor missions are needed to assess its category before any surface missions. However, after further discussion they provisionally assigned it to Category II, so no precursor missions are required, depending on future research.

If there is cryovolcanism on Ganymede or Titan, the undersurface reservoir is thought to be 50 – 150&amp;nbsp;km below the surface. They were unable to find a process that could transfer the surface melted water back down through 50&amp;nbsp;km of ice to the under surface sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~spi/COSPAR_Titan_Report2010_final.pdf COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Titan and Ganymede]&lt;/ref&gt; This is why both Ganymede and Titan were assigned a reasonably firm provisional Category II, but pending results of future research.

Icy bodies that show signs of recent resurfacing need further discussion and might need to be assigned to a new category depending on future research. This approach has been applied, for instance, to missions to [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. The planetary protection Category is subject for review during the mission of the Ceres orbiter (''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'']]'') depending on the results found.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Conley [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/jan2013/presentations/sbag8_presentations/MON_1530_ConleyDawn.pdf Planetary Protection for the Dawn Mission], NASA HQ, Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Category III / IV===

{{quotation|“…where there is a significant chance that contamination carried by a spacecraft could jeopardize future exploration.” We define “significant chance” as “the presence of niches (places where terrestrial microorganisms could proliferate) and the likelihood of transfer to those places.” &lt;ref name=smallsolarsystembodies/&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryProtectionCategories/&gt;}}

* Mars because of possible surface habitats.
* Europa because of its subsurface ocean.
* [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] because of evidence of water plumes.

===Category V===

{{quotation|Unrestricted Category V: “Earth-return missions from bodies deemed by scientific opinion to have no indigenous life forms.”&lt;ref name=PlanetaryProtectionCategories/&gt;}}
{{quotation|Restricted Category V: "Earth-return missions from bodies deemed by scientific opinion to be of significant interest to the process of chemical evolution or the origin of life."&lt;ref name=PlanetaryProtectionCategories/&gt;}}
In the category V for sample return the conclusions so far are:&lt;ref name=PlanetaryProtectionCategories/&gt;

* Restricted Category V: Mars, Europa, Enceladus.
* Unrestricted Category V: [[Venus]], the Moon.

with others to be decided.

===Other objects===

If there has been no activity for 3 billion years, it will not be possible to destroy the surface by terrestrial contamination, so can be treated as Category I. Otherwise, the category may need to be reassessed.

==The Coleman-Sagan equation==

The aim of the current regulations is to keep the number of microorganisms low enough so that the probability of contamination of Mars (and other targets) is acceptable. It is not an objective to make the probability of contamination zero.

The aim is to keep the probability of contamination of 1 chance in 10,000 of contamination per mission flown.&lt;ref name=EuropaStudy/&gt; This figure is obtained typically by multiplying together the number of microorganisms on the spacecraft, the probability of growth on the target body, and a series of bioload reduction factors.

In detail the method used is the Coleman-Sagan equation.&lt;ref&gt;edited by Muriel Gargaud, Ricardo Amils, Henderson James Cleaves, Michel Viso, Daniele Pinti  [https://books.google.com/books?id=oEq1y9GIcr0C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=Coleman+Sagan+equation Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Volume 1] page 325&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_c = N_0 R P_S P_t P_R P_g&lt;/math&gt;.

where 
: &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; = the number of microorganisms on the spacecraft initially
: &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = Reduction due to conditions on spacecraft before and after launch
: &lt;math&gt;P_S&lt;/math&gt; = Probability that microorganisms on the spacecraft reach the surface of the planet
: &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt; = Probability that spacecraft will hit the planet - this is 1 for a lander
: &lt;math&gt;P_R&lt;/math&gt; = Probability of microorganism to be released in the environment when on the ground, usually set to 1 for crashlanding.
: &lt;math&gt;P_g&lt;/math&gt; = Probability of growth. For targets with liquid water this is set to 1 for sake of the calculation.

Then the requirement is &lt;math&gt;P_c &lt; 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; is a number chosen by Sagan et al., somewhat arbitrarily. Sagan and Coleman assumed that about 60 missions to the Mars surface would occur before the exobiology of Mars is thoroughly understood, 54 of those successful, and 30 flybys or orbiters, and the number was chosen to endure a probability to keep the planet free from contamination of at least 99.9% over the duration of the exploration period.&lt;ref name=ColmanSagan&gt;Carl Sagan and Sidney Coleman [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pUQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA470&amp;dq=coleman+sagan+equation&amp;ots=a75yzxe9rP&amp;sig=wEcN3zkVJTKD3LSRxAT9LvwGaBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Decontamination Standards for Martian Exploration Programs, Chapter 28] from Biology and the Exploration of Mars: Report of a Study  edited by Colin Stephenson Pittendrigh, Wolf Vishniac, J. P. T. Pearman, National Academies, 1966 - Life on other planets&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critiques===

The Coleman Sagan equation has been criticised because the individual parameters are often not known to better than a magnitude or so. For example, the thickness of the surface ice of Europa is unknown, and may be thin in places, which can give rise to a high level of uncertainty in the equation.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Richard Greenberg, Richard J. Greenberg [https://books.google.com/books?id=gwRAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=coleman+sagan+equation#search_anchor Unmasking Europa: the search for life on Jupiter's ocean moon] {{ISBN|0387479368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glister&gt;Paul Gilster [http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=17515 Europa: Thin Ice and Contamination]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been criticised because of the inherent assumption made of an end to the protection period and future human exploration. In the case of Europa, this would only protect it with reasonable probability for the duration of the period of exploration.&lt;ref name=Greenberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glister /&gt;

Greenberg has suggested an alternative, to use the natural contamination standard - that our missions to Europa should not have a higher chance of contaminating it than the chance of contamination by meteorites from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;B. Randall Tufts, Richard Greenberg [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/infecting-other-worlds/2 Infecting Other Worlds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018184521/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/infecting-other-worlds/2 |date=2016-10-18 }}, American Scientist, July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gmvfvs8BWccC&amp;q=natural+contamination+standard#v=snippet&amp;q=natural%20contamination%20standard&amp;f=false Europa the Ocean Moon, Search for an Alien Biosphere, chapter 21.5.2 Standards and Risks]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|As long as the probability of people infecting other planets with terrestrial microbes is substantially smaller than the probability that such contamination happens naturally, exploration activities would, in our view, be doing no harm. We call this concept the natural contamination standard.}}

Another approach for Europa is the use of binary decision trees which is favoured by the ''Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System'' under the auspices of the Space Studies Board.&lt;ref name=EuropaStudy&gt;[http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/CurrentProjects/SSB_059273 Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System] - about the ''Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System''&lt;/ref&gt; This goes through a series of seven steps, leading to a final decision on whether to go ahead with the mission or not.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System; Space Studies Board; Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences; National Research Council [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13401&amp;page=13  Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Spacecraft Missions to Icy Solar System Bodies ( 2012 ) / 2 Binary Decision Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Recommendation: Approaches to achieving planetary protection should not rely on the multiplication of bioload estimates and probabilities to calculate the likelihood of contaminating Solar System bodies with terrestrial organisms unless scientific data unequivocally define the values, statistical variation, and mutual independence of every factor used in the equation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Recommendation: Approaches to achieving planetary protection for missions to icy Solar System bodies should employ a series of binary decisions that consider one factor at a time to determine the appropriate level of planetary protection procedures to use.}}

==Containment and quarantine for restricted Category V sample return==
{{further|Extraterrestrial sample curation}}
In the case of restricted Category V missions, Earth would be protected through quarantine of sample and astronauts in a yet to be built [[Biosafety level|Biosafety level 4]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170006928.pdf Preparing to receive and handle Martian samples when they arrive on Earth.] Francis M. McCubbin, NASA. 2017.  Accessed: 25 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a Mars sample return, missions would be designed so that no part of the capsule that encounters the Mars surface is exposed to the Earth environment. One way to do that is to enclose the sample container within a larger outer container from Earth, in the vacuum of space. The integrity of any seals is essential and the system must also be monitored to check for the possibility of micro-meteorite damage during return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/topic/solar-system/mars/designing-a-box-to-return-samples-from-mars/ Designing a Box to Return Samples From Mars] Astrobio.net, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/summary/DraftTestWorkshops Office of Planetary Protection: Mars Sample Quarantine Protocol Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_059308.pdf Mars sample return mission concept study (for decadal review 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://robotics.estec.esa.int/ASTRA/Astra2013/Papers/Senese_2811296.pdf Proof of concept of a Bio-Containment System for Mars Sample Return Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendation of the ESF report is that &lt;ref name=ESFsection12 /&gt;

{{quote|“No uncontained Mars materials, including space craft surfaces that have been exposed to the Mars environment should be returned to Earth unless sterilised"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;..."For unsterilised samples returned to Earth, a programme of life detection and biohazard testing, or a proven sterilisation process, shall be undertaken as an absolute precondition for the controlled distribution of any portion of the sample.”}}

No restricted category V returns have been carried out. During the Apollo program, the sample-returns were regulated through the [[Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law]]. This was rescinded in 1991, so new legislation would need to be enacted. The Apollo era quarantine procedures are of interest as the only attempt to date of a return to Earth of a sample that, at the time, was thought to have a remote possibility of including extraterrestrial life.

Samples and astronauts were quarantined in the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Johnston, John A. Mason, Bennie C. Wooley, Gary W. McCollum, Bernard J.

See quote from: McLane who lead the group that designed and built the Lunar Receiving Facility: {{bq|"The best that I hear now is that the techniques of isolation we used wouldn’t be adequate for a sample coming back from Mars, so somebody else has a big job on their hands."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the lunar receiving laboratory would be judged a failure by its own design criteria as the sample return didn't contain the lunar material, with two failure points during the Apollo 11 return mission, at the splashdown and at the facility itself.

However the Lunar Receiving Laboratory was built quickly with only two years from start to finish, a time period now considered inadequate. Lessons learned from it can help with design of any Mars sample return receiving facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10138&amp;page=60 The Quarantine and Certification of Martian Samples - Chapter 7: Lessons Learned from the Quarantine of Apollo Lunar Samples], Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration, Space Studies Board&lt;/ref&gt;

Design criteria for a proposed Mars Sample Return Facility, and for the return mission, have been developed by the American National Research Council,&lt;ref name=nrc2009&gt;
{{cite report |title=Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Mars Sample Return Missions |publisher=National Research Council |date=2009 | url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12576}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Space Foundation.&lt;ref name=esf2012&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - strategic advice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602150139/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf |date=2016-06-02 }} July, 2012, {{ISBN|978-2-918428-67-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that it could be based on biohazard 4 containment but with more stringent requirements to contain unknown microorganisms possibly as small as or smaller than the smallest Earth microorganisms known, the [[ultramicrobacteria]]. The ESF study also recommended that it should be designed to contain the smaller [[gene transfer agent]]s if possible, as these could potentially transfer DNA from martian microorganisms to terrestrial microorganisms if they have a shared evolutionary ancestry. It also needs to double as a clean room facility to protect the samples from terrestrial contamination that could confuse the sensitive life detection tests that would be used on the samples.

Before a sample return, new quarantine laws would be required. Environmental assessment would also be required, and various other domestic and international laws not present during the Apollo era would need to be negotiated.&lt;ref name=race&gt;M. S.

Space Res. vol 18 no 1/2 pp (1/2)345-(1/2)350 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decontamination procedures==

For all spacecraft missions requiring decontamination, the starting point is clean room assembly in [[FED-STD-209E|US federal standard]] class 100 [[cleanroom]]s. These are rooms with fewer than 100 particles of size 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm or larger per cubic foot. Engineers wear [[cleanroom suit]]s with only their eyes exposed. Components are sterilized individually before assembly, as far as possible, and they clean surfaces frequently with alcohol wipes during assembly. Spores of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' was chosen for not only its ability to readily generate spores, but its well-established use as a model species. It is a useful tracker of UV irradiation effects because of its high resilience to a variety of extreme conditions. As such it is an important indicator species for forward contamination in the context of planetary protection.

For Category IVa missions (Mars landers that do not search for Martian life), the aim is to reduce the bioburden to 300,000 bacterial spores on any surface from which the spores could get into the Martian environment. Any heat tolerant components are heat sterilized to 114&amp;nbsp;°C. Sensitive electronics such as the core box of the rover including the computer, are sealed and vented through high-efficiency filters to keep any microbes inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/technology/is_planetary_protection.html In-situ Exploration and Sample Return: Planetary Protection Technologies] JPL - Mars Exploration Rovers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/methods | title = Office of Planetary Protection - Methods and Implementation | accessdate = 2012-09-11 | author = Office of Planetary Protection | date = August 28, 2012 | work = NASA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120929033809/http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/methods | archivedate = September 29, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

For more sensitive missions such as Category IVc (to [[#Mars_special_regions|Mars special regions]]), a far higher level of sterilization is required. These need to be similar to levels implemented on the Viking landers, which were sterilized for a surface which, at the time, was thought to be potentially hospitable to life similar to special regions on Mars today.

In microbiology, it is usually impossible to prove that there are no microorganisms left viable, since many microorganisms are either not yet studied, or not cultivable. Instead, sterilization is done using a series of tenfold reductions of the numbers of microorganisms present. After a sufficient number of tenfold reductions, the chance that there any microorganisms left will be extremely low.{{or|date=January 2018}}

The two [[Viking program|Viking Mars landers]] were sterilized using dry heat sterilization.  After preliminary cleaning to reduce the bioburden to levels similar to present day Category IVa spacecraft, the Viking spacecraft were heat-treated for 30 hours at 112&amp;nbsp;°C, nominal 125&amp;nbsp;°C (five hours at 112&amp;nbsp;°C was considered enough to reduce the population tenfold even for enclosed parts of the spacecraft, so this was enough for a million-fold reduction of the originally low population).&lt;ref name=JPL2011/&gt;

Modern materials however are often not designed to handle such temperatures, especially since modern spacecraft often use "commercial off the shelf" components. Problems encountered include nanoscale features only a few atoms thick, plastic packaging, and conductive epoxy attachment methods. Also many instrument sensors cannot be exposed to high temperature, and high temperature can interfere with critical alignments of instruments.&lt;ref name=JPL2011/&gt;

As a result, new methods are needed to sterilize a modern spacecraft to the higher categories such as Category IVc for Mars, similar to Viking.&lt;ref name=JPL2011/&gt; Methods under evaluation, or already approved, include:

* Vapour phase [[hydrogen peroxide]] - effective, but can affect finishes, lubricants and materials that use aromatic rings and sulfur bonds. This has been established, reviewed, and a NASA/ESA specification for use of VHP has been approved by the Planetary Protection Officer, but it has not yet been formally published.&lt;ref&gt;Fei Chen, Terri Mckay, James Andy Spry, Anthony Colozza, Salvador Distefano, Robert Cataldo [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20130010386_2013009876.pdf Planetary Protection Concerns During Pre-Launch Radioisotope Power System Final Integration Activities] - includes the draft specification of VHP sterilization and details of how it would be implemented.  Proceedings of Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space 2013. Albuquerque, NM, February 25–28, 2013 Paper 6766&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethylene oxide]] - this is widely used in the medical industry, and can be used for materials not compatible with hydrogen peroxide. It is under consideration for missions such as [[ExoMars]].
* [[Gamma radiation]] and [[electron beams]] have been suggested as a method of sterilization, as they are used extensively in the medical industry. They need to be tested for compatibility with spacecraft materials and hardware geometries, and are not yet ready for review.

Some other methods are of interest as they can sterilize the spacecraft after arrival on the planet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* [[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] snow (Mars) - is most effective against traces of organic compounds rather than whole microorganisms. Has the advantage though that it eliminates the organic traces - while other methods kill the microorganisms, they leave organic traces that can confuse life detection instruments. Is under study by JPL and ESA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* Passive sterilization through [[UV radiation]] (Mars).{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Highly effective against many microorganisms, but not all, as a ''Bacillus'' strain found in spacecraft assembly facilities is particularly resistant to UV radiation. Is also complicated by possible shadowing by dust and spacecraft hardware.
* Passive sterilization through particle fluxes (Europa).{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Plans for missions to Europa take credit for reductions due to this.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Bioburden detection and assessment===

The spore count is used as an indirect measure of the number of microorganisms present. Typically 99% of microorganisms by species will be non-spore forming and able to survive in dormant states{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, and so the actual number of viable dormant microorganisms remaining on the sterilized spacecraft is expected to be many times the number of spore-forming microorganisms.

One new spore method approved is the "Rapid Spore Assay". This is based on commercial rapid assay systems, detects spores directly and not just viable microorganisms and gives results in 5 hours instead of 72 hours.&lt;ref name=JPL2011&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170808152222/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/PPCCTECHREPORT3.pdf Assessment of Planetary Protection and Contamination Control Technologies for Future Planetary Science Missions] see Section 3.1.2 Bio-burden Detection and Assessment.

Some studies suggest that the spore count method has limitations, since surfaces with the lowest or even zero spore count often have similar numbers of microorganisms than surfaces with higher spore counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3147454 | pmid=21652744 | doi=10.1128/AEM.00192-11 | volume=77 | title=Comparison of innovative molecular approaches and standard spore assays for assessment of surface cleanliness | journal=Appl Environ Microbiol | pages=5438-44 |vauthors=Cooper M, La Duc MT, Probst A, Vaishampayan P, Stam C, Benardini JN, Piceno YM, Andersen GL, Venkateswaran K | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

It is also long been recognized that spacecraft cleaning rooms harbour [[extremophile|polyextremophiles]] as the only microbes able to survive in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 14510851 | quote = Several spore-forming isolates were resistant to gamma-radiation, UV, H2O2 and desiccation, and one Acinetobacter radioresistens isolate and several Aureobasidium, isolated directly from the spacecraft, survived various conditions. | volume=5 | title=Microbial characterization of the Mars Odyssey spacecraft and its encapsulation facility | journal=Environ Microbiol | pages=977–85 |vauthors=La Duc MT, Nicholson W, Kern R, Venkateswaran K | doi=10.1046/j.1462-2920.2003.00496.x | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20446872 | quote = Extremotolerant bacteria that could potentially survive conditions experienced en route to Mars or on the planet's surface were isolated with a series of cultivation-based assays that promoted the growth of a variety of organisms, including spore formers, mesophilic heterotrophs, anaerobes, thermophiles, psychrophiles, alkaliphiles, and bacteria resistant to UVC radiation and hydrogen peroxide exposure | doi=10.1089/ast.2009.0396 | volume=10 | title=Recurrent isolation of extremotolerant bacteria from the clean room where Phoenix spacecraft components were assembled | journal=Astrobiology | pages=325–35 |vauthors=Ghosh S, Osman S, Vaishampayan P, Venkateswaran K | year=2010| bibcode=2010AsBio..10..325G | url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/85129/1/ast_2009_0396.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20131106"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-319 |title=Rare New Microbe Found in Two Distant Clean Rooms |work=[[NASA]] |first=Guy |last=Webster |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20140519" /&gt; For example, in a recent study, microbes from swabs of the ''Curiosity'' rover were subjected to desiccation, UV exposure, cold and pH extremes. Nearly 11% of the 377 strains survived more than one of these severe conditions.&lt;ref name="NAT-20140519"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madhusoodanan |first=Jyoti |title=Microbial stowaways to Mars identified |url=http://www.nature.com/news/microbial-stowaways-to-mars-identified-1.15249 |date=19 May 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15249 |accessdate=23 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not mean that these microbes have contaminated Mars. This is just the first stage of the process of bioburden reduction. To contaminate Mars they also have to survive the low temperature, vacuum, UV and ionizing radiation during the months long journey to Mars, and then have to encounter a habitat on Mars and start reproducing there. Whether this has happened or not is a matter of probability. The aim of planetary protection is to make this probability as low as possible. The currently accepted target probability of contamination per mission is to reduce it to less than 0.01%, though in the special case of Mars, scientists also rely on the hostile conditions on Mars to take the place of the final stage of heat treatment decimal reduction used for Viking. But with current technology scientists cannot reduce probabilities to zero.{{or|date=January 2018}}

===New methods===
Two recent molecular methods have been approved&lt;ref name=JPL2011/&gt; for assessment of microbial contamination on 
spacecraft surfaces.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Debus&gt;{{cite journal

* [[Adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) detection - this is a key element in cellular metabolism. This method is able to detect non cultivable organisms. It can also be triggered by non viable biological material so can give a "false positive".
* Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay - detects lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This compound is only present in Gram-negative bacteria. The standard assay analyses spores from microbes that are primarily [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]], making it difficult to relate the two methods.

==Impact prevention==

This particularly applies to orbital missions, Category III, as they are sterilized to a lower standard than missions to the surface. It is also relevant to landers, as an impact gives more opportunity for forward contamination, and impact could be on an unplanned target, such as a special region on Mars.

The requirement for an orbital mission is that it needs to remain in orbit for at least 20 years after arrival at Mars with probability of at least 99% and for 50 years with probability at least 95%. This requirement can be dropped if the mission is sterilized to Viking sterilization standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11381&amp;page=27 Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 )] Page 27 (footnote to page 26) of chapter 2 Policies and Practices in Planetary Protection&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Viking era (1970s), the requirement was given as a single figure, that any orbital mission should have a probability of less than 0.003% probability of impact during the current exploratory phase of exploration of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11381&amp;page=27 Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 )] Page 22 of chapter 2 Policies and Practices in Planetary Protection&lt;/ref&gt;

For both landers and orbiters, the technique of trajectory biasing is used during approach to the target. The spacecraft trajectory is designed so that if communications are lost, it will miss the target.

===Issues with impact prevention===

Despite these measures{{which|date=August 2014}} there has been one notable failure of impact prevention. The [[Mars Climate Orbiter]] which was sterilized only to Category III, crashed on Mars in 1999 due to a mix-up of imperial and metric units. The office of planetary protection stated that it is likely that it burnt up in the atmosphere, but if it survived to the ground, then it could cause forward contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/missions-past/climateorbiter/ Mars Climate Orbiter] page at [http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mars Observer]] is another Category III mission with potential planetary contamination. Communications were lost three days before its orbital insertion maneuver in 1993. It seems most likely it did not succeed in entering into orbit around Mars and simply continued past on a heliocentric orbit. If it did succeed in following its automatic programming, and attempted the manoeuvre, however, there is a chance it crashed on Mars.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Three landers have had hard landings on Mars.  These are ''[[Schiaparelli EDM lander]]'', the ''[[Mars Polar Lander]]'', and ''[[Deep Space 2]]''. These were all sterilized for surface missions but not for special regions (Viking pre-sterilization only). ''[[Mars Polar Lander]]'', and ''[[Deep Space 2]]'' crashed into the polar regions which are now treated as special regions because of the possibility of forming liquid brines.

==Controversies==

===Meteorite argument===

Alberto G. Fairén and Dirk Schulze-Makuch published an article in ''Nature'' recommending that planetary protection measures need to be scaled down. They gave as their main reason for this, that exchange of meteorites between Earth and Mars means that any life on Earth that could survive on Mars has already got there and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto G. Fairén &amp; Dirk Schulze-Makuch [http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n7/full/ngeo1866.html The Over Protection of Mars] Nature Geoscience 6, 510–511 (2013) {{DOI|10.1038/ngeo1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Zubrin used similar arguments in favour of his view that the back contamination risk has no scientific validity.&lt;ref name=zubrin&gt;Robert Zubrin "Contamination From Mars: No Threat", [http://www.planetary.org/explore/the-planetary-report/ The Planetary Report] July/Aug. 2000, P.4–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zubrin-interview&gt;[http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/cwc/Teaching/SpaceCol/sts497i/Zubrin/transcript.txt transcription of a tele-conference interview with Robert Zubrin] conducted on March 30, 2001 by the class members of STS497 I, "Space Colonization"; Instructor: Dr. Chris Churchill&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebuttal by NRC===

The meteorite argument was examined by the NRC in the context of back contamination. It is thought that all the [[Martian meteorites]] originate in relatively few impacts every few million years on  Mars. The impactors would be kilometers in diameter and the craters they form on Mars tens of kilometers in diameter. Models of impacts on Mars are consistent with these findings.&lt;ref name=Eugster&gt;O. Eugster, G. F. Herzog, K. Marti,
M. W. Caffee [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/MESSII/9004.pdf Irradiation Records, Cosmic-Ray Exposure Ages, and Transfer Times of Meteorites, see section 4.5 Martian Meteorites] LPI, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.E. NYQUIST1, D.D. BOGARD1, C.-Y. SHIH2, A. GRESHAKE3, D. STÖFFLER [http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~manga/nyquist.pdf AGES AND GEOLOGIC HISTORIES OF MARTIAN METEORITES] 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Irving [http://www.imca.cc/mars/martian-meteorites.htm Martian Meteorites - has graphs of ejection ages] - site maintained by Tony Irving for up to date information on Martian meteorites&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth receives a steady stream of meteorites from Mars, but they come from relatively few original impactors, and transfer was more likely in the early Solar System. Also some life forms viable on both Mars and on Earth might be unable to survive transfer on a meteorite, and there is so far no direct evidence of any transfer of life from Mars to Earth in this way.

The NRC concluded that though transfer is possible, the evidence from meteorite exchange does not eliminate the need for back contamination protection methods.&lt;ref name=nrc2009_5p48&gt;{{cite report |title=Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Mars Sample Return Missions |publisher=National Research Council |date=2009 |chapter=5: The Potential for Large-Scale Effects" |page=48 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12576&amp;page=48 |quote=''Despite suggestions to the contrary, it is simply not possible, on the basis of current knowledge, to determine whether viable martian life forms have already been delivered to the Earth. Certainly in the modern era there is no evidence for large-scale or other negative effects that are attributable to the frequent deliveries to Earth of essentially unaltered Martian rocks. However the possibility that such effects occurred in the distant past cannot be discounted. Thus it is not appropriate to argue that the existence of martian microbes on Earth negates the need to treat as potentially hazardous any samples returned from Mars via robotic spacecraft.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impacts on Earth able to send microorganisms to Mars are also infrequent. Impactors of 10&amp;nbsp;km across or larger can send debris to Mars through the Earth's atmosphere but these occur rarely, and were more common in the early Solar System.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== Proposal to end planetary protection for Mars ===

In their 2013 paper "The Over Protection of Mars", Alberto Fairén and Dirk Schulze-Makuch suggested that we{{who|date=May 2017}} no longer need to protect Mars, essentially using Zubrin's meteorite transfer argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n7/full/ngeo1866.html The overprotection of Mars]&lt;/ref&gt; This was rebutted in a follow up article "Appropriate Protection of Mars", in ''Nature'' by the current and previous planetary protection officers Catherine Conley and John Rummel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n8/full/ngeo1908.html Appropriate protection of Mars, Nature, Catherine Conley and John Rummel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=overprotection&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/the-overprotection-of-mars/#sthash.AdI6gYkT.dpuf The Overprotection of Mars?], astrobio.net, Andrew Williams - Nov 18, 2013 - summarizes both papers on the subject, with links to originals&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of Category V containment measures ===

The scientific consensus is that the potential for large-scale effects, either through pathogenesis or ecological disruption, is extremely small.&lt;ref name=nrc2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=iMars&gt;http://mepag.nasa.gov/reports/iMARS_FinalReport.pdf Preliminary Planning for an International Mars Sample Return Mission Report of the International Mars Architecture for the Return of Samples (iMARS) Working Group June 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=esf2010_PP&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - Strategic advice and requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602150139/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf |date=2016-06-02 }} July, 2012, {{ISBN|978-2-918428-67-1}} - see Back Planetary Protection section.

== Policy proposals ==
===Non-biological contamination===

A COSPAR workshop in 2010, looked at issues to do with protecting areas from non biological contamination.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, J., Race, M., and Horneck, G. eds. 2011. [http://cosparhq.cnes.fr/sites/default/files/ppp_workshop_report_ethical_considerations_princeton_final_v1a_7nov2012.pdf COSPAR Workshop on Ethical Considerations for Planetary Protection in Space Exploration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907165954/https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/sites/default/files/ppp_workshop_report_ethical_considerations_princeton_final_v1a_7nov2012.pdf |date=2017-09-07 }} COSPAR, Paris, 51 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cosparethical&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3698687 | pmid=23095097 | doi=10.1089/ast.2012.0891 | volume=12 | title=Ethical considerations for planetary protection in space exploration: a workshop | journal=Astrobiology | pages=1017–23 | last1 = Rummel | first1 = JD | last2 = Race | first2 = MS | last3 = Horneck | first3 = G| bibcode=2012AsBio..12.1017R }}&lt;/ref&gt; They recommended that COSPAR expand its remit to include such issues. Recommendations of the workshop include:

{{quotation|'''Recommendation 3''' COSPAR should add a separate and parallel policy to provide guidance on requirements/best practices for protection of non-living/nonlife-related aspects of Outer Space and celestial bodies}}

Some ideas proposed include protected special regions, or "Planetary Parks"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/19302-planetary-parks-space-wilderness-protection.html 'Planetary Parks' Could Protect Space Wilderness] by Leonard David, SPACE.com’s Space Insider Columnist, January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to keep regions of the Solar System pristine for future scientific investigation, and also for ethical reasons.

===Proposed extensions===

Astrobiologist [[Christopher McKay]] has argued that until we have better understanding of Mars, our explorations should be biologically reversible.&lt;ref name=RestorationEcology&gt;Christopher P. McKay [http://esseacourses.strategies.org/EcosynthesisMcKay2008ReviewAAAS.pdf Planetary Ecosynthesis on Mars: Restoration Ecology and Environmental Ethics] NASA Ames Research Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher P. McKay [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/718.summary Biologically Reversible Exploration] Science 6 February 2009: 
Vol. 323 no. 5915 p. 718 {{DOI|10.1126/science.1167987}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance if all the microorganisms introduced to Mars so far remain dormant within the spacecraft, they could in principle be removed in the future, leaving Mars completely free of contamination from modern Earth lifeforms.

In the 2010 workshop one of the recommendations for future consideration was to extend the period for contamination prevention to the maximum viable lifetime of dormant microorganisms introduced to the planet.

{{bq|"''''Recommendation 4.'''' COSPAR should consider that the appropriate protection of potential indigenous extraterrestrial life shall include avoiding the harmful contamination of any habitable environment —whether extant or foreseeable— within the maximum potential time of viability of any terrestrial organisms (including microbial spores) that may be introduced into that environment by human or robotic activity."&lt;ref name=cosparethical/&gt;}}

In the case of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], a similar idea has been suggested, that it is not enough to keep it free from contamination during our current exploration period. It might be that Europa is of sufficient scientific interest that the human race has a duty to keep it pristine for future generations to study as well. This was the majority view of the 2000 task force examining Europa, though there was a minority view of the same task force that such strong protection measures are not required.

{{quotation|"One consequence of this view is that Europa must be protected from contamination for an open-ended period, until it can be demonstrated that no ocean exists or that no organisms are present. Thus, we need to be concerned that over a time scale on the order of 10 million to 100 million years (an approximate age for the surface of Europa), any contaminating material is likely to be carried into the deep ice crust or into the underlying ocean."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9895&amp;page=2 Preventing the forward contamination of Europa - Executive Summary page 2] National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2018, the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] issued a ''Review and Assessment of Planetary Protection Policy Development Processes.'' In part, the report urges NASA to create a broad strategic plan that covers both forward and back contamination. The report also expresses concern about private industry missions, for which there is no governmental regulatory authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrison |first1=David |authorlink1=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |title=Fear of Aliens: How to Protect Alien Microbes [and Us] |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date=2018 |title= Review and Assessment of Planetary Protection Policy Development Processes |url=https://doi.org/10.17226/25172 |publisher=The National Academies Press |page= |docket= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protecting objects beyond the Solar System ===

The proposal by the German physicist [[Claudius Gros]], that the technology of the [[Breakthrough Starshot]] project may be utilized to establish a [[biosphere]] of [[unicellular organism]]s on otherwise only transiently [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] exoplanets,&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Gros]]: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0 ''Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project''], Astrophysics and Space Science, Vol. 361, pp 1-14 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; has sparked a discussion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/author/jessica-boddy ''Jessica Boddy'']: [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/qa-should-we-seed-life-alien-worlds ''Q&amp;A: Should we seed life on alien worlds?''], [[Science (journal)|Science]], 9.

'''Pleuston''' are the organisms that live in the thin surface layer existing at the air-water interface of a body of water as their [[habitat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pleuston|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pleuston|work=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include some [[cyanobacteria]], some [[gastropod]]s, the [[fern]]s ''[[Azolla]]'' and ''[[Salvinia]]'' and the seed plants ''[[Lemna]]'', ''[[Wolffia]]'', ''[[Pistia]]'', ''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'' and ''[[Hydrocharis]]''. Some fungi and fungi-like protists may be also found.

==Neuston==
The term ''Neuston'' is used either:
*As a synonym for Pleuston: hence, the collective term for the [[organism]]s that float on the top of water (epineuston) or live right under the surface (hyponeuston). 
*That subset of floating organisms that are microscopic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=P. S. Liss, W. George N. Slinn|title=Air-sea exchange of gases and particles|isbn=978-90-277-1610-1|pages=148|date=1983-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those that rely on [[surface tension]] to float.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James H. Thorp, Alan P. Covich|title=Ecology and classification of North American freshwater invertebrates|isbn=978-0-12-690647-9|pages=34|date=2001-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in comparison with the term '''pleuston''', which is then its superset, including those organisms that float by buoyancy or are macroscopic.
[[image:Pink-wing flying fish.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A [[flying fish]]]]
Neustons, broadly defined, are made up of some species of [[fish]] (see [[flying fish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yHTGFh1jq6AC&amp;pg=PA46|title=The Sea Surface and Global Change by P. S. Liss, Robert A. Duce|author=|date=|website=google.com|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[beetle]]s (see [[whirligig beetle]]), [[protozoans]], [[bacteria]] and [[spiders]] (see [[fishing spider]] and [[diving bell spider]]).  [[Springtail]]s in the genera ''[[Podura]]'' and ''[[Sminthurides]]'' are almost exclusively neustonic, while ''[[Hypogastrura]]'' species often aggregate on pond surfaces.  [[Water strider]]s such as ''[[Gerris]]'' are common examples of insects that supports their weight on water's [[surface tension]]. By extension, the term may also refer to non-organismal floating aggregations (see, ''e.g.'', [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]).

==Distinction versus other aquatic life==
[[Plankton]] (organisms that float or drift within the water) are distinguished from [[nekton]] (organisms that swim, powerfully, in the water), and [[benthos]] (organisms on the bottom of a body of water).

The '''political economy of communications''', news, or media, is a particular branch in [[Communication studies]] or [[media studies]] which studies the power relations ([[political economy]]) that constitute the communication of information from the [[mass media]] to its publics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media|last=Flew|first=Terry|last2=Smith|first2=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-900550-5|location=Don Mills, ON|pages=1–26, 57–75, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been developed by media and political economy scholars, such as [[Dallas Walker Smythe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Melody, B.|year=1994|title=Dallas Smythe: Pioneer in the political economy of communications|editor=T.

== Influences ==

One of the most early modern works in the political economy of communications are [[Harold Innis]]' works which were compiled in the book ''[[Empire and Communications]]''. This directly inspired [[Marshall McLuhan]], a colleague of Innis at the University of Toronto, who would later be made famous for the dictum "the medium is the message". Subsequent PEC approaches have been heavily influenced by Marxist thought and democratic politics, as it questions powers of and within communications against the realization of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Jonathan|date=2014-06-01|title=Critical political economy of communications: A mid-term review|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/mcp/2014/00000010/00000002/art00008|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|volume=10|issue=2|pages=189–202|doi=10.1386/macp.10.2.189_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] Thought- The [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] of PEC dictates it to often criticize [[capitalism]] for its effect on media and democracy, which originates from the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School|critical theory]] works of [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christan|date=2014|title=WikiLeaks and the Critique of the Political Economy|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=8|issue=1932–8036/2014FEA0002|pages=2718–2732}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common critique of critical political economy (often from the [[cultural studies]] approach) is that, like [[Marxism|Marx]], it [[Fetishism|fetishizes]] [[capitalism]] and is deterministic [[Technological determinism|technologically]] and/or [[Economic determinism|economically]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* [[Democracy|Democratic Politics]]- PEC views media and information as the ultimate democratizer of power, and thus includes social [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] as a criterion. Ultimately, this means that PEC encourages [[media reform]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and government intervention in the [[Market (economics)|marketplace.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Main Topics of Study ==

[[File:News Corp logo 2013.svg|thumb|Logo of [[News Corp]], a mass media conglomerate and a subject of concentrated ownership. ]]
* [[Concentration of media ownership|Media ownership]]- Concentration of ownership in media industries as a result of [[Technological convergence|convergence]] and [[Conglomeration|media conglomeration]] under [[neoliberal economics]] have become a concern for media [[Diversity (business)|diversity]] and [[Democracy|democratic discourse]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Support mechanisms- [[Advertising]], [[marketing]], [[Subscription business model|subscription]], [[social media]], and [[crowdfunding]] [[revenue]]s are examples of economic support for media organizations. Such mechanisms influence what types of [[Content (media)|content]] are published or not published, the nature of the [[commodity]] (content vs. [[the audience]] vs. [[advertisers]]) and are thus relevant to PEC studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* [[Government policy]]- Policy [[Media regulation|regulates]] media and its economics in terms of ownership, affecting how [[Creative industries|media industries]] operate as well as the role of media in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Journalism/News Media ==

As [[Journalism|journalism/news media]] is the core to the functioning of democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|title=Normative Theories of the Media: Journalism in Democratic Societies|last=Christians|first=Clifford G.|last2=Glasser|first2=Theodore L.|last3=McQuail|first3=Denis|last4=Nordenstreng|first4=Kaarle|last5=White|first5=Robert A.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252034237|doi=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEC works towards the goal of "healthy journalism."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|date=2012-10-01|title=Farewell to Journalism?|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|issue=5–6|pages=614–626|doi=10.1080/17512786.2012.683273|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for democracy, the current state of news media around the world and especially that of [[Media of the United States|the United States]], falls short of the general consensus (among media scholars and democratic theory) on what is considered to be healthy [[journalism]]. This is due in part to the overwhelming amount of [[public relations]] material being posed as [[News media|news]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is in the interest of PEC that journalism instead provide a "rigorous account" of those in power, meet the information needs of all classes and people, be truthful, and act as an early warning system by providing a "wide range of informed opinions on the most important issues of our time."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== New Media ==

[[Mass media|The mass media]] are undoubtedly experiencing considerable changes in platform, technology, and economic structure (e.g., [[crowdfunding]], [[social media]]) as the [[digital era]] continues to shift people toward "[[New media|new" media]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional financial configurations and business models have been destabilized by this transformation. However, new mechanisms of power have emerged from this more open system of information and news creation. The availability of information can now be skewed or influenced through "search, aggregation, and digital distribution infrastructures" (p.&amp;nbsp;493).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picard|first=Robert G.|date=2014-09-03|title=Twilight or New Dawn of Journalism?|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=15|issue=5|pages=500–510|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2014.895530|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Mosco's definition of political economic studies, where the "production, distribution, and consumption of resources, including communication resources” are essential, thus remains relevant even in times of [[new media]], since a new [[Network economy|(network) economy/society]] forms its ''own'' power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rise of the network society|last=Manuel.|first=Castells|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9780631221401|oclc=254487176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International encyclopedia of communication online|last=1949-|first=Donsbach, Wolfgang|last2=Association.|first2=International Communication|last3=(Firm)|first3=Wiley-Blackwell|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Wiley/Blackwell|isbn=9781405131995|oclc=271856987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/Syllabi/Spring%202010/COM%20330/BBarrettPoliticaleconomy.pdf|title=Approaches to Media|last=Boyd-Barrett|first=Oliver|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=186–192|chapter=The political economy approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8456">The '''Sakuma–Hattori equation''' is a mathematical model for predicting the amount of [[thermal radiation]], radiometric flux or radiometric power emitted from a perfect [[blackbody]] or received by a thermal radiation detector.

== History ==
The Sakuma–Hattori equation was first proposed by Fumihiro Sakuma, Akira Ono and Susumu Hattori in 1982.&lt;ref name=Sakuma1/&gt; In 1996 a study investigated the usefulness of various forms of the Sakuma–Hattori equation. This study showed the Planckian form to provide the best fit for most applications.&lt;ref name=Sakuma2/&gt; This study was done for 10 different forms of the Sakuma–Hattori equation containing not more than three fitting variables. In 2008, BIPM CCT-WG5 recommended its use for radiation thermometry uncertainty budgets below 960&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;

== General form ==
The Sakuma–Hattori equation gives the [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic signal]] from thermal radiation based on an object's [[temperature]]. The signal can be electromagnetic [[flux]] or signal produced by a detector measuring this radiation. It has been suggested that below the silver point{{Cref2|A}}, a method using the Sakuma–Hattori equation be used.&lt;ref name=Sakuma1&gt;F Sakuma, S Hattori, "Establishing a practical temperature standard by using a narrow-band radiation thermometer with a silicon detector", in ''Temperature: Its Measurement and Control in Science and Industry'', vol. 5, edited by J F Schooley, New York, AIP, 421–427 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; In its general form it looks like&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;J.

== Planckian form ==

=== Derivation ===

The Planckian form is realized by the following substitution:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda _x = A + \frac{B}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

Making this substitution renders the following the Sakuma–Hattori equation in the Planckian form.

|}

=== Discussion ===

The Planckian form is recommended for use in calculating uncertainty budgets for [[radiation thermometry]]&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt; and [[infrared thermometry]].&lt;ref name=MSLNZ&gt;''[http://msl.irl.cri.nz/sites/all/files/training-manuals/tg22-july-2009v2.pdf MSL Technical Guide 22 – Calibration of Low Temperature Infrared Thermometers]'' (pdf), Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also recommended for use in calibration of radiation thermometers below the silver point.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;

The Planckian form resembles [[Planck's law|Planck's Law]].

:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = \frac{c_1}{\lambda^5\left[\exp\left(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}\right)-1\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

However the Sakuma–Hattori equation becomes very useful when considering low-temperature, wide-band radiation thermometry. To use Planck's Law over a wide spectral band, an [[integral]] like the following would have to be considered:

:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = \int_{\lambda _1}^{\lambda _2}\frac{c_1}{\lambda^5\left[\exp\left(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}\right)-1\right]} d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

This integral yields an [[incomplete polylogarithm]] function, which can make its use very cumbersome.
The standard numerical treatment expands the incomplete integral in a geometric series of the exponential
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\lambda_2} \frac{c_1}{\lambda^5[\exp(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T})-1]}d\lambda
=c_1(\frac{T}{c_2})^4\int_{c_2/(\lambda_2 T)}^{\infty}
\frac{x^3}{\exp(x)-1}dx
&lt;/math&gt;
after substituting &lt;math&gt;\lambda = c_2/(xT)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\lambda = -c_2/(x^2T
)dx&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;J(c)\equiv \int_c^\infty \frac{x^3}{\exp x-1}dx
=\int_c^\infty \frac{x^3 \exp(-x)}{1-\exp(- x)}dx
=\int_c^\infty \sum_{n\ge 1}x^3 \exp(-nx)dx
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
=\sum_{n\ge 1} \exp(-nc)\frac{(nc)^3+3(nc)^2+6nc+6}{n^4}
&lt;/math&gt;
provides an approximation if the sum is truncated at some order.

The Sakuma–Hattori equation shown above was found to provide the best curve-fit for interpolation of scales for radiation thermometers among a number of alternatives investigated.&lt;ref name=Sakuma2&gt;Sakuma F, Kobayashi M., "Interpolation equations of scales of radiation thermometers", ''Proceedings of TEMPMEKO 1996'', pp. 305–310 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverse Sakuma–Hattori function can be used without iterative calculation. This is an addition advantage over integration of Planck's Law.

== Other forms ==

The 1996 paper investigated 10 different forms. They are listed in the chart below in order of quality of curve-fit to actual radiometric data.&lt;ref name=Sakuma2/&gt;

==Introduction==

The behaviour of different processes on discrete regular lattices have been studied quite extensively. They  show a rich diversity of behaviour, including a non-trivial dependence on the dimension of the regular lattice.&lt;ref name="os"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years  the study has been extended from regular lattices to [[complex network]]s. The shortcut model has been used in studying several processes and their dependence on dimension.

==Dimension of complex network==

Usually, dimension is defined based on the scaling exponent of some property in the appropriate limit. One property one could use  &lt;ref name="Shankera"/&gt;  is the scaling of volume with distance. For regular lattices &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf Z^d&lt;/math&gt; the number of nodes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle j&lt;/math&gt; within a distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; of node &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i&lt;/math&gt; scales as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r(i,j)^d&lt;/math&gt;.

For systems which arise in physical problems  one usually can identify some physical space relations among the vertices. Nodes which are linked directly will have more influence on each other than nodes which are separated by several links. Thus, one could define the distance  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; between nodes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle j&lt;/math&gt; as the length of the shortest path connecting the nodes.

For complex networks one can define the volume as the number of nodes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle j&lt;/math&gt; within a distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; of node &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i&lt;/math&gt;, averaged over &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i&lt;/math&gt;, and the dimension may be defined as the exponent which determines the scaling behaviour of the volume with distance. For a vector &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \vec{n}=(n_1,\dots, n_d)\in \mathbf Z^d&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle d&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer, the Euclidean norm &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \|\vec{n}\|&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the Euclidean distance from the origin to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \vec{n}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \|\vec{n}\|=\sqrt{n_1^2+\cdots + n_d^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

However, the definition which generalises to complex networks is the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm,

:&lt;math&gt; \|\vec{n}\|_1=\|n_1\|+\cdots +\|n_d\|. &lt;/math&gt;

The scaling properties hold for both the Euclidean norm and the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm. The scaling relation is

:&lt;math&gt; V(r) = kr^d, &lt;/math&gt;

where d is not necessarily an integer for complex networks. &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k&lt;/math&gt; is a geometric constant which depends on the complex network. If the scaling relation Eqn.  holds, then one can also define the surface area &lt;math&gt;\textstyle S(r)&lt;/math&gt; as the number of nodes which are exactly at a distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r&lt;/math&gt; from a given node, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle S(r)&lt;/math&gt; scales as

:&lt;math&gt; S(r) = kdr^{d-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

A definition based on the [[complex network zeta function]]&lt;ref name="Shankerb"/&gt; generalises the definition based on the scaling property of the volume with distance&lt;ref name="Shankera"/&gt; and puts it on a mathematically robust footing.

==Shortcut model==

The  shortcut model starts with a network built on a one-dimensional regular lattice. One then adds edges to create shortcuts that join remote parts of the lattice to one another. The starting network is a one-dimensional lattice of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N&lt;/math&gt; vertices with periodic boundary conditions. Each vertex is joined to its neighbors on either side, which results in a system  with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N&lt;/math&gt; edges. The network is extended by taking each node in turn and, with probability &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p&lt;/math&gt;, adding an edge to a new location &lt;math&gt;\textstyle m&lt;/math&gt; nodes distant.

The rewiring process allows the model to interpolate between a one-dimensional regular lattice and a two-dimensional regular lattice. When the rewiring probability &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p=0&lt;/math&gt;, we have a one-dimensional regular lattice of size &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p=1&lt;/math&gt;, every node is connected to a new location and the graph is essentially a two-dimensional lattice with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N/m&lt;/math&gt; nodes in each direction. For &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1&lt;/math&gt;, we have a graph which interpolates between the one and two dimensional regular lattices. The graphs we study are parametrized by

:&lt;math&gt; \text{size} = N,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \text{shortcut distance} = m,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \text{rewiring probability} = p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Application to extensiveness of power law potential==

One application using the above definition of dimension was to the 
extensiveness of statistical mechanics systems with a power law potential where the interaction varies with the distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1/r^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. In one dimension the system properties like the free energy do not behave extensively when &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 0\leq\alpha\leq1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., they increase faster than N as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;, where N is the number of spins in the system.

Consider the  Ising model with the Hamiltonian (with N spins)

:&lt;math&gt; H=-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}J(r(i,j))s_{i}s_{j}  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle s_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the spin variables, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between node &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i&lt;/math&gt; and node &lt;math&gt;\textstyle j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle J(r(i,j))&lt;/math&gt; are the couplings between the spins.  When the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle J(r(i,j))&lt;/math&gt; have the behaviour &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1/r^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we have the power law potential. For a general complex network the condition on the exponent &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; which preserves extensivity of the Hamiltonian was studied. At zero temperature, the energy per spin is proportional to

:&lt;math&gt; \rho=\sum_{i,j}J(r(i,j)),  &lt;/math&gt;

and hence extensivity requires that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho&lt;/math&gt; be finite.  For a general complex network &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the [[Riemann zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \zeta ( \alpha - d + 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, for the potential to be extensive, one requires

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha &gt; d.\, &lt;/math&gt;

Other processes which have been studied are self-avoiding random walks, and the scaling of the mean path length with the network size. These studies lead to the interesting result that the dimension transitions sharply as the shortcut probability increases from zero.&lt;ref name="Shankerc"&gt;

==Conclusion==

The shortcut model is useful for studying the dimension dependence of different processes. The processes studied include the behaviour of the power law potential as a function of the dimension, the behaviour of self-avoiding random walks, and the scaling of the mean path length. It may be useful to compare the shortcut model with the [[small-world network]], since the definitions have a lot of similarity. In the small-world network also one starts with a regular lattice and adds shortcuts with probability &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p&lt;/math&gt;. However, the shortcuts are not constrained to connect to a node a fixed distance ahead. Instead, the other end of the shortcut can connect to any randomly chosen node. As a result, the small world model tends to a random graph rather than a two-dimensional graph as the shortcut probability is increased.

'''Time Unit Box System''' ('''TUBS''') is a simple system for notating events that happen over a period. This system is mostly used for notating [[rhythm]]s in [[music]]. The notation consists of one or more rows of boxes; each box represents a fixed unit of time. Blank boxes indicate that nothing happens during that interval, while a mark in a box indicates that an event occurs at the start of that time interval.

TUBS is most useful for showing relationships between complex rhythms, such as [[polyrhythm]]s, that would be difficult to see in traditional [[musical notation]]. TUBS also has the advantage that non-musicians can interpret it much more easily than musical notation, because of its simplicity.

It was originally used by [[Musicology|musicologists]] Philip Harland and James Koetting to notate polyrhythms in [[African music]]. However, [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] composer Bak Yeon(박연)'s invention of similar but unrelated notation ''jeongganbo''(정간보, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060314223120/http://www.koreandb.net/KMusic/Pic/Klp011.jpg image]) to notate [[Korean court music]] dates back to middle of the 15th century.

TUBS notation has been adapted by several people; the most common adaptations use different symbols in the boxes to represent different sounds, for example different ways of hitting a drum or even different musical pitches. In fact, [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] notation is essentially TUBS rotated by 90 degrees.

== Examples ==
Below is an example in TUBS, followed by a similar representation in traditional music notation.

  \new Voice = "second"
    { \voiceTwo r8 f, r f f f16 f f f r8 }
&gt;&gt; }
&lt;/score&gt;

Below is an example of an adapted TUBS score depicting a percussion pattern for multiple instruments. One benefit with the TUBS system is that it clearly relates WHICH drum is to be struck (as the symbol will be solid, hollow, etc. uniquely for each drum) as opposed to different drums being notated via a different line of the musical staff, which can be more difficult to see. More importantly, the symbol used inside of each Time Unit Box relates how the drum is to be struck (open tone, slap, bass, rim-shot, etc.) which is not as easily conveyed with the musical staff notation.

'''Tiwanaku''' ({{lang-es|'''Tiahuanaco'''}} or {{lang|es|'''Tiahuanacu'''}}) is a [[Pre-Columbian]] archaeological site in western [[Bolivia]] near [[Lake Titicaca]] and one of the largest sites in the South America. Surface remains currently cover around 4 square kilometers and include decorated ceramics, monumental structures, and megalithic blocks. The site's population probably peaked around AD 800 with 10,000 to 20,000 people.&lt;ref name="Janusek2004b"&gt;{{cite book | title = Identity and Power in the Ancient Andes: Tiwanaku Cities through Time |last=Janusek|first= John|date=2004|isbn=978-0415946346|place=New York|publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first recorded in [[recorded history|written history]] in 1549 by Spanish conquistador [[Pedro Cieza de León]] while searching for the southern Inca capital of [[Qullasuyu]].&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{cite book | title =The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization|last=Kolata| first= Alan L.|authorlink= Alan Kolata|date =1993|isbn=978-1-55786-183-2|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have hypothesized that Tiwanaku's modern name is related to the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] term ''taypiqala'', meaning "stone in the center", alluding to the belief that it lay at the center of the world.&lt;ref name="Ancient Skies"&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: An Encyclopedic Survey of Archaeoastronomy | first1=David H.| last1=Kelley| first2=Eugene F.| last2=Milone |date=November 19, 2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-0-387-95310-6| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387953108|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name by which Tiwanaku was known to its inhabitants may have been lost as they had no written language.&lt;ref name="Frommers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes|first=Holly| url=http://www.frommers.com/store/047018986X.html |title=Frommers 500 Places to See Before They Disappear (500 Places) |publisher=[[Frommers]] |date=October 20, 2008 |pages= 266|isbn=978-0-470-18986-3 |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genographic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/pi/santos_notes.html |title=Profile: Fabricio R.

== Antiquity ==
 
The age of the site has been significantly refined over the last century. From 1910 to 1945, [[Arthur Posnansky]] maintained that the site was 11,000–17,000 years old&lt;ref name = "Posnansky 1910"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Posnansky | first1 = Arthur | year = 1910 | title = Tihuanacu e islas del Sol y de la Luna (Titicaca y Koati). | place = La Paz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Posnansky 1945"&gt;{{cite book | last = Posnansky | first = Arthur | year = 1945 | title = Tihuanacu, the Cradle of American Man | volume = I–II | others = Translated by James F. Sheaver | publisher = JJ Augustin | place = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on comparisons to geological eras and [[archaeoastronomy]]. Beginning in the 1970s, Carlos Ponce Sanginés proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 BC,&lt;ref name = "Ponce Sanginés 1971"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ponce Sanginés | first = Carlos | year = 1971 | title = Tiwanaku: Espacio, Tiempo y Cultura | place = La Paz | publisher = Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site's oldest radiocarbon date. This date is still seen in some publications and museums in Bolivia. Since the 1980s, researchers have recognized this date as unreliable, leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 BC.&lt;ref name = Browman 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Browman|first=David|year=1980|title = Tiwanaku expansion and economic patterns | journal = Estudios Arqueológicos|volume=5|pages=107-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Janusek 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Janusek|first=John|year=2003|title = Tiwanaku and Its Hinterland: Archaeological and Paleoecological Investigations of an Andean Civilization, Vol. 2: Urban and Rural Archaeology | chapter = Vessels, Time, and Society: Toward a Ceramic Chronology in the Tiwanaku Heartland | editor-last = Kolata | editor-first = Alan | place = Washington, D.C. | publisher = Smithsonian | pages = 30-89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stanish 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stanish | first = Charles | year = 2003 | title = Ancient Titicaca | place = Los Angeles | publisher = University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around AD 110 (50–170, 68% probability),&lt;ref name = "Marsh2012a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marsh | first1 = Erik | year = 2012 | title = A Bayesian Re-Assessment of the Earliest Radiocarbon Dates from Tiwanaku, Bolivia | journal = Radiocarbon | volume = 54 | pages = 203-218 | DOI = 10.2458/azu_js_rc.v54i2.15826}}&lt;/ref&gt; a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods.&lt;ref name = "Marsh2012b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marsh | first1 = Erik | year = 2012 | title = The Founding of Tiwanaku: Evidence from Kk’araña | journal = Ñawpa Pacha | volume = 32 | pages = 169-188 | DOI = 10.1179/naw.2012.32.2.69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structures ==

The structures that have been excavated by researchers at Tiwanaku include the Akapana, Akapana East, and [[Pumapunku]] stepped platforms, the [[Kalasasaya]], the Kheri Kala, and Putuni enclosures, and the Semi-Subterranean Temple. These may be visited by the public.

The Akapana is an approximately cross-shaped pyramidal structure that is 257 m wide, 197 m broad at its maximum, and 16.5 m tall. At its center appears to have been a sunken court. This was nearly destroyed by a deep [[Looting|looters]] excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side. Material from the looters excavation was dumped off the eastern side of the Akapana. A staircase with sculptures is present on its western side. Possible residential complexes might have occupied both the northeast and southeast corners of this structure.

Originally, the Akapana was thought to have been developed from a modified hill. Twenty-first-century studies have shown that it is an entirely manmade earthen [[mound]], faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks. The dirt comprising Akapana appears to have been excavated from the "moat" that surrounds the site.&lt;ref name="Isbell2004a"/&gt; The largest stone block within the Akapana, made of [[andesite]], is estimated to weigh 65.70 metric tons.&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt; The structure was possibly for the [[shaman]]-[[Pumapunku|puma]] relationship or transformation through shape shifting. Tenon puma and human heads stud the upper terraces&lt;!-- literally? bones? --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Isbell2004a"/&gt;

[[File:Lombards Museum 134.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Snuff tablet ("rapero"), ''Lombards Museum'']]

The Akapana East was built on the eastern side of early Tiwanaku. Later it was considered a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area. It was made of a thick, prepared floor of sand and clay, which supported a group of buildings. Yellow and red clay were used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes. It was swept clean of all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.&lt;ref name="Isbell2004a"&gt;Isbell, W. H., 2004, ''Palaces and Politics in the Andean Middle Horizon.'' in S. T. Evans and J. Pillsbury, eds., pp. 191-246. [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/EVAPAL.html?show=contents ''Palaces of the Ancient New World''], Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pumapunku is a man-made platform built on an east–west axis like the Akapana. It is a rectangular, terraced earthen mound faced with megalithic blocks. It is 167.36 m wide along its north–south axis and 116.7 m broad along its east–west axis, and is 5 m tall. Identical 20-meter-wide projections extend 27.6 meters north and south from the northeast and southeast corners of the Pumapunku. Walled and unwalled courts and an esplanade are associated with this structure.

A prominent feature of the Pumapunku is a large stone terrace; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks. It is called the "Plataforma Lítica". The Plataforma Lítica contains the largest stone block found in the Tiwanaku site.&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"&gt;Ponce Sanginés, C. and G. M. Terrazas, 1970, ''Acerca De La Procedencia Del Material Lítico De Los Monumentos De Tiwanaku.'' Publication no. 21. ''Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"&gt;Vranich, A., 1999, [http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI9926211/ ''Interpreting the Meaning of Ritual Spaces: The Temple Complex of Pumapunku, Tiwanaku, Bolivia''], Doctoral Dissertation, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ponce Sangines, the block is estimated to weigh 131 metric tons.&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt; The second-largest stone block found within the Pumapunku is estimated to be 85 metric tons.&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"/&gt;

[[File:TiahuanacoGateEGSquier1877.jpg|thumb|right|"[[Gateway of the Sun]]", Tiwanaku, drawn by [[Ephraim Squier]] in 1877. The scale is exaggerated in this drawing.]]

The Kalasasaya is a large courtyard more than 300 feet long, outlined by a high gateway. It is located to the north of the Akapana and west of the Semi-Subterranean Temple. Within the courtyard is where explorers found the Gateway of the Sun. Since the late 20th century, researchers have theorized that this was not the gateway's original location.

Near the courtyard is the Semi-Subterranean Temple; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north–south rather than east–west axis.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, Paul 1993"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tiwanaku Temples and State Expansion: A Tiwanaku Sunken-Court Temple in Moquegua, Peru |author=Goldstein, Paul |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls are covered with tenon heads of many different styles, suggesting that the structure was reused for different purposes over time.&lt;ref name="Brownman1981a"/&gt; It was built with walls of sandstone pillars and smaller blocks of Ashlar masonry.&lt;ref name="Brownman1981a"&gt;Browman, D. L., 1981, "New light on Andean Tiwanaku," ''New Scientist'' vol. 69, no. 4, pp. 408-419.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Michael, Dean Snow, and Elizabeth Benson, 1986, ''Atlas of Ancient America'' p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The largest stone block in the Kalasasaya is estimated to weigh 26.95 metric tons.&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt;

Within many of the site's structures are impressive gateways; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds, platforms, or sunken courts. Many gateways show iconography of the [[Staff God]]. This iconography also is used on some oversized vessels, indicating an importance to the culture. This iconography is most present on the Gateway of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Helaine ''Andean Archaeology'' Volume 2. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gateway of the Sun and others located at Pumapunku are not complete. They are missing part of a typical recessed frame known as a [[chambranle]], which typically have sockets for clamps to support later additions. These architectural examples, as well as the recently discovered Akapana Gate, have a unique detail and demonstrate high skill in stone-cutting. This reveals a knowledge of [[descriptive geometry]]. The regularity of elements suggest they are part of a system of proportions.

[[File:Puerta de la Luna - Tiahuanaco (Bolivia).jpg|thumb|Gate of the Moon.]]

Many theories for the skill of Tiwanaku's architectural construction have been proposed. One is that they used a ''luk’a,'' which is a standard measurement of about sixty centimeters. Another argument is for the Pythagorean Ratio. This idea calls for right triangles at a ratio of five to four to three used in the gateways to measure all parts. Lastly Protzen and Nair argue that Tiwanaku had a system set for individual elements dependent on context and composition. This is shown in the construction of similar gateways ranging from diminutive to monumental size, proving that scaling factors did not affect proportion. With each added element, the individual pieces were shifted to fit together.&lt;ref name="ProtzenOther2000"&gt;Protzen, J.-P., and S. E. Nair, 2000, "On Reconstructing Tiwanaku Architecture": ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol. 59, no., 3, pp. 358-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the population grew, occupational niches developed, and people began to specialize in certain skills. There was an increase in artisans, who worked in pottery, jewelry and textiles. Like the later Inca, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E. (2004), "The Archaeology of Ancient Economies," ''Annu. Rev. Anthrop.'' 33: 73-102.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the elites of the empire controlled essentially all economic output, but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, pastoralists, etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by hierarchical stratification within the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, Paul G. ''Lost Cities''. New York: Welcome Rain, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elites of Tiwanaku lived inside four walls that were surrounded by a moat. This moat, some believe, was to create the image of a sacred island. Inside the walls were many images devoted to human origin, which only the elites would see. Commoners may have entered this structure only for ceremonial purposes, since it was home to the holiest of shrines.&lt;ref name="Kolata"/&gt;

== Archaeology ==
As the site has suffered from looting and amateur excavations since shortly after Tiwanaku's fall, archeologists must attempt to interpret it with the understanding that materials have been jumbled and destroyed. This destruction continued during the Spanish conquest and colonial period, and during 19th century and the early 20th century. Other damage was committed by people quarrying stone for building and railroad construction, and target practice by military personnel.

No standing buildings have survived at the modern site. Only public, non-domestic foundations remain, with poorly reconstructed walls. The ashlar blocks used in many of these structures were mass-produced in similar styles so that they could possibly be used for multiple purposes. Throughout the period of the site, certain buildings changed purposes, causing a mix of artifacts found today.&lt;ref name="ProtzenOther2000" /&gt;

Detailed study of Tiwanaku began on a small scale in the mid-nineteenth century. In the 1860s, [[Ephraim George Squier]] visited the ruins and later published maps and sketches completed during his visit. German geologist [[Alphons Stübel]] spent nine days in Tiwanaku in 1876, creating a map of the site based on careful measurements. He also made sketches and created paper impressions of carvings and other architectural features. A book containing major photographic documentation was published in 1892 by engineer [[B. von Grumbkow]]. With commentary by archaeologist [[Max Uhle]], this was the first in-depth scientific account of the ruins.

=== Contemporary excavation and restoration ===
[[Image:Kalasasaya3.jpg|thumb|Walls around the temple Kalasasaya]]

In the 1960s, the Bolivian government initiated an effort to restore the site and reconstruct part of it. The walls of the Kalasasaya are almost all reconstructed. The original stones making up the Kalasasaya would have resembled a more "Stonehenge"-like style, spaced evenly apart and standing straight up. The reconstruction was not sufficiently based on research; for instance, a new wall was built around Kalasasaya. The reconstruction does not have as high quality of stonework as was present in Tiwanaku.&lt;ref name = "Brownman1981a" /&gt; As noted, the Gateway of the Sun, now in the Kalasasaya, was moved from its original location.&lt;ref name = "Kolata" /&gt;

Modern, academically sound archaeological excavations were performed from 1978 through the 1990s by [[University of Chicago]] [[anthropologist]] Alan Kolata and his Bolivian counterpart, Oswaldo Rivera. Among their contributions are the rediscovery of the [[suka kollus]], accurate dating of the civilization's growth and influence, and evidence for a drought-based collapse of the Tiwanaku civilization.

Archaeologists such as Paul Goldstein have argued that the [[Tiwanaku empire]] ranged outside of the altiplano area and into the [[Moquegua]] Valley in Peru. Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, Paul 1993"/&gt; Evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artificial Cranial Deformation at the Omo M10 Site: A Tiwanaku Complex from the Moquegua Valley, Peru | last =Hoshower | first = Lisa M. |year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tiwanaku robot 20060613 0470.jpg|thumb|left|Robotic exploration of a newly discovered tunnel in the Akapana pyramid, June 13, 2006]]

Today Tiwanaku has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], administered by the Bolivian government.

Recently, the Department of Archaeology of Bolivia (DINAR, directed by Javier Escalante) has been conducting excavations on the Akapana pyramid. The Proyecto Arqueologico Pumapunku-Akapana (Pumapunku-Akapana Archaeological Project, PAPA) run by the [[University of Pennsylvania]], has been excavating in the area surrounding the pyramid for the past few years, and also conducting [[Ground Penetrating Radar]] surveys of the area.

In former years, an archaeological field school offered through [[Harvard]]'s Summer School Program, conducted in the residential area outside the monumental core, has provoked controversy amongst local archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lémuz | first = C | year = 2007 | contribution-url = http://arqueobolivia.blogspot.com/2007/02/buenos-negocios-buena-arqueologia.html | contribution = Buenos Negocios, ¿Buena Arqueologia? | language = es | url = http://arqueobolivia.blogspot.com/ | title = Crítica Arqueológica Boliviana |trans-title=Bolivian archæological critic | type = [[World Wide Web]] log}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was directed by Dr. [[Gary Urton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2005 | contribution-url = http://www.summer.harvard.edu/2005/programs/bolivia/ | contribution = Program in Tiwanaku, Bolivia | url = http://www.summer.harvard.edu/2005/ | title = Summer School Archives | publisher = Harvard University | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120805220852/http://www.summer.harvard.edu/2005/ | archivedate = 2012-08-05 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of Harvard, who was an expert on [[quipu]]s, and Dr. [[Alexei Vranich]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The controversy was over allowing a team of untrained students to work on the site, even under professional supervision. It was so important that only certified professional archaeologists with documented funding were allowed access. The controversy was charged with nationalistic and political undertones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kojan | first1 = David | first2 = Dante | last2 = Angelo | title = Dominant narratives, social violence and the practice of Bolivian archaeology | journal = Journal of Social Archaeology | volume = 5 | number = 3 | pages = 383–408 | doi=10.1177/1469605305057585}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard field school lasted for three years, beginning in 2004 and ending in 2007. The project was not renewed in subsequent years, nor was permission sought to do so.

In 2009 state-sponsored restoration work on the [[Akapana pyramid]] was halted due to a complaint from [[UNESCO]]. The restoration had consisted of facing the pyramid with [[adobe]], although researchers had not established this as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=Makeover may lose Bolivian pyramid its world heritage site listing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/20/tiwanaku-pyramid-renovations|newspaper = The Guardian|date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pyramid may lose World Heritage status after renovation fiasco|url= http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/pyramid-may-lose-world-heritage-status-after-renovation-fiasco-20091020-h5v0.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11048">Various governmental agencies involved with [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|environmental protection]] and with [[occupational safety and health]] have promulgated regulations limiting the allowable [[concentration]]s of gaseous [[pollutant]]s in the ambient air or in emissions to the ambient air. Such regulations involve a number of different expressions of concentration.  Some express the concentrations as [[Parts per notation|ppmv]] and some express the concentrations as mg/m³, while others require adjusting or correcting the concentrations to reference conditions of moisture content, oxygen content or carbon dioxide content. This article presents a set of '''useful conversions and formulas for [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air dispersion modeling]]''' of atmospheric pollutants and for complying with the various regulations as to how to express the concentrations obtained by such modeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.air-dispersion.com/formulas.html Air Dispersion Modeling Conversions and Formulas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Converting air pollutant concentrations==

The conversion equations depend on the temperature at which the conversion is wanted (usually about 20 to 25 [[degrees Celsius]]).  At an ambient air pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] (101.325 [[kilopascal|kPa]]), the general equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ppmv} = \mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{m}^3\cdot \frac{(0.08205\cdot T)}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

and for the reverse conversion:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{m}^3 = \mathrm{ppmv}\cdot \frac{M}{(0.08205\cdot T)}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|align=right| ppmv
|align=left|= air pollutant concentration, in [[parts per notation|parts per million]] by volume
|-

|align=left|= milligrams of pollutant per cubic meter of air&lt;br&gt;

|-
|align=right| &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; 
|align=left|= [[molecular weight]] of the air pollutant (dimensionless)
|}

Notes:
* Pollution regulations in the United States typically [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|reference]] their pollutant limits to an ambient temperature of 20 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C as noted above. In most other nations, the reference ambient temperature for pollutant limits may be 0&amp;nbsp;°C or other values.
* 1 percent by volume = 10,000 ppmv (i.e., parts per million by volume).
* atm = absolute atmospheric pressure in atmospheres
* mol = [[mole (unit)|gram mole]]

==Correcting concentrations for altitude==

Atmospheric pollutant concentrations expressed as mass per unit volume of atmospheric air (e.g., mg/m³, µg/m³, etc.) at sea level will decrease with increasing [[altitude]] because the atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude.

The change of [[atmospheric pressure]] with altitude can be obtained from this equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005| isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_a=0.9877^a&lt;/math&gt;

Given an atmospheric pollutant concentration at an atmospheric pressure of 1 atmosphere (i.e., at sea level altitude), the concentration at other altitudes can be obtained from this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C_a = C\cdot 0.9877^a&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= altitude, in hundreds of meters
|-
!align=right| &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= atmospheric pressure at altitude ''&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'', in atmospheres
|-
!align=right| &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; 
|align=left|= Concentration at sea level altitude, in mass per unit volume
|-
!align=right| &lt;math&gt;C_a&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= Concentration at altitude &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, in mass per unit volume
|}

As an example, given a concentration of 260&amp;nbsp;mg/m³ at sea level, calculate the equivalent concentration at an altitude of 1,800 meters:

''C''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = 260 × 0.9877&lt;sup&gt; 18&lt;/sup&gt; = 208&amp;nbsp;mg/m³ at 1,800 meters altitude

==Standard conditions for gas volumes==

A [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal cubic meter]] (Nm³ ) is the metric expression of gas volume at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]] and it is usually (''but not always'') defined as being measured at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] of pressure.

A [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard cubic foot]] (scf) is the USA expression of gas volume at standard conditions and it is often (''but not always'') defined as being measured at 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere of pressure. There are other definitions of standard gas conditions used in the USA besides 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere.

That being understood:

'''1 Nm³ of any gas (measured at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure) equals 37.326 scf of that gas (measured at 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure).'''

'''1 kmol of any ideal gas equals 22.414 Nm³ of that gas at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure ... and 1 lbmol of any ideal gas equals 379.482 scf of that gas at 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure.'''

Notes:
* kmol = [[mole (unit)|kilomole or kilogram mole]]
* lbmol = [[mole (unit)|pound mole]]

==Windspeed conversion factors==

Meteorological data includes windspeeds which may be expressed as [[mile|statute miles]] per hour, [[knot (unit)|knots]], or meters per second. Here are the conversion factors for those various expressions of windspeed:

'''1&amp;nbsp;m/s = 2.237 statute mile/h = 1.944 knots'''&lt;br&gt;
'''1 knot = 1.151 statute mile/h = 0.514&amp;nbsp;m/s'''&lt;br&gt;
'''1 statute mile/h = 0.869 knots = 0.447&amp;nbsp;m/s'''

Note:
* 1 statute mile = 5,280 feet = 1,609 meters

==Correcting for reference conditions==

Many environmental protection agencies have issued regulations that limit the concentration of pollutants in gaseous [[Emission standards|emissions]] and define the reference conditions applicable to those concentration limits.  For example, such a regulation might limit the concentration of [[Nitrogen oxide|NOx]] to 55 ppmv in a dry combustion exhaust gas corrected to 3 volume percent [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].  As another example, a regulation might limit the concentration of [[Particulate|particulate matter]] to 0.1 [[Grain (measure)|grain]] per standard cubic foot (i.e., scf) of dry exhaust gas corrected to 12 volume percent [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Environmental agencies in the USA often denote a [[standard cubic foot]] of dry gas as "dscf" or as "scfd".  Likewise, a [[standard cubic meter]] of dry gas is often denoted as "dscm" or "scmd" (again, by environmental agencies in the USA).

===Correcting to a dry basis===

If a gaseous emission sample is analyzed and found to contain water vapor and a pollutant concentration of say 40 ppmv, then 40 ppmv should be designated as the "wet basis" pollutant concentration.  The following equation can be used to correct the measured "wet basis" concentration to a "[[dry basis]]" concentration:&lt;ref&gt;40 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Part 60, Appendix A-3, Test Method 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dry\;basis\;concentration = (wet\;basis\;concentration)/(1-w)&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|''&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= fraction of the emitted exhaust gas, by volume, which is water vapor
|}

Thus, a wet basis concentration of 40 ppmv in a gas having 10 volume percent water vapor would have a dry basis concentration = 40 ÷ ( 1 - 0.10 ) = 44.44 ppmv.

===Correcting to a reference oxygen content===

The following equation can be used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in an emitted gas (containing a measured O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content) to an equivalent pollutant concentration in an emitted gas containing a specified reference amount of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;40 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_r = C_m\cdot\frac{(20.9-r)}{(20.9-m)}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_r&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= corrected concentration in a dry gas having a specified reference volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= measured concentration in a dry gas having a measured volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Thus, a measured NOx concentration of 45 ppmv (dry basis) in a gas having 5 volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is&lt;br&gt;
45 × ( 20.9 - 3 ) ÷ ( 20.9 - 5 ) = 50.7 ppmv (dry basis) of NOx when corrected to a gas having a specified reference O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of 3 volume %.

===Correcting to a reference carbon dioxide content===

The following equation can be used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in an emitted gas (containing a measured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content) to an equivalent pollutant concentration in an emitted gas containing a specified reference amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;40 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Part 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_r = C_m\cdot\frac {r}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_r&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= corrected concentration in a dry gas having a specified reference volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= measured concentration in a dry gas having a measured volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
|}
 
Thus, a measured particulates concentration of 0.1 grain per dscf in a gas that has 8 volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is&lt;br&gt;
0.1 × ( 12 ÷ 8 ) = 0.15 grain per dscf when corrected to a gas having a specified reference CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of 12 volume %.

Notes:
* Although ppmv and grains per dscf have been used in the above examples, concentrations such as ppbv (i.e., parts per billion by volume), volume percent, grams per dscm and many others may also be used.
* 1 percent by volume = 10,000 ppmv (i.e., parts per million by volume).
* Care must be taken with the concentrations expressed as ppbv to differentiate between the British billion which is 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and the USA billion which is 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4193">In [[computational complexity theory]], '''Yao's principle''' or '''Yao's minimax principle''' states that the [[expected value|expected]] cost of a [[randomized algorithm]] on the [[worst case]] input, is no better than the expected cost, for a worst-case [[probability distribution]] on the inputs, of the [[deterministic algorithm]] that performs best against that distribution. Thus, to establish a lower bound on the performance of randomized algorithms, it suffices to find an appropriate distribution of difficult inputs, and to prove that no deterministic algorithm can perform well against that distribution. This principle is named after [[Andrew Yao]], who first proposed it.

Yao's principle may be interpreted in [[game theory|game theoretic]] terms, via a two-player [[zero sum game]] in which one player, [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], selects a deterministic algorithm, the other player, Bob, selects an input, and the payoff is the cost of the selected algorithm on the selected input. Any randomized algorithm ''R'' may be interpreted as a randomized choice among deterministic algorithms, and thus as a strategy for Alice. By [[John von Neumann|von Neumann's]] [[minimax theorem]], Bob has a randomized strategy that performs at least as well against ''R'' as it does against the best pure strategy Alice might choose; that is, Bob's strategy defines a distribution on the inputs such that the expected cost of ''R'' on that distribution (and therefore also the worst case expected cost of ''R'') is no better than the expected cost of any single deterministic algorithm against the same distribution.

==Statement==
Let us state the principle for [[Las_Vegas_algorithm|Las Vegas]] randomized algorithms, i.e., distributions over deterministic algorithms that are correct on every input but have varying costs.  It is straightforward to adapt the principle to [[Monte_Carlo_algorithm|Monte Carlo]] algorithms, i.e., distributions over deterministic algorithms that have bounded costs but can be incorrect on some inputs. 

Consider a problem over the inputs &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all possible deterministic algorithms that correctly solve the problem.
For any algorithm &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and input &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;c(a, x) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; be the cost of algorithm &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; run on input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a probability distribution over the algorithms &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; denote a random algorithm chosen according to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be a probability distribution over the inputs &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote a random input chosen according to &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.  Then,

: &lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in \mathcal{X}}{\max}\ \mathbf{E}[c(A,x)] \geq \underset{a \in \mathcal{A}}{\min}\ \mathbf{E}[c(a,X)] &lt;/math&gt; ,

i.e., the worst-case expected cost of the randomized algorithm is at least the cost of the best deterministic algorithm against input distribution &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof==
Let &lt;math&gt;C = \underset{x\in \mathcal{X}}{\max}\ \mathbf{E}[c(A,x)]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D = \underset{a\in \mathcal{A}}{\min}\ \mathbf{E}[c(a,X)]&lt;/math&gt;.  We have &lt;math&gt;C = \sum_x q_x C \geq \sum_x q_x \mathbf{E}[c(A,x)] = \sum_x q_x \sum_a p_a c(a,x) = \sum_a p_a \sum_x q_x c(a,x) = \sum_a p_a \mathbf{E}[c(a,X)] \geq \sum_a p_a D = D.&lt;/math&gt;

As mentioned above, this theorem can also be seen as a very special case of the [[Minimax theorem]].
