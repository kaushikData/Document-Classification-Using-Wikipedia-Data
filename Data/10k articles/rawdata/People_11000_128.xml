'''Adlan Khasanov''' (May 25, 1970 – May 9, 2004) was a [[Chechnya|Chechen]], [[Russia]]n [[journalist]] and [[photographer]], killed in action in [[Grozny]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050802103135/http://www.nppa.org/news_and_events/news/2004/05/reuters_photojournalist_killed.html Reuters Photojournalist Adlan Khasanov Killed With President in Chechen Bomb Blast]&lt;/ref&gt;

Khasanov studied journalism at the [[Chechen State University]], and later worked in newspapers as a reporter and photographer. He also worked for [[Reuters]] and [[RFE/RL|Radio Liberty]].

He was killed during a 9 May [[Victory Day]] [[parade]] at the "Dynamo" stadium in Grozny, in a bomb blast carried out by Chechen separatists in an attempt to eliminate Kremlin-backed Chechen President [[Akhmad Kadyrov]]. The stadium had undergone remodeling and reconstruction, and, according to reports, a bomb placed inside a concrete part of the structure escaped [[Explosive detection|security detection]] sweeps.

[[File:Alan with hat 2.jpg|thumb|Alan Reed]]

'''Alan Reed''' (born 1961 in [[Corbridge]], [[Northumberland]], [[England]]) is a UK [[watercolour]] artist. He began painting at an early age, winning a prize at the age of 10 for his painting of 'Bamburgh Castle at sunset'. He had his first exhibition at the age of 18, at the local library in his home town, Ponteland, and has been taking commissions ever since. His watercolour paintings have been exhibited worldwide in the UK, Italy, the US and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newartcollectors.com/artist_portfolio.asp?Artist=Alan%20Reed&amp;Portfolio=1369#biog.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He trained as an illustrator/graphic designer at Newcastle upon Tyne College of Art and Technology from 1978 to 1982.  Although his course did not touch on watercolour in the first year as he was being trained in other mediums including [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]] and [[gouache]], he practised using watercolours in his spare time. Early influences were established international artists including the American, [[Winslow Homer]], who had lived at [[Cullercoats]] in the North east of England, not far from where Alan lives now.  He also admired the work of [[Rowland Hilder]], who he described as a master of [[cityscapes]], [[John Singer Sargent]] and [[Sir William Russell Flint]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ne4me.co.uk/culture-4/watercolour-artist-paints-29.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

He left college with an HND in Applied Design and became self-employed in 1984 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.axisweb.org/seCVPG.aspx?ArtistID=3233.&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Enterprise Allowance Scheme]].  He also commenced a series of lecturing jobs at Newcastle College of Art and Technology, South Tyneside College, Derwentside College and Cleveland College of Art, covering a 20-year timescale. He opened his own Gallery of Fine Art in Eldon Garden, Newcastle in 1998 to 2002 and then went on to open his own studio in Ponteland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/news-archive/2006/07/20/artist-s-brush-with-hospital-72703-17418438/.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been a member of the [[Fine Art Trade Guild]] for over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fineart.co.uk/Directory/Detail.aspx?DirectoryUid=ed6a18dc-f30b-4fa8-8a8f-8c52a46e9856.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grey Street, Saturday Morning.jpg|thumb|Grey Street, Saturday Morning, Newcastle]]

==The UK==
Reed's work often includes street scenes. [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.journallive.co.uk/culture-newcastle/theatre-in-newcastle/2001/11/30/millennium-bridge-is-a-blinking-best-seller-61634-11454636/.&lt;/ref&gt; is a source of inspiration and the city's football fans heading for St James Park football ground have been one of many local subjects.  Scenes of [[Durham, England|Durham]] city, [[Northumberland]] castles and [[Norfolk]] are also amongst his extensive portfolio amassed over three decades of painting.  He also has an array of images of [[Scotland]], in particular [[Edinburgh]] and the east coastline and has exhibited on a regular basis in Scotland.  For three successive years (1992,1993 and 1994) his work was shortlisted for the [[Sunday Times]] Watercolour Competition.  In September 2010 Alan was 1st runner up in "The Bath Prize" with his original painting of "[[The Royal Crescent]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]".  His painting "The [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] by Torchlight" was also highly commended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journallive.co.uk/northumberland-sites/ponteland-northumberland/ponteland-news/2010/09/14/ponteland-painter-alan-reed-in-running-for-national-prize-61634-27264126/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/Adrian-scoops-163-5-000-prize-prestigious-art-contest/story-11349589-detail/story.html.&lt;/ref&gt; He has had a number of solo exhibitions since 1981 including those at the [[Mall Galleries]] in [[London]] and has been a regular exhibitor of rowing scenes in the Stewards' enclosure at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] along with exhibitions in his native Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morpethherald.co.uk/lifestyle/artist_alan_has_his_own_independence_day_1_3509164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Val d'Orcia.jpg|thumb|left|Val d'Orcia, Italy]]

==Italy==
In 1991 Alan was introduced to Italy by Susan; the holiday was to have a lasting effect on him.  Impressed by the landscape, Alan subsequently travelled to various regions throughout the country from the [[Veneto]] to [[Piedmont]], [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]], the [[Amalfi Coast]] and [[Abruzzo]]. He has completed several commissions to paint famous towns and cities including [[San Gimignano]], [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].  In 2005 he held an exhibition of his work entitled "The Light" in [[Marostica]], which was featured on Italian television and local press.

[[File:Barka, Oman.jpg|thumb|Barka, Oman]]

==Middle East==
Also in 2005 Reed was commissioned to paint two watercolours for a client in Oman.  This became the catalyst for regular painting trips to [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|The Gulf]], including [[Dubai]] and [[Kuwait]] as well as [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest-business-news/2011/08/03/north-east-firms-looking-east-in-search-of-new-markets-51140-29163925/.&lt;/ref&gt; common feature of his work in this region has been the [[dhows]] at rest in calm harbour waters, the distinctive [[Arabic]] architecture and the activity in the life of the Souks.  Alan has enjoyed an ongoing relationship with the Bait Muzna Gallery in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] since 2007.  He had a joint exhibition with landscape photographer Malcolm MacGregor titled "Mystical Oman" in April 2010 opened by his Highness Sayyid Tarik Al Said.&lt;ref&gt;http://main.omanobserver.om/node/5240.&lt;/ref&gt; sketch book studies of Oman have attracted significant interest and have been printed as a handmade leather bound limited edition reproduction sketch book featuring watercolours to celebrate Oman's 40th Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;http://main.omanobserver.om/search/node/paintings+of+Oman+for+queen+elizabeth&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Alan was born in [[Corbridge]], Northumberland, England, eldest son of Kenneth and Gillian Reed. Kenneth Reed is also an artist, specialising in paintings of [[golf]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axisweb.org/seEventDetails.aspx?EventID=360242&amp;TYPE=0.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan's grandfather, Thomas Reed also painted and his great grandfather carved ship figureheads.  Alan now lives in [[Ponteland]], Northumberland where his gallery and studio are based within his own home.  He married his wife Susan in 1993 and they have two children and three grandchildren. They both share strong family ethics and a [[Christian]] faith along with a unique bond following an operation on 27 June 2001 at Newcastle's [[Freeman Hospital]].  Susan needed a [[kidney transplant]] and although her mother was tested she was not compatible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2001/05/12/gift-husband-can-save-desperately-ill-wife-72703-11051565/.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan's kidneys were and he donated one of his own to Susan.&lt;ref&gt;Newcastle Evening Chronicle Saturday May 12, 2001 "A Gift of Life" Front Page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Journal, Newcastle Saturday December 22, 2001, pages 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; story was featured on BBC 1's Songs of Praise on Sunday 5 November 2006.

==Further reading==
Alan's approach to painting is described in a book entitled "[[Landscapes]] in Watercolour" by Theodora Philcox, a lecturer in art at Warwickshire. The book featured the work of 23 leading watercolourists from around the world.

==Early life==
Ashraf Pahlavi was born in [[Tehran]] on 26 October 1919, five hours after her brother Mohammad Reza. Her parents were [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]], a military commander, who would become the Shah of Persia, and [[Tadj ol-Molouk]], the second of his four wives.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; She had 10 siblings and half-siblings.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In the early 1930s, Ashraf Pahlavi, her older sister [[Shams Pahlavi|Shams]], and their mother were among the first significant Iranian women to cease wearing [[Hijab|the traditional veil]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Ashraf Pahlavi [[Iranian gender restrictions in education|was not permitted to attend university]] and instead was married in 1937, at the age of 18, to Mirza Khan Ghavam, whose family was politically allied with her father.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Young Ashraf Pahlavi.jpg|thumb|A young Ashraf Pahlavi]]

===Involvement in 1953 coup against Mossadegh===
{{Main|1953 Iranian coup d'état}}
In 1953, Ashraf Pahlavi played an important role in [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Operation Ajax]] as the one who changed Mohammad Reza Shah's mind in giving consent to the [[CIA]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] to start the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shah of Iran's twin sister dead at 96|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ashraf-pahlavi-obit-1.3394866|work=CBC|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah had originally opposed the operation and for a while resisted accepting it. In early 1953, she met with CIA agents who asked her to talk to her brother since she was the only one who was able to influence him. As historian [[Stephen Kinzer]]'s book ''All the Shah's Men'' recounts, "Ashraf was enjoying life in French casinos and nightclubs when one of [[Kermit Roosevelt Jr.|[Kermit] Roosevelt]]'s best Iranian agents, [[Assadollah Rashidian]], paid her a call. He found her reluctant, so the next day a delegation of American and British agents came to pose the invitation in stronger terms. The leader of the delegation, a senior British operative named Norman Darbyshire, had the foresight to bring a mink coat and a packet of cash. When Ashraf saw these emoluments, Darbyshire later recalled, "her eyes lit up and her resistance crumbled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinzer|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By her own account, Pahlavi was offered a blank check if she agreed to return to Iran from her enforced exile in France, but refused the money and returned of her own accord.&lt;ref&gt;'{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians argue that the coup would have occurred with or without Ashraf Pahlavi's persuasion of her brother. In an ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' article, writer Mark Gasiorowski states that the Shah "was not consulted about the decision to undertake the coup, about its manner of execution, or about the candidate chosen to replace [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mossadegh]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gasiorowski|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the coup was instead largely executed by the United States and others looking to undermine Mossadegh's leadership.

===Political activities===
[[File:Ashraf-meeting.png|thumb|left|Ashraf Pahlavi heading a meeting]]
Ashraf Pahlavi was a strong supporter of [[women's rights in Iran]] and the world during her brother's reign. In 1967, Pahlavi worked with the [[United Nations]] as the Iranian delegate to [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|the Commission on Human Rights]] as well as [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|the Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kathleen Teltsch|work=The New York Times|title=She may be a Princess, but Shah's Twin is more Interested in Equal Rights|date=22 March 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, she was heavily involved with the [[International Women's Year]], and addressed the United Nations.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Though an instrumental force in legitimizing gender reforms, her philosophy on gender was not particularly introspective: "I confess that even though since childhood I had paid a price for being a woman, in terms of education and personal freedom, I had not given much thought to specific ways in which women in general were more oppressed than men."&lt;ref name="Memoirs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pahlavi|first=Ashraf |title=Faces in a Mirror: Memoirs from Exile |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |oclc=643157789 |ISBN=9780132991315 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1980|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; By her own account, she was a strong supporter of the rights of women to basic life necessities such as "food, education, and health"&lt;ref name="passeth"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pahlavi |first=Ashraf |title=And Thus Passeth International Women's Year|work=The New York Times |date=5 January 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was not a radical reformist. She cited "chronic apathy"&lt;ref name="passeth"/&gt; from many governments as the underlying issue that prevented women's rights reforms from being implemented around the world.

Ashraf Pahlavi's women's rights stance was called into question after the publication of her 1976 ''[[The New York Times]]'' op-ed piece, "And Thus Passeth International Women's Year."  In a March 1976 article in ''[[The Nation]]'', writer [[Kay Boyle]] criticized Ashraf for her touting of International Women's Year as succeeding in widening the global vision of sisterhood, while approximately 4,000 of the Princess's own "sisters" were political prisoners in Iran with virtually no hope of a military trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boyle |first=Kay |title=Sisters of the Princess|work=The Nation|date=6 March 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1980 memoirs, Pahlavi acknowledges the poor conditions of women in Iran and expresses concern, as she writes, "the news of what was happening to Iran's women was extremely painful…[they] were segregated and relegated to second-class status…many were imprisoned or exiled."&lt;ref name="Pahlavi_211"&gt;{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ShahCarter.gif|thumb|Ashraf along with other imperial family members, at a dinner with US President [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[Niavaran Palace]]]]
Additionally, Pahlavi worked as an activist for human rights and equality. She was an advocate for the international spread of literacy, especially in Iran, where her brother Mohammad Reza Shah was a major proponent of the anti-illiteracy movement. She served as a member on the International Consultative Liaison Committee for Literacy.&lt;ref name="Pahlavi_211" /&gt;

Ashraf Pahlavi was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt in the summer of 1977 at her summer home on the [[French Riviera]], during which fourteen bullets were fired into the side of her Rolls Royce automobile. Her [[Lady-in-waiting]] was killed but Pahlavi left the scene unharmed.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pahlavi_78"&gt;{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klemesrud&gt;{{cite news|last=Klemesrud|first=Judy |title=Princess' book defends shah, attacks Carter|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19800423&amp;id=fMksAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RBMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6548,5038930&amp;hl=fi=vIFDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jq4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5677,74054&amp;dq=shah's+mother+died&amp;hl=en|accessdate= |newspaper=Star News|date=23 October 1980|agency=N.Y. Times  News Service|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1979 revolution, Ashraf Pahlavi asked [[David Rockefeller]] to support her brother Mohammad Reza's attempts to find asylum.&lt;ref name=lboyd&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Lyn|title=A King's exile|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/ir/sirga/ARboyd234.pdf|publisher=USC|accessdate=14 February 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also attacked [[U.S President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and the [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] for not giving their support to her late brother the Shah during the start of the Revolution.&lt;ref name=Klemesrud/&gt;

In 1994 she attended the funeral of former president [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/princess-ashraf-of-iran-the-shah-of-irans-twin-sister-who-was-regarded-as-the-power-behind-the-a6811176.html|title=Princess Ashraf of Iran: The Shah of Iran's twin sister|author=Jon Gambrell|date=14 January 2016|work=The Independent|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and finance==
[[File:Ashraf et shah.jpg|thumb|Ashraf with her twin brother, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]]] 
Ashraf Pahlavi argued that she was "attacked for financial misconduct" because she was engaged "in the administration of various organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; By her own account, she was of limited financial means when [[Mossadegh]] sent her into exile in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in later years she was said to have accumulated a large fortune. She attributed her wealth to increases in the value of lands that she had inherited from her father Reza Shah, and income from inherited businesses.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Nevertheless, it has been purported that part of the story behind the build up of her fortune may have been that during the Iranian industrial boom, which was driven by a surge in oil prices, Pahlavi and her son Shahram took 10% or more of a new company's stock gratis in return insuring (sic) the delivery of a license to operate, to import, to export, or to deal with the government. Government licenses were said to be given only to a few well-connected companies in each field. As a result, the need to get and keep a license became a cost that had to be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keddie|1981|p=172}}; see also {{harvp|Hoveyda|1979|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a document dated 17 September 1978 from Ashraf's office requested a transfer of $708,000 from her [[Bank Melli]] account to her account at the [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] in [[Geneva]] under the code name 'Sapia'.&lt;ref name=Klemesrud/&gt;

In 1980, Pahlavi published an article in ''The New York Times'', in which she came out in defense of herself and her family's financial situation. In the article, she argued that her wealth was not accumulated through "ill-gotten gains" and attributed her fortune to inherited land, which "drastically increased in value with the development of Iran and the new prosperity that was there for all".&lt;ref name="Klemesrud"/&gt; She noted that many other Iranians profited from the sale of their own real estate, but were not accused of financial misconduct because of close ties to the clergy and Khomeini.&lt;ref name="Klemesrud"/&gt; She also defended her brother, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, stating that, contrary to the claims made by some Khomeini supporters, the Shah did not profit from the Pahlavi Foundation.&lt;ref name="Klemesrud"/&gt; The Princess wrote that she planned to "fight these slanders with all my means and through whatever judicial means are available."&lt;ref name="Klemesrud"/&gt;

Psychologically, Ashraf Pahlavi had low self-esteem when she was younger. She did not like "what she saw in the mirror." She "wished for someone else's face,…, fairer skin, and more height." She always imagined that "there were so few people in this world shorter than I."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this motivated her to be bold. In her memoirs she wrote:

{{quote|Two decades ago French journalists named me "La Panthère Noire" (The Black Panther), I must admit that I rather like this name, and that in some respects it suits me. Like the panther, my nature is turbulent, rebellious, self-confident. Often, it is only through strenuous effort that I maintain my reserve and my composure in public. But in truth, I sometimes wish I were armed with the panther's claws so that I might attack the enemies of my country.&lt;ref name="Pahlavi_xv"&gt;{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Her brother, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Mohammad Reza Shah) was her closest friend. In her memoirs, she remembers looking upon him with a sense of wonder as a child, writing, "long before we reached adulthood, his voice became the dominant one in my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pahlavi|1980|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources mention a connection between her and [[drug trafficking]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fardust|1998|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; she said: "My detractors have accused me of being a smuggler, a spy, a Mafia associate (once even a drug dealer)".&lt;ref name="Pahlavi_xv"/&gt;

==Marriages and children==

===First marriage===
Pahlavi's first marriage was to Mirza 'Ali Muhammed Khan Ghavam, Nasir ud-Daula (1911–?). They were married in March 1937 and divorced in 1942. Ghavam was the Assistant Military Attaché for Iran in 1941 in Washington DC and the eldest son of H.H. Mirza Ibrahim Khan Ghavam, [[Qavam family|Qavam ul-Mulk]]. She had one son from her first marriage, H.H. Prince (Vala Gohar) Shahram Pahlavi-Nia (born 18 April 1940, [[Tehran]]). In 1966 he married 16-year-old Niloufar Afshar, and the couple had one son, Cyrus, in 1969. Pahlavi-Nia had another son, Amir Ebrahim (born 1974) out of wedlock with Naz Alam, a daughter of the Shah's longtime minister of court and confidante, Asadollah Alam. In 1987 Shahram and Naz had an Islamic marriage ceremony in the US Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Persia/pahlavi.htm | title = Iran, The Royal Dynasty |work=Royal Ark |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408232955/http://www.royalark.net/Persia/pahlavi.htm |archivedate=8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage===
[[File:(Ashraf and her husband.jpeg) اشرف پهلوي در كنار همسرش احمد شفيق.jpg|thumb|Ashraf and her spouse, Ahmed Shafiq]]
Pavlavi's second marriage was to (Sahib ul-Izza) Ahmed Chafik Bey (21 September 1911 – 1976). He was the director-general of Civil Aviation and fourth son of H.E. (Hazrat Sahib ul-Sa'ada) Ahmad Shafiq Pasha, the minister of the [[Khedive|Khedivial]] Court of Egypt. They married in 1944 in [[Cairo]], and divorced in 1960; he went on to a second marriage to Deloris Pianezzola, and died of cancer in 1976, in Tehran. They had two children, Captain H.H. [[Shahriar Shafiq|Prince (Vala Gohar) Shahriar Mustapha Chafik]] (15 March 1945 – 7 December 1979), assassinated in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bakhtiar escapes assassination attempt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HdIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BEcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4832,2531982&amp;dq=shahpour+bakhtiar+assassinated&amp;hl=en|accessdate=4 November 2012|newspaper=Daily News|date=17 July 1980|agency=AP|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H.H. Princess (Vala Gohari) [[Azadeh Shafiq|Azadeh Pahlavi-Chafik]] (1951–2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute to Princess Azadeh Shafigh Pahlavi (1951-2011)|url=http://www.iranian.com/main/blog/darius-kadivar/irandokht-tribute-princess-azadeh-shafigh-pahlavi-1951-2011|publisher=Iranian|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third marriage===
Pahlavi married a third and final time on 5 June 1960 (at the Iranian Embassy in Paris) to Mehdi Bushehri (1916–?), who was the Director of the Maison d'Iran (House of Iran), Paris. They had no children together, and were often separated while Pahlavi lived in exile in [[New York City]]&lt;ref name=Klemesrud/&gt; and Mehdi Bushehri remained in Paris.&lt;ref name=miaminews&gt;{{cite news|last=McElwaine|first=Sandra|title=Shah's sister living in a shadow world|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FRZVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Rj0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6057,3092787&amp;dq=shahnaz+pahlavi+married&amp;hl=en|accessdate=7 November 2012|newspaper=The Miami News|date=29 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1980 interview with ''The New York Times'' journalist [[Judy Klemesrud]], Pahlavi stated, "I have never been a good mother. Because of my way of life, I was not with my children very much".&lt;ref name="Klemesrud"/&gt;

==Exile and death==
[[File:Ashraf Pahlavı.jpg|thumb|Ashraf in 1970s]]
After the Revolution Princess Ashraf divided her time between [[Beekman Place]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/77884-an-eight-story-manhattan-mansion-with-a-history-of-famous-residents&lt;/ref&gt; which she sold before moving to [[Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]], [[Paris]] and in [[Juan-les-Pins]], on the [[French Riviera]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klemesrud/&gt;

Princess Ashraf Pahlavi died on 7 January 2016 in [[Monte Carlo]] at the age of 96.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; She had suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3391409/Ashraf-Pahlavi-twin-sister-Iran-shah-dead-96.html|title=Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister of Iran's last shah, dead at 96|date=9 January 2016|work=Mail Online|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was announced by her nephew and the imperial family's head, [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]] on his Facebook page.

Robert F. Armao, an adviser, said the cause was "old age". Armao related that Princess Ashraf died in her sleep at home in [[Europe]], but declined to name the country, citing concern for the safety of her family.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ashraf Pahlavi, Sister of Iran's Last Shah, Dies at 96|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/world/middleeast/ashraf-pahlavi-sister-of-irans-last-shah-defender-and-diplomat-dies-at-96.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 January 2016|access-date=8 January 2016|issn=0362-4331|author=Liam Stack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her funeral took place on 14 January 2016 in the [[Monaco Cemetery|Cimetière de Monaco]] in [[Monaco]], attended by members of the Pahlavi family, including Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]].&lt;ref name=Pure&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obsèques d'Ashraf Pahlavi: Farah Diba en deuil, adieu discret à la soeur du Shah|url=http://www.purepeople.com/article/obseques-d-ashraf-pahlavi-farah-diba-en-deuil-adieu-discret-a-la-soeur-du-shah_a171130/1|newspaper=Pure People|date=19 January 2016|access-date= |issn= |author=}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of her death, she was the oldest living member of her family.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Books==
Ashraf Pahlavi wrote two books in English:
*'' Faces in a Mirror: Memoirs from Exile'' (1980)
* ''Time for Truth'' (1995)

Additionally, she wrote one book in French:
*''Jamais Résignée'' (1981)

Her three books were published following her 1980 ''The New York Times'' article "I Will Fight These Slanders".  In accordance with her promise to fight the "slanders" about her and her family, her books are largely concerned with clearing up what she viewed as misconceptions about the Pahlavi dynasty.  She again addresses the questions about her personal financial situation, writing in her most widely read book, her memoir ''Faces in a Mirror'', "I had inherited about $300,000 when my father died (and about 1 million square meters of land near the Caspian Sea, as well as properties in Gorgan and Kermanshah, which would later become extremely valuable)"&lt;ref name="Pahlavi_78"/&gt; In the introduction to this book, Pahlavi writes that she wants "very much to explain to Western readers what they have failed to understand about the nature of Iran's culture and heritage…about the nature of the so-called [[Islamic revolution]]",&lt;ref name="Pahlavi_xv"/&gt; Generally, her books are viewed as too autobiographical and steeped in emotion to be used as serious historical references: ''[[The Library Journal]]'' called Pahlavi's ''Faces in a Mirror'', "little more than a personalized homily on the Pahlavis' virtues and the perfidy of nearly everyone else in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Snider, Dave. "''Faces in a Mirror'' (Book Review)". ''Library Journal''. 15 June 1980. 1380-1381&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1979 revolution, Pahlavi translated several books from French into Persian, including books on nursing and child care.&lt;ref name=flance/&gt;

'''Benjamin "Ben" Tackie''' (born 23 July 1973) is a Ghanaian [[professional boxer]] and world title challenger. He is known for his excellent [[chin (combat sports)|chin]] and ability to throw a high volume of punches. All but one of his losses have come via decision.

==Professional career==
Known as "Wonder", Tackie turned pro in 1994 and won his first 18 fights before losing a decision to [[Gregorio Vargas]] in 1999.  In 2002 he took on Kostya Tszyu for the unified WBC, WBA, and IBF light welterweight titles but lost a decision.  He lost his next two fights to [[Sharmba Mitchell]] and [[Ricky Hatton]].  He lost his most recent bout to [[Matthew Hatton]] on 22 September 2008 on the undercard to [[Ricky Hatton]]'s Light Welterweight title defence in Las Vegas.

Tackie's 10th-round knockout of [[Roberto Garcia Cortez|Roberto Garcia]] was named [[Ring Magazine]] [[Knockout of the Year]] 
for 2000.

So far in his 41 pro fights Tackie has been knocked down only once.

==Stalking charge==

In February 2015, his Stalking conviction was reversed in Bronx county court in New York. The threat communicated "Don't let me use my boxing skills on you" apparently did not rise to the legal requirement to uphold his conviction.

As of April 2009 his record stands at 29-11-1 with 17 knockouts.

"'''Brit Pack'''" is a term that has been used to refer to specific groups of young British actors who have achieved success in Hollywood, as well as more generally to the entire group of such actors. According to one article, "every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom."&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/tim-roth/biography/122|title=Tim Roth – Biography|author=TalkTalk web studio|publisher=talktalk.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of British actors which emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] actors at that time.

==1980s Brit Pack==
The journalist Elissa Van Poznak interviewed [[Gary Oldman]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Bruce Payne]], [[Spencer Leigh (actor)|Spencer Leigh]], and [[Colin Firth]] for ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine, in January 1987. The magazine had also intended to interview [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] but he was busy filming ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agwlbp.com/facejan.html|title=HugeDomains.com – Agwlbp.com is for Sale (Agwlbp)|publisher=agwlbp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the interview was "The Brit Pack". The moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent articles concerning the actors.&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tim-roth.com/index.php?id=facejul90|title=Tim Roth: Press|publisher=tim-roth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue of the 1988 magazine [[Film Comment]] stated that '[[Rupert Everett]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' were the leaders of the pack.&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"&gt;[http://www.americancinemapapers.com/files/BRIT_PACK.htm BRIT PACK: A CLUTCH OF ACTORS], Harlan Kennedy, ''American Cinema Papers'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Brit Pack==
In July 1993, an article for ''The Face'' was titled ''The New Brit Pack'', which included [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Naveen Andrews]], [[Jude Law]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]], [[Samuel West]] and [[Rufus Sewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Face Magazine Editors|title=The Face Magazine – Jaye Davidson Cover|url=http://www.crazyaboutmagazines.com/ourshop/prod_571877-The-Face-magazine-Jaye-Davidson-cover-July-1993-Volume-2-No-58.html|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other "packs"==
Unlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, "Brit Pack" actors have rarely associated with each other socially or in film. As a 1988 article put it, the Brit Pack "aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies – ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', et al. – they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either".&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"/&gt; Nonetheless, [[Bruce Payne]] and [[Tim Roth]] had both appeared in the ''Tales Out of School'' television series, [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tim Roth]] both appeared in ''[[Meantime (film)|Meantime]]'' and ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'', Gary Oldman and Colin Firth appeared together in [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] and [[Bruce Payne]] and Spencer Leigh both appeared in ''[[Smart Money (1986 film)|Smart Money]]''.

==Later uses of the term==
Currently, the phrase 'Brit Pack' is often used to describe any disparate group of young British actors and actresses of rising prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-britpack--our-new-generation-of-movie-stars-takes-tinseltown-841199.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=6 June 2008 | title=The Britpack – Our new generation of movie stars takes Tinseltown}}&lt;/ref&gt; No group has emerged which is as readily identifiable as the group from the 1980s.{{whom| date=November 2017}}

In 2014, it was used to describe a new wave of actors born in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were garnering success in Hollywood. These actors include [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Henry Cavill]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Eddie Redmayne]] and [[Rupert Friend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/best-of-british-tom-hiddleston|title=Best of British|work=ShortList Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/hot-british-men?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1447_64563853#slide-1|title=Hottest British Actors – 10 Best British Actors|author=Rebecca Cope|work=Harper's BAZAAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the Prince of Wales''' is the official [[Heraldry|heraldic]] insignia of the [[Prince of Wales]], a title traditionally granted to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], formerly the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and before that the [[Kingdom of England]].

The [[coat of arms]], in its current form, was devised for [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1958. It contains the badges and elements taken from all four of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the United Kingdom]] as well as from the many [[List of titles and honours of Charles, Prince of Wales|titles the prince holds]] as [[heir apparent]].

The history of the coat of arms is closely linked with that of the [[Royal Arms of England|Royal coat of arms of England]] and the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] wrote in 1863, "The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated."&lt;ref name="Boutell 256"&gt;Boutell p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
====Coronet====
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 31.png|thumb|130px|left|The British heir-apparent's coronet as depicted by [[Hugo Gerard Ströhl]]]]
The [[Coronet|coronets of the Prince and the Peers]] of the realm were regulated by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: "Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and [[Fleur-de-lis|Flower-de-Lized]] with one Arch; and in the midst a [[Globus cruciger|Ball and Cross]], as hath our Royal Diadem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#The_Warrant_of_1661 |title=Warrant of Feb 9, 1661|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] ([[St. Edward's crown]]) used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: "It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"&gt;Boutell p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

The heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. The warrant proclaimed: "by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown."&lt;ref name="1917 warrant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#Warrant_of_Nov_19_1917 |title=Warrant of Nov 19, 1917|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]]; the [[Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Frederick]], the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales|Coronet of George]] and the [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Charles]]. However these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/honours-principality-wales |title=Honours of the Principality of Wales |website=www.royal.uk |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Label====
Beginning with the reign of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] (or blue) was used by his son, the future King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within [[heraldry]] this system of differentiating arms is called [[cadency]]. The label is placed on the [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]] (or top) of the [[shield]] of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], heir of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], who first used a label of three points [[Argent]], also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of [[Cadency labels of the British royal family|cadency used by other members]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crest====
[[File:Prince of Wales 1914.png|thumb|200px|right|Coat of arms of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] as illustrated in [[Burke's Peerage]] 1914 edition.]]
The Prince of Wales's [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of [[Cadency|difference]] displayed. This crest depicts a "Lion [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent." The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[mantling]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Supporters====
Similarly to the crest, the prince's [[supporter]]s follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the [[Lion and the Unicorn]]. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter side]], an [[National symbols of England|ancient symbol of England]], is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a [[Royal Supporters of England|supporter of the English royal arms]] since the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The white [[Unicorn#Heraldry|unicorn]] of [[Scotland]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister side]], was incorporated into the royal arms from the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scottish royal arms]] after the Union of the crowns in 1603.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Order====
Prince Charles was appointed a [[List of current members of the Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1958. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Order of the Garter]] is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled [[Garter (stockings)|garter]], which bears in gold letters the motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'', [[French language|French]] for "Shame upon him who thinks evil of it".&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Motto====
Under the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the [[motto]] ''[[Ich dien]]'', German for "I serve". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward of Woodstock]], or the Black Prince. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind of Bohemia]], who was killed fighting alongside the prince and his father at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. The motto is also a near [[homophone]] for ''Eich Dyn'', "Your Man" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many [[Heraldic badge]]s, which represents the history and sovereignty of his many titles.

====Prince of Wales' feathers====
{{Main|Prince of Wales's feathers}}
 
The Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises "A plume of three [[ostrich]] feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or" with the motto 'Ich Dien' on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's coat of arms. It has become synonymous as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the [[Principality of Wales]] itself.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feathers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry|title=Titles and Heraldry: Prince of Wales's Feathers |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant of Appointment]] to companies that regularly supply of goods and services to the Prince. Currently there are 170 companies which are entitled to display this badge with the words 'By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales' underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves.&lt;ref name="Warrants"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry |title=Titles and Heraldry: Royal Warrants |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisations associated with Wales or the prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the [[British Army]] (such as the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]]) and the [[Welsh Rugby Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an [[Royal badges of England|ancient heraldic badge]] of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. However it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles pp. 89&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red Dragon of Wales====
{{Main|Royal Badge of Wales}}
On 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by King [[Edward VII]] approved the addition of a badge of the [[Welsh Dragon|Red Dragon]] to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation stated that: "on the sinister side a representation of the [[Royal badge of Wales|Badge of Wales]], namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant [[gules]], differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent." This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27385 |date=10 December 1901 |page=8714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Dragon, or ''Y Ddraig Goch'', has been a symbol associated with Wales since the time of [[Cadwaladr]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|King of Gwynedd]] in the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the [[House of Tudor]] that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]) displayed the Dragon of Cadwaladr on his [[Royal standards of England|battle standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Robin%20Ashburner.pdf |title=Flags in Wales |last=Ashburner |first=Robin |date=2001 |website=flaginstitute.org |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the [[Tudor rose]] as a royal badge for England, the [[thistle]] for Scotland and the [[Celtic harp|golden harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: "[[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]], fifteen [[bezant]]s, five, four, three, two and one." These arms were derived from those of [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], [[King of the Romans]], son and heir of King [[John, King of England|John]], who was also [[Count of Poitiers]] (or [[Poitou]]), represented by arms made up of [[pea]]s (poix) or [[gold coin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davis |first=Arthur Charles|authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |title=The Book Of Public Arms.

Upon the accession of the prince's mother as Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the [[Duke of Cornwall]]. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's guide to the Royal Family (Burke's genealogical series)|url=https://archive.org/details/burkesguidetoroy00lond/page/136 |year=1973 |publisher=Burke's Peerage; 1st edition |location=London |isbn=0220662223|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] for Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], his eldest son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of peerage, baronetage and knightage |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pf8cAAAAYAAJ/page/n213 |year=1914 |publisher=Burke's Peerage |location=London |isbn=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

||The [[House of Stuart|Stuart succession]] brought major changes to arms by incorporating elements of the arms of Scotland and Ireland in the 2nd and 3rd quarters respectively. The arms were first granted to Henry Stuart, the Duke of Rothesay after his father [[James I of England|James VI]] ascended the throne of England as James I. The arms were then granted twice more to the future Charles I and Charles II. It has been reported that James, the Duke of York (future James II) also bore the arms (despite not holding the title Prince of Wales), but only when his position as heir-presumptive to his brother became secure after the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion crisis]]. The arms were once more granted to James Francis Edward, who after 1688 became the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Pretender]], whose son [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie) continued the use of the arms in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces pp. 170-189&lt;/ref&gt;

||[[File:Royal Hanover Inescutcheon.svg|100px|right|thumb|Arms of Hanover with the crown of Charlemagne]] The [[House of Hanover]] inherited the throne of Great Britain after the death of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] in 1714, which led to the incorporation of the arms of King George I's possessions in [[Germany]] into the Royal arms. The blazon for the arms became: ''"1st quarter England impaling Scotland, 2nd France moderne, 3rd Ireland and 4th the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]], with a label of three points Argent. The Hanoverian quarter depicted: [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Duchy of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and an inescutcheon plain Gules, over all three."'' In the Royal arms the inescutcheon contained a depiction of the [[Crown of Charlemagne]], which was an [[augmentation of honour]] granted to the [[Prince-elector]]s of Hanover as [[Arch-Treasurer]] to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. As heir to this Imperial office, only the Prince of Wales was entitled to bear the empty inescutcheon, in right of inheritance of this imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces pp. 206-229&lt;/ref&gt;

||With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union of 1800]], the arms of the Prince of Wales changed with those of the Kingdom. The ancient claim to France was abandoned, and England occupied the 1st and 4th quarter, while the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon at the centre of the shield. This shield of arms was granted only once to George Augustus Frederick (the future George IV), who also became [[Prince regent]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

* George, Duke of York&lt;br&gt;([[George V of the United Kingdom]])
||The Royal arms were once again altered following the ascension of Queen [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] to the throne in 1837, when the Hanoverian shield was dropped. The Hanoverian inescutcheon was replaced by the [[Coat of arms of Saxony|arms of Saxony]], which was a heraldic inheritance from the queen's husband Prince [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (a Duke of Saxony).&lt;ref name="Aveling 287"&gt;Aveling p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; The inescutcheon only appeared in the arms of Albert's male-line descendants, and not in the Royal arms itself. According to the antiquarian Charles Boutell, the inescutcheon was placed as an "escutcheon of pretence", that "does not appear to be in accordance with either the spirit or the practical usage of true historical Heraldry".&lt;ref name="Boutell 256"/&gt; These arms were granted twice, first to 'Bertie' (later King Edward VII) and to the future George V. In his 1909 book ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry,'' [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] writes: "It is much to be regretted that the arms of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (the future George V) do not include the arms of his sovereignty of the Duchy of Cornwall, nor any allusion to his dignities of Prince of Wales or [[Earl of Chester]]."&lt;ref name="FD 486"&gt;Fox-Davies (1909) p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

||In 1910 Prince Edward Albert was invested and presented to the Welsh people as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle, the first time in six hundred years. Welsh local authorities had asked that the red dragon might be introduced into the Royal arms and the coinage, but neither of these wishes were granted. However a year later in 1911, King George V issued an [[order in council]] that replaced the inescutcheon of Saxony, in the Arms of the Prince of Wales, with an inescutcheon with the arms "representing the Principality of Wales". Blazoned as: ''"Quarterly Or and Gules four lions passant guardant counterchanged, ensigned by the Coronet of His degree."''&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28473 |date=7 March 1911 |page=1939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, son of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] was granted the same arms when he was made Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
===Consorts===
The family of the Prince of Wales is entitled to use certain heraldic features. The consort of the Prince of Wales (titled the [[Princess of Wales]]) is granted a unique coat of arms upon marriage, based on the [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] of the prince's arms (on the dexter side) and her father's arms (on the sinister side). The consort is also entitled to use the prince's supporters (with the appropriate label) and the use of the prince's coronet over the arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"/&gt; The current consort; [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], the [[Duchess of Cornwall]], was granted a coat of arms on 17 July 2005 upon her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/biographies/hrh-duchess-cornwall |title=HRH The Duchess of Cornwall: Titles and Heraldry |accessdate=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The children of the heir apparent were given their own distinct coronet, unlike any other grandchildren of the sovereign. This was confirmed in the 1917 Royal Warrant, which proclaimed: ''"to all the sons and daughters of the son and heir apparent of us and of our successors a coronet composed of two [[Cross pattée|crosses pattée]] (or crosses formy) four fleurs-de-lis and two strawberry leaves."''&lt;ref name= "1917 warrant"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/grants/item/71-coat-of-arms-prince-william |title=The Coat of Arms of HRH Prince William of Wales |accessdate=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the College of Arms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wives of the sons of the Prince of Wales use the same coronet as their husbands.

'''Ira Erastus Davenport''' (September 17, 1839 – July 8, 1911)&lt;ref name=Guiley1992&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits | author=Guiley, Rosemary Ellen | authorlink=Rosemary Ellen Guiley | year=1992 | publisher=[[Facts On File]] | location=New York | isbn=0-8160-2140-6 | pages=81–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''William Henry Davenport''' (February 1, 1841 – July 1, 1877),&lt;ref name=Guiley1992/&gt; known as the '''Davenport brothers''', were [[Americans|American]] [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] in the late 19th century, sons of a [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]] [[police]]man.  The brothers presented illusions that they and others claimed to be [[supernatural]].

==Career==

The Davenports began in 1854, less than a decade after [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] had taken off in America.  After stories of the [[Fox sisters]], the Davenports started reporting similar occurrences.  Their father took up managing his sons and the group was joined by William Fay, a Buffalo resident with an interest in conjuring.  Their shows were introduced by a former "[[Restoration Movement]]" [[religious minister|minister]], Dr. [[Jesse Babcock Ferguson|J. B. Ferguson]], a follower of Spiritualism, who assured the audience that the brothers worked by spirit power rather than deceptive trickery. Ferguson was apparently sincere in his belief that the Davenports possessed spiritual powers.

The Davenports' most famous effect was the box illusion.  The brothers were tied inside a box which contained [[musical instruments]].  Once the box was closed, the instruments would sound.  Upon opening the box, the brothers were tied in the positions in which they had started the illusion. Those who witnessed the effect were made to believe supernatural forces had caused the trick to work.

The Davenports toured the United States for 10 years and then traveled to [[England]] where spiritualism was beginning to become popular.  Their "spirit cabinet" was investigated by [[the Ghost Club]], who were challenging their claim of being able to contact the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prairieghosts.com/ghostclub.html |title=The Ghost Club |publisher=Prairieghosts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of the Ghost Club's investigation was never made public.  In 1868 the team was joined by [[Harry Kellar]].  Kellar and Fay eventually would leave the group to pursue their own career as a magician team.

==Exposures==

The Davenport brothers were exposed as frauds many times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1990 edition, originally published in 1962). ''Magic: A Picture History''. [[Dover Publications]]. p. 99. {{ISBN|0-486-26373-8}} "The Davenports were exposed many times, not only by magicians but by scientists and college students. The latter ignited matches in the dark. The flickering flames disclosed the brothers, with their arms free, waving the instruments which until then had seemed to be floating. The exposures had little effect on that segment of the public which chose to believe the manifestations were genuine. They closed their minds to the truth and sat in awe, sure that spirits had been conjured up in their presence."&lt;/ref&gt; The stage magician [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] saw how the Davenports' spirit cabinet illusion worked, and stated to the audience in the theatre that he could recreate their act using no supernatural methods. With the help of a friend, cabinet maker George Alfred Cooke, he built a version of the cabinet. Together, they revealed the Davenport Brothers' trickery to the public at a show in Cheltenham in June 1865.&lt;ref name=Steinmeyer_1&gt;{{cite book | author=Steinmeyer, Jim | authorlink=Jim Steinmeyer | title=Hiding the Elephant | publisher=Arrow | year=2005 | isbn=0-09-947664-9 | pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magicians including [[John Henry Anderson]] and [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]] worked to expose the Davenport Brothers, writing exposés and performing duplicate effects.  A pair of amateur magicians followed the brothers around [[Great Britain|Britain]], tying the Davenports into their box with a [[knot]] that could not be easily removed and thus exposed the trick to audiences who demanded their money back.  The impresario [[P. T. Barnum]] included an exposé of the Davenports in his 1865 book ''The Humbugs of the World''.
[[File:Davenport brothers cabinet sketch.png|thumb|left|Davenport brothers cabinet.]]
The Davenports were rejoined by William Fay for a final American tour before William Henry's death in 1877.  Fay settled in [[Australia]] and Ira Erastus lived in America until the two reunited in 1895 and toured with a show that failed.

The magician [[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]] also exposed the tricks of the Davenport brothers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of things immediately become less miraculous when it is known at times the Davenports employed as many as ten confederates. It was a night when a confederate was used that [[Alexander Herrmann]] (the stage magician known as Herrmann the Great) described in an article in the ''Cosmopolitan Magazine''. The performance was being given in Ithaca, New York, and many Cornell College students were in the audience. They had brought "pyrotechnic balls so made as to ignite suddenly with bright light." When the lights were struck the Davenports were found to be on opposite sides of the stage waving musical instruments around in the air.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|Mulholland, John]] . (1938). ''Beware Familiar Spirits''. Charles Scribner's Sons. p. 78. {{ISBN|0-684-16181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the magician [[Harry Houdini]], Ira had confessed to him that he and his brother had faked their "spirit" phenomena. Houdini in his book ''A Magician Amongst the Spirits'' (1924) also reproduced a letter from Ira claiming "we never in public affirmed our Belief in spiritualism." The spiritualist [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] refused to accept the exposures of fraud, and insisted that in private Ira was a practicing spiritualist.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2001"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2001). ''Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal''. [[University Press of Kentucky]]. pp. 18-27. {{ISBN|0-8131-2210-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] discovered the Davenport's [[Scrapbooking|scrapbook]] from the museum at the [[Lily Dale Spiritualist Assembly]]. Nickell examined newspaper clippings, personal notes and photographs from the scrapbook. He concluded that Doyle was correct about Ira endorsing spiritualism in private and Houdini was also correct about their public "spirit" phenomena being the result of trickery. According to Nickell "taken as a whole, the evidence of the scrapbook does indicate that Ira Davenport was a practicing spiritualist, or at least pretended to be, although he and his brother used trickery to accomplish the effects they attributed to spirits."&lt;ref name="Nickell 2001"/&gt;

[[File:Br.David St.Gerold.jpg|thumb|David Steindl-Rast (2004)]]
'''David Steindl-Rast''' OSB (born July 12, 1926) is a [[Catholic]] [[Benedictine]] [[monk]], notable for his active participation in [[interfaith]] dialogue and his work on the interaction between [[spirituality]] and science.

==Biography==
Steindl-Rast was born and raised in [[Vienna, Austria]]. He received his MA degree from the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]] and his [[Ph.D.]] in [[experimental psychology]] from the [[University of Vienna]] (1952). He emigrated to the United States in the same year and became a Benedictine monk in 1953 at [[Mount_Saviour_Monastery|Mount Saviour Monastery]] in [[Pine City, New York]], a newly founded Benedictine community. With permission of his abbot, Damasus Winzen, in 1966 he was officially delegated to pursue [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]-[[Christian]] dialogue and began to study [[Zen]] with masters [[Haku'un Yasutani]], [[Soen Nakagawa]], [[Shunryu Suzuki]] and [[Eido Tai Shimano]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallward, Clare. "David Steindl-Rast: Essential Writings". Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2010, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

He co-founded the Center for Spiritual Studies with [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Buddhist]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Sufi]] teachers, and since the 1970s has been a member of the cultural historian William Irwin Thompson's [[Lindisfarne Association]]. His writings include ''Gratefulness, the Heart of Prayer'', ''The Music of Silence'' (with Sharon Lebell), ''Words of Common Sense'' and ''Belonging to the Universe'' (co-authored with [[Fritjof Capra]]). He also co-founded A Network for Grateful Living, an organization dedicated to gratefulness as a transformative influence for individuals and society.

==Religion and mysticism==

During [[Link TV]]'s ''Lunch With Bokara'' 2005 episode ''The Monk and the Rabbi'', he stated:

:The religions start from mysticism. There is no other way to start a religion. But, I compare this to a volcano that gushes forth ...and then ...the magma flows down the sides of the mountain and cools off. And when it reaches the bottom, it's just rocks. You'd never guess that there was fire in it. So after a couple of hundred years, or two thousand years or more, what was once alive is dead rock. Doctrine becomes doctrinaire. Morals become moralistic. Ritual becomes ritualistic. What do we do with it? We have to push through this crust and go to the fire that's within it.

In that same episode, he expressed his belief in [[panentheism]], where divinity interpenetrates every part of existence and timelessly extends beyond it (as distinct from [[pantheism]]).

'''Donald Arthur Norman''' (born December 25, 1935) is the director of The Design Lab at [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;{{cite web | last = Robbins | first = Gary | title = Don Norman has Designs on Your Life | url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/oct/23/don-norman-homecoming/ | accessdate = November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://designlab.ucsd.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his books on design, especially ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]''. He is widely regarded for his expertise in the fields of [[design]], [[usability engineering]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Robbins, Gary"&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/oct/23/don-norman-homecoming/&lt;/ref&gt; Norman was also part of a select team flown in to investigate the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mindflowdesign.com/insights/user-centric-design-the-lessons-of-3-mile-island/|title=User-Centric Design - The Lessons of 3 Mile Island|date=2014-08-06|work=Mindflow Design|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a co-founder and consultant with the [[Nielsen Norman Group]].

Much of Norman's work involves the advocacy of [[user-centered design]].&lt;ref name="Zachry"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zachry | first = Mark | title = An Interview with Donald Norman | journal = Technical Communication Quarterly | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | date = October 2005 | page = 469 | doi = 10.1207/s15427625tcq1404_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books all have the underlying purpose of furthering the field of design, from doors to computers. Norman has taken a controversial stance in saying that the [[design research]] community has had little impact in the innovation of products, and that while academics can help in refining existing products, it is technologists that accomplish the breakthroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | last = Norman | first = Donald | title = Technology First, Needs Last | url = http://jnd.org/dn.mss/technology_first_needs_last.html | accessdate = January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Norman named his website with the initialism ''[[Just-noticeable difference|JND]]'' to signify his endeavors to make a difference.&lt;ref name="jnd"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jnd.org/about.html#jnd |title= What does ''jnd.org'' mean? |website= Just-Noticeable Difference }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman had been splitting his time between co-directing the dual-degree MBA and Engineering program at [[Northwestern University]] and consulting with the Nielsen Norman Group. Norman announced that he would no longer teach full-time after the 2009–2010 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | last = Norman | first = Donald | title = My change of status | url = http://jnd.org | accessdate = January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman is an active [[Distinguished Visiting Professor]] at the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST), where he spends two months a year teaching. He also holds the title of [[Professor Emeritus]] of Cognitive Science at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{ cite web | last = Norman | first = Donald | title = Donald Norman Curriculum Vitae | url = http://jnd.org/docs/Don_Norman_Academic_Vita.pdf | accessdate = January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is on numerous educational, private, and public sector advisory boards, including the editorial board of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.

In 2014, Norman returned to the University of California, San Diego as newly appointed director of The Design Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/oct/23/don-norman-homecoming/|title=Don Norman has designs on your life|website=The San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early academics ==

In 1957, Norman received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science]] (EECS) from [[MIT]]. Norman continued through college until 1962, in the process earning [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in [[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science|EECS]] and a [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] in [[Mathematical Psychology]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

After graduating, Norman took up a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Cognitive Studies at [[Harvard University]] and within a year became a lecturer.

After four years with the Center, Norman took a position as an associate professor in the Psychology Department at [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). Norman applied his training as an engineer and computer scientist, and as an experimental and mathematical psychologist, to the emerging discipline of [[cognitive science]]. Norman eventually became founding chair of the Department of Cognitive Science and chair of the Department of Psychology.

At UCSD, Norman was a founder of the Institute for Cognitive Science and one of the organizers of the [[Cognitive Science Society]] (along with [[Roger Schank]], [[Allan M. Collins|Allan Collins]], and others), which held its first meeting at the UCSD campus in 1979.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;

Together with psychologist [[Tim Shallice]], Norman proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning. One of the components of the Norman-Shallice model is the [[supervisory attentional system]].&lt;ref name="1a"&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedenberg | first = Jay | author2 = Gordon Silverman | title = Cognitive Science: An Introduction of the Study of Mind | year = 2010 | publisher = SAGE Publications | location = United St ates of America | isbn = 978-1-4129-7761-6 | pages = 180–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive engineering career ==

Norman made the transition from cognitive science to [[cognitive engineering]] by entering the field as a consultant and writer. His article "The truth about Unix: ''The user interface is horrid''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Norman | first1 = Don | title = The truth about Unix: The user interface is horrid | url = http://www.bradleymonk.com/File:The_truth_about_Unix_Don_Norman.pdf | work = Datamation | issue = 27(12) | date = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Datamation]]'' (1981) catapulted him to a position of prominence in the computer world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Soon after, his career took off outside of academia, although he still remained active at UCSD until 1993. Norman continued his work to further [[human-centered design]] by serving on numerous university and government advisory boards such as the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA). He currently serves on numerous committees and advisory boards like at Motorola, the [[Toyota National College of Technology]], [[TED Conference]], [[Panasonic]], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', and many more.

Norman published several important books during his time at UCSD, one of which, ''User Centered System Design'', obliquely referred to the university in the initials of its title.

In 1993, Norman left UCSD to join [[Apple Computer]], initially as an Apple Fellow as a User Experience Architect (the first use of the phrase "[[User Experience]]" in a job title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lialina|first1=Olia|title=Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopization of War|url=http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/|website=contemporary-home-computing.org|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merholz|first1=Peter|title=Peter in Conversation with Don Norman About UX &amp; Innovation|url=http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/e000862/|website=Adaptative Path|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}), and then as the Vice President of the [[Apple Advanced Technology Group|Advanced Technology Group]]. He later worked for [[Hewlett-Packard]] before joining with [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] to form the [[Nielsen Norman Group]] in 1998. He returned to academia as a professor of [[computer science]] at [[Northwestern University]], where he was co-director of the [[Segal Design Institute]] until 2010. In 2014, he returned to UCSD to become director of the newly established The Design Lab housed at the [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]].

Norman has received many awards for his work. He received an [[honorary degree]] from the [[University of Padua]] in [[Padua]], Italy. In 2001 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], and in 2006 he received the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Computer and Cognitive Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.fi.edu/tfi/exhibits/bower/06/ccscience.html | title = Donald A. Norman | work = Laureate Database | publisher = The Franklin Institute Awards | accessdate = 2011-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Norman was elected an Honorary Fellow of the [[Design Research Society]].

== User-centered design ==

In his book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'', Norman uses the term "[[user-centered design]]" to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he deems secondary issues like aesthetics. User-centered design involves simplifying the structure of tasks, making things visible, getting the mapping right, exploiting the powers of constraint, designing for error, explaining [[affordance]]s and [[seven stages of action]]. In addition, Norman discusses the closely related term "[[human-centered design]]" at length.

In his book The Things that Make us Smart: Defending the Human Attribute in the Age of the Machine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norman|first1=Don|title=Things That Make us Smart: Defending Human Attributes in the Age of the Machine|date=1993|publisher=Pursues Book Group|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201626950/donnormanA/104-2013751-2967137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman uses the term “Cognitive Artifacts” to describe “those artificial devices that maintain, display, or operate upon information in order to serve a representational function and that affect human cognitive performance”. Similar to his [[The Design of Everyday Things]] book, Norman argues for the development of [[machine]]s that fit our minds, rather than have our minds be conformed to the machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6013">'''Emory S. Foster''' (November 5, 1839 &amp;ndash; December 23, 1902) was a [[Major (United States)|major]] in the 7th [[Missouri State Militia (Union)|Missouri State Militia]] Cavalry during the [[American Civil War]].  Afterwards he was a [[St. Louis, Missouri]] newspaper editor who fought a [[duel]] with rival editor and former [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[John N. Edwards]].

==Civil War==
Foster was born in [[Greene County, Missouri]].

He was a staunch Unionist whose brother Marshall was murdered by secessionists in early 1861 on his way to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, "Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862", ''North and South'', Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;    During the [[American Civil War]], on Emory formed a [[Home Guard (Union)|Unionist Home Guard]] company called "Foster's Mounted Rangers" in which he served as [[Captain (United States)|captain]], enlisting on August 28, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Missouri State Archives, Soldiers Database,Record of Service Card, Civil War, 1861-1865, Box 28, Reel s881&lt;/ref&gt;  He later enlisted in the Federally funded [[Missouri State Militia (Union)|Missouri State Militia]], being elected major of the 7th MSM Cavalry.  He and his men engaged in skirmishes around his new home in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]] and Foster gained a reputation as an aggressive commander.

On August 15, 1862 after a two-day march from [[Warrensburg, Missouri]] to [[Lexington, Missouri]], he was ordered to take 800 men on a 20-mile march to [[Lone Jack, Missouri]] to engage Confederate troops that were attempting to capture [[Jackson County, Missouri]] in what would become the [[Battle of Lone Jack]].

Upon arrival, Foster's force encountered an 800-1,600 man sleeping Confederate recruiting force under [[Colonel]] [[John T. Coffee]] and [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] John Charles Tracy and routed them.  However, the firing of Foster's artillery alerted other Confederate recruiting commands in the area of his presence and intent. Confederates under Colonels [[Vard Cockrell]], [[Upton Hays]], and [[DeWitt C. Hunter]] were joined by Lt. Col. Tracy and a fierce five-hour battle ensued the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, "Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862", ''North and South'', Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, pages 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;   The Federals withdrew after Foster was wounded and Col. Coffee's command joined Cockrell.

Foster and his brother were severely wounded, unable to withdraw, and were taken to a cabin.  The cabin was captured by the Confederates and Foster was about to be executed by a member of [[Quantrill's Raiders]] when an 18-year-old [[Cole Younger]] physically threw the gunman out sparing Foster and his brothers life.  They gave $1,000 and their handguns to Younger who then delivered them to the Foster sons' mother in Warrensburg (all despite Younger's being a member of the Confederates).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rJNHtVsKH-gC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22emory+s+foster%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Z33yQ4yEGF&amp;sig=-bufCG6pUz4poRhN3NXyAgZTrag#PPA139,M1	The Devil Knows How to Ride: The True Story of William Clarke Quantrill and His Confederate Raiders by Edward E. Leslie - Da Capo Press - 1998] {{ISBN|0-306-80865-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, Younger as a member of the [[James-Younger Gang]] was captured in the botched [[Northfield, Minnesota]] bank robbery. Foster was to forcefully argue for a parole for Younger in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, "Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862", ''North and South'', Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Also arguing for the parole was future [[Secretary of War]] [[Stephen Benton Elkins]] whose only taste of combat had been at Lone Jack, an experience which he said filled him with disgust of war.

==Duel with John Newman Edwards==
After the war he became an editor at the St. Louis Journal.

On September 4, 1875 he fought a duel north of [[Rockford, Illinois]] with Edwards, who was then an editor of the St. Louis Times (after leaving the [[Kansas City Times]] in 1873).

The dispute had centered on an August 25 article by Edwards talking about the mistreatment of [[Jefferson Davis]] at the [[Winnebago County, Illinois]] Fair.  The Journal replied the same day "the writer of the Times article had lied, and knew he lied, when he wrote it."

Edwards demanded a retraction and Foster refused saying the editorial was not directed at Edwards personally.  On August 30 Edwards challenged Foster to a duel:

:The disclaimer in the first four paragraphs of your letter would be satisfactory had you followed it up by a withdrawal of the offensive terms of your editorial, so far as they referred to me personally. But as you decline to do so I must, therefore, construe your letter of this date, and its spirit, as a refusal on your part to do me an act of common justice, and so regarding it, I deem it my duty to ask of you that satisfaction which one gentleman has a right to ask of another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarstlouis.com/History2/johnnedwardsbio.htm JOHN NEWMAN EDWARDS - civilwarstlouis.com - February 13, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their seconds made the arrangements and at 5 pm the two met in a field and both missed as Foster smoked a cigar.  Foster commented, "A little high."

Edwards demanded a second fire, "I will go on if it takes a thousand fires."

Foster refused a second fire.  He had been challenged and shots had been fired and so his honor had been maintained.

Both shook hands and made a [[bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] [[toast]].

Foster died in [[Oakland, California]].

'''Eugen Samuilovich "Jenő" Varga''' (born as '''Eugen Weisz''', November 6, 1879, [[Budapest]] &amp;ndash; October 7, 1964, [[Moscow]]) was a [[Marxian economist]] of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] origin.

==Biography==
===Early years===

He was born as Jenő Weiß (Hungarian orthography: Weisz) in a poor Jewish family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Löwy]]|title=Redemption and Utopia: Jewish Libertarian Thought in Central Europe : a Study in Elective Affinity|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1992|page=174|ISBN=9780804717762|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0XaP509LdYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Redemption+and+Utopia:+Jewish+Libertarian+Thought+in+Central+Europe+:+a+Study+in+Elective+Affinity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ4PmH0u_UAhUNJ1AKHRuRCY0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Redemption%20and%20Utopia%3A%20Jewish%20Libertarian%20Thought%20in%20Central%20Europe%20%3A%20a%20Study%20in%20Elective%20Affinity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as a child of Samuel Weisz - who was a teacher in the primary school of [[Nagytétény]] - and Julianna Singer. 
Eugen "Jenő" Varga studied philosophy and economic geography at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]]. In 1906, he started writing in socialist and academic journals, mainly on economic subjects, but also on other topics. Before [[World War I]] he gained some fame by discussing with [[Otto Bauer]] about the origins of inflation in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In this period he belonged to the Marxist Centrists, of whom [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Rudolf Hilferding]] were the most prominent spokesmen.

===Hungarian revolution===

He participated as minister of finance in the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] of 1919. After the overthrow of the Soviet Republic he fled to Vienna.

===Soviet emigration===

In 1920 he went to the [[Soviet Union]], where he started working for the [[Comintern]], specializing in international economic problems and agrarian questions. In years 1922-1927 he was working at the department of trade in the Soviet embassy in [[Berlin]]. In the 1930s he became an economic adviser to [[Joseph Stalin]]. He survived the purges of the 1930s.

During [[World War II]] he advised the Soviet Government in matters of post-war reparations. He attended the Potsdam Conference of 1945 as an expert. Like most of his compatriots living and working in Moscow, he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], but he also remained active in the [[Hungarian Communist Party]].

He authored the economic reports the congresses of the Comintern discussed between 1921 and 1935. A large number of his writings were studies of the international economic [[conjuncture]], in which he made great effort to assess quantitative trends in output, investment and employment using official economic data from numerous countries. He also extensively studied [[Germany|German]] imperialism.

In 1946 he published ''The Economic Transformation of Capitalism at the End of the Second World War'', in which he argued that the capitalist system was more inherently stable than had been hitherto believed. This led to the closure of the Institute which he headed. (See: Paolo Spriano, ''Stalin and the European Communists''. London: Verso, 1985). Finally, in 1949 he would make his self-criticism. Though he remained a leading academic economist, his prestige had diminished. In the second edition of the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' he was qualified as a "bourgeois economist."

===Years after Stalin===

After Stalin's death in 1953, he reappeared on the scene, but the new men in power in the [[Kremlin]] believing in the virtues of peaceful co-existence were not interested in Varga's predictions of the outbreak of a "necessary" economic crisis in the United States. In 1954 and 1959 he received the [[Lenin Order]]s, in 1954 he obtained a [[Stalin Prize]] and in 1963 a [[Lenin Prize]]. After his death, his selected works in three volumes were published in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Hungary]], and  [[East Germany]].

Varga never returned to living in his native Hungary. Because he was very close to [[Mátyás Rákosi]], he was several times invited as an economic advisor to Hungary. In this period (1945-1950) he had specialized in economic planning, pricing and monetary reforms, i.e. reforms the Hungarian Communists now in power were carrying out. After the fall of Rákosi caused by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the take-over by the [[János Kádár|Kádár]] team, Varga's advisory work was not appreciated anymore.

He is well known internationally, and within the Philippines and Asia-Pacific region, claiming fame as one of the best musician-songwriters of the Philippines.

==Early life==
Freddie Aguilar's musical beginnings started when he was young.  At the age of 14, he wrote songs about his family who are now knows as the Peralta Family from Bukidnon. It was said that these people were exceedingly handsome and beautiful people that stole the hearts of many.  When he was 17-years-old, Aguilar played his first guitar. By the time he was 20-years-old, Freddie Aguilar performed on stage for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freddieanakaguilar.com/biography.html, The Freddie Aguilar Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freddie Aguilar studied [[Electrical Engineering]] at De Guzman Institute of Technology but did not finish the degree program. Instead he pursued music, became a street musician, and then a folk club and bar musician.&lt;ref name="e"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockard|first=Craig A.|title=Dance of life: popular music and politics in Southeast Asia|publisher=University of Hawaii|year=1998|page=144|isbn=0-8248-1918-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_likSSE9sEAC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=anak+freddie|accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 18, Aguilar parted ways with his family and quit college. After realizing and regretting his mistakes five years later, he composed the song "[[Anak (song)|Anak]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2017/06/10/1708408/freddie-i-wrote-anak-atone-my-sins Freddie: I wrote Anak to atone my sins] ''Philstar'' (10 June 2017). Retrieved 4 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Freddie Aguilar's influences include British and American folk-rock stars like [[Cat Stevens]] and [[James Taylor]].&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; He is also heavily influenced by his Filipino heritage, nationalist feelings, and tries to constitute a musical exploration of the Filipino ethos.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;

==Career==

===International acclaim===
Freddie Aguilar's "Anak" not only broke the Philippine record charts in 1979, but it also hit the no. 1 spot in Japan and achieved considerable popularity in other countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and parts of Western Europe.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;
The song has become so famous that, by some counts, it has been recorded in as many as a hundred versions in 23 languages throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Billboard'' reported that the song was the number two world hit of the 1980s. As of 2006, it was unsurpassed as the highest-selling record of Philippine music history.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

===Political activism===
Even before Aguilar's rendition of "Bayan Ko," Aguilar created and performed songs targeted at social injustices. His album, ''Magdalena'' included songs about a girl forced into prostitution as a result of poverty and the Christian-Muslim clashes in his song ''Mindanao.'' After the album, Freddie Aguilar also sang about the injustices suffered by the powerless, poverty, and the arrogance of superpowers in a song about the U.S. and Russia.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;

Five years after the composition of "Anak", Freddie Aguilar joined protests against the Marcos regime and began writing and performing songs that criticized the excesses of the government.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tadiar |first1=Neferti X.

One of the songs he was most remembered for during that time was his interpretation of "[[Bayan Ko]]" ("''My Country''"), in which he added a verse to the original piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==="Bayan Ko" (My Country)===
In 1978, Aguilar first recorded "Bayan Ko" in a patriotic effort to, in his words, "jolt back those who were starting to forget who we really are."&lt;ref name="c"/&gt; He also provided a rendition of the song as it is inspiring and gave him excitement and a surge of power.&lt;ref name="f"&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/06/24/10/bayan-ko-has-long-history 'Bayan Ko' has a long history]&lt;/ref&gt; The song was originally composed in 1928 by Constancio de Guzman, with lyrics by poet [[Jose Corazon de Jesus]], during a time of struggle for Philippine independence from US occupation.&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maceda |first1=Teresita Gemenez |last2= |first2= |year=2007 |title=Problematizing the popular: the dynamics of Pinoy pop(ular) music and popular protest music |journal=Inter-Asian Cultural Studies |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=390–413 |publisher= |doi=10.1080/14649370701393766 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged once again during the Marcos regime as the unofficial anthem of the emergent "people" of "[[People Power]]", the new democratic nation opposed to authoritarianism that is widely credited with the deposing of [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name="c"/&gt; In 1983, the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino]] triggered massive demonstrations against the Marcos dictatorship, and Aguilar's rendition of "Bayan Ko" was blared on the radio and speakers mounted on jeepneys throughout the streets of Manila and the provinces of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="d"/&gt; At the funeral of Senator Aquino, Freddie Aguilar sang "Bayan Ko" and felt that Aquino was a man of action who even gave his life for the freedom of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/2014/02/25/dancing-to-the-tune-of-the-revolution/, Dancing to the Tune of the Revolution: 5 songs of EDSA]&lt;/ref&gt; During the performance, Freddie Aguilar did not feel scared anymore and felt strong and confident.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt; He then decided to join the cause as well.&lt;ref name="g"/&gt; Aguilar, along with [[APO Hiking Society]] and other Pinoy pop musicians who took a stand against dictatorship, joined other protest singers in music and street performances as part of the anti-Marcos rallies.&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;

A few years later, Aguilar campaigned for the presidential candidacy of [[Corazon Aquino]] in the national election that would lead to the 1986 revolt.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

Aguilar mentioned in an interview with ABS-CBN News that the lyrics of the song combines the love the Filipinos have for their country, commemorate the Aquino family, and commitment to the country.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt; Even in this modern time, Filipinos will identify "Bayan Ko" as the nation's protest anthem.&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;

===Present day===
On January 18, 2008, Aguilar received the Asia Star Award from the Asia Model Award Festival in [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/77331/Iza-Calzado-bags-Asian-model-award-in-Korea GMA NEWS.TV, Iza Calzado bags Asian model award in Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguilar still lives in the Philippines, and continues to perform. He currently has moved to his own place dubbed "Ka Freddie's". He still has a strong following in the Philippines and among many [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] living overseas.

On July 14, 2016, Aguilar has been appointed as one of the 15 commissioners of the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA). Aguilar has been advocating for the creation of a new department called "Department of Culture and Arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/63764/freddie-aguilar-appointed-as-new-ncca-commissioner-by-president-rodrigo-duterte|title=Freddie Aguilar appointed as new NCCA commissioner by President Rodrigo Duterte|publisher=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]|language=Filipino|last=Serato|first=Arniel|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign and the [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|Inauguration]] of president [[Rodrigo Duterte]], Aguilar performed “Para sa Tunay na Pagbabago”, which is one of Duterte's campaign jingles to the tune of Ipaglalaban Ko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/hiphopdx-production/2018/05/Tekashi-e1526316435503-827x620.jpg|title=Freddie Aguilar at the peak of his career|publisher=[[GMA news]]|date=June 30, 1994|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aguilar is President Duterte's favorite singer.

'''Henry Lawrence Burnett''' (December 26, 1838 – January 4, 1916) was an American lawyer and, after serving as a [[Major (military)|major]] in the [[Cavalry Corps (Union Army)]], he was a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and [[Judge Advocate General's Corps (United States)|Judge Advocate]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].  He was a prosecutor in the trial that followed the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]].&lt;ref name="Colby1917"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colby, M.A.|first1=Frank Moore|title=The New International Year Book {{!}} A Compendium of the World's Progress for the year 1916|date=1917|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eytNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to the grade of [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers in 1866, to rank from March 13, 1865.

==Early life==
Burnett was born in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], in 1838.  He was the son of Henry Burnett (1801–1876), an [[abolitionist]], and Nancy ([[née]]  Jones) Burnett (d. 1880).&lt;ref name="Randall1912"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Randall|first1=Emilius Oviatt|last2=Ryan|first2=Daniel Joseph|title=History of Ohio: The Rise and Progress of an American State|date=1912|publisher=Century History Company|pages=105–112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ8WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His paternal grandfather, Samuel Burnett, a native of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] was, at one time, prominent and influential.  He as educated had a considerable fortune, but lost most of his property during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], along with [[Robert Morris (judge)|Robert Morris]],&lt;ref name="Randall1912"/&gt; and emigrated west to Ohio around 1798.&lt;ref name="HBurnett"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Burnett - An Ohio Pioneer |url=https://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/burnett/henrysr.htm#obit|website=www.iment.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a descendant of [[William Burnet (colonial administrator)|William Burnett]], a [[List of colonial governors of New York|colonial governor of New York]] and [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="HLBObit1916"/&gt;

He was determined not to become a [[farmer]], he ran away from home to get an education.  He attended [[Chester, Ohio|Chester Academy]] and, later, [[Hiram College]] where he was taught by later President [[James A. Garfield]].&lt;ref name="iment"/&gt;

In 1855, he began his studies at [[Poland Seminary|Ohio State National Law School]], in [[Poland, Ohio]], graduating in 1859.&lt;ref name="Colby1917"/&gt;  Following his graduation, he begins reading law with Judge Benjamin F. Hoffman, law partner of [[David Tod]], who later served as [[Governor of Ohio]].  He was [[admitted to the bar]] in 1860, and began practicing in [[Warren, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="iment"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1861 when the Civil War broke out, Burnett joined the [[2nd Ohio Cavalry]], where he rose to the rank of [[major (United States)|major]] in 1862.  After being trampled by a horse and seriously injured in 1863, however, he transferred to the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] of the [[Department of the Ohio]], working for [[Joseph Holt]], the [[Judge Advocate General of the United States Army|Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name="iment"/&gt;

In 1865, he was appointed [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in the Judge Advocate Corps.&lt;ref name="iment"/&gt;

===Lincoln assassination trial===
[[File:JBingham-JHolt-HBurnett.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Henry Burnett ''(right)'' along with [[John Bingham]] ''(left)'' and [[Joseph Holt]] ''(center)'' were the three judges in charge of the Lincoln assassination trial.]][[File:Henry_Lawrence_Burnett_c1865.jpg|thumb|right|Brig. Gen. Henry Lawrence Burnett]]
After the assassination of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, Burnett was called upon by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]] to be an Assistant [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General]].  Along with him were [[John Bingham]] and [[Joseph Holt]], the Judge Advocate General. The accused conspirators where [[George Atzerodt]], [[David Herold]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]], [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Samuel Arnold]], [[Michael O'Laughlen]], [[Edman Spangler]], [[Samuel Mudd]] and [[Mary Surratt]].&lt;ref name="Randall1912"/&gt;

The trail began on May 10, 1865. The three spent nearly two months in court, awaiting a verdict from the jury. Holt and Bingham attempted to obscure the fact that there were two plots. The first plot was to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] prisoners the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] had. The second was to assassinate Lincoln, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] to throw the government into chaos.&lt;ref name="Randall1912"/&gt;

It was important for the prosecution not to reveal the existence of a [[diary]] taken from the body of Lincoln's assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]]. The diary made it clear that the assassination plan dated from 14 April. The defence surprisingly did not call for Booth's diary to be produced in court. Holt was accused of withholding evidence, but it was never proven.

On June 29, the eight were found guilty for their involvement in the conspiracy to kill Lincoln. [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Arnold]], [[Michael O'Laughlen|O'Laughlen]] and [[Samuel Mudd|Mudd]] were sentenced to life in prison, [[Edman Spangler|Spangler]] six years in prison and [[George Atzerodt|Atzerodt]], [[David Herold|Herold]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Paine]] and [[Mary Surratt|Surratt]] were to hang. They were executed July 7, 1865. Surratt was the first woman in American history to be executed. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler, and Mudd were pardoned by [[Andrew Johnson]] in early 1869.

Following the completion of the trial, in October 1865, Burnett asked to be mustered out on December 1, 1865, which was granted.  Senator [[John Sherman]] and Holt asked for him to be appointed a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], which he accepted in May 1866.&lt;ref name="iment"/&gt; On January 13, 1866, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Burnett for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the [[United States Senate]] confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher]], ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-3641-1}}. p. 741.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Civil War career===
In late 1865, he moved to [[New York City]] where he resumed the practice of law with Judge [[Thomas W. Bartley]], former [[List of Justices of the Ohio Supreme Court|Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court]] and Governor of Ohio, until 1869.   Following his practice in New York, Burnett and his second wife moved back to Ohio where he then practiced law with [[Jacob Dolson Cox]], another former Governor, and [[John F. Follett]], who later served as a [[U.S. Representative]], until 1872, when he started a practice in New York with [[Edwin W. Stoughton]].&lt;ref name="HLBObit1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall1912"/&gt;

Burnett again moved to [[New York (state)|New York]], this time in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], where he served as counsel to the [[Buffalo and Erie Railroad]] (where his father-in-law was treasurer), until 1874.  After the railroad, he formed several law practices in New York with various prominent men, including ''Emott, Burnett &amp; Hammond'' (with former Judge James Emott, Henry B. Hammond, and Charles C. Emott in 1875),&lt;ref name="ABA1917"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Bar Association Journal|date=1917|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|page=674|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQdLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA674&amp;lpg=PA674|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYSCofA1885"&gt;{{cite book|title=Court of Appeals: New York: 27|date=1885|publisher=W.

'''Ivan Dimitrievich Ratiev''' ({{lang-ru|Иван Дмитриевич Ратиев}}), also known as '''Ivane Dimitris dze Ratishvili''' ({{lang-ka|ივანე რატიშვილი}}) (July 17, 1868 – April 26, 1958) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] prince and a prominent officer of the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Serving as a high-ranking official at the [[Winter Palace]] during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Ratiev is best known for saving the [[Diamond Fund|imperial treasures]] from being looted during the revolutionary turmoil.&lt;ref name="nkj"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/9735/ Тропинка в семейном саду] ("A Path in the Family Garden"). ''[[Nauka i Zhizn]]'', 1999: №9.&lt;/ref&gt; Ratiev spent several years in the [[Gulag]] but had his sentence commuted, at which point he retired to [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] where he remained until his death.

==Early life and career==
Ivan Ratiev was born in [[Oryol]] of a branch of the Georgian princely house of [[Ratishvili]], which had emigrated to the Russian Empire in 1724. His father was an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. Ivan Ratiev graduated from the Oryol [[Cadet Corps (Russia)|Cadet Corps]] and then from the Nikolayevsky Cavalry College. In 1890 he joined the 44th Nizhegorod Dragoon Regiment, deployed in [[Russian Georgia|Georgia]]. There he married, in 1896, Ekaterina [[Irakli Gruzinsky|Irakliyevna]], the Serene Princess [[Gruzinsky|Gruzinskaya]] (February 13, 1872 – 1917), a great-granddaughter of King [[Heraclius II of Georgia]] and a [[lady-in-waiting]] of the empress consort [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]].&lt;ref name="DRRI"&gt;{{ru icon}} Grebelsky, P. Kh., Dumin, S. V., Lapin, V. V. (1993), Дворянские роды Российской империи (''Noble families of Russian Empire''), vol. 4., p. 192. IPK Vesti.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winter Palace==
Ratiev retired from army service due to a trauma sustained in a [[horse race]] at [[Tbilisi]] in 1907. He then studied at [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] and, after his return to Russia, worked for the [[Ministry of the Imperial Court]]. He was assigned to an army cavalry unit of the [[Winter Palace]] with the rank of [[rittmeister]]. By the imperial order of December 6, 1913, he was made a lieutenant-colonel ([[podpolkovnik]]) of the Imperial Guard cavalry and an acting Police Master of the Winter Palace. Promoted to the rank of colonel in 1916, Prince Ratiev was appointed as a deputy commandant of the Winter Palace in April 1917, two months after the [[February Revolution]] overthrew the [[tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].&lt;ref name="DRRI"/&gt;  

[[File:Princess Ekaterina Gruzinskaya.jpg|thumb|upright|Ratiev's wife, Georgian princess Ekaterine Bagration-Gruzinskaya]]

During the storm of the Winter Palace by the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|revolutionaries]] on October 25, 1917, Ratiev did not flee, but ordered his guardsmen to evacuate the former imperial treasures to safer areas of the Palace. He dispatched his 16-year son Dimitri and two most trusted grenadiers to guard the secret depository, which, among other precious objects, housed the tsar's [[scepter]] incorporating the [[Orlov (diamond)|Orlov diamond]]. He then negotiated with the Bolshevik leader [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], who oversaw the storm of the Palace, thereby saving the treasures of the Palace from being looted and destroyed. The Soviet leadership publicly expressed their gratitude to Prince Ratiev on the pages of ''[[Izvestia]]'' (November 5, 1917) for "self-sacrificing efforts to protect and preserve the people's treasures" and appointed him the chief commandant of the Winter Palace and of all state museums and palaces of the [[Leningrad Military District|Petrograd district]].&lt;ref name="nkj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DRRI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Geraldine (1998), ''The Hermitage: The Biography of a Great Museum'', p. 150. Fromm International, {{ISBN|0-88064-190-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In March 1919, Ratiev escorted the "golden echelon", a train carrying Russia's [[gold reserve]], upon the transfer of the Russian government from [[Petrograd]] to [[Moscow]]. The road to Moscow was uneasy, Ratiev being pressured into surrendering the train and even being fired upon at [[Tver]]. Ratiev retired from the state service shortly thereafter and worked  
as a translator for various organizations of Moscow for several years. His subsequent life was marred by the loss of his wife and a son, who drowned while swimming in the river.&lt;ref name="Gogidze"&gt;{{ka icon}} Gogidze, Shalva (1987), [http://www.nplg.gov.ge/dlibrary/collect/0001/000450/File1-1.pdf "ამხანაგი თავადი" — განძეულობათა გადამრჩენი] (''"Comrade Prince" — Rescuer of the Treasures''). Tbilisi: Khelovneba.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 1924, Ivan Ratiev, his daughter Olga, and sister Sophia were arrested on charges of being members of "a counterrevolutionary monarchist organization." Due to his service in 1917, Ivan Ratiev's sentence of 5 years in [[Gulag]] was commuted to exile to [[Ekaterinburg]], where the family spent 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [pkk.memo.ru/page%202/dvor/.../ratiev.doc О Ратиевых ("The Ratiev family")]. [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]]. Accessed January 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, Ratiev moved to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, where he lived as a "state pensioner" and died at the age of 90.&lt;ref name="nkj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gogidze"/&gt;

Ratiev's daughter, Olga (died 1987), was married to the Russian [[Rurikids|Rurikid]] prince Yuri Sergeyevich Lvov (1897–1937), a grandnephew of Prince [[Georgy Lvov]], the Russian Prime Minister in 1917. Their daughter, Ekaterina, married the noted Georgian physicist Professor Vladimir Roinishvili.&lt;ref name="nkj"/&gt;

'''Joseph Tapley "Joe" Dougherty''' (November 4, 1898 – April 19, 1978) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[voice acting|voice actor]] who provided the original voice of the [[Warner Bros.]] animation character, [[Porky Pig]], starting with the character's debut in ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' in 1935 until ''[[Porky's Romance]]'' in 1937.  After that, [[Mel Blanc]] took over the role and voiced Porky for 52 years. Dougherty spoke with a natural [[Stuttering|stutter]] which became one of the character's trademarks; Dougherty's inability to control his stutter was a factor in the part being recast.

Dougherty was born in [[Missouri]]. Before becoming an actor, Dougherty attended medical school at the [[University of Nebraska]], where he was a member of the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] fraternity. He died in [[Los Angeles, California]].

== Death ==
Dougherty died on April 19, 1978 from a heart attack. He was 79 years old.

'''John Collins''' (June 8, 1717&lt;ref&gt;CBD gives June 8; ''DAB'', November 1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}March 4, 1795), was the [[List of Governors of Rhode Island|third Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Rhode Island]] from 1786 to 1790. He was the last Independent to serve as Governor of Rhode Island until [[Lincoln Chafee]] (2011–2015).

==American Revolution== 
Born in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], he was the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Collins. He stood forth as a staunch advocate of the independence of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. An admirer of [[George Washington]], he was selected by the governor of Rhode Island in 1776 to carry a letter to Washington informing him of the condition of the colony and soliciting counsel upon the best method to adopt for its defense. Later (1782) he was made bearer to the [[President of the Continental Congress|President of Congress]] of a statement of Rhode Island's reasons for rejecting the Impost Act. During the [[American Revolution]], Rhode Island was for the most part an agricultural area and as such opposed the restrictions of a national government.

In 1778, Collins represented Rhode Island in the [[Second Continental Congress]], where he served until May 1781, when he was superseded by [[William Ellery]]. He was, however, re-elected in 1782 and held the position until 1783.

==Post Revolution==
Within the state the agricultural interests vigorously advocated a paper currency. Collins espoused their cause and in 1786 was elected governor. During his term in office the issuance of paper money, which had been ceased at intervals since 1750, was resumed. It was provided by law that should any creditor refuse to accept the bills of the state the debtor might secure a discharge by depositing the amount of his debt with one of the judges of the state superior court or the court of common pleas. This law led to the suit of ''[[Trevett vs. Weeden]]'', which resulted in a decision looking toward the right of courts to declare legislative enactments unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Richman, I. B., ''Rhode Island, A Study in Separatism'', 1905, pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786 Collins was elected governor of Rhode Island and took office on May 3, 1786.

==Rhode Island's ratification of the U.S. Constitution==

When [[George Washington]] was inaugurated as President on April 30, 1789 Rhode Island was one of only two of the thirteen original states (along with North Carolina) not to have ratified the United States Constitution and was, technically speaking, an independent nation with Collins as it chief of state.

Anti-Federalist elements in Rhode Island, up to 1790, vigorously fought against the calling of a convention to decide upon entering the Federal Union, but in that year (January 17) gave its sanction to such a call by a majority of one vote in the General Assembly. This vote was cast by Collins, who had come to realize the importance of a Federal connection. The vote cost him his popularity and the governorship. He left office on May 5, 1790.  The Rhode Island General Assembly ratified the United States Constitution on May 29.

Later in 1790 Collins was elected to the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] but did not take his seat.

'''Leonid Danylovych Kuchma''' ({{lang-uk|Леоні́д Дани́лович Ку́чма}}; born 9 August 1938) is a Ukrainian politician who was the [[President of Ukraine#List of Presidents of Ukraine|second President]] of independent [[Ukraine]] from 19 July 1994 to 23 January 2005. Kuchma took office after winning the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1994|1994 presidential election]] against his rival, the incumbent [[Leonid Kravchuk]]. Kuchma won re-election for an additional five-year term in [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1999|1999]].

His presidency was surrounded by numerous corruption scandals and the lessening of media freedoms. Corruption accelerated after Kuchma's election in 1994, but in 2000–2001, his power began to weaken in the face of exposures in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Karatnycky, "Ukraine's Orange Revolution," ''Foreign Affairs,'' Vol. 84, No. 2 (Mar. – Apr., 2005), pp. 35–52 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20034274 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

On his watch the [[Economy of Ukraine|Ukrainian economy]] continued to decline until 1999, whereas growth was recorded since 2000, bringing relative prosperity to some segments of urban residents. During his presidency, [[Russia–Ukraine relations|Ukrainian-Russian ties]] began to improve.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Kravchuk, "Kuchma as Economic Reformer," ''Problems of Post-Communism'' Vol. 52#5 September–October 2005, pp 48–58&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful career in the machine-building industry of the [[Soviet Union]], Kuchma began his political career in [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1990|1990, when he was elected]] to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament); he was [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1994|re-elected in 1994]].&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma"&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile: Leonid Kuchma |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2283925.stm |date=26 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] between October 1992 and September 1993.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma"/&gt;

From July 2014 until October 2018 Kuchma was a special presidential representative of Ukraine at the semi-official peace talks regarding the ongoing [[War in Donbass]].

==Early life==
Leonid Kuchma was born in the village of [[Chaikine]] in rural [[Chernihiv Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonid Kuchma {{!}} president of Ukraine|url = http://global.britannica.com/biography/Leonid-Kuchma|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Danylo Prokopovych Kuchma (1901–1942) was wounded in [[World War II]] and eventually died of his wounds in the field hospital #756 (near the village of Novoselytsia) when Leonid was four.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = single {{!}} The Jamestown Foundation|url = http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%255Btt_news%255D=11795&amp;tx_ttnews%255BbackPid%255D=213&amp;no_cache=1#.VlNnVPmrTIU|website = www.jamestown.org|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Engology,Engineer, Leonid Kuchma - President of the Ukraine,|url = http://www.engology.com/eng5kuchma.htm|website = www.engology.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Paraska Trokhymivna Kuchma worked at a [[kolhoz]]. Kuchma attended the Kostobobrove general education school in the neighboring [[Semenivka Raion, Chernihiv Oblast|Semenivka Raion]]. Later he enrolled in [[Dnipropetrovsk National University]] and graduated in 1960 with a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] (majoring in [[aerospace engineering]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Profile: Leonid Kuchma|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2283925.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2002-09-26|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he joined the [[Communist Party of Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = UKRAINIANS ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/12/world/ukrainians-elect-a-new-president.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1994-07-12|access-date = 2016-01-13|issn = 0362-4331|first = Steven|last = Erlanger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuchma is a [[Candidate of Sciences|candidate of technical sciences]].

In 1967 Kuchma married Lyudmyla.&lt;ref name=UKPresWifes&gt;[http://en.itar-tass.com/world/735058 First ladies of Ukraine], [[ITAR-TASS]] (6 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Kuchma worked in the field of [[aerospace engineering]] for the [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]] in [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. At 28 he became a testing director for the Bureau deployed at the [[Baikonur cosmodrome]].

Some political observers suggested that Kuchma's early career was significantly boosted by his marriage to [[:uk:Кучма Людмила Миколаївна|Lyudmila Talalayeva]], an adopted daughter of Gennadiy Tumanov, the [[Yuzhmash]] chief engineering officer and later the Soviet Minister of Medium Machine Building.&lt;ref&gt;[[:uk:Бондаренко Костянтин Петрович|Бондаренко К.]] ''Леонід Кучма: портрет на фоні епохи.'' «Фоліо». Харків, 2007; стр. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/rus/news/news-203117.html Деньги к деньгам: браки в украинской политике (UNIAN, 12 July 2007)]. Unian.net. Retrieved on 6 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 38 Kuchma became the Communist party chief at [[Yuzhmash|Yuzhny Machine-building Plant]] and a member of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]]. He was a delegate of the 27th and 28th Congresses of the Communist Party of Soviet Union. By the end of the 1980s, Kuchma openly criticized the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"&gt;{{cite web| title=Profile: Leonid Kuchma |publisher=[[BBC]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/486472.stm| date=29 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 Kuchma was appointed the first deputy of general [[design engineer]] at Yuzhmash, and from 1986 to 1992, he held the position of the company's general director. [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1990|From 1990]] to 1992, Kuchma was a member of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukraine's parliament). In 1992 he was appointed as [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/&gt; He resigned a year later, complaining of "slow pace of reform".&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/&gt; He was [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1994|re-elected into parliament in 1994]].&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma"/&gt;

==President (1994–2005)==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Kuchma resigned from the position of [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] in September 1993 to run for the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1994|presidency in 1994]] on a platform to boost the economy by restoring economic relations with Russia and faster [[market economy|pro-market reforms]]. Kuchma won a clear victory against the incumbent President [[Leonid Kravchuk]], receiving strong support from the industrial areas in the east and south. His worst results were in the west of the country.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/&gt;

Kuchma was [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1999|re-elected in 1999]] to his second term.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/&gt; This time the areas that gave him strongest support last time voted for his opponents, and the areas which voted against him last time came to his support.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/&gt;

During Kuchma's Presidency, he closed opposition papers and several journalists died in mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1102303.stm#media "Country profile: Ukraine"], [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Serhy Yekelchyk]] President Kuchma's administration "employed electoral fraud freely" during the [[Ukrainian constitutional referendum, 2000|2000 constitutional referendum]] and 1999 presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KRBCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Ukrainian+constitutional+referendum+election+fraud+2000&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtwbHUpszaAhXQDuwKHeJqBJsQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukrainian%20constitutional%20referendum%20election%20fraud%202000&amp;f=false ''The Conflict in Ukraine: What Everyone Needs to Know''] by [[Serhy Yekelchyk]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2015, {{ISBN|0190237287}} (page 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Domestic policy===
In October 1994, Kuchma announced comprehensive economic reforms, including reduced [[subsidies]], lifting of price controls, lower taxes, [[privatization]] of industry and agriculture, and reforms in currency regulation and banking. The parliament approved the plan's main points. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) promised a $360&amp;nbsp;million loan to initiate reforms.

He was re-elected in 1999 to his second term. Opponents accused him of involvement in the killing in 2000 of journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]] (see also [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]], "[[Cassette Scandal]]", [[Mykola Mel'nychenko]]), which he has always denied. Critics also blamed Kuchma for restrictions on press freedom. Kuchma is believed to have played a key role in sacking the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet]] of [[Viktor Yushchenko]] by [[Verkhovna Rada]] on 26 April 2001.

Kuchma's [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] from 2002 until early January 2005 was [[Viktor Yanukovych]], after Kuchma dismissed [[Anatoliy Kinakh]], his previous appointee.

===Foreign policy===

In 2002 Kuchma stated that Ukraine wanted to sign an association agreement with the [[European Union]] (EU) by 2003–2004 and that Ukraine would meet all EU membership requirements by 2007–2011.&lt;ref name=UW28212EUU&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/73494 EU-Ukraine Summits: 16 Years of Wheel-Spinning], ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' (28 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; He also hoped for a [[free-trade]] treaty with the EU.&lt;ref name=UW28212EUU/&gt;

In his inaugural address Kuchma said:

{{quote|Historically, Ukraine is part of the Euro-Asian cultural and economics space. Ukraine's vitally important national interests are now concentrated on this territory of the former Soviet Union. ... We are also linked with... the former republics of the Soviet Union by traditional scientific, cultural and family ties... I am convinced that Ukraine can assume the role of one of the leaders of Euro-Asian economic integration.&lt;ref&gt;'Leonid Kuchma sklav prysiagu na virnist' ukrains'komu narodovy', Holos Ukrainy, 21 July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kuchma signed a "Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership" with Russia, and endorsed a round of talks with the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. Additionally, he referred to Russian as "an official language". He signed a special partnership agreement with [[NATO]] and raised the possibility of membership of the alliance.

After Kuchma's popularity at home and abroad sank as he became mired in corruption scandals, he turned to Russia as his new ally. He said that Ukraine needed a "multivector" foreign policy that balanced eastern and western interests{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

===Kuchma and the Cassette Scandal===
{{see also|Cassette Scandal}}
From 1998 to 2000, Kuchma's bodyguard [[Mykola Melnychenko]] was allegedly eavesdropping Kuchma's office, later publishing the recordings. The release of the tapes – dubbed "Kuchmagate" by the Ukrainian press – supposedly revealed Kuchma's numerous crimes. In particular, his approving the sale of radar systems to [[Saddam Hussein]] (among other illegal arms sales) and ordering the Ukraine's police minister to "take care" of the journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]].
[[File:Ukraine Without Kuchma 6 February.jpg|thumbnail|[[Ukraine Without Kuchma]] protests. 6 February 2001.]]
In September 2000, Gongadze disappeared and his headless corpse was found mutilated on 3 November 2000. On 28 November, the opposition politician [[Oleksandr Moroz]] publicised the tape recordings implicating Kuchma in Gongadze's murder. In 2005 the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office instigated criminal proceedings against Kuchma and members of his former administration in connection with the murder of Gongadze.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20051213221657/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/10/09/caseagainstkuchma.shtml Mosnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the press reported that Kuchma had been unofficially granted immunity from prosecution in return for his graceful departure from office in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, David (6 April 2005).

Critics of the tape point to the difficulty of Melnychenko recording 500 hours of dictaphone tape unaided and undetected, the lack of material evidence of said recording equipment, and other doubts which question the authenticity and motive of the release of the tape. Kuchma acknowledged in 2003 that his voice was one of those on the tapes, but claimed the tapes had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NI1G_9j1AhcC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;dq=Kuchma+edited&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k6gET6P_DZGSOrKj4aIB&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kuchma%20edited&amp;f=false ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004]'', ([[Europa Publications]]), [[Routledge]], December 12, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85743-187-1}} (page 504)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the election crisis of 2004===
Kuchma's role in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|election crisis of 2004]] is not entirely clear. After the second round on 22 November 2004, it appeared that Yanukovych had won the election by fraud, which caused the opposition and independent observers to dispute the results, leading to the [[Orange Revolution]].

Kuchma was urged by Yanukovych and [[Viktor Medvedchuk]] (the head of the presidential office) to declare a [[state of emergency]] and hold the inauguration of Yanukovych. He denied the request. Later, Yanukovych publicly accused Kuchma of a betrayal. Kuchma refused to officially dismiss Prime Minister Yanukovych after the parliament passed a [[motion of no confidence]] against the Cabinet on 1 December 2004. Soon after, Kuchma left the country. He returned to Ukraine in March 2005.

Kuchma said in October 2009 he would vote for Victor Yanukovych at the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/50751 Kuchma says he'll vote for Yanukovych as Ukraine's president], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (16 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In a document dated 2 February 2010 uncovered during the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], Kuchma in conversation with [[United States Ambassador to Ukraine]] [[John F. Tefft]], called the voters' choice between Yanukovych and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] during the second round of the 2010 presidential election as a choice between "bad and very bad" and praised (the candidate eliminated in the first round of the election) [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] instead.&lt;ref name="WLKuchmalovesYatsenyuk"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/92047/ "Kuchma: Yanukovych-Tymoshenko contest a choice between 'bad and very bad'"], ''Kyiv Post'' (3 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 Kuchma stated that he believed that Yanukovych was the real winner of the 2004 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/113012/ Kuchma: Orange Revolution defines Ukrainians as Europeans], [[Kyiv Post]] (17 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency==
Leonid Kuchma has been active in politics since his presidency ended. He aligned himself with President Viktor Yushchenko in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Kuchma backs Yushchenko in Ukraine turmoil|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/af8c01b8-2329-11da-86cc-00000e2511c8.html#axzz3ssVRmPKn|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2005-09-12|access-date = 2016-01-13|issn = 0307-1766|first = Tom|last = Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later raised concerns about the president in correspondence with then U.S. Ambassador to the Ukraine, [[John F.

On 11, February 2015, Kuchma was one of the signatories of a draft plan to end the conflict in Donbas. The summit was known as [[Minsk II]]. The plan ensured that a ceasefire was implemented and reaction from leaders in Europe was generally positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ukraine crisis: Leaders agree peace roadmap - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31435812|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-13|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuchma decommissioned the Chernobyl power plant's reactor.{{when|date=July 2017}}{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In September, 2015 Kuchma was again appointed as the representative for Ukraine at the [[Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine|Trilateral Contact Group]].  The group met in [[Belarus]] to discuss ending the conflict in Donbas. The choice of Kuchma comes nearly a decade after his presidency ended.

Kuchma was an amateur guitar player in his younger years. He was also known for his skill at the complicated [[card game]] ''[[preferans]].''

In 2003, he published his book ''[[Ukraine is not Russia]]'' ([[:uk:Україна — не Росія|uk]]).

After retirement, Kuchma was allowed to keep the state-owned [[dacha]] in [[Koncha-Zaspa]] for his personal use upon completion of his state duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66006/ Ukrayinska Pravda exposes president’s Mezhygirya deal], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The government order #15-r that would allow for Kuchma to keep his estate was signed by the acting prime-minister [[Mykola Azarov]] on 19 January 2005.

{{main|George Washington}}
The '''military career of George Washington''' spanned over forty years of service.  Washington's service can be broken into three periods ([[French and Indian War]], [[American Revolutionary War]], and the [[Quasi-War]] with [[France]]) with service in three different armed forces (British provincial militia, the [[Continental Army]], and the [[United States Army]]).

Because of Washington's importance in the early [[history of the United States of America]], he was granted a posthumous promotion to [[General of the Armies of the United States]], legislatively defined to be the highest possible rank in the US Army, more than 175 years after his death.

==French and Indian War service==
[[File:Washington Pennsylvania Mapb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Washington's 1754 map showing [[Ohio River]] and surrounding region]]
{{Main|George Washington in the French and Indian War}}

Virginia's Royal Governor, [[Robert Dinwiddie]], appointed Washington a major in the provincial militia in February 1753.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2000), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 1:268&lt;/ref&gt; In that year the French began expanding their military control into the "[[Ohio Country]]", a territory also claimed by the British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania.  These competing claims led to a world war 1756–63 (called the [[French and Indian War]] in the colonies and the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe) and Washington was at the center of its beginning. The Ohio Company was one vehicle through which British investors planned to expand into the territory, opening new settlements and building trading posts for the Indian trade.  Governor Dinwiddie received orders from the British government to warn the French of British claims, and sent Major Washington in late 1753 to deliver a letter informing the French of those claims and asking them to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, pp. 1:274–327&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington also met with [[Tanacharison]] (also called "Half-King") and other Iroquois leaders allied to Virginia at [[Logstown]] to secure their support in case of conflict with the French; Washington and Half-King became friends and allies.  Washington delivered the letter to the local French commander, who politely refused to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the Ohio Country to protect an Ohio Company group building a fort at present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].  Before he reached the area, a French force drove out the company's crew and began construction of [[Fort Duquesne]].  With [[Mingo]] allies led by Tanacharison, Washington and some of his militia unit [[Battle of Jumonville Glen|ambushed a French scouting party]] of some 30 men, led by [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]]; Jumonville was killed, and there are contradictory accounts of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. 31–38&lt;/ref&gt;  The French responded by [[Battle of Fort Necessity|attacking and capturing Washington at Fort Necessity]] in July 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Grizzard, pp. 115–119&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed to return with his troops to Virginia.  The experience demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience and impetuosity.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The governor promised land bounties to the soldiers and officers who volunteered in 1754; Virginia finally made good on the promise in the early 1770s, with Washington receiving title to 23,200 acres near where the [[Kanawha River]] flows into the [[Ohio River]], in what is now western West Virginia. Grizzard, pp. 135–137&lt;/ref&gt;  These events had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission similar to Washington's 1753 mission.&lt;ref name="Ellis, p. 14"&gt;Ellis, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Both France and Britain responded by sending troops to North America in 1755, although war was not formally declared until 1756.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2005), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Braddock disaster 1755===
[[File:Braddock's death at the Battle of Monongahela 9-July-1755.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Major-General Braddock's death at the Battle of the Monongahela, July 9, 1755.]]
In 1755, Washington was the senior Colonial aide to British General [[Edward Braddock]] on the ill-fated [[Braddock Expedition]]. This was at the time the largest ever British military expedition ventured into the colonies, and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country.  The French and their Indian allies were able to ambush the expedition, mowing down over 900 casualties including the mortally-wounded Braddock.  During what became known as the [[Battle of the Monongahela]], British troops retreated in disarray but Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces to an organized retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title = The Battle of the Monongahela |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1755 |accessdate = 2013-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commander of Virginia Regiment===
[[File:Washington 1772.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]]. Painted in 1772, it depicts Washington as colonel of the [[Virginia Regiment]], and is his earliest known likeness.]]
Governor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington in 1755 with a commission as "Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty's Colony" and gave him the task of defending Virginia's frontier.  The Virginia Regiment was the first full-time American military unit in the colonies (as opposed to part-time militias and the British regular units). Washington was ordered to "act defensively or offensively" as he thought best.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, ''George Washington: the Forge of Experience, 1732–1775'' (1965), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;  In command of a thousand soldiers, Washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training.  He led his men in brutal campaigns against the Indians in the west; in 10 months units of his regiment fought 20 battles, and lost a third of its men.  Washington's strenuous efforts meant that Virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies; Ellis concludes "it was his only unqualified success" in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1758, Washington participated in the [[Forbes Expedition]] to capture Fort Duquesne.  He was embarrassed by a [[friendly fire]] episode in which his unit and another British unit thought the other was the French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap.  In the end there was no real fighting for the  French abandoned the fort and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley.  Upon his return to Virginia, Washington resigned his commission in December 1758, and did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. 75–76, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Washington never gained the commission in the British army he yearned for, in these years he gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills,&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, ch. 8; Freeman and Harwell, pp. 135–139; Flexner (1984), pp. 32–36;  Ellis, ch. 1; Higginbotham (1985), ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and received significant public exposure in the colonies and abroad.&lt;ref name="Ellis, p. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OM45&gt;O'Meara, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  He closely observed British military tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution.  He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats.  He developed a command presence—given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, pp. 38,69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Washington learned to organize, train, and drill, and discipline his companies and regiments.  From his observations, readings and conversations with professional officers, he learned the basics of battlefield tactics, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1985), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1985), pp. 22–25&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of about 1,000 men, and came only in remote frontier conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Harwell, pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lessons learned===
Washington never gained the commission in the British army that he yearned for, but in these years he gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills,{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=91—93}} closely observing their tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution. He learned the basics of battlefield tactics from his observations, readings, and conversations with professional officers, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics.{{sfn|Higginbotham|1985|pp=14–15}} He gained an understanding of overall strategy, especially in locating strategic geographical points.{{sfn|Lengel|2005|p=80}}

Washington demonstrated his resourcefulness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats. He developed a command presence, given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, which demonstrated to soldiers that he was a natural leader whom they could follow without question.{{sfnm|Ellis|2004|1pp=38, 69||Fischer|2004|2p=13}} Washington's fortitude in his early years was sometimes manifested in less constructive ways. Biographer John R. Alden contends that Washington offered "fulsome and insincere flattery to British generals in vain attempts to win great favor" and on occasion showed youthful arrogance, as well as jealousy and ingratitude in the midst of impatience.{{sfn|Alden|1993|p=70}}

==American Revolutionary War service==
{{main|George Washington in the American Revolution}}
As political tensions rose in the colonies, Washington in June 1774 chaired the meeting at which the "[[Fairfax Resolves]]" were adopted, which called for, among other things, the convening of a [[Continental Congress]]. In August, Washington attended the [[First Virginia Convention]], where he was selected as a delegate to the [[First Continental Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (1998), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;  As tensions rose further in 1774, he assisted in the training of county militias in Virginia and organized enforcement of the boycott of British goods instituted by the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (1998), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boston===
{{main|Boston campaign}}
After the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] near Boston in April 1775, the colonies went to war.  Washington appeared at the [[Second Continental Congress]] in a military uniform, signaling that he was prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress created the [[Continental Army]] on June 14, 1775. Nominated by [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts, who chose him in part because he was a Virginian and would thus draw the southern colonies into the conflict, Washington was then appointed General and [[Commander-in-chief]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell (1983), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SiegeBoston.jpg|thumb|left|British forces evacuate the city at the end of the [[Siege of Boston]]]]
Washington assumed command of the colonial forces outside Boston on July 3, 1775 (coincidentally making July 4 his first full-day as Commander-in-chief), during the ongoing [[siege of Boston]].  His first steps were to establish procedures and to weld what had begun as militia regiments into an effective fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. 105–109&lt;/ref&gt;

When inventory returns exposed a dangerous shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. British arsenals were raided (including some in the West Indies) and some manufacturing was attempted; a barely adequate supply (about 2.5 million pounds) was obtained by the end of 1776, mostly from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Orlando W|title=The Supply of Gunpowder in 1776|journal=American Historical Review |volume=30 |issue=2|date=January 1925|pages=271–281|jstor=1836657}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In search of heavy weapons, he sent [[Henry Knox]] on [[Noble train of artillery|an expedition]] to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] to retrieve cannons that [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|had been captured there]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  He resisted repeated calls from Congress to launch attacks against the British in Boston, calling war councils that supported the decisions against such action.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, pp. 53, 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the [[Continental Navy]] was established in November 1775 he, without Congressional authorization, began arming a "secret navy" to prey on poorly protected British transports and supply ships.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  When Congress authorized an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Washington authorized [[Benedict Arnold]] to [[Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec|lead a force]] from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] to [[Quebec City]] through the wilderness of present-day [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

As the siege dragged on, the matter of expiring enlistments became a matter of serious concern.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington tried to convince Congress that enlistments longer than one year were necessary to build an effective fighting force, but he was rebuffed in this effort.  The 1776 establishment of the Continental Army only had enlistment terms of one year, a matter that would again be a problem in late 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington finally forced the British to withdraw from Boston by putting Henry Knox's artillery on [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights]] overlooking the city, and preparing in detail to attack the city from Cambridge if the British tried to assault the position.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner (1968), pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;  The British [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuated Boston]] and sailed away, although Washington did not know they were headed for [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, pp. 91–105&lt;/ref&gt;  Believing they were headed for New York City (which was indeed Major General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe's]] eventual destination), Washington rushed most of the army there.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, pp. 67–90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeated at New York City===
{{main|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
Washington's success in Boston was not repeated in New York.  Recognizing the city's importance as a naval base and gateway to the [[Hudson River]], he delegated the task of fortifying New York to [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] in February 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the city's poor defensibility, Congress insisted that Washington defend it. The faltering military campaign in Quebec also led to calls for additional troops there, and Washington detached six regiments northward under [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] in April.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington had to deal with his first major command controversy while in New York, which was partially a product of regional friction.  New England troops serving in northern New York under General [[Philip Schuyler]], a scion of an old [[patroon]] family of New York, objected to his aristocratic style, and their Congressional representatives lobbied Washington to replace Schuyler with [[Horatio Gates]]. Washington tried to quash the issue by giving Gates command of the forces in Quebec, but the collapse of the Quebec expedition brought renewed complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner (1968), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Gates' experience, Washington personally preferred Schuyler, and put Gates in a role subordinate to Schuyler. The episode exposed Washington to Gates' desire for advancement, possibly at his expense, and to the latter's influence in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner (1968), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

General Howe's army, reinforced by thousands of additional troops from Europe and a fleet under the command of his brother, Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]], began arriving off New York in early July, and made an unopposed landing on [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Without intelligence about Howe's intentions, Washington was forced to divide his still poorly trained forces, principally between Manhattan and Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 83–89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retreat from long island.jpg|thumb|left|Washington leads the retreat from Long Island]]
In August, the British finally launched their [[New York and New Jersey campaign|campaign to capture New York City]]. They first landed on Long Island in force, and flanked Washington's forward positions in the [[Battle of Long Island]]. Howe refused to act on a significant tactical advantage that could have resulted in the capture of the remaining Continental troops on Long Island, but he chose instead to besiege their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 89–102&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of a siege he seemed certain to lose, Washington then decided to withdraw. In what some historians call one of his greatest military feats, executed a nighttime withdrawal from Long Island across the [[East River]] to Manhattan to save those troops.&lt;ref name=F1027/&gt;

The Howe brothers then paused to consolidate their position, and the admiral engaged in a [[Staten Island Peace Conference|fruitless peace conference]] with Congressional representatives on September 11. Four days later the British [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed on Manhattan]], scattering inexperienced militia into a panicked retreat, and forcing Washington to retreat further.&lt;ref name=F1027&gt;Fischer, pp. 102–107&lt;/ref&gt; After Washington stopped the British advance up Manhattan [[Battle of Harlem Heights|at Harlem Heights]] on September 16, Howe again made a flanking maneuver, landing troops [[Battle of Pell's Point|at Pell's Point]] in a bid to cut off Washington's avenue of retreat. To defend against this move, Washington withdrew most of his army to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], where [[Battle of White Plains|after a short battle]] on October 28 he retreated further north.  This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan, so Howe returned to Manhattan and [[Battle of Fort Washington|captured]] [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]] in mid November, taking almost 3,000 prisoners. Four days later, [[Fort Lee Historic Park|Fort Lee]], across the Hudson River from Fort Washington, was also taken. Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey, but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 107–125&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign a general lack of organization, shortages of supplies, fatigue, sickness, and above all, lack of confidence in the American leadership resulted in a melting away of untrained regulars and frightened militia. Washington grumbled, "The honor of making a brave defense does not seem to be sufficient stimulus, when the success is very doubtful, and the falling into the Enemy's hands probable."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterattack in New Jersey===
[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]],'' by [[Emanuel Leutze]], 1851]]
After the loss of New York, Washington's army was in two pieces.  One detachment remained north of New York to protect the Hudson River corridor, while Washington retreated across New Jersey into Pennsylvania, chased by General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles, Earl Cornwallis]].&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, pp. 259–263&lt;/ref&gt;  Spirits were low, popular support was wavering, and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia, fearing a British attack.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 138–142&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington ordered General Gates to bring troops from Fort Ticonderoga, and also ordered General Lee's troops, which he had left north of New York City, to join him.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the loss of troops due to desertion and expiring enlistments, Washington was heartened by a rise in militia enlistments in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 196–200&lt;/ref&gt;  These militia companies were active in circumscribing the furthest outposts of the British, limiting their ability to scout and forage.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum, pp. 228–230&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Washington did not coordinate this resistance, he took advantage of it to organize an attack on an outpost of [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]]s in Trenton.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;  On the night of December&amp;nbsp;25–26, 1776, Washington led his forces [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|across the Delaware River]] and [[Battle of Trenton|surprised the Hessian garrison]], capturing 1,000 Hessians.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum pp. 250–275&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WashingtonPeale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''George Washington at Princeton'' by [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1779]]
This action significantly boosted the army's morale, but it also brought Cornwallis out of New York.  He reassembled an army of more than 6,000 men, and marched most of them against a position Washington had taken south of Trenton. Leaving a garrison of 1,200 at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], Cornwallis then [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|attacked Washington's position]] on January 2, 1777, and was three times repulsed before darkness set in.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 209–307&lt;/ref&gt;  During the night Washington evacuated the position, masking his army's movements by instructing the camp guards to maintain the appearance of a much larger force.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington then circled around Cornwallis's position with the intention of attacking the Princeton garrison.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Mercer]], leading the American advance guard, encountered British soldiers from Princeton under the command of [[Charles Mawhood]]. The British troops engaged Mercer and in [[Battle of Princeton|the ensuing battle]], Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]], which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the great victory.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

These unexpected victories drove the British back to the New York City area, and gave a dramatic boost to Revolutionary morale.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 333–335&lt;/ref&gt;  During the winter, Washington, based in winter quarters at [[Morristown, New Jersey]], loosely coordinated a low-level [[Forage War|militia war]] against British positions in New Jersey, combining the actions of New Jersey and Pennsylvania militia companies with careful use of Continental Army resources to harry and harass the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 354–382&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington's mixed performance in the 1776 campaigns had not led to significant criticism in Congress.&lt;ref name=Ferling125&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Before fleeing Philadelphia for [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] in December, Congress granted Washington powers that have ever since been described as "dictatorial".&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  The successes in New Jersey nearly deified Washington in the eyes of some Congressmen, and the body became much more deferential to him as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington's performance also received international notice: [[Frederick the Great]], one of the greatest military minds, wrote that "the achievements of Washington [at Trenton and Princeton] were the most brilliant of any recorded in the history of military achievements."&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of Philadelphia===
{{main|Philadelphia campaign|Saratoga campaign}}

In May 1777, the British resumed military operations, with General Howe attempting without success to draw Washington from his defensive position in New Jersey's [[Watchung Mountains]], while General [[John Burgoyne]] led an army south from Quebec toward [[Albany, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 344–346&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Burgoyne's [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] without resistance in early July, General Howe boarded a large part of his army on transports and sailed off, leaving Washington mystified as to his destination.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington dispatched some of his troops north to assist in Albany's defense, and moved most of the rest his forces south of Philadelphia when it became clear that was Howe's target.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gen. Sir William Howe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]]]
Congress, at the urging of its diplomatic representatives in Europe, had also issued military commissions to a number of European soldiers of fortune in early 1777.  Two of those recommended by [[Silas Deane]], the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] and [[Thomas Conway]], would prove to be important in Washington's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  Lafayette, just twenty years old, was at first told that Deane had exceeded his authority in offering him a major general's commission, but offered to volunteer in the army at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 342–343&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington and Lafayette took an instant liking to one another when they met, and Lafayette became one of Washington's most trusted generals and confidants.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt;  Conway, on the other hand, did not think highly of Washington's leadership, and proved to be a source of trouble in the 1777 campaign season and its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. xxii,xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

General Howe landed his troops south of Philadelphia at the northern end of [[Chesapeake Bay]], and turned Washington's flank at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777.  After further maneuvers, Washington was forced to retreat away from the city, allowing British troops to march unopposed into Philadelphia on September 26.  Washington's failure to defend the capital brought on a storm of criticism from Congress, which fled the city for [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], and from other army officers.  In part to silence his critics, Washington planned an elaborate assault on an exposed British base in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]].&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 356–358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;  The October 4 [[Battle of Germantown]] failed in part due to the complexity of the assault, and the inexperience of the militia forces employed in it.&lt;ref name="Leckie, p. 359–363"&gt;Leckie, p. 359–363&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 400 of Washington's troops were captured, including Colonel [[George Mathews (Georgia)|George Mathews]] and the entire [[9th Virginia Regiment]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;Jenkins, Charles F. (1904) ''The Guide Book to Historic Germantown'', Innes &amp; Sons, 1904.Jenkins, Charles F. ''The Guide Book to Historic Germantown'', Innes &amp; Sons, 1904. p 142.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not help that [[Adam Stephen]], leading one of the branches of the attack, was drunk, and broke from the agreed-upon plan of attack.&lt;ref name="Leckie, p. 359–363"/&gt; He was court martialed and cashiered from the army.  Historian Robert Leckie observes that the battle was a near thing, and that a small number of changes might have resulted in a decisive victory for Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The March to Valley Forge William Trego.png|thumb|right|Washington's army as it marches toward [[Valley Forge]]]]
Meanwhile, Burgoyne, out of reach from help from Howe, was trapped and forced to surrender his entire army on October 17, ten days after the [[Battle of Bemis Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 414–416&lt;/ref&gt;  The victory made a hero of General Gates, who received the adulation of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  While this was taking place Washington presided from a distance over the loss of control of the Delaware River to the British, and marched his army to its winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. 263–267&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington chose Valley Forge, over recommendations that he camp either closer or further from Philadelphia, because it was close enough to monitor British army movements, and protected rich farmlands to the west from the enemy's foraging expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valley Forge===
Washington's army stayed at Valley Forge for the next six months.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 435, 469&lt;/ref&gt; Over the winter, 2500-3000 out of 11,000 men died (estimates vary) from disease and exposure.  The army's difficulties were exacerbated by a number of factors, including a quartermaster's department that had been badly mismanaged by one of Washington's political opponents, [[Thomas Mifflin]], and the preference of farmers and merchants to sell their goods to the British, who paid in sterling silver currency instead of the nearly worthless Continental paper currency.&lt;ref name=L435/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;  Profiteers also sought to benefit at the army's expense, charging it 1,000 times what they charged civilians for the same goods.  Congress authorized Washington to seize supplies needed for the army, but he was reluctant to use such authority, since it smacked of the tyranny the war was supposedly being fought over.&lt;ref name=L435&gt;Leckie, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter he introduced a full-scale training program supervised by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff.  Despite the hardships the army suffered, this program was a remarkable success, and Washington's army emerged in the spring of 1778 a much more disciplined force.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 438–444&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington himself had to face discontent at his leadership from a variety of sources.  His loss of Philadelphia prompted some members of Congress to discuss removing him from command.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;  They were prodded along by Washington's detractors in the military, who included Generals Gates, Mifflin, and Conway.&lt;ref name=Chernow320&gt;Chernow, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;  Gates in particular was viewed by Conway and Congressmen [[Benjamin Rush]] and [[Richard Henry Lee]] as a desirable replacement for Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 93–97, 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there is no evidence of a formal conspiracy, the episode is known as the [[Conway Cabal]] because the scale of the discontent within the army was exposed by a critical letter from Conway to Gates, some of whose contents were relayed to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 445–449&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington exposed the criticisms to Congress, and his supporters, within Congress and the army, rallied to support him.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, pp. 317–320&lt;/ref&gt;  Gates eventually apologized for his role in the affair, and Conway resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington's position and authority were not seriously challenged again.  Biographer Ron Chernow points out that Washington's handling of the episode demonstrated that he was "a consummate political infighter" who maintained his temper and dignity while his opponents schemed.&lt;ref name=Chernow320/&gt;

===French entry into the war===
The victory at Saratoga (and to some extent Washington's near success at Germantown) were influential in convincing France to enter the war openly [[Franco-American alliance|as an American ally]].  French entry into the war changed its dynamics, for the British were no longer sure of command of the seas and had to worry about an invasion of their home islands and other colonial territories across the globe. The British, now under the command of General Sir [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]], evacuated Philadelphia in 1778 and returned to New York City, with Washington attacking them along the way at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]; this was the last major battle in the north.  Prior to the battle Washington gave command of the advance forces to Charles Lee, who had been exchanged earlier in the year.  Lee, despite firm instructions from Washington, refused Lafayette's suggestion to launch an organized attack on the British rear, and then retreated when the British turned to face him. When Washington arrived at the head of the main army, he and Lee had an angry exchange of words, and Washington ordered Lee off the command.  Washington, with his army's tactics and ability to execute improved by the training programs of the previous winter, was able to recover, and fought the British to a draw.  Lee was court martialed and eventually dismissed from the army.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 467–489&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Washington at Monmouth, 06-28-1778 - 06-28-1778 - NARA - 532864 - cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Washington at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]]]
The war in the north was effectively stalemated for the next few years.  The British successfully defended [[Newport, Rhode Island]] against a Franco-American invasion attempt that was frustrated by bad weather and difficulties in cooperation between the allies.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, pp. 5:50–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;  British and Indian forces organized and supported by Sir [[Frederick Haldimand]] in Quebec began to [[Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga|raid frontier settlements]] in 1778, and [[Savannah, Georgia]] was [[Capture of Savannah|captured]] late in the year.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 492–493&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the frontier activity Washington organised a major expedition against the [[Iroquois]] in the summer of 1779.  In the [[Sullivan Expedition]], a sizable force under Major General John Sullivan drove the Iroquois from their lands in northwestern New York in reprisal for the frontier raids.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 493–495&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WayneAtStonyPoint1779.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Anthony Wayne]] leading forces at the 1779 [[Battle of Stony Point]]]]
Washington's opponent in New York was  also active.  Clinton engaged in a number of amphibious raids against coastal communities from [[Tryon's raid|Connecticut]] to [[Chesapeake raid|Chesapeake Bay]], and probed at Washington's defenses in the Hudson River valley.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2010), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;  Coming up the river in force, he captured the key outpost of [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]], but advanced no further.  When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organized a counterstrike.  General Anthony Wayne led a force that, solely using the bayonet, [[Battle of Stony Point|recaptured Stony Point]].&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;  The Americans chose not to hold the post, but the operation was a boost to American morale and a blow to British morale.  American morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when the second major attempt at Franco-American cooperation, [[Siege of Savannah|an attempt to retake Savannah]], failed with heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 503–504&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficult times===
The winter of 1779–80 was one of the coldest in recorded colonial history.  New York Harbor froze over, and the winter camps of the Continental Army were deluged with snow, resulting in hardships exceeding those experienced at Valley Forge.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;  The war was declining in popularity, and the inflationary issuance of paper currency by Congress and the states alike harmed the economy, and the ability to provision the army.  The paper currency also hit the army's morale, since it was how the troops were paid.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sirhenryclinton2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]]]]
The British in late 1779 embarked on a new strategy based on the assumption that most Southerners were Loyalists at heart.  General Clinton withdrew the British garrison from Newport, and marshalled a force of more than 10,000 men that in the first half of 1780 successfully [[Siege of Charleston|besieged Charleston, South Carolina]].  In June 1780 he captured over 5,000 Continental soldiers and militia in the single worst defeat of the war for the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 496, 507–517&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington had at the end of March pessimistically dispatched several regiments troops southward from his army, hoping they might have some effect in what he saw as a looming disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 5:155&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington's army suffered from numerous problems in 1780: it was undermanned, underfunded, and underequipped.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, pp. 5:152–155&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of these shortcomings Washington resisted calls for major expeditions, preferring to remain focused on the principal British presence in New York.  Knowledge of discontent within the ranks in New Jersey prompted the British in New York to make two attempts to reach the principal army base at Morristown.  These attempts were defeated, with significant militia support, in battles at [[Battle of Connecticut Farms|Connecticut Farms]] and [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Springfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, pp. 5:169–173&lt;/ref&gt;

September 1780 brought a new shock to Washington.  British Major [[John André]] had been arrested outside New York, and papers he carried exposed a conspiracy between the British and General Benedict Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, pp. 5:196–295&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington respected Arnold for his military skills, and had, after Arnold's severe injuries in the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, given him the military command of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;  During his administration there, Arnold had made many political enemies, and in 1779 he began secret negotiations with General Clinton (mediated in part by André) that culminated in a plot to surrender [[West Point]], a command Arnold requested and Washington gave him in July 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 549–569&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold was alerted to André's arrest and fled to the British lines shortly before Washington's arrival at West Point for a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;  In negotiations with Clinton, Washington offered to exchange André for Arnold, but Clinton refused.  André was hanged as a spy, and Arnold became a brigadier general in the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pp. 578–581&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington organized an attempt to kidnap Arnold from New York City; it was frustrated when Arnold was sent on a raiding expedition to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

===Espionage===
Washington was successful in developing an espionage network, the kept track of the British and loyalist forces, well misleading the enemy into the strength of the American and French positions, and their intentions. British intelligence, by contrast, was poorly done.  Many prominent loyalists had fled to London, where they convinced Lord Jermaine and other top officials that there was a large potential loyalist fighting force that would rise up and join the British as soon as they were in the vicinity.  This was entirely false, but the British relied upon it heavily, especially in the southern campaigns of 1780-81, leading to their disasters.  Washington deceived the British in New York City marching his entire army, the entire French Army, around the city all the way to Virginia, where they surprised Cornwallis and his army. &lt;ref&gt;George J.A. O'Toole, ''Honorable Treachery: A History of US Intelligence, Espionage, and Covert Action from the American Revolution to the CIA'' (2014) ch 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest failure of British intelligence was the misunderstanding between the senior command in London, and New York regarding the need to support Burgoyne's invasion of New York.  British communication failures and lack of intelligence on what was happening led to the surrender of Burgoyne's entire army.&lt;ref&gt;Jared B. Harty, "George Washington: Spymaster and General Who Saved the American Revolution" (Staff paper  No. ATZL-SWV. Army Command And General Staff College Fort Leavenworth, School Of Advanced Military Studies, 2012) [http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA566174 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington used systematic reconnaissance on enemy positions by scouts and sponsored Major Benjamin Tallmadge who set up the Culper spy ring. Washington distrusted double agents, and was fooled by Benedict Arnold's treachery.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lengel, "Patriots Under Cover." ''American History'' 51.2 (2016): 26+. &lt;/ref&gt; Washington paid close attention to espionage reports, and acted on them.  He made sure his intelligence officers briefed one another; he did not insist on prior approval of their plans. His intelligence system became an essential arm in molding the Americans partisan style asymmetrical strategy. This laid the groundwork in the 1790s for Washington to formulate intelligence gathering as an important tool in presidential power.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Halverson, "Dangerous Patriots: Washington's Hidden Army during the American Revolution."

===Victory===

[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|Depiction by [[John Trumbull]] of the surrender of Lord Cornwallis's army at Yorktown]]

A British army under General Cornwallis, fighting its way through the Carolinas and Virginia, made its way to Yorktown to be evacuated by the British Navy. Washington coordinated an elaborate operation whereby both the French army in New England and the American Army in New York slipped off to Virginia without the British noticing. Cornwallis found himself surrounded, and a [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory against the British rescue fleet]] dashed his hopes. The [[siege of Yorktown|surrender of Cornwallis to Washington]] on October 17, 1781 marked the end of serious fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Selig,  "Washington, Rochambeau, and the Yorktown Campaign of 1781." in Edward G. Lengel, ed. ''A Companion to George Washington,'' (2012) pp: 266–287.&lt;/ref&gt; In London, the war party lost control of parliament, and the British negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] That ended the war. Hoping to gain the United States as a major trading partner, the British offered surprisingly generous terms.

Washington designed the American strategy for victory.  It enabled Continental forces to maintain their strength for six years and to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Some historians have lauded Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army, coordination with the Congress, with state governors and their militia, and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. On the day of battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals. Washington was not a great battlefield tactician; he sometimes planned operations that were too complicated for his amateur officers to execute. However, his overall strategy proved to be successful: keep control of 90% of the population at all times (including suppression of the Loyalist civilian population); keep the army intact; avoid decisive battles; and look for an opportunity to capture an outnumbered enemy army. Washington was a military conservative: he preferred building a [[regular army]] on the European model and fighting a [[conventional war]], and often complained about the undisciplined American militia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Rider, "George Washington: America's First Soldier," in Edward G. Lengel, ed. ''A Companion to George Washington,'' (2012) pp: 378–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brumwell, ''George Washington: Gentleman Warrior'' (2013)

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
[[File:General George Washington Resigning his Commission.jpg|thumb|left|''[[General George Washington Resigning His Commission]]'', by [[John Trumbull]]]]
One of Washington's most important contributions as commander-in-chief was to establish the precedent that civilian-elected officials, rather than military officers, possessed ultimate [[Civilian control of the military|authority over the military]]. This was a key principle of Republicanism, but could easily have been violated by Washington.  Throughout the war, he deferred to the authority of Congress and state officials, and he relinquished his considerable military power once the fighting was over. In March 1783, Washington used his influence to disperse a [[Newburgh conspiracy|group of Army officers]] who had threatened to confront Congress regarding their back pay. Washington disbanded his army and announced his intent to resign from public life in his "Farewell Orders to the Armies of the United States."  A few days later, on November 25, 1783, the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British evacuated New York City]], and Washington and the governor took possession of the city; at [[Fraunces Tavern]] in the city on December 4, he formally bade his officers farewell. On December 23, 1783, [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief]] to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;William M. Fowler Jr, ''American crisis: George Washington and the dangerous two years after Yorktown, 1781–1783'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quasi-War service==
{{main|Quasi-War}}
In the fall of 1798, Washington became immersed in the business of creating a military force to deal with the [[Quasi War|threat of an all-out war]] with France.  President John Adams asked him to resume the post of commander-in-chief and to raise an army in the event war broke out.  Washington agreed, stipulating that he would only serve in the field if it became absolutely necessary, and if he could choose his subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;  Disputes arose over the relative rankings of his chosen command.  Washington selected [[Alexander Hamilton]] as his inspector general and second in command, followed by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and Henry Knox.  This hierarchy was an inversion of the ranks these men had held during the revolution.  Adams wanted to reverse the order, giving Knox the most important role, but Washington was insistent, threatening to resign if his choices were not approved.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, pp. 360–362&lt;/ref&gt;  He prevailed, but the episode noticeably cooled his relationship with Henry Knox, and impaired Adams' relations with his cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution of this affair brought no opportunity for rest: Washington engaged in the tedious task of finding officers for the new military formations.  In the spring of 1799, the relaxation of tensions between France and the United States allowed Washington to redirect his attention to his personal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Lengel, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous promotion==
George Washington died on December 14, 1799, at the age of 67.  Upon his passing he was listed as a retired [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] on the rolls of the US Army. Over the next 177 years, various officers surpassed Washington in rank, including most notably [[John J. Pershing]], who was promoted to [[General of the Armies]] for his role in [[World War I]].  With effect from 4 July 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the same rank by authority of a congressional joint resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]]&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution stated that Washington's seniority had rank and precedence over all other grades of the Armed Forces, past or present, effectively making Washington the highest ranked U.S. officer of all time.&lt;ref name="GEN WASHINGTON"&gt;Bell, William Gardner; COMMANDING GENERALS AND CHIEFS OF STAFF: 1775–2005; Portraits &amp; Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer: 1983, CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY; UNITED STATES ARMY; WASHINGTON, D.C.: {{ISBN|0-16-072376-0}} : pp 52 &amp; 66&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical evaluations==
Historians debate whether Washington preferred to fight major battles or to utilize a [[Fabian strategy]]{{efn|The term comes from the Roman strategy used by General Fabius against Hannibal's invasion in the [[Second Punic War]].}} to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks followed by a retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him.{{efn|Ferling and Ellis argue that Washington favored Fabian tactics, and Higginbotham denies it.{{sfnm|Ferling|2010|1pp=212, 264|Ellis|2004|2p=11|Higginbotham|1971|3p=211}}.}} His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.{{sfn|Buchanan|2004|p=226}}

He made his theatrical debut a year before graduating, at the [[Bulandra Theatre|Bulandra Theater]], in [[Truman Capote]]'s ''[[The Grass Harp]]''. His screen debut came in [[Dan Pița]]'s ''[[Nunta de piatră]]'' (1972); he would later appear in the same director's ''[[Filip cel Bun]]'' (1975). Other directors with whom he has worked include [[Alexandru Tatos]] (''[[Mere roșii]]'', 1975; ''[[Secvențe]]'', 1982; and ''[[Secretul armei secrete]]'', 1988), [[Virgil Calotescu]] (''[[Buletin de București]]'', 1982; and ''[[Căsătorie cu repetiție]]'', 1985), [[Nae Caranfil]] (''[[Asfalt Tango]]'', 1996; and ''[[Filantropica]]'', 2002) and [[Cătălin Mitulescu]] (''[[The Way I Spent the End of the World]]'', 2006). In all, he has appeared in more than sixty films.&lt;ref name="propus"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/actorul-mircea-diaconu-propus-sefia-ministerului-culturii-finalul-unui-mandat-senator-marcat-conflicte-1_50aee8137c42d5a663a1970c/index.html "Actorul Mircea Diaconu, propus la şefia Ministerului Culturii, la finalul unui mandat de senator marcat de conflicte"], ''Adevărul'', 1 May 2012; accessed 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaconu worked with [[Lucian Pintilie]] both in film (the 1981 ''[[De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?]]'') and in theater: [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' at Bulandra, and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[As You Like It]]'' at the [[Nottara Theater]]. [[Liviu Ciulei]] hired him at Bulandra in 1972, and he remained there for a decade, before moving on to Nottara. At Bulandra, he appeared in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'', both under Ciulei's direction; and in [[Marin Sorescu]]'s ''Răceala'', directed by Dan Micu. At Nottara, he appeared in [[Alexander Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[The Forest (play)|The Forest]]''; ''Ultimul bal'', after [[Liviu Rebreanu]]'s ''[[Forest of the Hanged (novel)|Forest of the Hanged]]''; and Mihai Ispirescu's ''Într-o dimineață''. He became the director of Nottara Theater in 2004, working as such until his resignation in 2011.&lt;ref name="propus"/&gt;

[[File:1989 Revolutia Mircea Diaconu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Diaconu (with microphone) during the [[Romanian Revolution]]]]
A participant in the [[Romanian Revolution]], he was rehearsing a play at Nottara when [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s [[Ceaușescu's final speech|final speech]] began on 21 December 1989. During the day, he and his colleagues organized students to go to area factories and urge workers to declare an immediate strike. He spent the night outdoors with students, believing that, although the uprising lacked familiar leaders who could be trusted, the crowd at least recognized popular actors' faces. During the night, [[Securitate]] secret police fired through apartment windows, while the next morning, Diaconu saw that agents had quietly killed people with [[brass knuckles]]. However, he soon noticed that a revolution was in full swing, the boulevards leading to the city center packed with advancing workers who had trapped two tanks, one of which he rode to the Central Committee building from which Ceaușescu had spoken the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Frankland, ''The Patriots' Revolution: How Eastern Europe Toppled Communism and Won Its Freedom'', p.328-29. I.R. Dee, 1992, {{ISBN|978-156663-035-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he was among several figures to appear before a microphone in [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Palace Square]]. Addressing a throng chanting anti-Ceaușescu slogans, he repeated an appeal for calm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre Țurlea]], ''Din culisele Parlamentului României: 1990-1992'', p.9. Editura Globus, 1994, {{ISBN|978-973490-053-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 he became the country's first actor to resign his contract with a theater and become a freelancer. Other theaters with which he has appeared include Theatrum Mundi and the [[National Theatre Bucharest]]. He taught acting at his alma mater between 1977 and 1978, and again from 1991 to 1998. He wrote three books that appeared under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].&lt;ref name="propus"/&gt; The first, ''Șugubina'' (1977), is a volume of short stories. The second, ''La noi, când vine iarna'', was initially published as a children's book in 1980 and was republished as a novel for adults in 2013. The third, ''Scaunul de pânză al actorului'' (1985), includes sketches about the theatrical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Bianca Burța-Cernat, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Iernile-vrajbei-noastre*articleID_29504-articles_details.html "Iernile vrajbei noastre"], ''Observator Cultural'', nr. 701/November 2013; accessed 27 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He was obliged to join the [[Romanian Communist Party]] during his second year of university, due to the high grades he had achieved.&lt;ref name="final"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/guvernul-ponta--mircea-diaconu--la-ministerul-culturii--la-finalul-unui-mandat-de-senator-nelipsit-de-conflicte-262585 "Mircea Diaconu, la Ministerul Culturii, la finalul unui mandat de senator nelipsit de conflicte"], ''România Liberă'', 1 May 2012; accessed 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
[[File:Mircea Diaconu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Diaconu as [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Culture Minister]]]]
He began his political career in 2008, when he was [[Romanian legislative election, 2008|elected]] to the [[Romanian Senate|Senate]] for Argeș County as a member of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL).&lt;ref name="propus"/&gt; While there, he served on the culture committee;&lt;ref name="final"/&gt; his term expired at [[Romanian legislative election, 2012|the following election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=42&amp;cam=1&amp;leg=2008 Profile] at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site; accessed 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, he was named [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Culture Minister]] in the new [[Victor Ponta]] cabinet,&lt;ref name="propus"/&gt; but was forced out of office the following month when the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice]] ruled there was a conflict of interest between his ministerial position and his managerial role at the theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristian Câmpeanu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/mircea-diaconu-nu-mai-poate-fi-ministru--vezi-de-ce-267928 "Mircea Diaconu nu mai poate fi ministru"], ''România Liberă'', 18 June 2012; accessed 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, when the PNL failed to include him on its list of candidates for [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Romania)|that year's European Parliament election]], Diaconu decided to run as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanialibera.ro/politica/institutii/mircea-diaconu-si-a-dat-demisia-din-pnl--va-candida-ca-independent-la-europarlamentare-329584 "Mircea Diaconu şi-a dat demisia din PNL.

During the campaign, he built up the image of an independent persecuted by bureaucratic institutions determined to keep him out of office, benefiting from favorable media coverage.&lt;ref name="georg"&gt;{{ro icon}} Romulus Georgescu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/politica/partide/mircea-diaconu--rol-jucat-la-perfectie-336682 "Mircea Diaconu, rol jucat la perfecție"], ''România Liberă'', 26 May 2014; accessed 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He won some 380,000 votes or 6.8% of the national total (ahead of two political parties that won seats), assuring him a term as an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/rezultate-partiale-alegeri-europarlamentare-ora-17-00-psd-unpr-pc-37-60-pnl-15-pdl-12-23-live-text-12649917 "Rezultate parțiale alegeri europarlamentare"], Mediafax, 26 May 2014; accessed 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an independent, he was only required to win 3.1% of the vote in order to secure a seat; he obtained double digits in the counties of [[Constanța County|Constanța]] (13.3%) and [[Botoșani County|Botoșani]] (10.4%).&lt;ref name="georg"/&gt; He is thought to have significantly eroded the PNL vote, with one party member, [[Nicolae Robu]], claiming Diaconu cut its performance by nearly half.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/politica/nicolae-robu-pnl-mircea-diaconu-aproape-ca-a-injumatatit-scorul-pnl-669085.html "Nicolae Robu (PNL): Mircea Diaconu aproape că a înjumătăţit scorul PNL"], ''Jurnalul Național'', 26 May 2014; accessed 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Parliament, he sits with the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/politica/mircea-diaconu-face-parte-din-grupul-alde-dar-isi-mentine-statutul-de-independent-671386.html "Mircea Diaconu face parte din grupul ALDE, dar îşi menţine statutul de independent"], ''Jurnalul Național'', 25 June 2014; accessed 18 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and is vice president of the [[European Parliament Committee on Culture and Education|Culture Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Tomescu, [http://www.evz.ro/mircea-diaconu-a-fost-ales-vicepresedinte-al-comisie-de-cultura-si-educatie-din-parlamentul-european.html "Mircea Diaconu a fost ales vicepreşedinte al Comisiei de cultură şi educaţie din Parlamentul European"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 7 July 2014; accessed 18 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammad Tabatabai''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: آیت الله میرزا سید محمد طباطبائی, also known as '''Mohammad Sang-e-laji''',;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;''Sang-e-laj'' (سَنگِلَج) is one of the neighbourhoods of the Old Tehran, not far from the [[Bazar, Tehran|Grand Bazar of Tehran]]. The ''Sang-e-laj Theatre'', one of the oldest theatre halls in Iran, which is still in use, is located in this neighbourhood. For further information, consult the entry [[:fa:سنگلج|''Sang-e-laj'']] in ''The Persian Wikipedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; 22 December 1842 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1920) was one of the leaders of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] who played an important role in the establishment of democracy and rule of law in Iran. He was the son of Sayyed Sādegh Tabātabā'i, one of the influential clerics during the reign of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser ad-Din Shah Qajar]]. His paternal grandfather, Sayyed Mehdi Tabātabā'i, was a reputed clergy in [[Hamedan]].&lt;ref name="zinati"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sayyed Abdollah Behbahāni and Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i |language=Persian |url=http://www.zinati.de/Images/Images/Behbehan%20and%20Tabatabaie.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218173816/http://www.zinati.de/Images/Images/Behbehan%20and%20Tabatabaie.htm |archivedate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the father of Sayyed Sādegh Tabātabā'i editor of ''Ruznāmeh-ye Majles'', the [[Majles of Iran|Majles]] newspaper. 

He is entombed inside a family [[tomb]] in [[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine]] in [[Rey, Iran|Rey]].

==Biography==
Mirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i was born in Karbala, [[Iraq]]. The family moved to Hamedan when he was two years old, and to Tehran, when he was eight. He received education in the sciences, (Arabic) literature, Islamic jurisprudence and doctrines from his father, and [[philosophy]] from Mirzā Abol-Hasan Jelveh. For a period of time he was also a pupil of Sahaikh Hadi Najmābādi.&lt;ref name="zinati"/&gt;
The latter has been the spiritual father of a number of individuals who later played significant roles in bringing about the Constitutional Revolution of Iran, such as [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]] and [[Mirza Jahangir Khan|Mirza Jahangir Khan Sur-e Esrafil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bayat|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 he left Iran for the purpose of [[Hajj]], however as a result of his late arrival, he undertook an [[Umrah]] Hajj, after which he settled in [[Samarra]], Iraq, where he became a pupil of Ayatollah [[Mirza Mohammed Hassan Husseini Shirazi|Mirzā Mohammad Hasan Hosseini Shirāzi]] and completed his studies with him. Following the death of his father, he took his entire family to Samarra and for some ten years advised Ayatollah Shirāzi on political matters. On the recommendation of Ayatollah Shirāzi, he finally returned to Tehran. Due to his independent mind, in Tehran he kept away from state officials and individuals in positions of power. In his public speeches, he emphasized on the merits of freedom and incessantly stirred up the sense of loving freedom amongst his audiences. In this, he went so far as to suggesting [[republicanism]] as a viable alternative to [[monarchism]]. His latter views polarised his audiences, driving some away, and attracting some more closely instead. His ascetic lifestyle, however, very effectively protected him against personal attacks by his detractors. His emphasis permanently revolved around a national government, respect for the rule of law, equality before law, and the indiscriminate application of justice in the society.&lt;ref name="zinati"/&gt;

=== Constitutional Revolution ===
The spark leading to the Constitutional Revolution of Iran is by some held to be the [[foot whipping]] of some sugar merchants in Tehran in December 1905, by the then Governor of Tehran, Ahmad Alā od-Dowleh, for disobeying the order by the government to lower the price of sugar.&lt;ref name="Keddie_67"&gt;{{harvp|Keddie|2003|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this event, a large number of people from [[Bazaar]], together with some clergy, took sanctuary (known as ''[[Bast (asylum)|Bast]]'' &lt;ref&gt;J. Calmard, ''Bast'', [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f8/v3f8a055.html ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in ''[[Shah Mosque|Shah's Mosque]]'' (''Masjed-e Shah'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Imam Khomeini]] Mosque'' since 1979) in Tehran. They were however forcibly removed from this place by the agents of the then Chief Minister of [[Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar ad-Din Shah]], Ain ad-Dowleh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keddie|2003|pp=66, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, on the suggestion of Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i a large number of [[Ulema]] of Tehran retired to Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine and formulated a set of demands to be presented to Mozaffar ad-Din Shah. The single most important demand to be made at this juncture from Shah turned out to be the demand for establishing an ''Edālat'khāneh'' (عدالتخانه - House of Justice), of which the specifics were left unspecified. According to Keddie,&lt;ref name="Keddie_67"/&gt; this lack of detail may have been intended for preserving unity amongst the more radical modernizers and the traditional Ulema. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah accepted the demand for setting up an ''Edālat'khāneh'' and for good measure also dismissed the unpopular Governor of Tehran. Following this, the Ulema ceased their protest and returned to Tehran. The ''Edālat'khāneh'' was to be the genesis of what later became Iran's ''[[Majles of Iran|Majles]]''.

Mozaffar ad-Din Shah and his Chief Minister, Ain od-Dowleh, reneged however on their promises. Not only did they not establish an ''Edālat'khāneh'', but violence against people continued unabated, both in Tehran and in other provinces of Iran. At this stage popular preachers such as [[Sayyid Jamal al-Din Va'iz|Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani]] (father of the celebrated Iranian writer [[Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh]]) and Shaikh Mohammad Vā'ez began their most vociferous attacks on the establishment. This led to Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani being ordered to leave Tehran, an act that led to strong protests by the public. In the course of ousting Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani from Tehran, a young [[Sayyed]] (a descendant of prophet [[Mohammad]]) was shot dead by an officer, an event that led to a large mass of clergy leaving Tehran in protest and taking ''Bast'' in [[Qom]] in July 1906. This move was followed by between 12,000 and 14,000 merchants and tradesmen taking ''Bast'' in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Legation]] in Tehran, bringing the commerce in Tehran to virtual standstill.&lt;ref name="Keddie_67"/&gt; In passing, it should be remarked that the orthodox historical view in the present-day Iran is that the role of the British at this juncture in the history of Iran was by no means a benevolent one, but calculated, the calculation being aimed at marginalising the religious elements of the revolutionary movement. It is well known that it was for exactly the lack of clarity as regards the role of [[Islam]] in a post-revolution era that such Constitutional Revolutionary of the first hour as [[Sheikh Fazlollah Noori]] came to take the side of [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad-Ali Shah]] and became an anti-revolutionary.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Officiate Website of [http://iichs.org/index_en.asp ''Iranian Institute for Contemporary Historical Studies''] ([http://iichs.org/index.asp مؤسسۀ مطالعات تاریخ معاصر ایران]) should be consulted. In particular, [http://www.iichs.org/PDF_files/A_BaresiyeElal.pdf this article], in Persian, by Dr Farzad Jahān'bin, is worth considering. The idea being advanced is that whereas the taking of ''Bast'' of between some 12,000 to 14,000 men in the British Legation in Tehran seems to have been spontaneous, preparations for hosting such large numbers (providing for both meals and sanitation of the individuals taking the ''Bast'') had been in the making for months in advance. There are eye-witness reports indicating how months in advance of the event, the British middlemen had been purchasing large quantities of rice and other foodstuff in various food markets in and around Tehran and transported these at night-times into the complex housing the British Legation in Tehran.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, the status of Sheikh Fazlollah Noori as a revolutionary has been fully restored.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;According to {{harvp|Keddie|2003|p=180}}, "The third main leader of the Tehran ulema, Shaikh Fazlollah Nuri [the other two being Mirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i and Ayatollah Sayyed Abdollah Behbahāni], did turn against the movement once it became clear that the constitution was not going to reinstate the [[sharia]], but bring in many Western-style institutions and laws."&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this time Iranians began to increase their demands, demanding not only the dismissal of Shah's Chief Minister, Ain od-Dowleh, but also establishment of a national consultative assembly, what came to be known as, and become, ''Majles''.&lt;ref name="Keddie"&gt;{{harvp|Keddie|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of ''Mashrouteh'' (مشروطه), signifying a new political system, was floated around this time.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The orthodox viewpoint in contemporary Iran (consult [http://iichs.org/index_en.asp ''Iranian Institute for Contemporary Historical Studies'']) is that the word ''Mashrouteh'' (مشروطه), in opposition to ''Mashrou'eh'' (مشروعه) (meaning, ''based on religion'' or ''based on religious traditions''), was insinuated and popularised by the British. According to [[Dehkhoda Dictionary]] (3rd edition, Tehran University Press, 2006), ''Mashrouteh'' is a form of state government according to which introduction and elimination of laws are the sole prerogatives of Parliament, or Houses of Parliament. In this connection, Sheikh Fazlollah Noori insisted on a ''Mashrou'eh'' form of government, according to which the sole role of ''Majles'' would be the safeguarding of the [[Islamic]] laws.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of July 1906, Mozaffar al-Din Shah dismissed his unpopular Chief Minister Ain od-Dowleh, and in early August 1906 he accepted the proposed institution of ''Majles''. The first ''Majles'' came into being in October 1906, immediately after the Deputies of Tehran were elected.&lt;ref name="Keddie"/&gt; A committee of experts drafted the ''Fundamental Law'', which Mozaffar al-Din Shah signed, after some delay, in December 1906. A longer ''Supplementary Fundamental Law'', drafted in 1907, was signed by the new Shah, Mohammad-Ali Shah, in October 1907 (Mozaffar al-Din Shah died on 3 January 1907). These two charters formed the core of the Iranian written Constitution, to be supplanted by a new written Constitution after the Revolution of 1979.&lt;ref name="Keddie"/&gt;

The rules governing the election of Deputies of ''Majles'' were originally drafted by Mozaffar al-Din Shah. His delay in making this document available led Mirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i to visiting him personally at [[Niavaran Palace Complex|Sāheb'qrāniyeh Palace]] for enquiry. He left the Palace with the draft of these regulations in his hands. After some changes in this draft, it was finally ratified by Mozaffar al-Din Shah. Copies of this were subsequently dispatched to all cities in Iran. This event was celebrated on Monday 10 September 1906 by ornamenting the streets of Tehran with decorative light bulbs.&lt;ref name="zinati"/&gt;

Tabatabai died in Tehran in 1920, at the age of 77.

=== As deputy ===
Of the religious minority groups in Iran, only [[Zoroastrians]] had a Zoroastrian Deputy in First ''Majles''. During the legislative period of this ''Majles'', Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i deputised also the [[Assyrians in Iran|Iranian Christians]] in ''Majles''. During this period, the [[Persian Jews|Iranian Jewish community]] were deputised by Ayatollah Sayyed Abdollah Behbahāni.&lt;ref name="zinati"/&gt;

=== As private person ===
According to Keddie, Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i "appears to have had genuinely liberal proclivities and considerable contact with other liberals, believed that a constitution would be the best way to limit the power of uncontrolled autocrats who were selling Iran to the Western powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keddie|2003|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the sudden rise in the price of sugar in 1905 (see above), Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i proposed that instead of serving tea at religious gatherings, such as at ''Rozeh-Khāni'''s, the poor be given cash. In making this suggestion, he was also aiming at improving the state of public health, as he believed that not in all large gatherings the tea was being served in hygienically clean utensils, thus spreading transferable diseases amongst the population.&lt;ref name="zinati"/&gt;

== School and modern teaching methods ==
Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i founded the ''Islāmieh School'' (مدرسه اسلامیه) in Tehran where modern teaching methods were used. He appointed his brother, Assad'o'llah Tabātabā'i, as the Head of this school. During a celebration, on 28 October 1905, Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i delivered a speech to the school in which he expanded on the necessity of learning and establishment of modern schools in Iran.&lt;ref name="zinati"/&gt;

'''Pa Maretu Ariki''' (1848 – 1906) was a sovereign of the [[Cook Islands]]. He was the ''[[Ariki#Cook Islands|ariki]]'' of the ''Pa'' [[dynasty]], one of the two [[chiefdom]]s of the ''[[Rarotonga#Subdivisions|Takitumu]]'' tribe on the island of [[Rarotonga]].

==Early life==
Pa Maretu was originally born at [[Aitutaki]] on the 15th of December 1848, his father being Mataka, a Rarotongan native, and his mother Maria, a native of Aitutaki. Shortly after his birth he was brought to Rarotonga, where he was adopted by [[Pa Upoko Takau Ariki|Pa Upoko]] (also known as Mere Pa or Mary Pa) the daughter of [[:Image:Patepou.jpg|Pa Te Pou Ariki]] and her husband Obura, who was the son of Maretu I (1802–1880), one of the first [[Christian convert]]s in 1823. He was educated by Congregationalist [[London Missionary Society|European missionaries]] and taught native lore by the missionary Maretu.&lt;ref name=MaretuPapersPast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19060216.2.32&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=|title=Death of Pa Ariki|publisher=Auckland Star|date=February 16, 1906|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
Pa Maretu succeeded his adoptive mother Pa Upoko in 1895. He was appointed native missionary of [[Ngatangiia]], and remained so until his death. He married at an early age to Pati More, a woman of high rank, but they had no children. In 1901 he visited New Zealand, accompanying [[Lieutenant colonel]] [[Walter Edward Gudgeon]] to welcome the [[George V|Duke]] and [[Mary of Teck|Duchess of York]] to the [[Colony of New Zealand|colony]].&lt;ref name=MaretuPapersPast/&gt; He was a member of the [[wikt:federal council|Federal Council]] of the Cook Islands and of the Rarotonga Council. He was also a native [[judge]] of the [[High Court]] and of the [[Land registration|Land Titles Court]], and took a great interest in the government of the islands.&lt;ref name=MaretuPapersPast/&gt; He was always of great assistance to Walter Edward Gudgeon in settling native disputes, and things in general, as he was able to view things from a European and native standpoint.&lt;ref name=MaretuPapersPast/&gt;

==Later life==
Pa Maretu retained the title until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Extracts from report of Rev. J.J.K. Hutchin to the LMS dated January 14, 1907: 2&lt;/ref&gt; He died on the 7th of February 1906 after suffering from heart and lung afflictions for some weeks, he succumbed at last very quickly. He was buried on Friday afternoon on the 9th of February, and the funeral was officially attended by the [[Resident Commissioner]] and the [[Government officer]]s.&lt;ref name=MaretuPapersPast/&gt; He was succeeded by Pa Tetianui (also adopted by Pa Upoko) on the 16th of February 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Cook Islands Gazette, 26 February 1906: 280&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29875">'''Roberto Rino Magliola''' (born 1940) is an [[Italian-American]] academic specializing in European [[hermeneutics]] and [[deconstruction]], in comparative philosophy, and in inter-religious dialogue. He is retired from [[National Taiwan University]] and from [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]] of Thailand.

== Career ==
Magliola received his doctorate in 1970 from [[Princeton University]] in [[comparative literature]] with specialty and dissertation in [[Phenomenology (religion)|phenomenology]]/hermeneutics, [http://worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/893358 see diss. in microform format, here]). He is retired from the (interfaith) Graduate School of Philosophy and Religions, Abac [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]] ([[Thailand]]), where he was professor of [[philosophy]] and [[religious studies]]; and from [[National Taiwan University]], where he was distinguished chair professor in the Graduate School of Liberal Arts.&lt;ref&gt;See Magliola's "bio" in Y. Wang, ed. ''Deconstruction and the Ethical in Asian Thought'' (Routledge, 2007), pp. x,xi.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983–84, he taught and researched at [[Tamkang University]] in [[Taiwan]] while on sabbatical from [[Purdue University]], where he had taught since 1969 and been a (full) professor since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Magliola, autobiographical profile, in C. Koelb and S. Noakes, eds., ''The Comparative Perspective on Literature'' (Cornell University Press, 1988), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 he moved to the Orient, taking up residence there ''en permanence''. He continued publication in Buddhism and deconstruction and also did interdisciplinary writing and conferencing on [[postmodernism]] (in literature and Religious Studies) throughout this period. A [[Carmelites|Carmelite lay tertiary]] (1982–present),&lt;ref&gt;See Magliola's "bio" in J.Y. Park, ed., ''Buddhisms and Deconstructions'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; he began to write more extensively both on the application of Derridean thought-motifs to [[Roman Catholic theology|Catholic theology]], and on Catholic meditation (see [[Christian Meditation]] and see [[Contemplation]]), making an invited presentation in 1999 on ‘Catholic Meditation in Tibetan [[Vajrayana]] Form’ for the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Federation of Asian Bishops Councils  ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/cultr/documents/rc_pc_cultr_doc_15121998_bangkok99_en.html See ''Proceedings'' for 2nd Day, Feb. 2, 1999, here]).

In Thailand since 1994, he researched [[Theravada]] Buddhism and also underwent training in [[Vipassanā]]-[[Satipatthana]] meditation ([[Wat Mahathat, Bangkok]]).&lt;ref&gt;See same reference as in endnote 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He organized and chaired the Thai delegation of Buddhist and Catholic scholars from Assumption University to the quadrennial international meetings of the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies (1996, 2000), having begun presenting papers there in 1992. After a return of two years to teaching in Taiwan, he formally retired from university teaching as of summer, 2002, and currently lives in the United States of America where his three children, Lorinda-marie, Jon-carlo, and Clara-marie, and his several grandchildren reside. Since 2002, he has taught minicourses 
([http://www.gflp.org/livinganddying.html see course information, Global Family for Love and Peace, here]), organized forums, and been an interfaith retreatant at the Manhattan (NYC) Center of the Wu Sheng Monastery, Ling Jiou Shan Buddhist Society, Kung-Liao, Taiwan (2002–2005) [the Manhattan Center closed in 2005 and moved to Oakland Garden, Queens, NYC]. In spring 2012 Ling Jiou Shan opened a new Center in Flushing, NYC, enabling Magliola to resume his affiliation as interfaith retreatant and consultant (2012-  ). From 2002 through 2007 he has been a co-editor ([https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=robert+magliola&amp;x=11&amp;y=17 see some of these edited books, here]) for volumes in the book-series “Seminars on Culture and Values” for the Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, [[Catholic University of America]], Washington, D.C. He is Co-editor (2008–  ) of the ''DES Journal'' (3 issues a year; c. 20,000 circulation), academic review of [[Delta Epsilon Sigma]], national scholastic honor society for students/faculty/alumni of Catholic colleges and universities (http://www.deltaepsilonsigma.org/en-us/default.aspx). He was a Seminar Associate (2002–2011)&lt;ref&gt;See same "bio" reference as in endnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Seminar in Buddhist Studies (a faculty and graduate student forum), [[Columbia University]], and studied (autumn 2010–summer 2012) the meditative mode of Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo as it is taught at the Downtown New York Meditation Community (Manhattan, N.Y.C.), where Peter Doobinin leads the Insight Meditation Program ([[vipassanā]]). In Italy—as of spring 2012—Magliola practices at Villa Vangelo e Zen ("The Gospel and Zen") ([http://www.vangeloezen.org]), Desio (Lombardia), where the Director is padre Luciano Mazzocchi, S.X., who belongs to the Society of St. Francis Xavier for the Foreign Missions ([http://www.saveriani.it]) and who, after twenty years in Japan, is a certified Soto Zen teacher with established centers throughout Italy ([http://www.lastelladelmattino.org/7145 see also the Italian blogs associated with the website of La Stella del Mattino Italian Buddhist Community, Zen monk Mauricio Yushin Marassi, director, discussing Magliola's review of P. Knitter's ''Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian'', here]). On March 27, 2013, Magliola received from Vangelo e Zen an official ''Attestato'' (Certification): the document declares him qualified to teach meditation “as transmitted in Zen, and in other Oriental forms” [in which he has been trained] to “priests, Religious, and laity of the Catholic Church,” in accordance with “the spirituality of dialogue promoted by Vatican Council II.”&lt;ref name="dimmid"&gt;In ''Dilatato Corde'', Vol. 3, No. 2 (July-Dec. 2013), at [http://www.dimmid.org www.dimmid.org], Dialogue Interreligieux Monastique/Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, see the biographical note accompanying Magliola’s article “’Neither I nor Not I’- .”&lt;/ref&gt;  The same document notes that “In 1999, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger [later to become Pope Benedict XVI], Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, expressed in writing his approval and his encouragement” for “the Association Vangelo e Zen.”&lt;ref name="dimmid"/&gt; In 2012 and 2013, Magliola has been a Reviewer/Outside Reader in Buddhism and Postmodern Theology for ''Harvard Theological Review'', Harvard University.

==Jacques Derrida and Buddhism==
Magliola is a specialist in European [[hermeneutics]] and [[deconstruction]], in comparative philosophy, and in [[Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhist – (Roman) Catholic dialogue]] ([http://www.monasticdialog.com]). He is widely acknowledged to be the first scholar to have identified and published at length (''Derrida on the Mend'', 1984&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University Press, 1984; 2nd ed., 1986; reprint Purdue University Press, 2000-2011, 2013- .&lt;/ref&gt;) on possible intersections between [[Jacques Derrida]]’s thought and Buddhism, especially [[Madhyamika]] Buddhism and its generally accepted “founder,” [[Nagarjuna]]:

* “As far as I know, Magliola is the first person to study Derrida in a Buddhist perspective, and he does this with a higher degree of speculative engagement than has been attained in similar studies of [[Nietzsche]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Bergson]].” – Joseph S. O’Leary, [http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/221.pdf review] of ''Derrida on the Mend'' in ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'', Vol. 12, No. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;362
* “The latter [Magliola’s ''On Deconstructing Life-Worlds: Buddhism, Christianity, Culture,'' 1997&lt;ref&gt;Scholars Press, American Academy of Religion, 1997; Oxford University Press, 2000- .&lt;/ref&gt;]  is a major work from an author whose earlier book, ''Derrida on the Mend'', was the first to cross Buddhism and deconstruction.” – N. Robert Glass, [http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BE/jbe93843.htm review] of [[David Loy]], ed., ''Healing Deconstruction-'', and Robert Magliola, ''On Deconstructing Life-Worlds'', in ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'', Vol. 5 (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;60
* “Since Robert Magliola’s 1984 publication ''Derrida on the Mend'', which involved his pioneering comparison of Derrida and Nagarjuna, . . .” – Youru Wang, in his review of Youxuan Wang, ''Buddhism and Deconstruction: Towards a Comparative Semiotics'', in ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 55, No. 3 (July 2005)
* “It took Magliola, in ''Derrida on the Mend'', to bring Nagarjuna and other Buddhist voices into the arena of the discourse on deconstruction, and the efforts of the academy to marginalize his work have been considerable.” – E. H. Jarow, “Zen Flesh, Bones, and Blood: Deconstructing Inter-Religious Dialogue,” in ''Buddhisms and Deconstructions'',&lt;ref&gt;Rowman and Littlefield, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ed. J.Y. Park, p.&amp;nbsp;228.

For other references to ''Derrida on the Mend'' making a similar point, see [[Harold Coward]] (''Derrida and Indian Philosophy'', State U. of New York Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;125), Dennis McCort (''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 71, No. 1 (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;225 ([http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/search?fulltext=McCort&amp;sendit=Enter&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=1&amp;journalcode=jaarel See review, here]), and Ellen Y. Zhang (“[[Jizang]]’s [[Śūnyatā]]-Speech: A Derridean Dénégation with Buddhist Negations,” in ''Buddhisms and Deconstructions'', ed. Park, p.&amp;nbsp;116).
 
Brian Bocking and Youxuan Wang point out, in their “Signs of Liberation?—A Semiotic Approach to Wisdom in Chinese Madhyamika Buddhism,” ''The Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', Vol. 33, No. 3 (Sept. 2006) ([http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/jocp/2006/00000033/00000003/art00007 See article in Ingenta, here]), that ''Derrida on the Mend'' also works with the Chan/[[Zen]] form of Buddhism, pioneering the comparison of this Far Eastern tradition and several Western semiotic themes:  “As early as 1984, certain [[semiotic]] themes in Chinese Chan Buddhism were picked up in Robert Magliola, ''Derrida on the Mend'', . . . .”

'''''Facing Up to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs From Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter''''' (Angelico Press, 2014), 224 pp.: [http://angelicopress.com/magliola-real-doctrinal-difference/ see on Angelico Press's website at] and [https://www.amazon.com/Facing-Real-Doctrinal-Difference-Catholic-Buddhist/dp/1621380793/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416412441&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=facing+up+to+real+doctrinal+difference&amp;pebp=1416412445362 see on Amazon website, here].

* "This intriguing study offers a bold thesis that adapting the Derridean concept of difference within a Catholic framework can allow adept practitioners of both Buddhist and Catholic traditions to edify each other while acknowledging their radical difference. This avoids the temptation to relativism and superficial syncretism that so often infects pluralist accounts of dialogue. His professional background in contemporary continental philosophy coupled with his long history of sustained participation in Buddhist-Catholic dialogue provide Magliola with a unique vantage point for this effort. . . . Exposure to teachings and practices of one's counterpart in other traditions can stimulate the revival of dormant but important analogous teachings and practices in one's own religion. Magliola's hope is that the Catholic tradition may be able to develop further doctrinal understandings in an Asian manner, analogously to its earlier developments which adapted Hellenistic thought forms." - John V. Apczynski (St. Bonaventure U.), Review in ''Catholic Books Review'', March 2015: [http://www.catholicbooksreview.org/2015/magliola.html see review (FULL TEXT), here].
Commendations from the back cover and front inner pages of '''''Facing Up to Real Doctrinal Difference''''':
* "Buddhist scholar and Catholic theologian Robert Magliola makes the convincing claim that an adaptation of some of Derrida's strategies makes it possible for Christians to affirm the positive role of Buddhist spiritual practices and teachings in God's plan of salvation while fully espousing their faith in Jesus Christ as universal Savior." - Rev. William Skudlarek, O.S.B., '''''Consultore''''', Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue (Vatican)
* "A new approach based not on samenesses but on founding and irreducible differences." - Fra Matteo Nicolini-Zani, Monastery of Bose (Italy), Coord.: Dialogo Monastico Interreligioso/Monastic Interreligious Dialogue-Italy.
* "Robert Magliola is one of the great scholars of Derrida and Buddhism. This new book on the topic of Derrida's notion of 'difference' presents a philosophical foundation for understanding how Catholics can learn and receive from the differences of Buddhism while preserving faith in the traditional doctrines of the Church." - Donald W. Mitchell, professor of philosophy emeritus, Purdue University; editor, ''Claritas'' (Focolare Movement).
* "Robert Magliola attempts to show how mutual respect, appreciation, and even love can coexist with honest, frank, and clear recognition of the real substantive differences between Buddhism and Christianity." - Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, Buddhist monk, scholar, and translator from the Pali canon (BPS, Wisdom P., etc.); president, Buddhist Publishing Society (1988-2010), Sri Lanka; founding chair, [[Buddhist Global Relief]]
* "A substantial achievement. Robert Magliola is radical as well as profoundly faithful to his own Catholic background." - Gavin D'Costa, professor of Catholic theology, University of Bristol, U.K.; advisor to the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales
* "This book will be a key tool in grassroots Buddhist-Christian relations." - Rev. James Loughran, S.A., director, Graymoor Ecumenical and Interreligious Institute, New York
* "Robert Magliola demonstrates a well-rounded understanding of the three main Buddhist traditions: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana." - Ven. Dr. Sak Dhammadipa, Abbot, Chuang Yen Monastery, N.Y.

* Critique of Magliola's essay (in ''Buddhisms and Deconstructions'', above) in review from Dan Lusthaus, Harvard University, in ''Journal of Chinese Religions'', No. 35 (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;183, 184:  "The gem of this collection is Magliola's response, which not only answers Jackson's critique by rightly pointing out that relying on secondary sources by Anglo-American philosophers who 'flatten Derrida's philosophical elegance' in order to render it suitable to their own sensibilities leads to basic 'mistakes' (p. 235-236) in one's understanding of Derrida's thought; more intriguing are his replies, both positive and critical, to other essays in this book. By demonstrating how thinking Buddhist ideas, such as the two-truths and ''gongan''s, in a Derridean manner exposes limitations in the way Buddhist scholars think about Buddhism, Magliola shows us how Buddhism can learn from deconstruction" ([http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/yjch20 find Journal source here]).

'''Shaun Wylie''' (17 January 1913 – 2 October 2009&lt;ref name=death&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6903467.ece Obituary — Shaun Wylie: member of Bletchley Park code-breaking team], ''[[The Times]]'', 5 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trin"&gt;[http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/news/article.asp?ItemID=1205 Dr Shaun Wylie, 1913–2009], [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British [[mathematician]] and [[World War II]] codebreaker.

==Early life==
Wylie was born in [[Oxford]], [[England]], the fourth son of [[Francis James Wylie|Sir Francis Wylie]], later the first Warden of [[Rhodes House]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/page/deaths Deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021034213/http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/page/deaths |date=21 October 2013 }}, Rhodes House Trust, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Dragon School]] (in Oxford) and then [[Winchester College]].&lt;ref name="int"&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~mudd/finding_aids/mathoral/pmc45.htm An interview with Shaun Wylie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310074640/http://www.princeton.edu/~mudd/finding_aids/mathoral/pmc45.htm |date=10 March 2015 }} on 21 June 1985, The Princeton Mathematics Community in the 1930s, Transcript Number 45 (PMC&lt;!-- Not a PMCID --&gt; 5).&lt;/ref&gt; He won a scholarship to [[New College, Oxford]] where he studied mathematics and [[Literae Humaniores|classics]].&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; In 1934, he went to study [[topology]] at [[Princeton University]], obtaining a PhD in 1937 with [[Solomon Lefschetz]] as his supervisor.&lt;ref name="gen"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|1406}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Princeton he met fellow English mathematician [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; He became a fellow of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in 1938/1939.&lt;ref name="trin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trin-newsletter-2005"&gt;[http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/uploads/TH%20NL%20Spring%202005.pdf Trinity Hall Newsletter], Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II codebreaking==
[[File:Enigma rotors and spindle showing contacts rachet and notch.jpg|thumb|left|Wylie contributed to the breaking of the [[Enigma machine]] code.]]
During [[World War II]], Turing had been recruited to work at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's codebreaking centre. Turing wrote to Wylie around December 1940, who was by then teaching at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]], inviting him to work at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref name="hodges198"&gt;[[Andrew Hodges]], ''[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1983, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted, and arrived in February 1941.&lt;ref name="hodges198"/&gt; He joined Turing's section, [[Hut 8]], which was working on solving the [[Enigma machine]] as used by the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. He became head of the [[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]] subsection,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smith, ''Station X'', revised edition 2004, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and allocated time on the [[bombe]] codebreaking machines.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Erskine, 2001, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], successor to Turing as head of Hut 8, commented that "except for Turing, no-one made a bigger contribution to the success of Hut 8 than Shaun Wylie; he was astonishingly quick and resourceful and contributed to theory and practice in a number of different directions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/oct1943.rhtm "Not all our own way"], Bletchley Park History, "Articles from our archives", http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk, last accessed 12 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Wylie transferred in Autumn 1943 to work on "[[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]]", a [[Germany|German]] teleprinter cipher.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, 2001, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; He married Odette Murray, a [[Women's Royal Naval Service|WREN]] in the section.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 2004, pp. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, soon after the [[victory in Europe]], Wylie demonstrated how [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] &amp;mdash; electronic machines used to help solve Tunny &amp;mdash; could have been used unmodified to break the Tunny "motor wheels", a task which had been previously done by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, 2006, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; While at Bletchley Park, he became president of the dramatic club.&lt;ref name="kahn"&gt;Kahn, 1991, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt; He had also played international [[hockey]] for [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="kahn"/&gt; but according to fellow codebreaker [[I. J. Good]], he "never mentioned any of his successes".&lt;ref name="good206"&gt;Good, 2006, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
After the war, he was a fellow at Trinity Hall until 1958&lt;ref name="trin"/&gt; and lectured in mathematics.&lt;ref name="atd-note"&gt;"Notes on contributors", p. 532 in Michael Smith and Ralph Erskine, editors, ''Action This Day'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[Ph.D.]] advisor for [[Frank Adams]], [[Max Kelly]], [[Crispin St. J. A. Nash-Williams|Crispin Nash-Williams]], [[William Tutte]] and [[Christopher Zeeman]].&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt; With [[Peter Hilton]], he authored ''Homology Theory: An Introduction to Algebraic Topology'', published in 1960.&lt;ref name="good206"/&gt;

In 1958, he became Chief Mathematician at [[GCHQ]], the UK [[signals intelligence]] organisation.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt; In July 1969, he was sent a draft paper by [[James H. Ellis]], another GCHQ mathematician, about the possibility of what was termed "non-secret encryption", or what is now more commonly known as [[public-key cryptography]], on which Wylie commented "unfortunately, I can't see anything wrong with this".&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;Steven Levy, ''Crypto'', 2001, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired in 1973, and taught at [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys]] (later [[Hills Road Sixth Form College]]) in Cambridge for seven years.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt; He was elected an [[Honorary title (academic)|honorary fellow]] at Trinity Hall in 1980.&lt;ref name="trin"/&gt;

Wylie supervised five PhD students at Cambridge, through whom he has 1037 "descendants" according to the [[American Mathematical Society]] [[Mathematical Genealogy Project]].&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt; In addition he influenced the intellectual development of generations of pupils at the [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys]] / [[Hills Road Sixth Form College]] where he taught maths and classical Greek and where he also produced plays, such as [[Anton Chekov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' and coached the school Chess Team which rather than playing other schools, played and usually won against college and university teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He also came out of retirement temporarily to teach Mathematics at Long Road Sixth Form College.

After retirement from teaching, Wylie was instrumental in the founding of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and in the Cambridge-based [[University of the Third Age]] (U3A) and at the time of his death was preparing to read in the next Cambridge Greek Play, [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Agamemnon]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Shaun "Doc" Wylie, as he was known to his pupils and students, possessed an incisive insightful intellect and was a man who brought good humour to those around. He was reticent and modest about his many significant accomplishments. He would patiently encourage and coach those who he felt were promising but under-performing. He was an inspiration to those who came in contact with him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

His eldest son, the late [[Keith Wylie]] (1945–1999), a [[barrister]], was a [[croquet]] international and open champion of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mauicroquetclub.org/people/KeithWylie.htm Keith Wylie Dead at 54] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729105841/http://www.mauicroquetclub.org/people/KeithWylie.htm |date=29 July 2010 }}, ''[[The Times]]'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 2 October 2009.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;&lt;ref name="trin"/&gt;

'''Thomas Scott''' (1 January 1842 – 4 March 1870) was an Irish Protestant who emigrated to Canada in 1863.&lt;ref name=DCB&gt;Rea, J. E. "Biography – Scott, Thomas (d. 1870) – Volume IX (1861-1870) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography." Biography – SCOTT, THOMAS (d. 1870) – Volume IX (1861-1870) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography. University of Toronto, 1 Jan. 1976. Web. 18 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While working as a labourer on the "Dawson Road Project", he moved on to [[Winnipeg]] where he met [[John Christian Schultz]] and fell under the influence of the adherents to the [[Canadian Party]]. His political involvement in the [[Red River Settlement]] from then on led to his capture at [[Fort Garry]] where he was held hostage with others. On 4 March 1870 Scott was marched out of Fort Garry's east gate and was executed on the wall by the provisional government of the Red River Settlement led by [[Louis Riel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Red River Rebellion|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = Watson and Dwyer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Manitoba|pages = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott's execution led to the [[Wolseley Expedition]] – a military force said to be sent to protect Canada from American annexation, but widely believed to confront Louis Riel and the Métis at the Red River Settlement, authorized by [[Sir John A. Macdonald]]. Thomas Scott's execution highlights a time of severe conflict between settlers and the Métis in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="The Execution of Thomas Scott"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Execution of Thomas Scott|url=http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPCONTENTSE1EP9CH2PA4LE.html|website=CBC Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; His execution led to Riel's exile, and to Riel's own execution for treason in 1885.

== Life ==

Little is known of Thomas Scotts' early years. He was born in the Clandeboye area of [[County Down]], in what is today [[Northern Ireland]] in 1820. Raised as a Presbyterian, he became an active [[Orange Order|Orangeman]].&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; Scott emigrated to Ontario in 1863 along with his step-brothers, Joseph Bath and Christian Aiello.&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; On his arrival at Red River, he worked as a labourer on the "Dawson road" project, connecting the Red River and Lake Superior.&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; He took part in a strike in 1869, for which he was fired and convicted of aggravated assault.&lt;ref&gt;Bumsted, J.M. Reporting the Resistance: Alex Begg and Joseph Hargrave on the Red River Resistance. 2003. University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott then moved to Winnipeg, where he met [[John Christian Schultz]] and became a supporter of the [[Canadian Party]].&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; Scott backed the annexation of the Red River Settlement to Canada,&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; and the rest of his life revolved around this conflict.&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; Scott had persecuted many metis, or "Half Breeds" in Winnipeg, and his first town, Ottawa, with a mysterious man named Gnez Noel.

== Role in the Red River Resistance ==

Scott was employed by the Canadian government as a surveyor during the [[Red River Rebellion]]. He was first arrested and imprisoned in December 1869 at [[Upper Fort Garry]] by [[Louis Riel]] and his men while trying to attack the fort along with 34 other volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=Thomas|title=Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered|date=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0802082823|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Scott had briefly escaped Upper Fort Garry in January with [[John Christian Schultz]] and [[Charles Mair]]. In February 1870, Scott, alongside several volunteers amassed a rescue party outside John Christian Schultz's house in Kildonan that sought to free any remaining prisoners at Fort Garry. Summarily, the Métis released the prisoners and the rescue party was dispersed. Scott and several volunteers marched to Portage, but passed too close to Fort Garry, where Scott was captured and imprisoned by Riel's garrison once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Thomas Scott's Body: And Other Essays on Early Manitoba History|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = University of Manitoba Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Winnipeg, Manitoba|pages = 197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Mair and John Christian Schultz travelled through America and later reached Ontario to urge the government for an extensive military expedition to the Red River Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Red River Rebellion|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = Watson and Dwyer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Manitoba|pages = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint-military operation of the Wolseley Expedition dispatched the Ontario 1st and 60th rifles alongside British troops in May 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Red River Rebellion|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = Watson and Dwyer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Manitoba|pages = 192–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that Thomas Scott suffered severe diarrhea during his second incarceration, which was said to have had a negative effect on both Scott and his captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Thomas Scott's Body: And Other Essays on Early Manitoba History|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = University of Manitoba Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Winnipeg, Manitoba|pages = 200}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his captivity, Scott was an extraordinarily difficult, opinionated, and verbally abusive individualist who refused to acknowledge his captors' legal authority. There is some evidence that Thomas had an altercation with a group of guards that had brought him out and injured him so severely that Louis Riel had him locked into another cell with a stronger lock, partly for his own safety. It has also been documented that Scott's fellow prisoners had asked that he be removed due to his obnoxious behaviour while in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumsted|first1=J.M.|title=The Red River Rebellion|date=1996|publisher=Watson &amp; Dwyer Publishing Ltd.|location=Manitoba|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually executed for committing insubordination following a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rambaut|first1=Thomas|title=The Hudson's Bay Half-Breeds and Louis Riel's Rebellions|journal=Political Science Quarterly|date=1887|volume=2|issue=1|pages=148|jstor=2139321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and execution ==

While in jail, Scott became a nuisance as he caused trouble with the guards and made attempts at escaping. He was then brought in front of a court where they found him guilty of defying the authority of the Provisional Government, fighting with guards, and slandering the name of Louis Riel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://shsb.mb.ca/en/node/1372|title = Centre du patrimoine|date = 10 February 2015|accessdate = 10 February 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was not alone in being sentenced to death, but the other sentences were never carried out. On 4 March 1870, unlike the other members of his group, he faced the firing squad. His execution was watched by 100 bystanders. Many eyewitnesses disagree on multiple aspects of Scott's execution from disagreement on his last words and actions to the manner of his death. What is agreed upon is that he was shot while blindfolded by a firing squad against the east side gate of Upper Fort Garry. It was reported that Scott was kneeling in the snow praying fervently up until he was shot. Other witnesses reported that he had been yelling wildly that his execution was unjust and that his execution was murder. The weapons that were used by the firing squad were ordinary hunting weapons (supposedly [[musket]]s) and it was observed that the men who shot these guns were intoxicated. At the time of fire, the men in the firing squad stood 60 meters away from Scott. It was also debated whether or not Scott died immediately when shot by the firing squad.&lt;ref name=BumsteadEM&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=3–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Métis leader [[John Bruce (Canada)|John Bruce]] claimed that only two bullets from the firing squad actually hit Scott, wounding him once in the left shoulder, and once in the upper chest. A man came forward and discharged his pistol close to Scott's head, but the bullet only penetrated the upper part of the left cheek and came out somewhere near the cartilage of the nose. Still not dead, Scott was placed in a makeshift coffin, from which he was later reported to cry:
:''"For God's sake take me out of here or kill me."''
John Bruce said that he was left there to die of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=6|url=http://site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/lib/ocultrent/reader.action?docID=10215344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar account was reported by Reverend George Young, who was told by Major George Robinson that Scott was confined to a roughly made coffin on the presumption that he had died when shot on by the firing squad. Robinson said that five hours later he and Riel entered the room where Scott's coffin was being kept and heard Scott beg for death. Robinson fled the room, Riel closed the door and, a few moments later, Robinson heard a shot and presumed that Scott was then dead. This account was cast into suspicion, though, as Riel had fired Robinson as the editor of ''New Nation'' on 19 March 1870, so it remains unclear whether or not these accounts are based in fact or acted to defame Riel in retaliation for Robinson's dismissal.&lt;ref name="University of Manitoba Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=3–10|url=http://site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/lib/ocultrent/reader.action?docID=10215344}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:ShootingThomasScott.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Guilmette's depiction of Thomas Scott's execution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.umanitoba.ca/canadian_wartime/grade6/teachers/module5/scott_drawings.shtml|title = University of Manitoba Archives and Special Collections|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Upon Scott's death, Reverend George Young forwarded Thomas Scott's documents to his brother Hugh. These documents included Scott's commendatory letters and certificates of good character written by Presbyterian minister of whose church Scott had been connected to in Ireland. Additionally his life savings were sent to his brother. It has been suspected that because it was a such substantial amount ($103.50), that this money might have indicated an immoral lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumsted|first1=J.M.|title=Louis Riel v. Canada: The Making of a Rebel|date=2001|publisher=Great Plains Publications|location=Winnipeg|isbn=1894283252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known where Scott's body was laid to rest. In 1870, the supposed burial site of Thomas Scott was revisited by a party of men led by Reverend Young. The purpose of this expedition was to bring his body back to Ontario. The party found the reported site of his burial just outside the Hudson's Bay Company store, dug 6 feet down. There they discovered the fruit tree box that was meant to be Scott's coffin. The box was discovered partially open and measuring 5 feet, 8 inches in length. No body was found once the box was opened. The box contained only dirt and shavings of some sort. The length of the box has thrown into question whether Scott had ever been buried at that site. He was 6 feet, 2 inches tall and would not have fit into this makeshift coffin which had been said to have been nailed shut. Later, John Bruce claimed that Goblet, a man who had attended the actual funeral, had told him that a week after Scott's execution a hole had been cut in the ice of German Creek about a quarter of a mile from the mouth of the River La Seine. Scott's body was brought to this site and tied in heavy chains and then sunk into the water.&lt;ref name="University of Manitoba Press"/&gt; Another theory is that his body was taken out of the coffin by a Fenian Winnipeger, the proprietor of the Red Saloon, under whose floor it was buried. Years later, when the site of the business was torn up for road construction, a skeleton was found. Some suggest that the skeleton belonged to Thomas Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Qu'Appelle : footprints to progress: a history of Qu'Appelle and district|last = |first = |publisher = Qu'Appelle Historical Society|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of his death ==

Though relatively unknown during his lifetime, once news of Scott's death made it to Ontario he was regarded as a martyr by the English-speaking, Protestant population.&lt;ref name=BumsteadEM/&gt; With opinions divided along ethnic lines during the century following Scott's death, English speaking historians have depicted the execution of Thomas Scott as the murder of an innocent victim. His execution was used to explain Louis Riel's fall from federally recognized politics. It was held that Riel could not be dealt with legitimately because he was seen as a murderer by Ontario. Additionally, the marginalization of Métis peoples in Canada was justified by the Anglo-Canadians memory of a brutal murder dealt to one of their own (Thomas Scott).

By contrast, French Canadian speakers and sympathizers have emphasized Scott's problematic behaviour, as mentioned above.&lt;ref name="Dick 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/48/nationalism.shtml#05|title = Nationalism and Visual Media in Canada: The Case of Thomas Scott’s Execution|last = Dick|first = Lyle|date = 2004|journal = Manitoba History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was stated by historian Lyle Dick that the martyrdom of Scott created a "rallying symbol" for expansionists who wanted the armed force be sent to the Northwest. This fostered higher recruitment rates for the Red River Expedition and hastened its dispatch.&lt;ref name="Dick 2004"/&gt; Upon learning about Scott's death, the Canadian government dispatched the [[Wolseley Expedition]] to [[Fort Garry]] from Ontario to seize the fort and force [[Louis Riel]], now branded a murderer, to flee the settlement. Scott's religious affiliation to the Orange Order had repercussions in Ontario as well. The Toronto Globe had published an article that stated, Scott was cruelly murdered by the enemies of the Queen, country and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Red River Rebellion|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = Watson and Dwyer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Manitoba|pages = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red River Settlement was reportedly affected by the execution of Thomas Scott as well. It was said that the Red River Settlement had adopted a new social atmosphere following Scott's execution of sullen hostility towards the leadership of Louis Riel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Red River Rebellion|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = Watson and Dwyer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Manitoba|pages = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 1870, Sir John A. Macdonald had written to the Earl of Carnarvon, that Thomas Scott's men were calling for retribution against Riel for the unjust murder of Thomas Scott. The Scott incident was known to intensify and complicate negotiations with the provisional Red River government and Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Red River Rebellion|last = Bumsted|first = J.M.|publisher = Watson and Dwyer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Manitoba|pages = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the death of Thomas Scott, the [[Manitoba Act]] was passed and the creation of the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]] had occurred.

== Memorials and portrayals of Scott in Canada ==
[[File:Thomas Scott Memorial Orange Hall.JPG|thumb|Thomas Scott Memorial Orange Hall, 216-218 Princess Street, Winnipeg]]
The [[Thomas Scott Memorial Orange Hall]] was constructed in 1902 and is located on Princess Street in Winnipeg. The hall was named in commemoration of Scott.&lt;ref name="The Execution of Thomas Scott"/&gt;
 
Thomas Scott and his execution is portrayed in sources by many historians controversially. As mentioned, there is plenty of speculation of his behavior in prison, the event of his execution and the way in which he died and was laid to rest. In [[Louis Riel (comics)]], Chester Brown portrays Scott as a nuisance. According to Brown, Scott was aggravating, insulting, and rude while imprisoned in Fort Garry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Chester|title=Louis Riel A Comic-Strip Biography|date=2006|publisher=Drawn &amp; Quarterly|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; These qualities are supposedly what may have led to his execution. In the George Bloomfield directed movie, [[Riel (film)]], Thomas Scott's trial and execution is briefly portrayed. He is depicted as loud and uses offensive words such as "savage."&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, George. "Riel." Performed by Gary Reineke. Canada: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). 1979. Film.&lt;/ref&gt; He is only depicted in this way however, after he is convicted and led to his execution.

J. M. Bumsted, a specialist on the topic of the Red River Rebellion, also discusses many popular portrayals of Thomas Scott in his work, "Thomas Scott's Body: And Other Essays on Early Manitoba History." It is important to note that even Bumsted stresses that many stories may have been elaborated on.&lt;ref name="site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=200|url=http://site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/lib/ocultrent/reader.action?docID=10215344}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bumsted, Louis Riel explains Scott's execution for two reasons. First, Scott's negative behavior and actions while in prison, as described by many other historians. Second, Scott is portrayed simply as a pawn being played in a bigger political game.&lt;ref name="site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; Historians who expand on the behavioral issues claim that both the guards and other captors were aggravated by Scott's words and actions.&lt;ref name="site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; He is said to have been threatening towards Riel and the guards and used constant obscene language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=201|url=http://site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/lib/ocultrent/reader.action?docID=10215344}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued in some works that these behaviors are typical of captives who believe they are held unjustly, which Scott certainty believed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also mentioned earlier, Scott is reported to have suffered diarrhea. It is commonly said by historians that this would have caused him aggravation, resulting in his negative behavior. The diarrhea combined with the annoying behavior however, is argued to have been reason to execute Scott as he was too much to deal with.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bumsted also discusses Scott's portrayal as a "ringleader" in a labour strike against Dawson Road superintendent John Snow, leading to justification for execution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Scott is also portrayed as a heavy drinker and a "barroom brawler."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Contradictory, Scott is also portrayed in some works as being quiet and inoffensive, just powerful and determined.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=206|url=http://site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/lib/ocultrent/reader.action?docID=10215344}}&lt;/ref&gt; His execution in these stories is portrayed as being a factor of a personal animosity between him and Riel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This animosity is depicted in many different versions ranging from Scott offending Riel by telling him to move out of his way on the street, to a rivalry over love for the same women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=206–207|url=http://site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/lib/ocultrent/reader.action?docID=10215344}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version has Scott rescuing a Metisse named Marie from a flood. Scott subsequently protected Marie from Riel and his "clumsy" courtship of her. This led to a hatred of Scott by Riel, causing him to want him executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bumstead|first1=J.M.|title=Thomas Scott’s Body: And Other Essays in Early Manitoba History|date=2000|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Manitoba|isbn=9780887553875|pages=207|url=http://site.ebrary.com.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/lib/ocultrent/reader.action?docID=10215344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bumsted, the only thing commonly agreed throughout these depictions is that Scott's execution was a political mistake by Louis Riel and the Metis.&lt;ref name=BumsteadEM/&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 1460''', adopted unanimously on 30 January 2003, after recalling resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1261|1261]] (1999), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1265|1265]] (1999), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1296|1296]] (2000), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306|1306]] (2000), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1308|1308]] (2000), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1314|1314]] (2000), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|1325]] (2000) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1379|1379]] (2001), the Council called for the immediate end to the use of [[military use of children|child soldiers]] and endorsed an "era of application" of international norms and standards for the protection of war-affected children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council calls for immediate halt to use of child soldiers|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/sc7649.doc.htm|publisher=United Nations|date=30 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
===Observations===
The Security Council reiterated its commitment to address the impact of [[war|armed conflict]] upon children and emphasised the responsibility of all parties to comply with the [[United Nations Charter]] and [[international law]], and end [[impunity]] for those responsible for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crime]]s and crimes against children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCormack|first=T.|title=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law – 2003, Volume 6; Volume 2003|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-90-6704-203-1|author2=McDonald, Avril |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was important that humanitarian personnel had safe and unimpeded access and the [[coming into force]] of the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] was welcomed. The Council further noted that enlisting children under the age of 15 into the national armed forces was classified as a war crime under the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]].

===Acts===
The resolution supported the call of the Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] for an "era of application" international standards concerning the protection of children in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=Holly|title=The role of international law in the elimination of child labor|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16285-3|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties to conflict that were using child soldiers were called upon to end such practices while a dialogue would be established with the parties to develop plans to end their recruitment and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McIntyre|first=Angela|title=Rights, root causes and recruitment, the youth factor in Africa's armed conflicts|journal=African Security Review|year=2003|volume=12|issue=2|url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/ASR/12No2/E4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was concern at the list of parties violating their international obligations attached in the annex of the Secretary-General's report and further steps would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Happold|first=Matthew|title=Child soldiers in international law|year=2005|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6586-6|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Member States were called upon to adopt measures through national legislation to control [[arms trafficking]] in states that did not respect international law (the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]) relating to the military use of children and protection of civilians during war. The Council was determined to include provisions for the protection of children in the [[mandate (international law)|mandates]] of [[peacekeeping]] operations. There was concern at reports of sexual exploitation of women and children, particularly cases involving humanitarian workers and United Nations peacekeepers. 

The Security Council requested the implementation of counselling and HIV/AIDS testing services for United Nations peacekeepers, police and humanitarian personnel. All concerned parties and other states were called upon to ensure that the rights of children were incorporated into peace and [[disarmament]], [[demobilization|demobilisation]] and reintegration processes, and to abide by commitments made to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, [[Olara Otunnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council calls for an immediate end to recruitment of child soldiers|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=6026&amp;Cr=children&amp;Cr1=conflict|date=30 January 2003|agency=United Nations News Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, the Secretary-General was instructed to submit a report by 31 October 2003 on the implementation of the current resolution, including a specific section on the protection of children in all of his future country-specific reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloth-Nielsen|first=Julia|title=Children's rights in Africa: a legal perspective|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=978-0-7546-4887-1|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valerie Ritchie Perrine''' (born September 3, 1943) is a retired [[Americans|American]] actress and model. For her role as [[Honey Bruce]] in the 1974 film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'', she won the [[BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles]], the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress]], and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Her other film appearances include ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978),  ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' (1979), and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980).

==Career==

Perrine began her career as a [[Las Vegas]] [[showgirl]]. She played [[soft-core pornography]] actress Montana Wildhack in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five (film)|Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1972). Perrine was photographed for a pictorial layout in the May 1972 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'', later appearing on the cover in August 1981. She then became the first actress to purposely display herself nude on American television by completely baring her breasts during the May 4, 1973, [[PBS]] broadcast of [[Bruce Jay Friedman]]'s ''[[Steambath (play)|Steambath]]'' on ''Hollywood Television Theater.'' (She was seen taking a shower from the side totally undressed.) Only a few PBS stations nationwide carried the program. Later in 1973, she appeared in the episode "When the Girls Came Out to Play" of the romantic anthology television series ''[[Love Story (1973 TV series)|Love Story]]'' (1973).

In 1975, Perrine was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[Golden Globe]] for Best Motion Picture Actress (Drama) and won the [[Prix d'interprétation féminine|Best Actress Award]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for her role as comedian [[Lenny Bruce]]'s wife, [[stripper]] [[Honey Harlow|Honey Bruce]], in [[Bob Fosse]]'s ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'' (1974).

She was [[Carlotta Monti]] in the [[biopic]] ''[[W.C. Fields and Me]]'' (1976). She played Miss Eve Teschmacher, [[Gun moll|moll]] of criminal mastermind [[Lex Luthor]], in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978). For this role, she was nominated for the 1979 [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress (Film)|Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. She reprised her role as Miss Teschmacher in ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980).

Perrine played Charlotta Steele, ex-wife of a [[rodeo]] champion played by [[Robert Redford]], in ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' (1979). Her career grew uneven after an appearance in ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980), for which she was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Award]] for [[1980 Golden Raspberry Awards|Worst Actress]]. This film has since become a cult classic. In 1982, she played the role of Marcy, the wife of a corrupt police officer, in ''[[The Border (1982 film)|The Border]]'' with [[Jack Nicholson]]. In the years since then, Perrine has worked in lower-profile projects, although she did have a small supporting role in the 2000 [[Mel Gibson]] film ''[[What Women Want]]''. In 1995, Perrine made a guest appearance on the series ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', playing an ex-wife of [[Richard Belzer]]'s Detective [[John Munch]].
