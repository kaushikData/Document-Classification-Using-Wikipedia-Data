'''Anna Schepeler-Lette''' (''née'' Anna Lette; December 19, 1829 – 1897) was a German politician, feminist, women's social reformer, and [[pedagogue]]. She was the first director of [[Lette-Verein]] (Lette Society), a German educational institution for girls.{{sfn|Albisetti|2014|p=102}}

 | quote  ="If we are asked whether we would have women enter public life, whether we would wish them to become professors in the university, clergymen in the church, and lawyers at the bar, as is the case in America, we should make no response, Tor they are but idle questions. These demands have not yet been made in Germany, nor will they be made for a long time to come, if ever. But why peer into the future? We have today many institutions, many customs, which past centuries would have looked upon as contrary to Divine and human law. In this connection we would say with Sancho Panza: 'What is, is able to be.'" (Anna Schepeler-Lette, 1886){{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|1886|p=904}}

Schepeler-Lette was born December 19, 1829, at [[Soldin]], Germany (now Poland). She was the eldest daughter of Dr. [[Wilhelm Adolf Lette]] whom she accompanied, in 1848, to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he went as a member of the [[Frankfurt Parliament|German National Parliament]]. In 1866, she joined her father in [[Berlin]], and was initiated into the work of the Lette Society, to which she devoted all her time and energy. A reformer, Schepeler-Lette went to America in 1876, and visited the [[Centennial Exposition]], and many of the principal cities of the US, where she carefully examined various institutions whose aims were similar to those of the Lette Society.{{sfn|Stanton|1884|p=139}}{{sfn|Sklar|Schüler|Strasser|1998|p=25}}

In 1872, Schepeler-Lette established the "Association to promote the employment of the female sex" in Berlin, later renamed Lette-Verein. Under her leadership, the association became a global model for women's vocational training. She founded schools that had no precedent at the time, nor was there a guarantee that government or industry would find the education provided as being acceptable. Under her leadership, the trade and vocational school was established in 1872, telegraph training in 1873, typesetting in 1875, and photography in 1890. Schepeler-Lette is also remembered for recognizing the need to train and retrain instructors.&lt;ref name="parlament-berlin.de"&gt;{{cite web|title=Präsident Ralf Wieland enthüllt Büste von Anna Schepeler-Lette (25.02.2014)|url=http://www.parlament-berlin.de/de/Meldungen/Praesident-Ralf-Wieland-enthuellt-Bueste-von-Anna-Schepeler-Lette|publisher=Parliament Berlin|accessdate=29 May 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her death in 1897, the artist Alexander Tondeur created a bust in her honor.&lt;ref name="parlament-berlin.de" /&gt;

The name "applied behavior analysis" has replaced [[behavior modification]] because the latter approach suggested attempting to change behavior without clarifying the relevant behavior-environment interactions. In contrast, ABA tries to change behavior by first [[Functional analysis (psychology)|assessing the functional relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment]].&lt;ref name=JABA/&gt; Further, the approach often seeks to develop socially acceptable alternatives for aberrant behaviors.&lt;ref name=JABA&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mace, F.C.|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1994|volume=27|pages=385–392|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-385|pmc=1297814|issue=2|pmid=16795830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JABA2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baer, D.M.|author2= Wolf, M.M.|author3= Risley, T.R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Some still-current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1987|volume=20|issue=4|pages=313–327|doi=10.1901/jaba.1987.20-313|pmc=1286071|pmid=16795703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEAB&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F.C.

==Definition==
ABA is an applied science devoted to developing procedures which will produce observable changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=JABA3/&gt; It is to be distinguished from the [[experimental analysis of behavior]], which focuses on basic experimental research,&lt;ref name=As-in-ABA&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dillenburger, K. |author2=Keenan, M. |title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths |journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=193–95 |year=2009 |pmid=19404840 |doi=10.1080/13668250902845244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it uses principles developed by such research, in particular [[operant conditioning]] and [[classical conditioning]]. Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of [[radical behaviorism]], treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses. This represents a shift away from methodological behaviorism, which restricts behavior-change procedures to behaviors that are overt, and was the conceptual underpinning of [[behavior modification]].

Behavior analysts also emphasize that the science of behavior must be a ''natural'' science as opposed to a ''social'' science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marr |first1=M |title=The natural selection: behavior analysis as a natural science |journal=European Journal of Behavior Analysis |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=103–118 |url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034739/http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior with the environment, including [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] and consequences, without resort to [[Subfields of psychology|"hypothetical constructs"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson, T. |doi=10.1901/jeab.1984.41-211 |pmc=1348034 |year=1984 |title=The examining magistrate for nature: a retrospective review of Claude Bernard's An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=2 |issue=41 |pages=212–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of ABA can be traced back to the research of Teodoro Ayllon and [[Jack Michael]] with their study "The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer" (1959) that they submitted to the ''[[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'' (JEAB) as part of their doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Houston]]. The researchers were training the staff and nurses at a [[psychiatric hospital]] how to use a [[token economy]] based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[behavioral engineering]]&amp;mdash;a synonym for ABA,&lt;ref name=behavioranalysislearning&gt;

In 1968, Baer, Bijou, Risley, Birnbrauer, Wolf, and James Sherman joined the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the [[University of Kansas]], where they founded the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis''.&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baer|first1=Donald M.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1993|volume=26|issue=4|pages=569–570|doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-569|pmid=16795815|pmc=1297894|title=A brief, selective history of the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas: The early years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable graduate students from the University of Washington include Robert Wahler, James Sherman, and [[Ivar Lovaas]].&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty/&gt; Lovaas established the UCLA Young Autism Project while teaching at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and devoted nearly half a century to groundbreaking research and practice aimed at improving the lives of children with autism and their families. In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior,&lt;ref name="Lovaas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=T|author2=Eikseth|title=S|journal=Journal of Autism &amp; Developmental Disorders|date=14 December 2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=375–378|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relied upon the methods of [[errorless learning]] that was initially devised by [[Charles Ferster]] to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury.&lt;ref name="Lovaas"/&gt; 

In 1987, Lovaas published the landmark study, "Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children".&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt; The experimental group in this study received up to 40-hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting using errorless [[discrete trial training]] (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact and language. ABA principles are used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, "Long-Term Outcome for Children With Autism Who Received Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment". Lovaas’ work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research outcomes were replicated in university and private settings. The "Lovaas Method" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or DTT for 30 to 40 hours per week. 

In addition to being a major contributor of ABA, Lovaas taught now prominent behaviorists, such as [[Robert Koegel]], Laura Schreibman, Tristram Smith, John McEachin, Ron Leaf, [[Doreen Granpeesheh]], Jacquie Wynn, and over 20,000 UCLA students who took his "Behavior Modification" course during his 50 years of teaching. He even cofounded what is today the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA), published hundreds of research articles and books, received state and national awards, and forced school districts to adopt evidenced based teaching programs. His work influenced how autism was treated, and improved the lives of parents and children stricken with the autism diagnosis worldwide.

Over the years, "behavior analysis" gradually superseded "behavior modification";  that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior.&lt;ref name=JEAB/&gt; This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior.

While ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used for [[applied animal behavior]] and [[clinical behavior analysis]], in [[behavioral medicine]], [[behavioral neuroscience]], and [[criminology]], to [[Organizational behavior management|increase job safety and performance]], [[Systematic desensitization|counteract phobias]], and [[Positive behavior support|improve classroom management]].&lt;ref name=PBSExpansion&gt;{{cite journal|title=Positive behavior support: Expanding the application of applied behavior analysis.|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Freeman|first2=KA|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=23|issue=1|pages=85–94|pmc=2731369|date=Spring 2000|pmid=22478340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abapbsschoolviolence&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying behavior analysis to school violence and discipline problems|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Kincald|first2=D|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=28|issue=1|pages=49–63|pmc=2755344|year=2005|pmid=22478439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWPBIS&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=schoolwide+positive+behavioral+interventions+%26+supports|title=The impact of schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and supports on bullying and peer rejection: a randomized controlled effectiveness trial|last1=Waasdorp|first1=TE|last2=Bradshaw|first2=CP|last3=Leaf|first3=PJ|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|volume=166|issue=2|pages=149–56|date=Winter 2012|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.755|pmid=22312173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Baer, Wolf, and Risley's 1968 article&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt; is still used as the standard description of ABA.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007&gt;{{cite book |ref = harvnb |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |url =http://wps.prenhall.com/chet_cooper_appliedbeh_2 |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lists the following the seven characteristics of ABA.
* '''Applied''':  ABA focuses on the social significance of the behavior studied. For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved.
* '''Behavioral''':  ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described.
* '''Analytic''':  Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation.&lt;ref name=BWR&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baer, D.M. |author2=Wolf, M.M. |author3=Risley, T.R. |year=1968 |title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 91–97 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91 |pmc=1310980 |pmid=16795165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations.  The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied. 
* '''Technological''':  The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately.&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt;  Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conceptually Systematic''':  Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions.  Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as "secondary reinforcement" or "errorless discrimination" where appropriate.
* '''Effective''':  Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed
* '''General''':  Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects.

===Other proposed characteristics===

In 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added:&lt;ref name=Heward&gt;{{cite book |editor=Heward, W.L. |year=2005 |title=Focus on behavior analysis in education: Achievements, challenges, and opportunities |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall/Merrill |isbn=0-13-111339-9|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Accountable''': To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stokes, Trevor |author2=Budd, Karen S. |title=A small matter of proof: the legacy of Donald M. Baer |publisher=Context Press |location=Reno, NV |year=2003 |isbn=1-878978-43-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Public''': The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations.
* '''Doable''': To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.&lt;ref name=Heward1&gt;Heward, 205 p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Empowering''': ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Optimistic''': According to several leading authors, behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons:
** The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment.
** Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements.
** As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success.
** The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable.

==Concepts==

===Behavior===
{{Main article|Behavior}}

Behavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=James M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993a |title=Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum Associates |page=23 |isbn=0-8058-0905-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a ''response'' is a single instance of that behavior.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. "Repertoire" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do.

====Operant conditioning====
{{Main article|Operant conditioning}}

Operant behavior is the so-called "voluntary" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the [[three-term contingency]] that uses [[stimulus control]], in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as [[reinforcement]] or [[punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades.

====Respondent (classical) conditioning====
{{Main article|Classical conditioning}}

Respondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not ''produce'' a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food ''because'' it salivates).

===Environment===

The environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists.&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"&gt;Michael, J. (2004). ''Concepts and principles of behavior analysis'' (rev. ed.) Kalamazoo, MI: Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included.  A stimulus is an "energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells".&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"/&gt;

'''A stimulus can be described''':
* '''Topographically''' by its physical features.
* '''Temporally''' by when it occurs.
* '''Functionally''' by its effect on behavior.

===Reinforcement===
{{Main article|Reinforcement}}

Reinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Flora, S.R. |title=The power of reinforcement |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in most behavior change programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-527 |author1=Northup, J. |author2=Vollmer, T.R. |author3=Serret, K. |year=1993 |title=Publication trends in 25 years of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |journal= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=527–37 |pmid=16795803 |pmc=1297882}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple [[schedules of reinforcement]] that affect the future probability of behavior.

===Punishment===
{{Main article|Punishment (psychology)}}

Punishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added ([[positive punishment]]) or removed ([[negative punishment]]). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese E.P. |title=The analysis of human operant behavior |publisher=Brown |location=Dubuque IA |year=1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.

===Extinction===
{{Main article|Extinction (psychology)}}

Extinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] procedures.

===Discriminated operant and three-term contingency===

In addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S–R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moxley, R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism. The philosophy of behavior analysis |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_5/ai_n28246897/ |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=108–25 |doi=10.1037/h0100137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This antecedent–behavior–consequence contingency is termed the three-term contingency. A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of [[stimulus control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as "Setting Event", "Establishing Operations", and "Motivating Operations" by various researchers in their publications.

===Verbal behavior===
{{Main article|Verbal Behavior}}

[[B.F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner's]] classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2007). Promoting generalization and maintenance of skills learned via natural language teaching. ''SPL-ABA'' 1(4)–2(1), 97–138&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's system includes:
* [[Tact (psychology)]] – a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement.
* [[Mand (psychology)]] – behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer.
* Intraverbals – verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question).
* [[Autoclitic]] – secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of "I think..." vs. "I know...")

For assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]].

==Measuring behavior==

When measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=J.M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993b |title=Readings for Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |edition=2nd |location=Hillsdale, HF |publisher=Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-0906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeatability===

Response classes occur repeatedly throughout time—i.e., how many times the behavior occurs.
* '''Count''' is the number of occurrences in behavior.
* '''Rate/frequency''' is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time.
* '''Celeration''' is the measure of how the rate changes over time.

===Temporal extent===

This dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time—i.e., how long the behavior occurs.
* '''Duration''' is the amount of time in which the behavior occurs.

===Temporal locus===

Each instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time—i.e., when the behavior occurs.
* '''Response latency''' is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response.
* '''Interresponse time''' is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class.

===Derivative measures===

Derivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions:
* '''Percentage''' is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities.
* '''Trials-to-criterion''' are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of performance.

==Analyzing behavior change==

===Experimental control===

In applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At least one participant
* At least one behavior (dependent variable)
* At least one setting
* A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data
* At least one treatment or intervention condition
* Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed
* An intervention that will benefit the participant in some way&lt;ref&gt;[[Behavioral Cusp]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional analysis (psychology)==
{{main article|Functional analysis (psychology)}}

===History of functional analysis===

Prior to the seminal article on functional analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology available to them at the time. Instead of treating the function of the disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead ''pre-assume'' consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, [[B.F. Skinner]]) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.

In 1977, Edward Carr published a paper on potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) [[negative reinforcement]] in the form of removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.

In 1982, Iwata and colleagues conducted the first experimental analysis of the maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine whether or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.

===Functional behavior assessment (FBA)===
Functional assessment of behavior provides hypotheses about the relationships between specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors as the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.

===Functions of behavior===

Behavior serves two major functions for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior to get something or to get out of something.  When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, "What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?" Described below are the common functions of behavior.

==== Obtain socially mediated events ====

''Access to attention (positive reinforcement: social)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain attention from another person. For example, a child throws a toy because it characteristically results in mom's attention. (If this behavior results in mom looking at child and giving him lots of attention—even if she's saying "NO"—he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of attention include, but are not limited to, hugs, kisses, reprimands, frowns, smiles, etc.

''Access to tangibles (positive reinforcement: tangible/activity)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain a specific item or engage in a specific activity from another person. For example, a child hits mom because s/he wants the toy mom is holding. (If this behavior results in mom giving the child the toy, s/he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of tangible items include, but are not limited to, food, toys, movies, video games, etc.

''Automatic positive reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because the response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging in the behavior produces reinforcing stimulation unique to the specific context. For example, a child hits his/her eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, but are not limited to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc.

==== Escape/avoid undesirable events (negative reinforcement) ====

===== Escape/avoid socially mediated events =====

''Escape/removal of attention'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking in front of the class. Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.

''Escape/removal of tasks or activities'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, when a child is told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a set of worksheets, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principal's office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing the worksheets. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, etc.

===== Escape/avoid specific stimulation =====

''Automatic negative reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging in the behavior decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs his head against the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.

=== Function versus topography ===

As previously stated function refers to the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are likely to be effective.

=== Method of identifying functions of behavior ===

'''FBA methods can be classified into three types''':
* Indirect assessment
* Descriptive assessment
* Functional (experimental) analysis

==== Indirect FBA ====

This method uses structured interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires to obtain information from persons who are familiar with the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as "indirect" because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments.

==== Descriptive FBA ====

Unlike the indirect methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior. These observations occur in the environment in which the behavior naturally occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.) therefore there is no direct manipulation of the environment.
The most common form of descriptive assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received appropriate training on how to record the data.
Another form of descriptive FBA is called a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and setting in which the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, it can be used to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest.

==== Functional (experimental) analysis ====

A functional analysis is the most direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects on the behavior of interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a functional analysis, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) it can be said that there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://autism.outreach.psu.edu/sites/omcphplive.outreach.psu.edu.drpms.autismconference/files/42%20and%2055%20Presentation.pdf | title=Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior: the Basics | date=2010 | author=Brian A.

Below, common examples of experimental conditions are described.
A standard functional analysis normally has four conditions (three test conditions and one control).

===== Attention =====

In this condition, the experimenter gives the individual moderately preferred items and instructs them to go play. After that initial instruction, the experimenter pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly in the form of a reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.

===== Escape =====

In this condition, the experimenter instructs the individual that it is time to work. After the initial instruction, the experimenter delivers a series of demands that the individual is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained.

===== Alone =====
In this condition, the child is left alone with a variety of items to engage with. If the child engages in the behavior of interest, no programmed consequences are delivered. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be automatically maintained.

===== Control (play) =====

In this condition, the child is allowed to engage with a variety of items during the session. No demands are placed on the child throughout the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.

===Conducting a functional behavior assessment===

Functional behavior assessments are rarely limited to only one of the methods described above. The most common, and most preferred, method for identifying the function of behavior can be seen as a four-part processes.
# The gathering of information via indirect and descriptive assessment.
# Interpretation of information from indirect and descriptive assessment and formulation of a hypothesis about the purpose of problem behavior.
# Testing of a hypothesis using a functional analysis.
# Developing intervention options based on the function of problem behavior.

===Task analysis===

[[Task analysis]] is a process in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: [[forward chaining]], [[Backward chaining (applied behavior analysis)|backward chaining]] and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crowell, C.R. |author2=Anderson, D.C. |author3=Abel, D.M. |author4=Sergio, J.P. |year=1988 |title=Task clarification, performance feedback, and social praise: procedures for improving the customer service of bank tellers |journal=[[J Appl Behav Anal]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages= 65–71 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1988.21-65 |pmid=16795713 |pmc=1286094}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behavioral script]]s often emerge from a task analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-89 |author1=MacDuff, G.S. |author2=Krantz, P.J. |author3=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to use photographic activity schedules: Maintenance and generalization of complex response chains |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=89–97 |pmid=8473261 |pmc=1297722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-121 |author1=Krantz, P.J. |author2=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to initiate to peers: Effects of a script-fading procedure |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=121–32 |pmid=8473251 |pmc=1297725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergan, J.R. |year=1977 |title=Behavioral Consultation |publisher=Merrill |isbn=0-675-08488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kratochwill, T.R. |author2=Van Someren, K.R. |author3=Sheridan, S.M. |year=1989 |title=Training behavioral consultants: a competency-based model to teach interview skills |journal=Professional School Psychology |volume=4 |pages=41–58 |doi=10.1037/h0090570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Normington, C.J. |author3=Miller, C.D. |author4=Morrill, W.H. |author5=Haase, R.F. |year=1968 |title=Microcounseling and attending behavior: an approach to prepracticum counselor training |journal=[[J Couns Psychol]] |volume=15 |issue=5, pt. 2 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1037/h0026129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Ivey, M.B. |year=1998 |title=Intentional Interviewing and Counseling: Facilitating Client Development in a Multicultural Society |edition=4th |publisher=Brooks/Cole |isbn=0-534-35756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwata, B.A. |author2=Wong, S.E. |author3=Riordan, M.M. |author4=Dorsey, M.F. |author5=Lau, M.M. |year=1982 |title=Assessment and training of clinical interviewing skills: Analogue analysis and field replication |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |pmid=7118753 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=191–203 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1982.15-191 |pmc=1308264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivey would later call this "behaviorist" phase a very productive one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Couns Dev |year=2001 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=105–18 |title=Allen E.

===Chaining===
{{Main article|Chaining}}

The skill to be learned is broken down into small units for easy learning. For example, a person learning to brush teeth independently may start with learning to unscrew the toothpaste cap. Once they have learned this, the next step may be squeezing the tube, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weiss, K.M. |year=1978 |title=A comparison of forward and backward procedures for the acquisition of response chains in humans |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=255–59 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1978.29-255 |pmid=16812053 |pmc=1332753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem behavior, chains can also be analyzed and the chain can be disrupted to prevent the problem behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walker, H.M. |year=1995 |title=The Acting-Out Child: Coping With Classroom Disruption |edition=2nd |publisher=Sopris West |isbn=1-57035-047-7}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some behavior therapies, such as [[dialectical behavior therapy]], make extensive use of behavior chain analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Linehan, M.M. |year=1993 |title=Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=0-89862-034-1}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prompting===

A [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompt]] is a cue that is used to encourage a desired response from an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ontario Ministry of Education |year=2007 |title=Effective Educational Practices for Students with ASD |publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prompts are often categorized into a prompt hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive, although there is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive, those that are physically intrusive or those that are hardest prompt to fade (e.g.,verbal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnett, D.W. |year=2006 |title=Preschool Intervention Scripts: Lessons from 20 years of Research and Practice |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6888/is_2_2/ai_n28461339/ |journal=Journal of Speech Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=158–81 |doi=10.1037/h0100216|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to minimize errors and ensure a high level of success during learning, prompts are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |last2=Pear |year=2003 |title=Behavior Modification: What is it and how to do it? |edition=7th |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this process, prompts are faded quickly as possible so that the learner does not come to depend on them and eventually behaves appropriately without prompting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=VanDerHeyden, A.M. |author2=Snyder, P. |author3=DiCarlo, C.F. |author4=Stricklin, S.B. |author5=Vagianos, L.A. |year=2002 |title=Comparison of within-stimulus and extra-stimulus prompts to increase targeted play behaviors in an inclusive early intervention program |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132946/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=188–97 |doi=10.1037/h0099967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chesnut, M. |author2=Williamson, P.N. |author3=Morrow, J.E. |year=2003 |title=The use of visual cues to teach receptive skills to children with severe auditory discrimination deficits |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_4/ai_n28173253/ |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=212–24 |doi=10.1037/h0100120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Types of prompts'''
Prompters might use any or all of the following to suggest the desired response:
* Vocal prompts: Words or other vocalizations
* Visual prompts: A visual cue or picture
* Gestural prompts: A physical gesture
* Positional prompt: e.g., the target item is placed close to the individual.
* Modeling: Modeling the desired response. This type of prompt is best suited for individuals who learn through imitation and can attend to a model.
* Physical prompts: Physically manipulating the individual to produce the desired response. There are many degrees of physical prompts, from quite intrusive (e.g. the teacher places a hand on the learner's hand) to minimally intrusive (e.g. a slight tap).&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"/&gt;

This is not an exhaustive list of prompts; the nature, number, and order of prompts are chosen to be the most effective for a particular individual.

===Fading===

The overall goal is for an individual to eventually not need prompts. As an individual gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt. This ensures that the individual does not become overly dependent on a particular prompt when learning a new behavior or skill.

===Thinning a reinforcement schedule===

Thinning is often confused with fading. Fading refers to a prompt being removed, where thinning refers to an increase in the time or number of responses required between reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LeBlanc, L.A. |author2=Hagoplan, L.P. |author3=Maglieri, K.A. |author4=Poling, A. |year=2002 |title=Decreasing the intensity of reinforcement-based interventions for reducing behavior: conceptual issues and a proposed model for clinical practice |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_3/ai_n28132960/ |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1037/h0099991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic thinning that produces a 30% decrease in reinforcement has been suggested as an efficient way to thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cautilli, J. |year=2005 |title=Brief report: application of proposed model of decreasing reinforcement intensity |journal=Int J Behav Consult Ther |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6886/is_1_1/ai_n28321102/ |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–36 |doi=10.1037/h0100731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schedule thinning is often an important and neglected issue in [[contingency management]] and [[token economy]] systems, especially when these are developed by unqualified practitioners (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R. (2005). ''Ethics for behavior analysts.'' LEA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalization===

Generalization is the expansion of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberto  |last2=Troutman |year=2006 |title=Applied behavior analysis for teachers |edition=7th  |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or his school and then ''generalize'' the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osnes, P.G. |author2=Lieblein, T. |year=2003 |title=An explicit technology of generalization |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_4_3/ai_n28132927/ |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=364–74 |doi=10.1037/h0099994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaping===
{{Main article|Shaping (psychology)}}

Shaping involves gradually modifying the existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then he or she could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of [[operant conditioning]] principles and [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]]. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kemp, S.M. |author2=Eckerman, D.A. |year=2002 |title=Simulating a shaping task |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132944/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=166–78 |doi=10.1037/h0099975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One teaching technique found to be effective with some students, particularly children, is the use of video modeling (the use of taped sequences as exemplars of behavior). It can be used by therapists to assist in the acquisition of both verbal and [[voluntary action|motor]] responses, in some cases for long [[chaining|chains]] of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D'Ateno, P. |author2=Mangiapanello, K. |author3=Taylor, B.A. |year= 2002 |title=Using video modeling to teach complex play sequences to a preschooler with autism |journal=J Posit Behav Interv |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–11 |doi=10.1177/10983007030050010801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Corbett, B.A. |author2=Abdullah, M. |year=2005 |title=Video modeling: why does it work for children with autism? |journal=J Early Intensive Behav Interv |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |doi=10.1037/h0100294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interventions based on an FBA===

Critical to behavior analytic interventions is the concept of a systematic behavioral [[case formulation]] with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tryon, W.W. |year=1976 |title=A system of behavioral diagnosis |journal=[[Prof Psychol]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=495–506 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.7.4.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kanfer, F.H. |author2=Saslow, G. |year=1969 |chapter=Behavioral diagnosis |editor=Franks CM |title=Behavior Therapy: Appraisal and Status |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=417–44 |oclc=24223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach should apply a behavior analytic [[theory of change]] (see [[Behavioral change theories]]). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Romano, J.M. |author2=Jensen, M.P. |author3=Turner, J.A. |author4=Good, A.B. |author5=Hops, H. |year=2000 |title=Chronic pain patient-partner interactions: further support for a behavioral model of chronic pain |journal=Behav Ther |volume=31 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(00)80023-4 |pages=415–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malott, R.W. |year=1992 |title=A theory of rule-governed behavior and organizational behavior management |journal=J Organ Behav Manage |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=45–65 |doi= 10.1300/J075v12n02_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Malott, R.W. |author2=Shimamune, S. |author3=Malott, M.E. |year=1992 |title=Rule-governed behavior and organizational behavior management: an analysis of interventions |journal=J Organ Behav Manage |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=103–16 |doi=10.1300/J075v12n02_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hayes, S.C. |author2=Brownstein, A.J. |author3=Zettle, R.D. |author4=Rosenfarb, I. |author5=Korn, Z. |year=1986 |title=Rule-governed behavior and sensitivity to changing consequences of responding |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=237–56 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1986.45-237 |pmid=16812448 |pmc=1348236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gerhardt, P.F. |author2=Weiss, M.J. |author3=Delmolino, L. |year=2003 |title=Treatment of severe aggression in an adolescent with autism: non-contingent reinforcement and functional communication training |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_4_4/ai_n28173265/ |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=386–94 |doi=10.1037/h0100124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 2007 clinical report of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded that the benefit of ABA-based interventions in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) "has been well documented" and that "children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and [[adaptive behavior]] as well as some measures of social behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title=Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |author1=Myers, S.M. |author2=Johnson, C.P. |author3=Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers from the [[MIND Institute]] published an evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches in 2008. On the basis of "the strength of the findings from the four best-designed, controlled studies", they were of the opinion that one ABA-based approach (the [[Lovaas technique]] created by [[Ole Ivar Løvaas]]) is "well-established" for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Rogers2008&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |year=2008 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=8–38 |title=Evidence-based comprehensive treatments for early autism |author1=Rogers, S.J. |author2=Vismara, L.A. |doi=10.1080/15374410701817808 |pmc=2943764 |pmid=18444052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 review of psycho-educational interventions for children with autism whose mean age was six years or less at intake found that five high-quality ("Level 1" or "Level 2") studies assessed ABA-based treatments. On the basis of these and other studies, the author concluded that ABA is "well-established" and is "demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children with autism when treatment is intensive and carried out by trained therapists".&lt;ref name=Eikeseth2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=158–78 |year=2009 |title=Outcome of comprehensive psycho-educational interventions for young children with autism |author=Eikeseth, S. |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2008.02.003 |pmid=18385012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5467678_Outcome_of_comprehensive_psycho-educational_interventions_for_young_children_with_autism}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review committee also concluded that "there is a great need for more knowledge about which interventions are most effective".
* A 2009 paper included a descriptive analysis, an effect size analysis, and a [[meta-analysis]] of 13 reports published from 1987 to 2007 of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI, a form of ABA-based treatment with origins in the Lovaas technique) for autism. It determined that EIBI's effect sizes were "generally positive" for IQ, adaptive behavior, expressive language, and receptive language. The paper did note limitations of its findings including the lack of published comparisons between EIBI and other "empirically validated treatment programs".&lt;ref name=Reichow2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |title=Comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral interventions for young children with autism based on the UCLA Young Autism Project model |author1=Reichow, B. |author2=Wolery, M. |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0596-0 |pmid=18535894}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 2009 [[systematic review]] of 11 studies published from 1987 to 2007, the researchers wrote "there is strong evidence that EIBI is effective for some, but not all, children with autism spectrum disorders, and there is wide variability in response to treatment". Furthermore, any improvements are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention.&lt;ref name=Howlin2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Howlin, P. |author2=Magiati, I. |author3=Charman, T. |editor=MacLean, Jr. |editor2=William E. |title=Systematic review of early intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism |journal=Am J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19143460 |doi=10.1352/2009.114:23-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies published from 1987 to 2007 concluded that EIBI has a "large" effect on full-scale intelligence and a "moderate" effect on adaptive behavior in autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eldevik, S. |author2=Hastings, R.P. |author3=Hughes, J.C. |author4=Jahr, E. |author5=Eikeseth, S. |author6=Cross, S. |title=Meta-analysis of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for children with autism |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=439–50 |year=2009 |pmid=19437303 |doi=10.1080/15374410902851739}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, investigators from [[Vanderbilt University]] under contract with the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] performed a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on ABA-based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders; the ABA-based therapies included the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]/Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model (the latter developed by Sally Rogers and [[Geraldine Dawson]]).&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011&gt;{{cite book |author1=Warren, Z. |author2=Veenstra-VanderWeele, J. |author3=Stone, W. |author4=Bruzek, J.L. |author5=Nahmias, A.S. |author6=Foss-Feig, J.H. |author7=Jerome, R.N. |author8=Krishnaswami, S. |author9=Sathe, N.A. |author10=Glasser, A.M. |author11=Surawicz, T. |author12=McPheeters, M.L. |title=Therapies for children with autism spectrum disorders |year=2011 |url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |series=AHRQ Publication No. 11-EHC029-EF, Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 26 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |location=Rockville, MD |access-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002035802/http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that "both approaches were associated with ... improvements in cognitive performance, language skills, and adaptive behavior skills".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-9}} However, they also concluded that "the strength of evidence ... is low", "many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment", "subgroups may account for a majority of the change", there is "little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies", and the published studies "used small samples, different treatment approaches and duration, and different outcome measurements".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-10}}

A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving a total of 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews.&lt;ref name= Spreckley2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spreckley, M. |author2=Boyd, R. |title=Efficacy of applied behavioral intervention in preschool children with autism for improving cognitive, language, and adaptive behavior: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J Pediatr |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=338–44 |year=2009 |pmid=18950798 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior.&lt;ref name=Spreckley2009/&gt; In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, T. |author2=Eikeseth, S. |author3=Sallows, G.O. |author4=Graupner, T.D. |title=Efficacy of applied behavior analysis in autism |journal=J Pediatr |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=151–52; author reply 152–53 |year=2009 |pmid=19559310 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2009.01.065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site [[randomized trial]]s are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref name="Begoli, PRS-ABA, ABA Ontology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begoli|first1=Edmon|title=Procedural-Reasoning Architecture for Applied Behavior Analysis-based Instructions|date=May 2014|publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|location=Knoxville, Tennessee, USA|pages=44–79|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/2749|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States District Court Judge ruled withholding ABA from children (0–21) with autism causes irreparable harm, finding Elizabeth Dudek of Florida's Agency for Healthcare Administration's position suggesting ABA was experimental was arbitrary and capricious, ordering AHCA enjoined from withholding ABA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autism-u.com/helpdoc/Order-Case-No-11-20684-CIV.PDF Permanent Injunction Order]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, CMS ordered its guidance that all states to cover ABA via [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] and [[Early Head Start]] EPSDT programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/CIB-07-07-14.pdf | title=CMCS Informational Bulletin: Clarification of Medicaid Coverage of Services to Children with Autism | publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research is clearly required, specifically to include larger and thus more representative samples.

===Criticism===
Conversely, various major figures within the autistic community have written biographies detailing harm caused by the provision of ABA. Several of these people have since been diagnosed with [[PTSD]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Less scholarly reviews were provided by [[Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn|Elizabeth Devita-Raeburn]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/aba-autism-controversy/495272/|title=Is the Most Common Therapy for Autism Cruel?|first=Elizabeth|last=DeVita-Raeburn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine and by an ex-practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/why-i-left-aba/|title=Why I Left ABA|first= Anxious |last=Advocate |website=sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. A 2017 study, based on a survey of 'post-traumatic stress symptoms' completed by individuals with presumed, self-reported diagnosis of ASD and their caregivers, found that 46% of the individuals who also reported receiving ABA treatment met the author's "diagnostic threshold for PTSD" via their survey score, versus 28% of respondents not reporting receipt of ABA treatment. Individuals reported as receiving ABA were 86% more likely on average (41% for adults, 130% for children) to meet the author's "diagnostic threshold".&lt;ref&gt;Henny Kupferstein. Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autism exposed to applied behavior analysis . "Advances in Autism". 4 (1), pp. 19-29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2017 study was heavily criticized by peer reviewers who noted, among other things, that her methods for recruiting participants were faulty, she did not use appropriate operative definitions for PTSS versus PTSD, and there was detected bias baked into the hypothesis of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Barrett Leaf. Evaluating Kupferstein's claims of the relationship of behavioral intervention to PTSS for individuals with autism. "Emerald Insight". Advances in Autism, 4(3), 122-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage''' (French: centre régional arabe pour le patrimoine mondial ; Arabic: المركز الإقليمي العربي للتراث العالمي) is a Category 2 Centre under the auspices of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;The Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage (ARC-WH) was established by the General  Conference of UNESCO at its 35th session in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; founded as an autonomous and independent Bahraini public institution in 2010.

The ARC-WH purpose is to reinforce the implementation of the [[World Heritage Convention]] in the Arab States region, by enhancing the knowledge of it, promoting the Operational Guidelines and the cooperating among the States Parties of the Arab States region.

ARC-WH is meant to respond to the provisions of the '''Global Strategy for a Representative, Balanced and Credible World Heritage List''' is also intended to assist the implementation of the '''Global Training Strategy for World Cultural and Natural Heritage''' (Helsinki, 2001).

ARC-WH has 18 member States: [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Tunisia]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemen]].

The main objective of ARC-WH is to assist States Parties in the implementation of the World Heritage Convention in the Arab States region along three main major axes : '''information''', '''assistance''', '''logistical &amp; financial'''.

==History==

The Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage was established by the Royal Decree issued on 16 December 2010, following the General Conference of UNESCO at its 35th session in 2009. The two legislative chambers ratified the agreement between UNESCO and the Government of Bahrain. The agreement following the decision of the General Conference (35th session)
was signed in February 2010 by the Director-General of UNESCO, [[Irina Bokova]] and the Culture Minister of Bahrain [[Sh. Mai Bint Muhammad Al Khalifa|Sh. Mai Bint Mohammed Al Khalifa]].

As of 23 December 2011, all formalities related to the Agreement were completed upon the receipt of the letter of enforcement by UNESCO. Following the entry into force of the Agreement, the first meeting of the Governing Board was held on 28 April 2012 for the approval of the internal regulations, recruit the founding team of the Centre and approve the first year work plan.

==Activities==

ARC-WH will organize its activities along three main axes:

1. The provision of information relating to the World Heritage Convention and its application, including development and management of an Arabic language website, the translation and publication of relevant documents, and promotion of the establishment of new conservation programmes at universities, in all the Arab region States.

2. The provision of assistance to States Parties in the region to improve their ability to implement the WH Convention (including understanding of WH policy, concepts, rules of procedure, preparation of tentative lists, preparation of nominations, monitoring of state of conservation, education programmes etc.) by facilitating organization of appropriate WH
training at ARC-WH’s premises or anywhere else in the region, and responding to State Party requests for assistance.

3. The provision of logistical and financial support for regional activities in support of the WH Convention including hosting of meetings, conferences, training workshops or exhibitions in the region; the identification of appropriate facilities and services (lecture rooms, equipment, competent translators, etc.) for planned meetings for the WH Centre and other international institutions in the region, and the raising of funds to support World Heritage activities in the region.

==Related International Agencies==
ARC-WH will meet its objectives in close coordination with existing international, regional and national agencies, initiatives
and programmes concerned with World Heritage in the Arab States region including but not limited to:

• international organizations such as [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, and in particular, its ATHAR programme to “protect and promote the rich cultural heritage in the Arab region”; [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature); [[ICOMOS]] (International Council on Monuments and Sites)

• regional organizations such as [[ALECSO]] (The Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization), Tunisia; [[ROPME]] (Regional Organisation for the Protection of the Marine Environment – Kuwait; [[UNEP]], and [[PERSGA]] (Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden-Jeddah);

• national conservation agencies (the various Departments and Directorates of Antiquities in the region), and national conservation organisations such as [[CULTNAT]] (Centre for Documentation of Cultural and Natural Heritage), Egypt, affiliated with Bibliotheca Alexandrina and supported by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of Egypt), and [[CERKAS]] (Centre de Restauration et de Rehabilitation de zones atlasiques et sub-atlasiques), Morocco.

'''Armenian Distance Learning Network''' (ADLN) is the first [[Armenian language|Armenian]] [[e-learning]] project. The project was launched in early 2002 and was restructured and updated in January, 2006. ADLN courses are business based and target [[Armenian language|Armenian]] speaking users of the [[Internet]]. The project was designed as a contribution to the development of [[Armenian language|Armenian]] beginner entrepreneurs who wish to be involved in the growth of [[e-business]] in [[Armenia]] as well as the country’s general e-growth.  The web-page language is [[Armenian language|Armenian]]; the system is based on a [[course management system]] - [[Moodle]]. 

== History ==

The e-project ADLN was the first step to develop an [[e-learning]] [[community]] in [[Armenia]] and form a positive attitude towards the phenomenon. First e-course implemented by ADLN was entitled “[[Electronic Commerce]]”. The course materials were based on the first e-commerce book in [[Armenian Language]] “[[E-commerce]]” (2004) written by Albert Poghosyan. Fifty participants from all over [[Armenia]] were involved in the course, which offered also after course consultation opportunities if the participants express a desire to develop their own e-projects. After the graduation, the participants received a certificate together with the upper mentioned book. The second e-course that attracted more than 150 participants was entitled “Electronic Marketing” (2006). ADLN had 60 graduates that completed the whole learning and assessment process.  The third e-course entitled “PR in the new era of communication” is in the process of development. All courses are conducted only in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], thus the course development and adaptation process is considered to be of high importance. 
The system is connected to the Armenian Electronic Payment System - EDram, as well as international on-line &amp; credit card payment systems thus the users are able to register both – on-line and off-line. 
System tools of the ADLN system are:

'''Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University''' (formerly '''Azerbaijan State Oil Academy''')&lt;ref name="president.az"&gt;[http://president.az/articles/16054 "Azərbaycan Dövlət Neft Akademiyasının adının dəyişdirilməsi haqqında"] Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin 3 sentyabr 2015-ci il tarixli Sərəncamı. president.az, 03.09.2015&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dövlət Neft və Sənaye Universiteti}}) is a tertiary education institution in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

== History ==
The rise of what became ASOIU is tied to the rise of the [[petroleum industry]] in the Baku region. By 1887 the preparatory technical school that would become [[Baku Polytechnicum]] was established in Baku. By 1910 it had integrated a curriculum related to the growing oil industry. However, the ratio of [[Azeri]]s to non-Azeris was so skewed that, of the 494 students studying at the school in 1916, only 20 were Azeri. On November 14, 1920, after the invasion of the [[Red Army]] and the establishment of the fledgling [[Azerbaijan SSR]], the new government decreed that Baku Polytechnicum would close and be replaced by Baku Polytechnical Institute, a more traditional [[Institute of technology|polytechnic institute]] and the beginnings of the current incarnation. The new school focused on training engineers in a broad range of industries, from agriculture to oil. By 1923 the school graduated its first three students; by 1927 it had risen to 289 graduates.

The new school went through many name changes over the years as its emphasis changed to meet the needs of Azerbaijan. In 1923 the school changed its name to Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute. In 1929 the agriculture department was spun off into a separate Agriculture Institute and the university changed its name to the Azerbaijan Oil Institute (AOI) in 1930. However, the expanding need for engineers in areas outside oil resulted in expansion in the school's curriculum. The school changed names again in 1934, this time to the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute (Az.I.I.).

[[World War II]] taxed the Soviet Union and schools like Az.I.I. struggled to stay open. At the end of the war, there was great demand for oil engineers in the Soviet Union and the school trained them in great numbers. In 1952, the government founded a separate Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute and moved much of the non-petrochemical curricula to the new school so that Az.I.I. could focus on the oil industry. On February 12, 1959 the school was renamed the Azerbaijan Oil and Chemistry Institute (AzOCI). In the early 1960s an evening program was developed. This program developed into its own, separate public university in 1992, reusing the name Azerbaijan Industrial Institute and becoming [[Sumgait State University]]. On March 21, 1992, after the independence of Azerbaijan from the Soviet Union, the university changed its name to the current ASOIU.

In 1993 the school changed its curricula into a more Western model, with its first [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]] candidates graduating in 1999.

By the decree of the president, the university was named the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industrial University in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/16054|title=Azərbaycan Prezidentinin Rəsmi internet səhifəsi -  SƏNƏDLƏR » Sərəncamlar|website=president.az|language=az|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asoiu.edu.az/en/page/1-about-asoiu|title=About ASOIU|website=www.asoiu.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BACSAP''' (Bahrains' Association of Computer Students and Professionals) came into existence in April 1998, which was one of the first student chapters of Pakistan to be affiliated with ACM.

BACSAP was the brainchild of one of the students’ Shahnawaz Malik. Upon asking him how he came up with the idea he said that the basic motivation behind this concept was that there was no society, which could provide students with the chance to do something related to his or her field of study, because at university level education should not be just books and classrooms, but rather it requires something much more than that. The students really needed a platform that would prepare them for their practical and professional life. They also needed an opportunity to improve their management and leadership skills, because that is how they learned how to take initiative and then give a practical shape to their ideas.

Now BACSAP has around 150 members, and membership is opened twice a year with the start of each semester.

[[File:Career Edge Organization logo.gif|thumb|200px|Logo of the Canadian not-for-profit organisation Career Edge Organization]]
'''Career Edge Organization''' (also known as Career Edge or CareerEdge.ca) Career Edge Organization (CEO) is Canada's largest provider of paid internships, engaging in connecting companies with qualified talent; while giving job seekers the chance to break into the workforce and launch their career.   CEO focuses its efforts on helping four distinct candidate segments (new graduates, new graduates with self-declared disabilities, internationally qualified professionals coming to or who have recently immigrated to Canada along with Canadian Armed Force Reservists overcome barriers to meaningful employment.

CEO tackles the "no experience, no job cycle" by offering work experience opportunities with a paid internship model that includes coaching/mentoring, on-the-job training, industry knowledge transfer, and networking as four key pillars.  Together these components offer interns the opportunity to gain the knowledge, experience and connections they will need to launch a successful career.

CEO was the first online [[Employment website|job board]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, A: ''PM appeals to business to join youth jobs plan 3,000 to be hired as $90 million project kicks off'', page A.2. Toronto Star, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Career Edge Organization is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. www.careeredge.ca

==History and activities==
In 1996, a group of business leaders from some of Canada's largest organizations committed to make a significant contribution to youth employability by developing the Career Edge Organization and Career Edge, a unique and innovative internship program. This initiative was created in response to a finding in the mid-1990s that more than 600,000 Canadian graduates were unemployed or under-employed.

In 1999, a paid internship program specifically for graduates with disabilities was added to the organization and was called "Ability Edge." Further demographic changes and skills shortages led to the creation of the Career Bridge paid internship program for "internationally qualified professionals" in 2003.

In 2009, Career Edge Organization was the first to conduct a nationwide study of diverse [[Generation Y]] Canadians, in partnership with Angus Reid Strategies (formerly Ipsos Reid).&lt;ref&gt;Marketwire (September 30, 2009). [http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Gen-Y-Speaks-Up-to-Reject-Entitlement-Label-1052415.htm ''Gen Y Speaks Up to Reject Entitlement Label'']. Press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their inception, over 1,000 employers have worked closely with Career Edge Organization. In September 2010, Career Edge Organization reached a notable milestone and celebrated the placement of over 10,000 interns.

In December 2011, Career Edge Organization relaunched their online presence with a new website that takes advantage of social media and their recent rebranding exercise to unify and focus their three core programs under one web portal.

Career Edge Organization partnered with the HRPA to deliver a new specialized program for Canadian employers which allows them to achieve their organizational objectives by accessing CHRP candidates for short-term HR projects. In February 2012, Career Edge Organization also celebrated with GE Canada when they placed their 500th intern.&lt;ref&gt;Newswire Canada (February 2012).

'''Columba Ryan''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Dominican Order|OP]]}} (born Patrick Ryan, 13 January 1916 – 4 August 2009) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican priest]] who was a philosophy teacher, university chaplain, and pastor.  He was the brother of [[John Ryan (cartoonist)|John Ryan]], the British animator and cartoonist.

== Life ==
Patrick Ryan was born in [[Hampstead]] in 1916, the second son of [[Sir Andrew Ryan]], a British diplomat who was the last [[dragoman]] in [[Constantinople]], and his wife Ruth. Patrick was educated at [[Ampleforth College|Ampleforth]] in North Yorkshire.  In 1935 he entered the [[Dominican Order]] at [[Woodchester Priory]] in Gloucestershire where he was given the name Columba.

At the age of 30 (in 1946) he completed his DPhil at [[Oxford University]].  He was one of the friars who was on the Peace Pilgrimage to Vézelay in Burgundy, selecting "30 strong men" to carry a heavy wooden cross across France in thanksgiving for the end of the [[Second World War]].

Ryan had an analytical mind and enjoyed philosophical controversy and debate.  While teaching philosophy at the Dominican House of Studies at [[Hawkesyard Priory|Hawkesyard]] in 1954, he set up a Philosophical Enquiry Group, an annual meeting for Catholic philosophers held at the nearby [[Spode House]]. The Catholic philosophers [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] and [[Peter Geach]] were among the first invited, remaining leading figures of the group for the 20 years. He was also bursar at the priory.

He was briefly in charge of studies at [[Blackfriars, Oxford]], where he was pro-regent of studies,&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Herald 2009&lt;/ref&gt; then became chaplain to the Catholic students at the [[University of Strathclyde]].

Ryan's contribution to philosophy and theology was more through his influence on the people he taught, although a short piece 'The Traditional Concept of Natural Law: an Interpretation' (which he claimed to have written on the train before he gave it as a lecture) has been influential.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic News 2009,  see also Lisska p.80&lt;/ref&gt; His students included [[Herbert McCabe]] and Timothy McDermott, both translators of the Blackfriars Summa, and [[Fergus Gordon Kerr|Fergus Kerr]].

He was an early pioneer of religious broadcasting, producing and narrating films about the religious life.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Herald 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He died, aged 93, on what was then the Feast of [[St Dominic]].

[[File:Cramming.jpg|thumb|A young boy does some last minute cramming while walking to school with his sister]]
In education, '''cramming''' (also known as '''mugging''' or '''swotting''', from
''[[wikt:swot|swot]],'' akin to "[[sweat]]", meaning "to study with determination") is the practice of working intensively to absorb large volumes of informational material in short amounts of time. It is often done by students in preparation for upcoming exams, especially just before they are due. Usually the student's priority is to obtain shallow recall suited to a superficial examination protocol, rather than to internalize the deep structure of the subject matter. Cramming is often discouraged by educators because the hurried coverage of material tends to result in poor long-term retention of material, a phenomenon often referred to as the [[spacing effect]]. Despite this, educators nevertheless widely persist in the use of [[multiple choice|superficial examination protocols]], because these questions are easier to compose, quicker (and therefore cheaper for the institution) to grade, and objective on their own terms. When cramming, one attempts to focus only on studies and to forgo unnecessary actions or habits.

== Prevalence ==
Cramming is often done the night before a test, or in the days before a final exam.

In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, cramming usually occurs during the [[revision week]] (week before exams), also known as "[[swotvac]]" or "stuvac".

== Cramming as a study technique ==
H.E. Gorst stated in his book, 'The Curse of Education', "as long as education is synonymous with cramming on an organized plan, it will continue to produce mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;Gorst, H.E. ''The Curse of Education''. London: Grant Richards, 1901. (Page 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally considered an undesirable study technique, cramming is becoming more and more common among students both at the secondary and post-secondary level. Pressure to perform well in the classroom and engage in extracurricular activities in addition to other responsibilities often results in the cramming method of studying. Cramming is a widely used study skill performed in preparation for an examination or other performance-based assessment.

Most common among high school and college-aged students, cramming is often used as a means of memorizing large amounts of information in a short amount of time. Students are often forced to cram after improper time utilization or in efforts to understand information shortly before being tested. Improper time management is usually the cause for last-minute cramming sessions, and many study techniques have been developed to help students succeed instead of cramming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/plan/college-success/961.html How to Take on College Studying: Your Cramming Days are Over].

== Cramming and school performance ==
Teaching students to avoid last-minute cramming is a large area of concern for education professionals and profit for educational corporations and businesses. Learning and teaching study techniques that enhance retention as opposed to learning for a single examination is one of the core issues that plagues colleges and university academic advisors, and also adds to the stress of academic success for students. Ideally, proper study skills need to be introduced and practiced as early as possible in order for students to effectively learn positive study mechanisms.

According to [[William G. Sommer]], students in a university system often adapt to the time-constraints that are placed upon them in college, and often use cramming to perform well on tests. In his article, ''Procrastination and Cramming: How Adept Students Ace the System'', he states "Many students outwardly adapt to this system, however, engage in an intense and private ritual that comprises five aspects: calculated procrastination, preparatory anxiety, climactic cramming, nick-of-time deadline-making, and a secret, if often uncelebrated, victory. These adept students often find it difficult to admit others into their efficient program of academic survival."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sommer |first=W. G. |title=Procrastination and Cramming: How Adept Students Ace the System |journal=[[Journal of American College Health]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=5–10 |doi=10.1080/07448481.1990.9936207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Conclusion ==
[[Active learning]] and [[critical thinking]] are two methods which emphasize the retention of material through the use of class discussions, study groups and individual thinking. Each has been cited as a more effective means of learning and retaining information as compared to cramming and [[memorization]].

'''Critical reading''' is a form of [[language]] analysis that does not take the given text at face value, but involves a deeper examination of the claims put forth as well as the supporting points and possible [[counterarguments]]. The ability to reinterpret and reconstruct for improved clarity and readability is also a component of critical reading. The identification of possible ambiguities and flaws in the author's reasoning, in addition to the ability to address them comprehensively, are essential to this process. Critical reading, much like [[academic writing]], requires the linkage of evidential points to corresponding arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/resources/writing/writing-resources/critical-reading |title=Critical Reading|publisher=University of Leicester |date= |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As acknowledged by a number of scholars and wordsmiths,
&lt;small&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...a story has as many versions as it has readers. Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure. Some pick out parts and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of prejudice, some paint it with their own delight."&lt;br&gt;— John Steinbeck, ''[[The Winter of Our Discontent]]'' (1961)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

There are no simple relations between these levels. As the "[[hermeneutic circle]]" demonstrates, the understanding of single words depends on the understanding of the text as a whole (as well as the culture in which the text is produced) and vice versa: You cannot understand a text if you do not understand the words in the text.

The critical reading of a given text thus implies a critical examination of the concepts used as well as of the soundness of the arguments and the value and relevance of the assumptions and the traditions on which the text is given.

"Reading between the lines" is the ability to uncover implicit messages and bias.

==Symptomatic reading==

Thurston (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;638) introduces the concept of "symptomatic reading": "Symptomatic reading is used in literary criticism as a means of analyzing the presence of ideology in literary texts. French Marxist philosophers [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Étienne Balibar]] develop the technique of symptomatic reading in ''Reading Capital''". Dorfman and Mattelart later used symptomatic reading as a means of analyzing the presence of imperialist ideology in Disney comics.

==The reciprocal nature of reading and writing==
When you read, you have to seek information, and you are confronted with different views, which forces you to consider your own position. In this process, the reader is converted to a "writer", whether or not he writes or publishes his own ideas.

Reading and writing are thus reciprocal processes, reading is an active process, and the best way to learn critical reading is probably by training academic writing.

Bazerman (1994) writes about the active role of the reader, and remarks (p.&amp;nbsp;23): "The cure for real boredom is to find a more advanced book on the subject; the only cure for pseudo-boredom is to become fully and personally involved in the book already in front of you".  Bazerman's book is informed by an advanced theoretical knowledge of scholarly research, documents and their composition. For example, chapter 6 is about "Recognizing the many voices in a text". The practical advises given are based on textual theory ([[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Julia Kristeva]]).  Chapter 8 is titled "Evaluating the book as a whole: The [[book review]]", and the first heading is "books as tools".

==Epistemological issues==
Basically critical reading is related to epistemological issues. [[Hermeneutics]] (e.g., the version developed by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]) has demonstrated that the way we read and interpret texts is dependent on our "pre-understanding" and "prejudices". Human knowledge is always an interpretative clarification of the world, not a pure, interest-free theory. Hermeneutics may thus be understood as a theory about critical reading. This field was until recently associated with the humanities, not with science. This situation changed when [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] published his book (1962) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', which can be seen as an hermeneutic interpretation of the sciences because it conceives the scientists as governed by assumptions which are historically embedded and linguistically mediated activities organized around paradigms that direct the conceptualization and investigation of their studies. Scientific revolutions imply that one paradigm replaces another and introduces a new set of theories, approaches and definitions. According to Mallery; Hurwitz &amp; Duffy (1992) the notion of a paradigm-centered scientific community is analogous to Gadamer's notion of a linguistically encoded social tradition. In this way hermeneutics challenge the positivist view that science can cumulate objective facts. Observations are always made on the background of theoretical assumptions: they are theory dependent.

By conclusion is critical reading not just something that any scholar is able to do. The way we read is partly determined by the intellectual traditions, which have formed our beliefs and thinking. Generally we read papers within our own culture or tradition less critically compared to our reading of papers from other traditions or "paradigms".

==A famous example==

The psychologist [[Cyril Burt]] is known for his studies on the effect of heredity on intelligence. Shortly after he died, his studies of inheritance and intelligence came into disrepute after evidence emerged indicating he had falsified research data. Tucker's paper (1994) is illuminative on both how "critical reading" was performed in the discovery of the falsified data as well as in many famous psychologists "non-critical reading" of Burt's papers. Tucker shows that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that IQ is hereditary and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. This paper thus demonstrates how critical reading (and the opposite) may be related to beliefs as well as to interests and power structures.

[[File:Puzzle2 Solution DARPA.png|500px|thumb|right|As an example, solution of puzzle 2 from the DARPA Shredder Challenge.]]

Under the rules of the competition, the $50,000 challenge award would be granted to the first team to submit the answers to questions relating to a hidden mystery. The mystery verified that the team was able to extract meaningful intelligence from the page that was thought destroyed.  The secret answers could be acquired by reconstructing five individual puzzles that were created by shredding one or more single-sided hand-written documents.&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt;

Approximately 600 worker-hours were dedicated by the team to reconstruct five documents shredded into more than 10,000 pieces.&lt;ref name = "Wired Dec 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "TechCrunch Dec 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "PopSci Dec 5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dillow|first=Clay|date = December 5, 2011|title=DARPA's Impossible-Sounding Shredder Challenge is Already Solved|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-12/darpas-impossible-sounding-shredder-challenge-already-solved|publisher=''[[Popular Science]]''|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Good, the team's name was based on an Internet [[meme]] "[[All your base are belong to us]]".&lt;ref name="AOL Gov, Dec 20, 2011"/&gt;

==Other teams==
Second placed team, "Schroddon", was composed just of husband and wife Marianne and Don Engel living in [[Baltimore]], Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ruediger |first=Nicole |title=Puzzle Pair |url=http://www.umbc.edu/magazine/winter12/atplay.html |publisher=UMBC |accessdate=Winter 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015080133/http://www.umbc.edu/magazine/winter12/atplay.html |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the winning team, Schroddon used a human-assisted algorithm that the couple created. Both physicists, Marianne used her background in cryptography and Don used his background in computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UMBC Team Places Second in the DARPA Shredder Challenge |url=http://www.csee.umbc.edu/2011/12/umbc-team-places-second-in-the-darpa-shredder-challenge/ |publisher=UMBC |accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was ranked first from November 14 until November 18, 2011.&lt;br /&gt;

[[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD) reconstructed three puzzles through an online crowdsourcing approach, but their work-in-progress was repeatedly sabotaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris|first=Mark|title=How a Lone Hacker Shredded the Myth of Crowdsourcing|url=http://medium.com/backchannel/how-a-lone-hacker-shredded-the-myth-of-crowdsourcing-d9d0534f1731 |accessdate=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rahwan|first=Iyad|title=How Crowdsourcing Turned On Me|url=http://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/how-crowdsourcing-turned-on-me

'''DataCite''' is an international [[not-for-profit]] organization which aims to improve [[data citation]] in order to:
*establish easier access to research data on the Internet
*increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scholarly record
*support data archiving that will permit results to be verified and re-purposed for future study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DataCite|title=What is DataCite?|url=http://www.datacite.org/whatisdatacite|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
In August 2009 a paper was published laying out an approach for a global registration agency for research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approach for a joint global registration agency for research data|doi=10.3233/ISU-2009-0595}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2011-05-23--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; DataCite was subsequently founded in London on 1 December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=Janna|last2=Brase|first2=Jan|title=DataCite and DOI names for research data|journal=Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design|date=20 July 2014|volume=28|issue=10|pages=1035–1041|doi=10.1007/s10822-014-9776-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; by organisations from 6 countries: the [[British Library]]; the Technical Information Center of Denmark (DTIC); the [[TU Delft]] Library from the Netherlands; the National Research Council’s [[Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information]] (NRC-CISTI); the [[California Digital Library]] (University of California Curation Center);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchives.cdlib.org/sw1st7gf68/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/23055 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140505164849/http://webarchives.cdlib.org/sw1st7gf68/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/23055 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-05-05 |title=University of California becomes founding member of Datacite |accessdate=2014-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Purdue University]] (USA);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.lib.purdue.edu/news/2010/02/16/purdue-libraries-a-founding-member-of-international-cooperative-to-advance-research/ | title=Purdue Libraries becomes founding member of Datacite | accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tib-hannover.de/en/the-tib/news/news/id/133/ | title=TIB becomes founding member of Datacite | accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founding of DataCite, leading research libraries and information centres converged for the first official members’ convention in Paris on 5 February 2010. The inclusion of five further members was approved in the office of the International Council for Science (ICSU): Australian National Data Service (ANDS);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ands.org.au/guides/doi.html | title=ANDS joins Datacite | accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsche Zentralbibliothek für Medizin (ZB MED); GESIS - Leibniz-Institut für Sozialwissenschaften; French Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (INIST);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inist.fr/spip.php?article66 |title=Inist join Datacite consortium |accessdate=2010-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309010702/http://www.inist.fr/spip.php?article66 |archivedate=2010-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich.

== Technical ==

The primary means of establishing easier access to research data is by DataCite members assigning persistent identifiers, such as [[digital object identifier]]s (DOIs), to data sets. Although currently leveraging the well-established DOI infrastructure, DataCite takes an open approach to identifiers, and considers other systems and services that help forward its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DataCite |title=What do we do? |url=http://www.datacite.org/whatdowedo |accessdate=17 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317195125/http://www.datacite.org/whatdowedo |archivedate=17 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

DataCite's recommended format for a data citation is: 
*Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Publisher. Identifier
OR
*Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Version. Publisher. ResourceType. Identifier

DataCite recommends that DOI names are displayed as linkable, permanent URLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DataCite|title=Why cite data?|url=http://www.datacite.org/whycitedata|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party tools allow the migration of content to and from other services such as ODIN, for [[ORCID]]&lt;ref name="ODIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://odin-project.eu/2013/05/13/new-orcid-integrated-data-citation-tool/|title=New ORCID-integrated data citation tool |last=Thorisson |first=Gudmundur |date=2013-05-13 |publisher=ODIN Project |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21759">'''Educational robotics''' is a broad term that refers to a collection of activities, instructional programs, physical platforms, educational resources and pedagogical philosophy. There are many schools which are using the robot teacher. 

== Definition ==
The primary of objective of educational robotics is to provide a set of experience to facilitate the student's development of knowledge, skills and attitudes for the design, analysis, application and operation of robots.  The term robot here is used quite broadly and may include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles of any scale.   The rigor of the approach can be scaled based on the background of the target audience and may be suitable for students across the entire educational spectrum—from elementary school or graduate programs.

An alternate, or secondary, objective is to use robotics as a tangible and exciting application to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design.

==Education and training==
[[File:ER4u.jpg|thumb|The [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]] – educational robot.]]
Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=139 | title = Career: Robotics Engineer | accessdate = 2012-01-27 | year = 2012 | work = Princeton Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students. First-year computer science courses at several universities now include programming of a robot in addition to traditional software engineering-based coursework.&lt;ref name=MKG12&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://romisatriawahono.net/lecture/rm/survey/software%20engineering/Software%20Construction/Major%20-%20teaching%20novices%20programming%20using%20robots%20-%202012.pdf |title=Systematic Literature Review: Teaching Novices Programming using Robots |first1=L |last1=Major |first2=T |last2=Kyriacou |first3=O.P. |last3=Brereton |format=pdf |journal=IET Software |publisher=IEEE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=502-513 |doi=10.1049/iet-sen.2011.0125 |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SG13&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/9656489/Enhancing_Practice_and_Achievement_in_Introductory_Programming_with_a_Robot_Olympics |title=Enhancing Practice and Achievement in Introductory Programming with a Robot Olympics |first1=Michael |last1=Scott |first2=Steve |last2=Counsell |first3=Stasha |last3=Lauria |first4=Stephen |last4=Swift |first5=Allan |last5=Tucker |first6=Martin |last6=Shepperd |first7=Gheorghita |last7=Ghinea |format=pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Education |publisher=IEEE |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=249–254 |doi=10.1109/TE.2014.2382567 |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives in schools===
[[File:Rero-robots.jpg|thumb|rero reconfigurable robots, designed as easy to assemble and easy to program]]
Since 2014, companies like Cytron Technologies has been making inroads into schools and learning centers with their rero reconfigurable robot.  Designed to be easy and safe to assemble and easy to program, robotics became very accessible to young children with no programming skills and even up to advance users at tertiary level.  Robotics education was heavily promoted via roadshows, science fairs, exhibitions, workshops, camps and co-sponsored classes, bringing robotics education to the masses.

===Post-secondary degree programs===
From approximately 1960 though 2005, robotics education at post-secondary institutions took place through elective courses, thesis experiences and design projects offered as part of degree programs in traditional academic disciplines, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering or computer science.

Since 2005, more universities have begun granting degrees in robotics as a discipline in its own right, often under the name "Robotic Engineering".  Based on a 2015 web-based survey of robotics educators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7970162/ |title=The State of Robotics Education: Proposed Goals for Positively Transforming Robotics Education at Postsecondary Institutions |first1=Joel M. |last1=Esposito |journal=IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine  |publisher=IEEE |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=157-164 |doi=10.1109/MRA.2016.2636375 |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the degree programs and their estimates annual graduates are listed alphabetically below.  Note that only official degree programs where the word "robotics" appears on the transcript or diploma are listed here; whereas degree programs in traditional disciplines with course concentrations or thesis topics related to robotics are deliberately omitted.

===Certification===
The [[Robotics Certification Standards Alliance|Robotics Certification Standards Alliance (RCSA)]] is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry- and educational-related robotics certifications.

===Summer robotics camp===
Several summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum. In addition, youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 Education at American Museum of Natural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102072036/http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]] in Silicon Valley, CA, just to name a few.

===Robotics afterschool programs===
Many schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum. Two main programs for afterschool robotics are [http://www.botball.org Botball] and [http://www.usfirst.org FIRST Robotics].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8721">'''Elisabeth Friederike Rotten''' (15 February 1882, Berlin - 2 May 1964) was a [[Quaker]] [[peace activist]] and [[Progressive education|educational progressive]].

== Life ==
As daughter to the Swiss couple Moritz and Luise Rotten, she attended the "höhere Mädchenschule  Luisenschule" during 1888-1898, later studying at the Victorialyzeum [[Berlin]] from 1904. In September 1906 she took the Reifeprüfung at the Kaiserin Augusta-Gymnasium [[Berlin-Charlottenburg|Charlottenburg]].  She graduated in her studies in philosophy and German language and literature in [[Heidelberg]], Berlin, [[Marburg]] and [[Montpellier]]. In Marburg she met with [[Hermann Lietz]] and [[Gustav Wyneken]], which was vital to the future development of her thinking.  In 1913 she published her PhD thesis under the title "Goethes Urphänomen und die platonische Idee" ([[Goethe]]'s "Urphänomen" and the Platonic ideal) in Marburg.  

In 1913 she began lecturing at the [[University of Cambridge]] on German literature.  In 1914 she returned to Berlin and worked in the "Auskunfts- und Hilfsstelle für Deutsche im Ausland und Ausländer in Deutschland" with professor [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]].  In the same year she co-founded the "[[Bund Neues Vaterland]]", later the "[[Deutsche Liga für Menschenrechte|German League for Human Rights]]".  In 1915 she travelled as a representative to the 1st International Women's Congress in [[The Hague]] and worked for the foundation of the  "Internationalen Frauenliga für Frieden und Freiheit" (International Women's League for Peace and Freedom").

In 1922, together with [[Beatrice Ensor]] and [[Adolphe Ferrière]] she founded the New Education Fellowship becoming its vice-chair for German-speaking countries and editor, of its German language journal which  eventually came to be called Das Werdende Zeitalter.&lt;ref&gt;Brehony, K. J. (2004). "A New Education for a New Era: Creating International Fellowship Through Conferences 1921-1938." Paedagogica Historica 40(5 &amp; 6): 733-755.&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1922 she was associated  with the school farm, Schulfarm Insel Scharfenberg, begun by Wilhelm Blume in Berlin and was a frequent visitor to the [[Odenwaldschule]] founded in 1910 by the educational reformer [[Paul Geheeb]].

In 1925, Rotten and Adolphe Ferrière became the first Deputy Directors of the [[International Bureau of Education]] (IBE), where they provided support to Director [[Pierre Bovet]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002473/247329e.pdf|title=IBE In Focus: 90 years of excellence in education|last=IBE|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was also a friend of the anarchist, [[Gustav Landauer]], who was Minister of Culture in the short-lived Munich Soviet (or “Council Republic”) of 1919 before being murdered after it was violently suppressed. 
From 1926 until 1932, Rotten shared the editorship of the journal ''Das Werdende Zeitalter'' with Karl Wilker, an exponent of social pedagogy who transformed the Lindenhof in Berlin. The title of this journal was inspired by that given to a collection of essays by Landauer, which his friend, the philosopher [[Martin Buber]], published in 1921. 
In 1930, Rotten co-founded a school at [[Hellerau]] just outside Dresden, where a garden city was established shortly after 1900 as part of a reform movement advocating modern housing.&lt;ref&gt;Brehony, K. J. (2004). "A New Education for a New Era: Creating International Fellowship Through Conferences 1921-1938." Paedagogica Historica 40(5 &amp; 6): 733-755.&lt;/ref&gt;

1919 hielt sie die vielbeachtete Rede auf der Internationalen Erziehungskonferenz in [[Genf]] über „Die Versuche einer neuen Erziehung in Deutschland“. Sie war Mitbegründerin des „[[Bund entschiedener Schulreformer]]“. Bis 1921 war sie als Leiterin der Pädagogischen Abteilung der „Deutschen Liga für Völkerbund“ tätig und gab 1920 bis 1921 die „Internationale Erziehungsrundschau“ heraus (als Beilage der Zeitschrift „Die neue Erziehung“). 1921 wurde sie Mitbegründerin des [[Weltbund für Erneuerung in der Erziehung|Weltbundes für Erneuerung in der Erziehung]] ([[New Education Fellowship]]) und Direktorin für die deutschsprachigen Länder und gab - in der Nachfolge der "Internationalen Erziehungsrundschau" als deutschsprachiges Organ des Weltbundes die zeitschrift "[[Das Werdende Zeitalter]] heraus (ab 1926 zusammen mit [[Karl Wilker]]). 1922 arbeitete sie in der [[Schulfarm Insel Scharfenberg]] (s. [[Scharfenberg (Insel)]]) in Berlin. 1923 beteiligte sie sich an der Gründung der kunstgewerblichen Siedlung auf dem [[Gut Kohlgraben]] bei [[Vacha]] in der [[Rhön]]. Bis 1923 arbeitete sie mit den englischen Quäkern in der Kinderhilfe ([[Quäkerspeisung]]) zusammen, 1930 wurde sie Mitglied der Religiösen Gesellschaft der Freunde ([[Quäker]]).

The '''Georgia Career Information System''' (GCIS) provides current, accurate occupational and [[education]]al information to [[school]]s and agencies throughout Georgia in order to help young people and adults make informed [[Career counseling|career choices]]. It is the main service of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Career Information Center (GCIC).

Working with educational and [[labor market]] professionals, GCIS contains assessments, explorations, and search strategies as well as the most comprehensive and accurate state and national occupational and educational information. In addition to [[career management]] tools for individuals, tools are available to assist [[Business administration|administrators]]. Each year, about 625,000 Georgians access GCIS from around 1,250 sites.

A further initiative, the ''Georgia Career Information System Junior'' (GCIS Junior) provides [[career development]] information for [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[middle school]] students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8058">'''Hugo Albert Emil Hermann Dingler''' (July 7, 1881, [[Munich]] – June 29, 1954, Munich) was a [[Germany|German]] [[scientist]] and [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Hugo Dingler studied [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[physics]] with [[Felix Klein]], [[Hermann Minkowski]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Woldemar Voigt]], and [[Wilhem Roentgen]] at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Munich|Munich]]. He graduated from the [[University of Munich]] with a thesis under [[Aurel Voss]]. Dingler earned his Ph.D. in mathematics, physics and astronomy in 1906. His doctoral advisor was [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. In 1910 Dingler's first attempt to earn a [[Habilitation]] failed. His second try in 1912 was successful. Dingler then taught as a [[Privatdozent]] and hold lectures on mathematics, philosophy and the history of science. He became a professor at the University of Munich in 1920. Dingler got a position as Professor ordinarius in Darmstadt in 1932.

In 1934, one year after the Nazis took power Dingler was dismissed from his teaching position for still unclear reasons. Dingler himself told several interviewers that this was because of his favorable writings concerning [[Jew]]s. In fact both philo-semitic as well as anti-semitic statements by Dingler had been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Eckart Menzler-Trott, ''Gentzens Problem. Mathematische Logik im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland.'' Basel 2001, {{ISBN|3-7643-6574-9}}; ''Opportunismus als Naturanlage: Hugo Dingler und das „Dritte Reich“.'' In: Peter Janich (Hrsg.): ''Entwicklungen der methodischen Philosophie.'' Frankfurt a. M. 1992, S. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1934 to 1936 he again held a teaching position.

In 1940 Dingler joined the [[Nazi]] Party and was again given a teaching position. Of Dingler's 1944 book ''Aufbau der exakten Fundamentalwissenschaft'' only thirty copies survived wartime bombing.

==Thought==
Dingler's position is usually characterized as "[[Conventionalism|conventionalist]]" by [[Karl Popper]] and others. Sometimes he is called a "radical conventionalist" (also referred to as "[[critical voluntarism]]" in the secondary literature),&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Janich]], ''Protophysics of Time: Constructive Foundation and History of Time Measurement'', Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; as by the early [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Dingler himself initially characterized it as "critical conventionalism", to contrast it with the "naïve conventionalism" of other philosophers such as [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], but he himself later ceased to call his position conventionalist. Dingler agrees with the conventionalists that the fundamental assumptions of [[geometry]] and physics are not extracted empirically and cannot be given a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]. However, Dingler disagrees with conventionalists such as Henri Poincaré in that he does not believe there is freedom to choose alternative assumptions. Dingler believes that one can give a foundation to mathematics and physics by means of operations as building stones. Dingler claims that this [[Operation (mathematics)|operational]] analysis leads one to [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[Newtonian mechanics]], which are the only possible results.

Dingler opposed [[Einstein]]'s [[relativity theory]] and was therefore opposed and snubbed by most of the leaders of the [[Germany|German]] physics and mathematics community. This opposition, at least to the theory of [[general relativity]], remains in the work of his follower [[Paul Lorenzen]].

==Influence==
Paul Lorenzen, noted for his work on constructive foundations of mathematics was a follower of Dingler, at least with respect to the foundations of geometry and physics. The so-called Erlangen School of followers and allies of Lorenzen, including [[Kuno Lorenz]], [[Wilhelm Kamlah]], and [[Peter Janich]], and more indirectly, [[Jürgen Mittelstraß]], is thus in large part pursuing a modernized version of Dingler's program which claims to incorporate [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[quantum logic]].

'''Kfar Galim''' ({{lang-he-n|כְּפַר גַּלִּים}}, ''lit.'' Waves Village) is a [[boarding school]] and [[youth village]] in northern [[Israel]]. Located near [[Tirat Carmel]], it falls under the jurisdiction of [[Hof HaCarmel Regional Council]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Kefar Gallim}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

The school was established in 1952 as a partnership between the [[Haifa]] municipal council and the [[Ministry of Immigrant Absorption (Israel)|Ministry of Immigrant Absorption]].&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

Kfar Galim runs a middle school, a high school, an engineering [[college#Israel|college]] and a farm. It also has dormitory facilities.

==High school==
Kfar Galim accepts students in 7th to 12th grade. It offers majors in biology and environmental sciences, communication and society (radio and television) and physical education. It also runs an electronic and computer engineering technology program in collaboration with the [[Israel Air Force]] (13th and 14th grades). Graduates of this program are awarded a Practical Engineering degree and can do their military service in the air force.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

==Boarding school==
The boarding school has an enrollment of 170 students from all over the country. Many are [[olim|new immigrants]] or children of Russian and Ethiopian immigrants. Admission is also open to Israeli teenagers.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

==Archaeology==
Archaeological excavations in the region of Kfar Galim found evidence of an ancient olive oil industry. Thousands of olive pits and waste from processing the olives were discovered there, attesting to the existence of one of the earliest known [[Neolithic]] agro-pastoral-fishing subsistence systems on the Levantine coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblicalpaths.wordpress.com/2009/05/24/atlit-yam-a-submerged-pre-pottery-neolithic-villiage/ Neolithic village findings]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorna Marshall''' (September 14, 1898 – July 8, 2002), born Lorna Jean McLean, was an anthropologist who in the 1950s, 60s and 70s lived among and wrote about the previously unstudied [[!Kung people]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;Douglas Martin, "Lorna Marshall, 103, Early Scholar on Africa's Bushmen", [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/30/us/lorna-marshall-103-early-scholar-on-africa-s-bushmen.html obituary] in the [[New York Times]], July 30, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r2&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~pea00036 Expeditionary notebooks and journals of Lorna and Laurence Marshall, 1928, 1951–1968 : A Finding Aid]. Peabody Museum Archives. Harvard University. October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Marshall was born in Morenci, Arizona territory. She married Laurence Kennedy Marshall in 1926; they had a daughter [[Elizabeth Marshall Thomas]] (born 1931) and a son [[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Kennedy Marshall]] (1932–2005). Marshall received a BA in English Literature from UC Berkeley in 1921 and an MA from Radcliffe College in 1928, and before 1926 worked as an English instructor at [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]]. Later she took [[anthropology]] courses at [[Harvard University]] and had a second career as an ethnographer. Her husband was born in Medford, Massachusetts in 1889, studied at Tufts University, and co-founded the [[Raytheon Company]] in 1922 where he worked until 1950.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

In 1951, the Marshall family went to [[South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) to conduct an ethnographic study of the !Kung of Nyae Nyae (also known as the Ju/'hoansi or Ju/'hoan Bushmen). The family became deeply engaged in this work and returned to Africa on several expeditions throughout the 1950s and 1960s, each lasting from a few months to a year and a half.&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt; As Elizabeth Marshall Thomas explains in her book, ''The Old Way'', Laurence Marshall attempted to recruit an anthropologist to join their expeditions, but no one was interested. It then fell to Lorna Marshall to conduct ethnographic interviews and compile fieldnotes, despite the fact that she had no formal anthropological training.&lt;ref name="Old Way"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Elizabeth Marshall|title=The old way : a story of the first people|year=2006|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=9780374225520|pages=49|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, Marshall published numerous articles on [[ǃKung people|!Kung]] culture and [[San religion|religion]]. Her first book, ''The !Kung of Nyae Nyae'', was published in 1976 to positive reviews including one by Alan Barnard, who called Marshall "one of the most sensitive, meticulous and unpretentious ethnographers of all time."&lt;ref name=Barnard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Alan|title=The !Kung of Nyae (Book Review)|journal=Africa (Edinburgh University Press)|date=December 1978|volume=48|issue=4|pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall enjoyed a long career, publishing her second book, ''Nyae Nyae !Kung Beliefs and Rites'', in 1999 when she was 101. In addition to written ethnography, Lorna Marshall also collaborated on several ethnographic films about the !Kung of Nyae Nyae with her son, [[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Kennedy Marshall]] (1932–2005), a documentary and ethnographic filmmaker.&lt;ref name=JohnMarshallGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the John Marshall Ju/’hoan Bushman Film and Video Collection, 1950-2000|url=http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/fa/marshall.pdf|publisher=Human Studies Film Archives, Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died at her daughter Elizabeth's home in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], where she had lived since 1996, in 2002 at the age of 103; she had previously lived in the same house in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], since the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

'''Louis F. Knoll''' (died 2004) was an American Baptist missionary&lt;ref&gt;Peter Penner ''Russians, North Americans and Telegus: the Mennonite Brethren'' p390 1997 "Louis F. Knoll of the American Baptist Society, then located in Madras, was given power of attorney."&lt;/ref&gt; who taught Christian Ethics at the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], affiliated with the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]].

Robert Eric Frykenberg, Professor Emeritus of History &amp; South Asian Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] writes that Louis F. Knoll believed that the [[British Rule]] in India was a major obstacle to the spread of Christianity in India.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eric Frykenberg, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sOrglHSX6rsC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq= Oxford History of the Christian Church]'', Oxford University Press, 2008.  p.287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
===India===
Knoll was the co-founder&lt;ref name="Schramm" /&gt; of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].  [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] ran their seminary in [[Ramayapatnam]].  At first in 1967, the [[B. D.]] section of the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological College, of which he was the Principal, was made to be situated in the same campus of [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] before it was fully integrated into the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] in 1972 through an ''Act of Integration'' performed by Louis F. Knoll and then acting Principal [[William P. Peery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations'', Volume 11, American Baptist Historical Society, 1968.  p. 321.  [https://books.google.com/books?cd=8&amp;id=ZWnkAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=]&lt;/ref&gt;  Talathoti Punnaiah who underwent a 1-year spirituality course as an [[Aspirant]] at the [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary affirms the fact that it was Knoll as President of the [[Ramayapatnam]] Seminary who integrated the graduate section of the [[Ramayapatnam]] Seminary into the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]].&lt;ref&gt;Talathoti Punnaiah, ''My Memoir, Ministry and Message: (60 years Life Experiences 1950-2010)'', Self-published by the Author, Kakinada, 2010, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Conference of the Mennonite Brethren Churches in India|Mennonite Brethren Mission]] also sought Knoll to consolidate its organizational structure&lt;ref&gt;Peter Penner, ''Russians, North Americans and Telegus: the Mennonite Brethren mission in India, 1885–1975'', Issue 10 of Perspectives on Mennonite life and thought,
Volume 10 of Russians North Americans &amp; Telagus, Kindred Productions, 1997.  p. 276.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZMo4V4Ll8wC&amp;dq=]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978, when the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] movie ''[[Karunamayudu]]'' was released, the movie acknowledged the contribution of Knoll as a financial adviser displayed during the opening titles.
===Overseas===
After Knoll left India, he served as Vice President of [[American Baptist Seminary of the West]] from 1978 to 1985.&lt;ref name="Schramm" /&gt;

'''Mary Cardwell Dawson''' (February 14, 1894 &amp;ndash; March 19, 1962) was an [[African-American]] musician  and teacher and the founding director of the [[National Negro Opera Company]].

==Biography==
In 1927, Dawson opened the Cardwell Dawson School of Music in the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which remained open until 1941. &lt;ref&gt;www.post-gazette.com/magazine/19990801opera1.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 

After presenting the opera ''[[Aida]]'' at the NANM convention of 1941, Dawson launched her National Negro Opera Company later that same year with a performance at Pittsburgh's [[Syria Mosque]]. The star was [[La Julia Rhea]], and other members included [[Minto Cato]], [[Carol Brice]], [[Robert McFerrin]], and [[Lillian Evanti]]. NNOC mounted productions in [[Washington D.C.]], [[New York City]], Chicago, and Pittsburgh. Pianist [[Ahmad Jamal]] began formal training at the age of seven with Ms. Dawson, whom he says greatly influenced him.

== Early life ==
Csikszentmihalyi was born on 29 September 1934 in [[Rijeka|Fiume]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lionsroar.com/the-man-who-found-the-flow/|title=The Man Who Found the Flow|last=Cooper|first=Andrew|date=1998-09-01|work=Lion's Roar|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; then part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. His family name derives from the [[Csíkszentmihályi village]] in Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4_BAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;pg=PA129&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third son of a career diplomat at the Hungarian Consulate in Fiume.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Kristine Marin|date=2014|title=Kristine Marin Kawamura, PhD interviews Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, PhD|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/CCM-08-2014-0094|journal=Cross Cultural Management|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|volume=21|issue=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two older half-brothers died when Csikszentmihalyi was still young; one was an engineering student who was killed in the [[Siege of Budapest]], and the other was sent to labor camps in Siberia by the Soviets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

His father was appointed Hungarian Ambassador to Italy shortly after the [[World War II|Second World War]], moving the family to Rome.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tsl.news/articles/2015/2/6/news/5935-q-and-a-cgu-professor-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-receives-hungarian-national-award|title=Q&amp;A: CGU Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi Receives Hungarian National Award|last=Pontifex|first=Trevor|date=2015-02-06|website=The Student Life|publisher=[[Claremont Colleges]]|publication-place=[[Claremont, California]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Hungarian People's Republic|Communists took over Hungary]] in 1949, Csikszentmihalyi's father resigned rather than work for the regime; the Communist regime responded by expelling his father and stripping the family of their Hungarian citizenship. To earn a living, his father opened a restaurant in Rome, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi dropped out of school to help with the family income.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At this time, the young Csikszentmihalyi, then travelling in Switzerland, saw [[Carl Jung]] give a talk on the psychology of UFO sightings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Csikszentmihalyi emigrated to the United States from Hungary at the age of 22, working nights to support himself while studying at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He received his B.A. in 1959 and his PhD in 1965, both from the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4751.asp|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|website=|series=|publisher=Claremont Graduate University, Division of Behavorial and Organizational Sciences|location=Claremont, Calif.|accessdate=3 March 2014|quote="B.A., University of Chicago, 1960"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then taught at [[Lake Forest College]], before becoming a professor at the University of Chicago in 1969.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Work==
Csikszentmihalyi is noted for his work in the study of [[happiness]] and [[creativity]], but is best known as the architect of the notion of ''[[flow (psychology)|flow]]'' and for his years of research and writing on the topic. He is the author of many books and over 120 articles{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} or book chapters. [[Martin Seligman]], former president of the [[American Psychological Association]], described Csikszentmihalyi as the world's leading researcher on [[positive psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainchannels.com/thinker/mihaly.html Thinker of the Year Award]&lt;/ref&gt; Csikszentmihalyi once said: "Repression is not the way to virtue. When people restrain themselves out of fear, their lives are by necessity diminished. Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed and still kept within the bounds of reason."&lt;ref name="focusdep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusdep.com/quotes/topics/virtue/start/0/ |title=Virtue Quotes &amp; Quotations |publisher=focusdep.com |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111201415/http://focusdep.com/quotes/topics/virtue/start/0/ |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His works are influential and are widely cited.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel King &amp; Neil Anderson (2002). ''Managing Innovation and Change''. Cengage Learning EMEA. p. 82. ({{ISBN|1861527837}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow ===
{{main|Flow (psychology)}}
{{Mental state}}

In his seminal work, ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience'', Csíkszentmihályi outlines his theory that people are happiest when they are in a state of ''flow''—a state of [[concentration]] or complete absorption with the activity at hand and the situation. It is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.&lt;ref name="flowthepsychologyofoptimalexperience"&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0-06-092043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} The idea of flow is identical to the feeling of being ''in the zone'' or ''in the groove''. The flow state is an optimal state of ''[[intrinsic motivation]]'', where the person is fully immersed in what they are doing. This is a feeling everyone has at times, characterized by a feeling of great absorption, engagement, fulfillment, and skill—and during which temporal concerns (time, food, ego-self, etc.) are typically ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Csikszentmihalyi|first1=Mihaly|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|date=1990|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, Csíkszentmihályi described flow as "being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing [[jazz]]. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.09/czik_pr.html Geirland, John (1996). "Go With The Flow". ''Wired'' magazine, September, Issue 4.09.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Csikszentmihályi characterized nine component states of achieving flow including "challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clarity of goals, immediate and unambiguous feedback, concentration on the task at hand, paradox of control, transformation of time, loss of self-consciousness, and [[wikt:autotelic|autotelic]] experience".&lt;ref name="flowatwork"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fullagar | first1 = Clive J. | last2 = Kelloway | first2 = E. Kevin | year = 2009 | title = Flow at work: an experience sampling approach | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 595–615 | doi=10.1348/096317908x357903}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve a flow state, a balance must be struck between the challenge of the task and the skill of the performer. If the task is too easy or too difficult, flow cannot occur. Both skill level and challenge level must be matched and high; if skill and challenge are low and matched, then apathy results.&lt;ref name="Finding Flow" /&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!-- ref name defined in [[Template:Mental state]] --&gt;

One state that Csikszentmihalyi researched was that of the [[autotelic]] personality.&lt;ref name="flowatwork"/&gt; The autotelic personality is one in which a person performs acts because they are intrinsically rewarding, rather than to achieve external goals.&lt;ref&gt;Car, A. ''Positive psychology. The Science of happiness and human strengths''. Hove, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Csikszentmihalyi describes the autotelic personality as a trait possessed by individuals who can learn to enjoy situations that most other people would find miserable.&lt;ref name="flowthepsychologyofoptimalexperience"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} Research has shown that aspects associated with the autotelic personality include curiosity, persistence, and humility.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. &amp; Nakamura, J. (2011). Positive psychology: Where did it come from, where is it going? In K. M. Sheldon, T. B. Kashdan, &amp; M. F. Steger (Eds.), ''Designing positive psychology'' (pp. 2–9). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
A majority of Csikszentmihalyi's most recent work surrounds the idea of [[motivation]] and the factors that contribute to motivation, challenge, and overall success in an individual. One personality characteristic that Csikszentmihalyi researched in detail was that of [[intrinsic motivation]]. Csikszentmihalyi and his colleagues found that intrinsically motivated people were more likely to be goal-directed and enjoy challenges that would lead to an increase in overall [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abuhamdeh|first=Sami|author2=Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly|title=The importance of challenge for the enjoyment of intrinsically motivated, goal-directed activities.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2012|volume=38|pmid=22067510|doi=10.1177/0146167211427147|pages=317–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Csikszentmihalyi identified intrinsic motivation as a powerful trait to possess to optimize and enhance positive experience, feelings, and overall [[well-being]] as a result of challenging experiences. The results indicated a new [[personality]] construct, a term Csikszentmihalyi called ''work orientation'', which is characterized by "achievement, endurance, cognitive structure, order, play, and low impulsivity". A high level of work orientation in students is said to be a better predictor of grades and fulfillment of long-term goals than any school or household environmental influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Maria|author2=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|title=Motivation and academic achievement: The effects of personality traits and the quality of experience|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1991|volume=59|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1991.tb00259.x|pages=539–574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malay name and its function ==
In [[Bahasa Malaysia]], it was called ''Kementerian Pendidikan'', and was in charge of all the education-related affairs. In 2004, its name was changed to ''Kementerian Pelajaran'' and then became in charge of the education from pre-school up to the secondary level. The tertiary education was taken over by a new ministry, [[Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Higher Education]] until May 2013 where Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] announced the two ministries will be merged to form a single Ministry of Education. In 2015, the ministry was split again.

== Political significance ==
Historically, the position of Minister of Education is considered a stepping stone for future [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian prime ministers]]. All Malaysian prime ministers to date have held this position in their career except the first prime minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]].

The '''National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program''' (NSF-GRFP) is an annual grant awarded by the [[National Science Foundation]] to approximately 2,000 students pursuing research-based Master's and doctoral degrees in the natural, social, and engineering sciences at US institutions.  The fellowship provides an honorarium of $12,000 to be placed towards the cost of tuition and fees at the university the fellow attends; it also awards the student directly with an annual $34,000 stipend for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsfgrfp.org/ |title=NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program |accessdate=2013-04-08 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each recipient could previously apply for a one time only travel award for $1,000.  This travel award was previously for international research activities or presenting at an international scientific conference.  However, in 2010, this opportunity was converted to the Nordic Research Opportunity, which is intended to facilitate collaborations between U.S. graduate fellows and scholars at Finnish, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian research institutions.

==Award history==
The Graduate Research Fellowship was first awarded in 1952, with the goal of encouraging basic scientific research and ensuring comprehensive, competitive research programs for U.S. students.  Since 1952, the NSF has funded over 46,500 Graduate Research Fellowships out of over 500,000 applicants.  Many former graduate fellows have gone on to become [[Nobel laureates]] and members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Science Foundation|title=GRF History|url=http://www.nsfgrfp.org/about_the_program/history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application requirements==
The competition is open to senior undergraduate students as well as new graduate students in their first or second years of graduate study.

In order to apply, the applicant must submit biographical information, undergraduate and graduate transcripts where applicable, at least three letters of recommendation, and two essays: a personal statement with past research experience and a research proposal.

Applications are typically due in early November, with different deadlines for different scientific fields. Letters of recommendation are typically due in mid November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsfgrfp.org/how_to_apply|title=Home - NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program (GRFP)|website=www.nsfgrfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellows and students selected for Honorable Mention are usually notified in April of the year following their application.  Together, the Fellows and Honorable Mention students make up about the top 30% of applicants.

==Additional information==
The grant is administered through the institution the student is attending. The grant's funding can be postponed for up to two 12-month increments as long as the recipient continues to engage in work leading to the eligible graduate degree. For instance, a recipient might postpone the grant's funding while working as a teaching assistant or research assistant. This is referred to as "reserve". On the third year of reserve, the recipient will automatically forfeit any remaining years of tenure.

The '''National Centre for Universities and Business''' (NCUB) develops, promotes and supports collaboration between universities and business across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Docherty|title=A National Centre for Universities and Business|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/david-docherty/national-centre-universities-business_b_3036107.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elizabeth|first=Gibney|title=Hub aims to make business links pay off|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/420386.article|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCUB is headed by [[David Docherty]] (Chief Executive) and Richard Greenhalgh (Chair). NCUB’s Leadership Council includes many of the UK’s most successful businesses and universities.

==History==
Prior to NCUB, the [[Council for Industry and Higher Education]] (CIHE), was born in 1986 from the collaboration of [[James Prior, Baron Prior|James Prior]], John Cassels and [[Pauline Perry, Baroness Perry of Southwark|Pauline Perry]]. Pauline (at that time the Chief Inspector of Schools at the Department for Education) had heard about an American organisation that had managed to bring businesses and universities closer together. John (as Director General of the [[National Economic Development Office]]) was a believer in the power of partnership while Jim Prior was a recent Cabinet member and the new chairman of GEC. He agreed to invite the heads of a range of businesses, universities and polytechnics to a couple of initial discussions to see if there was indeed a common cause that might be addressed through a partnership approach.

In 2013, in response to the Wilson Review CIHE was replaced by the National Centre for Universities and Business (NCUB).

==Birth and class==

Pavel Feoktistovich Chernyshev was born around 1854 in [[Samara Oblast|Samara]], in the [[Empire of Russia]], to noble parents.&lt;ref name="gse"&gt;Pavel Feoktistovich Chernyshev entry, [[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 1979. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Pavel+Chernyshev]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and death==

By 1874, Chernyshev was a medical student at the Medical and Surgical Academy in [[St. Petersburg]]. While a student, he helped organize and served as treasurer for the Samartsy, a [[populist]] St. Petersburg student society.&lt;ref name="gse"/&gt; He took part in the "Going to the People" movement, and it is for this participation that he was arrested by authorities on August 30, 1874 and incarcerated shortly thereafter. He was released on bail on March 11, 1876; having contracted [[tuberculosis]] while in prison, he died in a hospital soon after his release.&lt;ref name="gse"/&gt;

Chernyshev's primary claims to fame are his imprisonment, death, and funeral, all of which occurred over about 18 months from his arrest to his funeral on March 30, 1876. The funeral at [[Volkovo Cemetery]] became the seed of a large populist anti-government demonstration,&lt;ref&gt;"Rites of Protest: Populist Funerals in Imperial St. Petersburg, 1876-1878" [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2697643?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt; and the composer [[Grigori A. Machtet]] wrote the poem "The Last Farewell" (literally "Succumbed to the ordeal of imprisonment") in his memory. The poem lives on as the lyrics to the song "Slavery and Suffering," (''Esclavage et souffrance'')&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;"Esclavage et souffrance." Performed by Alexandrov Ensemble, (former) Red Army Choir. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eA1IkCGEtM&lt;/ref&gt; which has been performed by the [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army Choir]] and was a popular revolutionary song.

'''Racket''' (formerly '''PLT Scheme''') is a [[General-purpose programming language|general-purpose]], [[multi-paradigm programming language]] in the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-[[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Racket |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/intro.html |access-date=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dialects of Racket and Scheme |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/dialects.html |access-date=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is used in a variety of contexts such as [[script (computing)|scripting]], general-purpose programming, [[computer science]] education, and research.

The platform provides an implementation of the Racket language (including a sophisticated [[run-time system]],&lt;ref name="mred"/&gt; various libraries, [[just-in-time compilation|JIT compiler]], and more) along with an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) named DrRacket (formerly named DrScheme) written in Racket.&lt;ref name="drscheme"/&gt; The IDE, and an accompanying programming curriculum, is used in the [[ProgramByDesign]] outreach program, an attempt to turn computing and programming into "an indispensable part of the liberal arts curriculum".&lt;ref name="teachscheme"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Felleisen |last2=Findler |last3=Flatt |last4=Krishnamurthi |year=2004 |url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/#cse2003-fffk |title=The TeachScheme!

==History==

===Development===
[[Matthias Felleisen]] founded PLT in the mid 1990s, first as a research group, soon after as a project dedicated to producing [[pedagogic]] materials for novice programmers (lectures, exercises/projects, software).  In January 1995, the group decided to develop a pedagogic programming environment based on [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].  [[Matthew Flatt]] cobbled together MrEd, the original [[virtual machine]] for Racket, from libscheme,&lt;ref name="libscheme"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/vhll/benson.html |title=libscheme: Scheme as a C Library |last=Benson |first=Brent W. Jr. |date=October 26–28, 1994 |publisher=USENIX Association |publication-place=Berkeley, CA |booktitle=Proceedings of the USENIX Symposium on Very High Level Languages |pages=7–19 |location=Santa Fe, NM |isbn=978-1880446652 |access-date=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wxWidgets]], and a few other free systems.&lt;ref name="gui-rebuild"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rebuilding Racket's Graphics Layer |access-date=2017-12-11|date=2010-12-08 |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2010/12/rebuilding-rackets-graphics-layer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, a team including Flatt, [[Robert Bruce Findler|Robby Findler]], [[Shriram Krishnamurthi]], Cormac Flanagan, and many others produced '''DrScheme''', a programming environment for novice Scheme programmers and a research environment for [[type system#Combining static and dynamic type checking|soft typing]].&lt;ref name="drscheme"&gt;{{cite journal |title=DrScheme: A Programming Environment for Scheme|journal=Journal of Functional Programming |last1=Findler |last2=Clements |last3=Flanagan |last4=Flatt |last5=Krishnamurthi |last6=Steckler |last7=Felleisen |url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/jfp01-fcffksf.pdf |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main development language that DrScheme supported was named PLT Scheme.

In parallel, the team began conducting workshops for high school teachers, training them in program design and functional programming.  Field tests with these teachers and their students provided essential clues for directing the development.

Over the following years, PLT added teaching languages, an algebraic stepper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Clements |first1=J. |last2=Flatt |first2=M. |last3=Felleisen |first3=M. |title=Modeling an Algebraic Stepper |booktitle=European Symposium on Programming Languages |year=2001 |url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/esop2001-cff.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a transparent [[read–eval–print loop]], a constructor-based printer, and many other innovations to DrScheme, producing an application-quality pedagogic program development environment.  By 2001, the core team (Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, Krishnamurthi) had also written and published their first textbook, ''[[How to Design Programs]]'', based on their teaching philosophy.

The first generation of PLT Scheme revisions introduced features for [[programming in the large and programming in the small#Programming in the large|programming in the large]] with both [[modular programming|modules]] and [[class (computer programming)|classes]]. Version 42 introduced units – a first-class module system – to complement classes for large scale development.&lt;ref name="release-notes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Racket Core Release Notes |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/release-notes/racket/HISTORY.txt |access-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GpxFjzKz?url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/release-notes/racket/HISTORY.txt |archive-date=2013-05-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class system gained features (e.g. [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-style [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]]) and also lost several features (e.g. [[multiple inheritance]]) throughout these versions.&lt;ref name="scheme-with-classes" /&gt;  The language evolved throughout a number of successive versions, and gaining milestone popularity in Version 53, leading to extensive work and the following Version 100, which would be equivalent to a "1.0" release in current popular version systems.

The next major revision was named Version 200, which introduced a new default module system that cooperates with macros.&lt;ref name="release-notes" /&gt; In particular, the module system ensures that run-time and [[compile-time]] computation are separated to support a "tower of languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Composable and Compilable Macros |last=Flatt |first=M. |booktitle=International Conference on Functional Programming |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike units, these modules are not [[first-class object]]s.

Version 300 introduced [[Unicode]] support, [[foreign function interface|foreign library]] support, and refinements to the class system.&lt;ref name="release-notes" /&gt;  Later on, the 300 series improved the [[computer performance|performance]] of the language runtime with an addition of a JIT compiler and a switch to a default [[generational garbage collection]].

By the next major release, the project had switched to a more conventional [[software versioning#Sequence-based identifiers|sequence-based]] version numbering.  Version 4.0 introduced the &lt;code&gt;#lang&lt;/code&gt; shorthand to specify the language that a module is written in.  Further, the revision introduced [[immutable object|immutable]] pairs and lists, support for fine-grained [[parallel computing|parallelism]], and a [[Static typing|statically-typed]] dialect.&lt;ref name="4.0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2008/06/plt-scheme-version-4.html |title=PLT Scheme version 4.0 |date=2008-06-12 |access-date=2012-08-07 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GpxGJOg8?url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2008/06/plt-scheme-version-4.html |archive-date=2013-05-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upcoming version 7 of Racket is intended to have a new macro expander written in Racket and is being built on [[Chez Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.racket-lang.org/2018/01/racket-on-chez-status.html |title=Racket-on-Chez Status: January 2018|date=2018-01-05 |access-date=2018-04-13 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6yea9ArGR?url=https://blog.racket-lang.org/2018/01/racket-on-chez-status.html |archive-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rename===
On June 7, 2010, PLT Scheme was renamed Racket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://racket-lang.org/new-name.html |title=From PLT Scheme to Racket |publisher=Racket-lang.org |date= |access-date=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renaming coincided with the release of Version 5.0. Subsequently, the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) backend was rewritten in Racket from [[C++]] in Version 5.1 using native [[widget toolkit|UI toolkits]] on all platforms.&lt;ref name="gui-rebuild" /&gt; Version 5.2 included a background [[Static code analysis|syntax checking]] tool, a new plotting library, a database library, and a new extended REPL.&lt;ref name="5.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2011/11/racket-v52.html |title=Racket 5.2|publisher=PLT, Inc|date=2011-11-09 |access-date=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 5.3 included a new submodule feature for optionally loaded modules,&lt;ref name="submodules"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2012/06/submodules.html |title=Submodules|date=2012-06-03 |access-date=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; new [[Program optimization|optimization]] tools, a [[JSON]] library, and other features.&lt;ref name="5.3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2012/08/racket-v53.html |title=Racket 5.3|publisher=PLT, Inc|date=2012-08-07 |access-date=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 5.3.1 introduced major improvements to DrRacket: the background syntax checker was turned on by default and a new documentation preview tool was added.&lt;ref name="5.3.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2012/11/racket-v531.html |title=Racket 5.3.1|publisher=PLT, Inc|date=2012-11-07 |access-date=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In version 6.0, Racket released its second-generation package management system. As part of this development, the principal DrRacket and Racket repository was reorganized and split into a large set of small packages, making it possible to install a ''minimal racket'' and to install only those packages needed.&lt;ref name="6.0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2014/02/racket-v60.html |title=Racket 6.0|publisher=PLT, Inc |date=2014-02-26 |access-date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
{{Main|Racket features}}
Racket's core language includes [[macro (computer science)#Syntactic macros|macros]], [[modular programming|modules]], [[closure (computer science)|lexical closures]], [[tail call]]s, [[delimited continuation]]s,&lt;ref name=icfp2007/&gt; parameters (fluid variables), [[design by contract|software contracts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contracts |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/contracts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[green threads|green]] and OS [[thread (computer science)|threads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Threads |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/threads.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Futures |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/futures.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Places |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/places.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more. The language also comes with primitives, such as eventspaces and custodians, which control resource management and enables the language to act like an [[operating system]] for loading and managing other programs.&lt;ref name="mred"/&gt;  Further extensions to the language are created with the powerful macro system, which together with the module system and custom parsers can control all aspects of a language.&lt;ref name="creating-languages"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Flatt |first=Matthew |title=Creating Languages in Racket |newspaper=Communications of the ACM |year=2012 |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/1/144809-creating-languages-in-racket |access-date=2012-04-08 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike programming languages that lack macro systems, most language constructs in Racket are written on the base language using macros.  These include a [[mixin]] class system,&lt;ref name="scheme-with-classes"/&gt; a component (or module) system as expressive as ML's [[opaque ascription]],&lt;ref name="units"/&gt; and [[pattern matching]].

Further, the language features the first contract system for a [[higher-order programming]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
 |last1=Findler |first1=R. B.
 |last2=Felleisen |first2=M.
 |title=Contracts for Higher-Order Functions
 |booktitle=International Conference on Functional Programming
 |year=2002
 |url=http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/pubs/papers/ho-contracts-icfp2002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Racket's contract system is inspired by the [[Design by Contract]] work for [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] and extends it to work for higher-order values such as [[first-class function]]s, objects, [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] cells, and so on. For example, an object that is checked by a contract can be ensured to make contract checks when its methods are eventually invoked.

Racket's compiler is a [[bytecode]] compiler that translates to an internal bytecode format that is run by the Racket [[virtual machine]].  On [[x86]] and [[PowerPC]] platforms, the bytecode is further compiled using a JIT compiler at runtime.

Since 2004, the language has also shipped with PLaneT, a package manager that is integrated into the module system so that [[third-party software component|third-party libraries]] can be transparently imported and used. Also, PLaneT has a built-in [[software versioning|versioning]] policy to prevent [[dependency hell]].&lt;ref name="planet"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Component Deployment with PLaneT: You Want it Where? |last=Matthews |first=J. |booktitle=Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2014, much of Racket's code was moved into a new packaging system separate from the main code base. This new packaging system is serviced by a client program named ''raco''. The new package system provides fewer features than PLaneT; a blog post by Jay McCarthy on the Racket blog explains the rationale for the change and how to duplicate the older system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.racket-lang.org/2014/12/the-racket-package-system-and-planet.html |title=The Racket package system and Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macros and extensibility===
{{See also|Racket features#Language Extensions|l1=Racket language extensions}}

The feature that distinguishes Racket from other languages in the Lisp family is its integrated language [[Extensible programming|extensibility]]. Racket's extensibility features are built into the module system to allow context-sensitive and module-level control over syntax.&lt;ref name='languages-as-libraries'/&gt; For example, the &lt;code&gt;#%app&lt;/code&gt; syntactic form can be overridden to change the semantics of [[function application]]. Similarly, the &lt;code&gt;#%module-begin&lt;/code&gt; form allows arbitrary static analysis of the entire module.&lt;ref name='languages-as-libraries'/&gt; Since any module can be used as a language, via the &lt;code&gt;#lang&lt;/code&gt; notation, this effectively means that virtually any aspect of the language can be programmed and controlled.

The module-level extensibility features are combined with a [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]-like hygienic macro system, which provides more features than [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp's]] s-expression manipulation system,&lt;ref name='you-want-it-when'&gt;{{cite conference |last=Flatt |first=Matthew |url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/macromod.pdf |title=Composable and Compilable Macros, You Want it When? |booktitle=International Conference on Functional Programming |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flatt, Culpepper, Darais, Findler, [http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/jfp12-draft-fcdf.pdf Macros that Work Together; Compile-Time Bindings, Partial Expansion, and Definition Contexts]&lt;/ref&gt; Scheme 84's [[Hygienic macro|hygienic]] extend-syntax macros, or [[R5RS]]'s [[syntax-rules]].  Indeed, it is fair to say that the macro system is a carefully tuned [[application programming interface]] (API) for [[compiler]] extensions.  Using this compiler API, programmers can add features and entire [[domain-specific language]]s in a manner that makes them completely indistinguishable from built-in language constructs.

The macro system in Racket has been used to construct entire language [[dialect (computing)|dialects]].  This includes Typed Racket—a statically typed dialect of Racket that eases the migration from [[dynamically typed|untyped]] to typed code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Tobin-Hochstadt |first1=S. |last2=Felleisen |first2=M. |title=The Design and Implementation of Typed Scheme |booktitle=Principles of Programming Languages |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lazy Racket—a dialect with [[lazy evaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Barzilay |first1=E. |last2=Clements |first2=J. |title=Laziness Without All the Hard Work: Combining Lazy and Strict Languages for Teaching |booktitle=Functional and Declarative Programming in Education |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other dialects include FrTime ([[functional reactive programming]]), Scribble (documentation language),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Flatt |first1=M. |last2=Barzilay |first2=E. |last3=Findler |first3=R. B. |title=Scribble: Closing the Book on Ad Hoc Documentation Tools |booktitle=International Conference on Functional Programming |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slideshow ([[slide show|presentation]] language),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Findler |first1=R. B. |last2=Flatt |first2=M. |title=Slideshow: Functional Presentations |booktitle=International Conference on Functional Programming |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several languages for education.&lt;ref name="functional-io"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Felleisen |last2=Findler |last3=Flatt |last4=Krishnamurthi |first1=M. |first2=R. B. |first3=M. |first4=S. |title=A Functional I/O System (or Fun for Freshman Kids) |url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/icfp09-fffk.pdf |booktitle=International Conference on Functional Programming |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum |last1=Felleisen |last2=Findler |last3=Flatt |last4=Krishnamurthi |first1=M. |first2=R. B. |first3=M. |first4=S.|journal=Journal of Functional Programming |url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/fdpe2002-fffk.pdf |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racket's core distribution provides libraries to aid the process of constructing new programming languages.&lt;ref name="languages-as-libraries"/&gt;

Such languages are not restricted to [[s-expression]] based syntax.  In addition to conventional readtable-based syntax extensions, Racket's &lt;code&gt;#lang&lt;/code&gt; makes it possible for a language programmer to define any arbitrary parser, for example, using the parser tools library.&lt;ref name="parsers"&gt;{{cite web |title=Parser Tools: lex and yacc-style Parsing |url=http://docs.racket-lang.org/parser-tools/ |access-date=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Racket features#Logic Programming|Racket logic programming]] for an example of such a language.

==Programming environment==
The language platform provides a self-hosted [[integrated development environment|IDE]]&lt;ref name="drscheme"/&gt; named DrRacket, a continuation-based [[web server]],&lt;ref name="web-server"/&gt; a [[graphical user interface]],&lt;ref name="gui-rebuild"/&gt; and other tools.  Racket is also a viable scripting tool and can be used for scripting the Unix shell. It can parse [[command line arguments]], execute external tools and includes libraries like all common [[scripting language]]s.

===DrRacket IDE===
DrRacket (formerly DrScheme) is widely used among introductory computer science courses that teach Scheme or Racket and is lauded for its simplicity and appeal to beginner programmers. The IDE was originally built for use with the TeachScheme! project (now [[ProgramByDesign]]), an outreach effort by [[Northeastern University]] and a number of affiliated universities for attracting high school students to computer science courses at the college level.

The editor provides [[Syntax highlighting|source highlighting]] for syntax and run-time errors, parenthesis matching, a [[debugger]] and an algebraic stepper. Its student-friendly features include support for multiple "language levels" (Beginning Student, Intermediate Student and so on). It also has integrated library support, and sophisticated [[Program analysis|analysis]] tools for advanced programmers. Further, [[modular programming|module-oriented programming]] is supported with the module browser, a contour view, integrated [[software testing|testing]] and [[Fault coverage|coverage]] measurements, and [[refactoring]] support. It provides integrated, context-sensitive access to an extensive hyper-linked help system named "Help Desk".

DrRacket is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (95 and up), [[macOS]], [[Unix]], and [[Linux]] with the [[X Window System]] and programs behave similarly on all these platforms.

== Code examples ==
Here's a trivial [[hello world]] program:
&lt;source lang="Racket"&gt;
#lang racket/base
"Hello, World!"
&lt;/source&gt;
Running this program produces the output:
:{{samp|"Hello, World!"}}

Here's a slightly less trivial program:
[[File:Sierpinski Racket example.png|thumb|The result of this program, as shown in DrRacket]]
&lt;source lang="Racket"&gt;
#lang racket
(require 2htdp/image)

(let sierpinski ([n 8])
  (if (zero? n)
    (triangle 2 'solid 'red)
    (let ([t (sierpinski (- n 1))])
      (freeze (above t (beside t t))))))
&lt;/source&gt;
This program, taken from the Racket website, draws a [[Sierpinski triangle]], nested to depth 8.

Using the &lt;code&gt;#lang&lt;/code&gt; directive, a source file can be written in different dialects of Racket.  Here is an example of the factorial program in Typed Racket, a [[statically typed]] dialect of Racket:
&lt;source lang="Racket"&gt;
#lang typed/racket

(: fact (Integer -&gt; Integer))
(define (fact n)
  (cond [(zero? n) 1]
        [else (* n (fact (- n 1)))]))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Applications and practical use ==

Apart from having a basis in [[programming language theory]], Racket was designed to be used as a general-purpose language in production systems.  Thus, the Racket distribution features an extensive library that covers systems and network programming, web development,&lt;ref name="web-server"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Implementation and Use of the PLT Scheme Web Server|journal=Journal of Higher-Order and Symbolic Programming |last1=Krishnamurthi, Hopkins |last2=McCarthy |last3=Graunke |last4=Pettyjohn |last5=Felleisen |year=2007 |url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/hosc07-sk-mf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a uniform interface to the underlying operating system, a dynamic [[foreign function interface]],&lt;ref name="ffi"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Foreign Interface for PLT Scheme |last1=Barzilay |first1=E. |last2=Orlovsky |first2=D. |booktitle=Scheme and Functional Programming |year=2004 |url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/scheme04-bo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; several flavours of [[regular expressions]], lexer/parser generators,&lt;ref name="parsers"/&gt; [[logic programming]], and a complete [[GUI]] framework.

Racket has several features useful for a commercial language, among them an ability to generate standalone executables under Windows, macOS, and Unix, a [[Profiling (computer programming)|profiler]] and [[debugger]] included in the [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), and a [[unit testing]] framework.

Racket has been used for commercial projects and web applications. A notable example is the [[Hacker News]] website, which runs on [[Arc (programming language)|Arc]], which is developed in Racket. [[Naughty Dog]] has used it as a scripting language in several of their video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cufp.org/conference/sessions/2011/functional-mzscheme-dsls-game-development |title=Functional mzScheme DSLs in Game Development |access-date=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racket is used to teach students algebra through game design in the [[Bootstrap curriculum|Bootstrap program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2015/index.shtml |website=bootstrapworld.org |access-date=2015-08-11 |title=Bootstrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4781">In [[computing]], a '''Research Object''' is a method for the identification, aggregation and exchange of scholarly information on the [[World Wide Web|Web]]. The primary goal of the research object approach is to provide a mechanism to associate together related resources about a scientific investigation so that they can be shared together using a single identifier. As such, research objects are an advanced form of [[Enhanced publication]].&lt;ref name="BelhajjameZhao2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belhajjame|first1=Khalid|last2=Zhao|first2=Jun|last3=Garijo|first3=Daniel|last4=Gamble|first4=Matthew|last5=Hettne|first5=Kristina|last6=Palma|first6=Raul|last7=Mina|first7=Eleni|last8=Corcho|first8=Oscar|last9=Gómez-Pérez|first9=José Manuel|last10=Bechhofer|first10=Sean|last11=Klyne|first11=Graham|last12=Goble|first12=Carole|authorlink12=Carole Goble|title=Using a suite of ontologies for preserving workflow-centric research objects|journal=[[Journal of Web Semantics]]|volume=32|year=2015|pages=16–42|issn=1570-8268|doi=10.1016/j.websem.2015.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current implementations build upon existing Web technologies and methods including [[Linked Data]], [[HTTP]], [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)]], the [[Open Archives Initiative]] [[Object Reuse and Exchange]] (OAI-ORE) and the Open Annotation model, as well as existing approaches for identification and knowledge representation in the scientific domain including [[Digital object identifier|Digital Object Identifiers]] for documents, [[ORCID]] identifiers for people, and the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) data model.

== Principles and motivation ==
The research object approach is primarily motivated by a desire to improve reproducibility of scientific investigations. Central to the proposal is need to share research artifacts commonly distributed across specialist repositories on the Web including supporting data, software executables, source code, presentation slides, presentation videos. Research Objects are not one specific technology but are instead guided by a set of principles. Specifically research objects are guided by three principles of identity, aggregation and annotation&lt;ref name="Bechhofer2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/npre.2010.4626.1| title = Research Objects: Towards Exchange and Reuse of Digital Knowledge| year = 2010| last1 = Bechhofer | first1 = S. | last2 = Bechhofer | first2 = S. | last3 = De Roure | first3 = D.|authorlink3=David De Roure | last4 = Gamble | first4 = M. | last5 = Goble | first5 = C.|authorlink5=Carole Goble | last6 = Buchan | first6 = I. | journal = [[Nature Precedings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Digital identity]] - Use [[unique identifier]]s as names for things, such as DOIs for publications or data, and ORCID ids for researchers.
* [[Data aggregation]] - Use some form of aggregation to associated related things together that are part of the broader study, investigation etc. so that others may more readily discover those related resources.
* [[Annotation]] - Provide additional [[metadata]] about those things, how they relate to each other, their [[provenance]], how they were produced etc.

A number of communities are an actively developing the research object concept.

===ROSC W3C activity ===
A [[W3C]] community group entitled the Research Objects for Scholarly Communication (ROSC) Community Group was started in April 2013. The community charter states that the goals of the ROSC activity are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/community/rosc/rosc-community-group-charter/|title=Research Object for Scholarly Communication (ROSC) Community Group Charter|first=Jun|last=Zhao|year=2013|website=www.w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to exchange requirements and expectations for supporting a new form of scholarly communication"

The Community Group aims to produce the following types of deliverables:

* Use cases for the representation, publishing, and exchange of research objects on the Web
* Requirements and desiderata distilled from the use cases.
* A survey of related work on supporting the representation, publishing, and exchange of research objects.
* Various best practices and guidelines towards a community-wide practice of sharing, citing, and exchanging of research objects

=== Github and Figshare ===
The [[Mozilla]] Science Lab have initiated an activity in collaboration with [[GitHub]] and [[Figshare]] to develop "Code as research object". The initial proposal of the activity is to allow users to transfer code from a GitHub repository to figshare, and provide that code with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), providing a permanent record of the code that can be cited in future publications.

'''Rosetta Stone Language Learning''' is [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL) [[software]] published by [[Rosetta Stone (company)|Rosetta Stone Inc]]. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and [[grammar]] by [[spaced repetition]], without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion™.

The software's name and logo allude to the [[Rosetta Stone|an ancient stone slab of the same name]] on which the [[Raphia Decree|Decree of Memphis]] is inscribed in three writing systems.

==Dynamic Immersion==
In a Rosetta Stone Language Learning exercise, the student pairs sound or text to one of several images. The number of images per screen varies.

For example, the software shows the student four photographs. A native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs, and the statement is printed on the screen; the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described. In another variation, the student completes a textual description of a photograph.

In writing exercises, the software provides an on-screen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the [[Latin alphabet]].

[[Grammar]] lessons cover [[grammatical tense]] and [[grammatical mood]]. In grammar lessons, the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept, and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted. Then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase, and the student chooses the correct option.

If the student has a [[microphone]], the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation.

Each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson, and each unit concludes with a milestone, which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit.

===Scoring===
The program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At the bottom of the window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all answers for that screen are correct, the button for that screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all answers for a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.

==Software versions==
To use Rosetta Stone Language Learning, a student needs the Rosetta Stone [[application software]] and at least one level of a language pack. The latest [[Software versioning#Change significance|major version]] of Rosetta Stone is Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13.

Language packs also have [[version number]]s. The version number of the language pack is distinct from the version numbering scheme of the Rosetta Stone application, and a language pack is only compatible with specific versions of the application. Version 4 and 5 are [[backward compatible]] with language packs developed for Version 3, but not older ones.&lt;ref name="compatibility" /&gt;

===Version 1===
By the end of 1996, Rosetta Stone Version 1 had a selection of nine level-one language courses (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and four level-two courses (English, French, German, Spanish). A CD-ROM product called The Rosetta Stone PowerPac featured introductory versions of seven of the courses.

At this time, Fairfield Language Technologies had already begun development of the Arabic, Esperanto, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, Thai, and Vietnamese courses. Within a few months, the Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese courses were complete, and development of Latin, Polish, and Welsh courses were underway. The Latin course was the next to be completed, followed by Hebrew. In this fashion, Fairfield introduced new courses to market gradually.

Rosetta Stone Version 1 was developed for [[Macintosh]] [[System 6]] and higher, and [[Windows 3.0]] and higher. Later revisions of Version 1 for Macintosh required [[System 7]]. The final revision of Version 1 was v1.9.&lt;ref name="compatibility"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://success.rosettastone.com/articles/en_US/Text/How-do-I-know-if-my-Rosetta-Stone-Application-CD-is-compatible-with-my-Rosetta-Stone-Language-CD/ |title=How do I know if my Rosetta Stone Application CD is compatible with my Rosetta Stone Language CD?
 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Rosetta Stone Success Central |publisher=Rosetta Stone Ltd. |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 2===
At Version 2, Fairfield continued to add more language courses, but also marketed more editions of The Rosetta Stone software.

The PowerPac CD-ROM introduced in Version 1 now featured basic lessons in seven languages. One complete level of a language course was now called a Personal Edition of the software.

Because many consumers found The Rosetta Stone to be too expensive, Fairfield started a series of "Explorer" editions. An Explorer CD-ROM was a lower-cost excerpt of a Version 2 course. Each edition of the Rosetta Stone Explorer series (Japanese Explorer, Welsh Explorer, etc.) included three units (22 lessons) from Level 1. The company no longer sells Explorer editions.

Then there was Global Traveler, a CD-ROM and [[Electronic dictionary|electronic]] [[Bilingual dictionary#Formats|translation dictionary]] package for people requiring some facility in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. The lessons on the CD-ROM teach words and phrases for travelers. The electronic translator was programmed with about 60,000 words and 720 phrases.

====Compatibility====
The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x is backward compatible with some of the later language packs for Version 1; specifically languages courses with a version number of 3.0 or 4.0.x.&lt;ref name="compatibility" /&gt;

The Rosetta Stone v2.1 through v2.2.x are only compatible with v6.x language courses. These versions of the language packs and software engine are neither backward compatible nor [[forward compatible]].&lt;ref name="compatibility" /&gt; Language discs developed for The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x are incompatible with these later revisions of the software.

In v2.1.4.1A of The Rosetta Stone, the program began using [[copy protection]] software called [[SafeDisc]].

===Version 3===
Rosetta Stone Version 3 is not backward compatible with language packs developed for Rosetta Stone Versions 1 or 2.&lt;ref name="compatibility" /&gt;

Version 3 was initially released in August 2007 for ten bestselling languages, with other languages following later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351285/000104746908010224/a2187940zs-1.htm |title=Registration Statement Under the Securities Act of 1933 (Prospectus) for Rosetta Stone Inc. |author=Michael C. Wu, General Counsel |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final revision of Version 3 is v3.4.7.r1.&lt;ref name="compatibility" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://success.rosettastone.com/articles/en_US/Text/Update-Instructions-Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Latest-Application-Versions |title=Update Instructions: Rosetta Stone Version 3 Latest Application Versions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Rosetta Stone Success Central |publisher=Rosetta Stone Ltd. |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homeschool Edition====
Homeschool Edition introduces additional features that keep track of time spent per lesson, scores achieved on lessons, lesson plans, and instructional objectives. This edition includes a supplemental CD-ROM that has workbooks, quizzes, lesson transcripts, and exams.

Unlike the Personal Edition, the Homeschool Edition application does not recommend reviews. Aside from the minor differences, the homeschool edition is essentially the same as the personal edition—except for the supplemental CD with written exercises and lesson plans. The language discs in the two editions are identical and are interchangeable. Some may have 3 discs and some may have 5. Much of the information on the supplemental CD-ROM is available online from Rosetta Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Updated Supplemental Education Materials |url=http://www.rosettastone.com/homeschool/sem |publisher=Rosetta Stone |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosetta Stone Coach.JPG|thumb|An [[English as a foreign language]] coach talks with a student via Rosetta Studio.]]

===Version 4 TOTALe===
Version 4 is backward compatible with all language packs developed for Version 3.&lt;ref name="compatibility" /&gt;

Rosetta Stone released Version 4 TOTALe on September 14, 2010. TOTALe is a [[software suite]] comprising Rosetta Course, Rosetta Studio, Rosetta World, and TOTALe Mobile Companion. Users of the Rosetta Studio software subscribe to a service that [[videoconferences]] them with a language [[Coaching|coach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/gadgetreviews/with-totale-rosetta-stone-brings-the-social-web-to-language-software-review/10299 |title=With TOTALe, Rosetta Stone brings the social web to language software |last=Nusca |first=Andrew |date=3 January 2010 |work=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=18 January 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetta World is a social gaming service. TOTALe Mobile Companion is a Rosetta Stone [[mobile app]] for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.

With Version 4, Rosetta Stone adds stricter copy protection measures.

=== Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13===
Rosetta Stone released Version 5 on October 9, 2014. The notable changes are the change in brand name ("Rosetta Course" has become "Language Training"), a new interactive demo is built into the application based on user feedback and a new minimalist UI with no beveled edges or drop shadows.

The software is offered in three variants

=== Discover Languages===

Rosetta Stone’s Discover Languages is an app currently only available on Xbox One. It is very different from the traditional design, involving a virtual world and more of a focus on games in order to appeal more strongly to game playing audiences. The only languages currently supported are English and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn Spanish and English on your Xbox One with the new Rosetta Stone app |url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/learn-spanish-and-english-your-xbox-one-new-rosetta-stone-app |publisher= WinBeta|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language Course organization===
The language courses are divided into three to five levels offered as language packs either in CD-ROMs or Download. In the [[retail software]] packages of Rosetta Stone, each CD-ROM has one level.

All languages, except Latin, use mostly the same set of words and sentences in almost the same order, with mainly the same images. Some of the material is reused from lesson to lesson to invoke long-term retention.

In version 3 pack, there are four units per language level. Each unit has four core lessons that are about 30 minutes long. The student then moves on to one of the following lesson modes: Pronunciation, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Reading, Speaking. The Milestone is an exercise at the end of each unit in which students apply what they learned in the unit.

====Rosetta Stone v2 Language Pack====
In Rosetta Stone version 2 Language Packs, most lessons have two levels; a few have three.

=====Level 1 (8 units)=====
The first eight units have 84 lessons, plus eight reviews. The lessons reiterate simple vocabulary and [[grammatical tense]]s. The lessons conclude with a unit on giving directions.

Units 1–4 have 10 lessons and one review. Units 5–8 have 11 lessons and a review.

=====Level 2 (11 units)=====
The 11 units of Level 2 include a total of 118 lessons. The lessons in the first nine units have a format similar to those in Level 1. The final two units are "[[Glossary]]" units devoted to single words pertaining to a particular topic, such as school, nature, or automobiles.

Level 2 units cover more advanced grammar, as well as preparation for common situations, such as [[banking]], [[shopping]], and [[tourism]]. Short videos  (in [[QuickTime]] format) illustrate some verbs.

Units 16 and 17 use [[Panel (comics)|single-panel comics]] from the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' as a teaching tool.

=====Level 3=====
Level 3 expands on Level 2 with longer videos and written passages.

====Rosetta Stone v3 Language Pack====
Rosetta Stone version 3 Language Pack has 3–5 levels. The lessons differ by language. Compared with Version 2, Version 3 lessons focus more on conversation and less on grammar rules.

=====Level 1 (4 units)=====
In level one, each unit has a 30-minute lesson and some activities that are five to fifteen minutes long. Level 1 takes up to 24 hours to complete.

Starting from simple vocabulary such as basic greetings, "boy", "girl", "man", and "woman", moving up through numbers, comparisons, adjectives, nouns, verb conjugation, and telling time. Each unit also contains a ten-minute simulated conversation called a "Milestone".

The units are: Language Basics, Greetings and Introductions, Work and School, and Shopping.

=====Level 2 (4 units)=====
Level 2 offers a total of about twenty-four hours designed to teach the user to "navigate your surroundings as you build on the vocabulary and essential language structure in Level 1." More grammar is covered, including past and future tenses, and imperative forms. Topics such as giving directions, writing letters, workplace terms, apologies, discussing emotions, and criticizing art are also covered. As in Level 1, each unit is followed by a ten-minute "Milestone".

The four units in Level 2 are Travel, Past and Future, Friends and Social Life, and Dining and Vacation.

=====Level 3 (4 units)=====
Level 3 offers instruction designed to help "connect with the world around you by building on the language fundamentals and conversational skills you developed in Levels 1 and 2." In addition to expanding upon grammar learned in Levels 1 and 2, Level 3 teaches more in depth vocabulary, including botanical terms, culinary terms, how to express detailed opinions and judgments, and how to discuss politics, religion, and business. As in the first two levels, each unit contains a ten-minute "Milestone" activity in which the user participates in a simulated conversation.

The four units in Level 3 are Home and Health, Life and World, Everyday Things, and Places and Events.

=====Level 4 (4 units) =====
The four units are Tourism and Recreation, Professions and Hobbies, At Home and Around Town, and Style and Personal Wellness.

=====Level 5 (4 units)=====
The five units are Business and Industry, Arts and Academics, Emergency Situations, and Family and Community.

Levels 4 and 5 teach more complex sentence structures, higher verbal tenses, and more irregular verbs, and introduce more vocabulary.

===Audio Companion===
On 9 June 2008, Rosetta Stone introduced an addition to its Version 3 [[product line]]: Audio Companion, supplemental audio recordings of words and phrases. The student is meant to repeat the spoken words and phrases for practice and memorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new-product/software/3270454/rosetta-stone-audio-companion/ |title=Rosetta Stone Audio Companion |last=Haworth |first=Rosemary |date=31 July 2008 |work=[[PC Advisor]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike recordings based on the [[Pimsleur Language Programs|Pimsleur]] method, the Audio Companion provides neither narration nor translations. Rosetta Stone distributes the audio supplements on [[Compact Disc#Audio CD|audio CD]] and as [[MP3]] files. Each Audio Companion supplements one level of the language course, and each disc supplements a specific unit. Complete Version 4 course packages include Audio Companion material for each level.

===Endangered Language Program===
The Endangered Language Program was created in 2004 for use by [[endangered language]] communities engaged in [[language revitalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodroof, Martha. “[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10357963 Endangered Alaskan Language Goes Digital]." [[National Public Radio]]. May 23, 2007. (accessed July 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that contract the Endangered Language Program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product, allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting [[indigenous intellectual property]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Endangered Languages: Move to Save Mohawk Language Through Technology," ''Language'' magazine, Vol. 5, no. 9 (May 2006): 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; These versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites.

Based in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]], the Endangered Language Program began offering a corporate grant program in 2007 to underwrite development costs for awarded communities.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, Don. "Rosetta Stone: Endangered Language Program Announcement]." Kabissa Space for Change in Africa. Jan. 8, 2007. (accessed July 06, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetta Stone Inc. offered the first awards of the grant program to the [[Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Arthur. "A Language Lost, and Found]." ''Imagine Louisiana,'' spring 2008: 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Navajo Language Renaissance coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Brossy, Chee. "New media for Diné&amp;nbsp;– Navajo Times." ''Navajo Times.'' Dec. 6, 2007. (accessed July 06, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Endangered Language Program also offers paid internships to graduate and undergraduate students interested in contributing to the work of the program.&lt;ref&gt;UICLACS. "Opportunities.” University of Illinois Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies. July 2008. (accessed July 06, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 the [[Chickasaw Nation]], through the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program established in 2007, contracted with Rosetta Stone to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the [[Chickasaw language]] to its 60,000+ members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, J. (2016). Language affiliation and ethnolinguistic identity in chickasaw language revitalization. Language &amp; Communication, 47, 100-111. doi:10.1016/j.langcom.2015.04.005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.rosettastone.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=227935&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2107339|title=Press  Release - Investor Relations - Rosetta Stone|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effort comes as the Chickasaw Nation has approximately 50 native speakers remaining, with its last monolingual speaker having died in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/01/07/260555554/what-happens-when-a-languages-last-monolingual-speaker-dies|title=What Happens When A Language's Last Monolingual Speaker Dies?|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and efficacy==

===Critiques from language experts===
Frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaughnessy|first=Michael|title=CALL, commercialism and culture: inherent software design conflicts and their results|journal=ReCALL|year=2003|volume=15|issue=2|pages=251–268|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=214455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order, using the same images taken mostly in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area near the company's headquarters at the time in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]], [[Virginia]]. In the most recent version, there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions.

Another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers. In 2006, ''[[Macworld]]'' reviewer Cyrus Farivar noted that his Persian CD used ''khodrow'' for "car", although most native speakers use a [[List of French loanwords in Persian|French loanword]], ''ma:sheen''. The same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning [[Persian language|Persian]], such as "bread" and "tea"; however, it very curiously included the word "elephant" in a basic vocabulary lesson. Perplexed by the question of why the word "elephant" would be taught in a language where it might never be used (there are not many elephants in Iran), Farivar called Rosetta Stone, Inc. He was told that the company makes four different picture sets: one for Western languages, another for Asian languages, and two sets unique to each [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Latin]]. The [[Persian language|Persian]] language CD was using the Western picture set, which explains why the images were not culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Macworld 2006 review"&gt;Farivar, Cyrus; January 19, 2006; [http://www.macworld.com/2006/01/reviews/rosettastone3/index.php Foreign-language software provides a comprehensive approach to learning]; ''[[Macworld]]'', retrieved July 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Donald McRae on the German course====
Writing in 1997, Donald McRae of [[Brock University]] said that Rosetta Stone represented "good pedagogy" and that "the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology". He described the Version 2 German language course as "very good", but indicated that he had "some reservations".{{explain|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref name="McRae"&gt;McRae, Donald; June 24, 1997; [http://www-writing.berkeley.edu/chorus/call/reviews/archives/rosettagerm.html Review: The Rosetta Stone for German]; CALL @Chorus; retrieved October 22, 2006.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205014752/http://www-writing.berkeley.edu/chorus/call/reviews/archives/rosettagerm.html |date=December 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mark Kaiser on the Russian course====
In a 1997 review of the Version 2 Russian language course, Mark Kaiser, director of the Language Media Center at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], called the program "woefully inadequate for a number of reasons".&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;Kaiser, Mark; September 25, 1997; [http://www-writing.berkeley.edu/chorus/call/reviews/rosetta_russian/index.html Review: The Rosetta Stone for Russian], CALL @Chorus, retrieved October 22, 2006.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913073027/http://www-writing.berkeley.edu/chorus/call/reviews/rosetta_russian/index.html |date=September 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kaiser's observations was that Rosetta Stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context. Because the company uses the same [[stock photograph]]s for all its language courses, they depict people, activities, and manufactured goods that are conspicuously American. Kaiser also found that Rosetta Stone Version 2 does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills, and that some of the words and phrases are too English-based.

"The entire package lacks any [[Language pedagogy|pedagogical]] foundation," he concluded. "Rather, it utilizes the glitz of the [[Multimedia computer|multimedia]] capabilities of the computer, a dearth of quality foreign language software, and clever marketing to create an economically successful product."&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}

Brendan Lewis, a world traveler, made similar observations in his critique nearly 14 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fluentin3months.com/rosetta-stone-review/ |title=Review of Rosetta Stone: Detailed and honest look at latest version (TOTALe) |last=Lewis |first=Brendan |work=Fluent in 3 Months |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stephen Krashen's Review====

The language-learning specialist Stephen Krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were "about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests."&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen, 2013, "Rosetta Stone:  Does Not Provide Compelling Input, Research Reports at Best Suggestive, Conflicting Reports on Users' Attitudes," ''The International Journal of Foreign Language Teaching'', April 2013, pp. 1-4; quotation from p. 4.  
http://www.tprstories.com/images/ijflt/articles-april-2013/Krashen-Rosetta-Stone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===End User License Agreement===
The user purchases a licence to use the software, which is non-transferable. Up to five members of a household may use a single licence.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.rosettastone.com/CDN/global/pdfs/Global-EULA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional use==

===United States Army===
In December 2007, the [[United States Army]] offered a special military version of Arabic to help troops deploying to the Middle East learn the language for conversations and phrases important in a military situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revolutionary Technology Strengthens Military Language Training |url=http://pr.rosettastone.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=228009&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1273960 |publisher=Rosetta Stone |date=December 3, 2007 |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was available to all US Army personnel, US Military Academy cadets, contracted US Army ROTC Cadets and other special guests with a sponsor.

The United States Army "E-Learning", a SkillPort product, offered the full Version 3 Online, with the exception of only a few languages. The Army E-Learning web site was accessible by most Army members with a valid AKO (Army Knowledge Online) e-mail address or CAC (Common Access Card).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Army e-Learning Overview |url=http://www.dls.army.mil/eLearn_overview.html |publisher=[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] |accessdate=February 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050227/http://www.dls.army.mil/eLearn_overview.html |archive-date=2010-02-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Department of State]] uses Rosetta Stone (Version 3 as of 2009) as a companion to their in-class and distance learning language programs provided through the [[Foreign Service Institute]]. It is free for civil and foreign service employees.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===James Madison University===
In April 2011, [[James Madison University]] was the first university to partner with Rosetta Stone to offer the Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe as an accredited Conversational Spanish I language learning course. The program teaches Spanish through a series of images that, when clicked on, show the vocabulary word. The student will speak into a microphone and speech recognition software will correct mispronounced words, according to Reilly Brennan, Rosetta Stone's Director of Public Relations. The course is available to adults who want to complete a degree for teaching and non-degree seeking students are eligible to take the class. The Rosetta Stone TOTALe accredited offering is a 16-week, intensive language-learning program. The program is accessed completely online and follows a syllabus approved by Rosetta Stone and James Madison University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = JMU teams up with Rosetta Stone: University offers new online Spanish class|url = http://www.breezejmu.org/news/article_be00daf2-6950-11e0-81a7-001a4bcf6878.html|website = The Breeze|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint George's College''', founded in 1936 and run by the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]], is among the most exclusive and upper-class schools in [[Santiago, Chile]]. According to Seminarium Head Hunting, fully one third of the CEO's of the top 200 companies in Chile are graduates of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capital|url=http://www.al-dia.cl/sistema/tablas/listar.asp?r=2882|publisher=www.al-dia.cl|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Holy Cross priests arrived in Santiago, Chile, on March 1, 1943, at the invitation of Cardinal [[José María Caro Rodríguez|José María Caro]], [[Archbishop of Santiago (Chile)]], to administer Saint George's College. Fathers William Havey, Alfred Send, and Joseph Doherty believed they were going to do university work. Little did they know that "college" in this context meant a school of first through 12th graders.

Today, Saint George's College serves 2,650 students. Its history is rich and is closely tied with the history of Chile, including the 1970s when the school was taken over by the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military government]] and Holy Cross was ousted. St. George's was the only private school in Chile to be taken over by military authority following the September 1973, coup.  The Congregation returned to the school in 1986.  Strong faith formation and service have been a hallmark of Saint George's. Over the decades, the college has formed many influential leaders in Chilean society. Also Holy Cross' first Chilean vocation, Fr. Jorge Canepa, was a 1946 graduate of the school.

Originally an all-boys school, Saint George's College was made co-educational in 1973. First located in the then-exclusive [[Pedro de Valdivia]] section of [[Providencia, Chile|Providencia]], in 1970 it was relocated to [[Vitacura]].  Academically, its students have consistently ranked in the top 20 in terms of mean and average college entrance exam scores. 

Its traditional rival schools are [[Colegio del Verbo Divino]] and Colegio San Ignacio, which were originally located near one another in the Pedro de Valdivia neighborhood of [[Providencia, Chile|Providencia]]. Its traditional sister school was Colegio Santa Úrsula ("Ursulinas"), which was originally next door to St. George's in Providencia

A splinter group of parents and teachers, dissatisfied with the [[Liberation Theology]] measures imposed by Father [[Gerard Whelan (priest)|Gerard Whelan]] (known locally as the Padre Gerardo) during the early 1970s, broke off in 1972 and formed [[Colegio Tabancura]], an [[Opus Dei]]-run boys' school. Since then, St. George's College has had a reputation for social and political activism, which is unusual among the group of exclusive schools of Santiago, and the generally conservative Chilean upper-class.

Among Saint George's College's internationally renowned alumni are [[José Miguel Insulza]] (Class of '61, Socialist politician, Secretary General of the [[Organization of American States]]), [[Andrés Pascal Allende]] (Class of '62, Marxist revolutionary), [[Andrés&amp;nbsp;Wood]] (Class of '83, film director/producer, who directed the film [[Machuca]], a fictionalized account of Saint George's College around the time of the military coup of '73), [[Gonzalo Lira]] (Class of '85, author, film director), [[Marco Enríquez-Ominami]] (Class of '90, leftist presidential candidate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marcopresidente.cl/programa/marco.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105153654/http://www.marcopresidente.cl/programa/marco.html |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="994">'''Special Education Bulgaria''' (SEB) ({{lang-bg|Специална Педагогика България}}) is a [[community of practice]], a professional community, for special education professionals and the parents of students with special needs throughout Bulgaria.

SEB was developed by researchers from [[Sofia University]], [[Bulgaria]] and the [[University of Wollongong]], [[Australia]]. The purpose of the SEB website is to facilitate the community of practice. It is hoped that such a community will help reduce the sense of isolation felt by young special education teachers and other special education stakeholders in rural areas of Bulgaria. The community is also intended to support special education stakeholders who are separated from their support network across busy cities or by the requirements of daily living.

==Reception==
Norwegian philosopher Finngeir Hiorth states that the book, like it's companion volume, ''Stephen Hawking for Beginners'', starts with, "historical passages dealing with earlier ideas about the Universe," before, "bringing the story up-to-date." Pirani's text is, according to Hiorth, "written in a simple and easily understandable language with a minimum of formulas," with terminology, "always explained." "[P]rofusely illustrated." by Roche, the volume is, Hiorth concludes, "like comics or funnies," where, "quite a lot of the information is formulated in an entertaining way."&lt;ref name="SW01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmology for Beginners|first=Finngeir|last=Hiorth|url=https://infidels.org/library/modern/finngeir_hiorth/cosmology.html|work=The Secular Web|date=1997|accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Trampoline Hall''' is a barroom lecture series started by Canadian author [[Sheila Heti]] in [[Toronto]]. It has been sold out consistently since 2001.

== Format ==
Trampoline Hall is held every month at [[The Garrison]]. The program consists of three talks each followed by a question-and-answer period, and is hosted by improv teacher and consultant [[Misha Glouberman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyeweekly.com/interview/article/44478 "Misha Glouberman's Terrible Noises for Beautiful People"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, Eye Weekly, November 05, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lecturers may speak on any subject from the mundane to the arcane, but are forbidden to speak on any area in which they are professionally expert. As a result, talks vary from the well-informed to the unstructured, with the lecturer's level of comfort and degree of preparation emerging as part of the "performance". Over a few months in 2010-2011, representative topics included "The History of 3D," "[[Suicide note|Suicide Notes]]," "Cultural Entropy in the [[Internet era|Internet Era]]," "The Perfect Baguette," and "Being an Asshole."

== Reception ==
The show went on a 10-city tour of the US in 2002 and has played numerous shows in [[New York City|New York]] and [[San Francisco]]. It has been written about favourably in [[The New Yorker]], [[The Village Voice]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-07-06/nyc-life/lecture-hall/1 "Lecture Hall. A speech series from Toronto tries its best to make New Yorkers smart"], by Tricia Romano, The Village Voice, Jul 6 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the National Post,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trampolinehall.net/PostArticle/ The National Post]&lt;/ref&gt; the Globe and Mail, and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/the-talking-trampoline/Content?oid=1187940 "The Talking Trampoline"], Indie Week, November 13, 2002; [http://www.trampolinehall.net/pk/nysun/NewYorkSunArticle.pdf "Eclectic Lectures Bounce from Topic to Topic"] by Gary Shampiro, New York Sun, Jul 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6572">The '''Reverend Doctor William Lee Bradley''' (September 6, 1918 – April 29, 2007, born in [[Oakland, California]]), was a scholar of comparative religion, ethics, and theology, as well as a philanthropist.

==Early life and education==
Bradley was born in Oakland to Kathryn Lee Culver, an author and artist, and Dwight Jaques Bradley, author and [[Congregational Church]] leader. He was raised in [[El Paso, Texas]], [[Webster Groves, Missouri]], and [[Newton Centre, Massachusetts]]. In 1947, he married Paula Anne Elliott, later a New Hampshire State Representative (1992–98; 2000–02). He received his B.A. from [[Oberlin College]] (1941), B.D. from [[Andover Newton Theological School]] (1950), and Ph.D. from [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland (1949).  He was a Sergeant in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in [[World War II]] (1942–45), serving in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]].

== Career ==
A fifth-generation ordained minister in the [[Congregational Christian Churches]] (later merging to become the [[United Church of Christ]]), he served as a Professor at [[Hartford Seminary]] from 1950-1966.  He was a visiting Professor at [[Thammasat University]] in [[Bangkok, Thailand]] for the last three years of his tenure at Hartford. In Bangkok, he served on the field staff of [[The Rockefeller Foundation]] and researched his ancestor, the Dr. [[Dan Beach Bradley]], the first medical missionary to Siam and court physician to Siam's King [[Mongkut]] and his son, King [[Chulalongkorn]].

After his time at Hartford, Bradley took a position at the Rockefeller Foundation as Associate Director for the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, from 1966–1971, and was then President of the Edward W. Hazen Foundation in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] from 1971-1984.  At The Rockefeller Foundation, he was particularly proud of his work assisting emerging playwrights and theatres in the heydey of the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre movement in [[New York City]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, assisting such emerging talents as playwrights [[Julie Bovasso]], [[Maria Irene Fornes]], [[John Guare]], [[Sam Shepard]], Ron Whyte, and [[Lanford Wilson]], as well as theatres such as the artistic leadership of producers such as Ellen Stewart ([[La MaMa]] Experimental Theatre Company or LaMaMa, E.T.C.), [[Joseph Papp]] ([[New York Shakespeare Festival]] - [[The Public Theater]]), Wyn Handman ([[The American Place Theatre]]), [[Joe Cino]] (Caffe Cino), and the theatre at [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]].  His theatre involvement continued in the 1980s when he served as Chair of the Board of [[Circle Repertory Company]] in New York City. As President of the Hazen Foundation, he was known for taking creative philanthropic risks by providing crucial [[seed funding]] for innovative programs and organizations that often later attracted substantial funding from larger foundations.  The reach and influence of the Hazen Foundation under his leadership therefore was amplified well  beyond the value of the grants awarded.

While in Connecticut, Bradley also served on the Governor's Commissions on Human Services; Libraries; and Equity and Excellence in Education. Following his retirement from the Hazen Foundation, which he continued to serve as President Emeritus, William and Paula moved to [[Randolph, New Hampshire]], where both became active in that community.  Bradley co-founded and served as the first editor of the ''Mountain View'', a quarterly news magazine in Randolph, served as President of the [[Randolph Foundation]] from 1991–1996, and continued his lifelong activity in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics on the local and statewide level.

== Publications ==
Bradley was the author of many articles and several books, including ''P.T. Forsyth: The Man and His Work'', ''The Meaning of Christian Values Today'', ''Introduction to Comparative Religion'', and ''Siam Then: The Foreign Colony in Bangkok Before and After Anna''. He was the coauthor of ''Thailand: Domino By Default?''  He remained active in ministry throughout his career, performing weddings and funerals for several generations of friends and family in the several communities he and Paula called home.

Bradley died in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] at Havenwood-Heritage Heights Health Services Center on April 29, 2007, of complications from [[Alzheimer's Disease]].

'''The World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) of UNESCO, is a Programme Office on Global Water Assessment. 
It was founded in 2000 in response to a call from the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) to produce a UN system-wide periodic global overview of the status (quantity and quality), use and management of freshwater resources. To meet this challenge, WWAP coordinates the work of 31 UN-Water members, and 38 international partners under the umbrella mechanism of [http://www.unwater.org UN-Water], in the production of the World Water Development Report (WWDR). The WWDR is the UN flagship report on water issues; it is a comprehensive review that gives an overall picture of the state, use and management of the world’s freshwater resources and aims to provide decision-makers with tools to formulate and implement sustainable water policies.
The WWDR is released every year with a different focus on different strategic water issues, and it is a comprehensive review that gives an overall picture of the state of freshwater resources around the world, with the aim of providing managers and key decisions-makers with the information, data, tools and skills necessary to enable them to effectively participate in the development of policies. Consequently, WWAP aims to equip water managers and policy- and decision-makers with knowledge, tools and skills necessary to formulate and implement sustainable water policies.


==Background==
The growing global [[water crisis]] threatens the security, stability and environmental sustainability of developing but also [[developed nation]]s. Millions die each year from [[water-borne disease]]s, while [[water pollution]] and [[ecosystem destruction]] aggravate, particularly in the developing world. Over the past few decades there has been an increasing acceptance that the [[water resource management|management of water resources]] must be undertaken with an integrated approach, that assessment of the resource is of fundamental importance as the basis for decision-making and that national capacities to undertake necessary assessments must be fully supported. Management decisions to alleviate poverty, to allow [[economic development]], to ensure [[food security]] and the health of human populations as well as preserve vital ecosystems, must be based on our best possible understanding of all relevant systems.
In 1998, the Sixth Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development stated that there was a need for regular, global assessments on the status of freshwater resources. In response to this recommendation, the member organizations of UN-Water (known then as the ACC Subcommittee on Water Resources) decided to undertake a collective UN system-wide continuing assessment process. Founded in 2000, the World Water Assessment Programme coordinates the production of the UN World Water Development Report (WWDR), to report on the status of global freshwater resources Initially the periodicity and coverage of the Report was triennial and comprehensive, but in 2012, UN-Water changed this for it to have an annual periodicity and being theme oriented with as purpose to sharpen the focus of the Report on strategic water issues and become more topical. 
Recent and future key themes addressed by the WWDRs are: 
* [[Water and energy nexus]] (WWDR 2014); 
* Water and the dimensions of [[sustainable development]] (WWDR 2015); 
* Water and jobs, (youth) unemployment, [[green growth]] (WWDR 2016); 
* [[Wastewater management]], [[circular economy]] (WWDR 2017); 
* Nature-based solutions for water, including [[ecosystems protection]], green/grey infrastructures and [[traditional knowledge]] (WWDR 2018); 
* Leaving no one behind, including migration, [[gender equality]], [[hydro-politics]], livelihoods, vulnerable groups (WWDR 2019); and 
* [[Water and climate]], resilience and adaptation (WWDR 2020).

==Mission and Objectives==
This UNESCO programme aims to equip water managers and policy- and decision-makers with knowledge, tools and skills necessary to formulate and implement sustainable water policies.
The Programme's objectives are to:
*Monitor, assess and report on the world's freshwater resources and ecosystems, water use and management, and identify critical issues and problems;
*Help countries develop their own assessment capacity;
*Raise awareness on current and imminent/future water related challenges to influence the global water agenda;
*Inform and respond to the needs of decision-makers and water resource managers;
*Support anticipatory decision-making on the global water system including the identification of alternative futures;
*Promote gender equality;
*Measure progress towards achieving sustainable use of water resources through robust indicators and;
*Identify the progress made globally as well as by specific regions in the realization of international commitments such as the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs).

To face the challenge of providing a global water assessment, WWAP produces the World Water Development Report, the UN  flagship  report on water issues, released every year, to give an overall picture of the state of water resources. Through a series of assessments the Report provide a mechanism for monitoring changes in the resource and its management and tracking progress towards achieving different targets.

The basis for the Report springs from the UN Millenium Declaration of 2000, where the international community pledged to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach, afford safe drinking water and to stop the unsustainable exploitation of water resources by developing water management strategies at local, regional and global level. In 2015, many countries adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): a large part of them is dependent upon the access to safe and sufficient water.
As such, the World Water Development Report is part of an ongoing worldwide assessment project that is taking stock of past actions, present challenges and future opportunities in order to provide the information needed for efficient and effective capacity-building throughout the world. For this reason, the WWDR is targeted to all those involved in the formulation and implementation of water-related policies and investment strategies, as well as to professionals at all levels.

One of the key objectives of the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) is to help countries improve their self-assessment capability by building on existing strengths and experiences.
WWAP fulfils this mission by assisting in the preparation of case studies in countries around the world in order to highlight the state of water resources where different physical, climatic and socio-economic conditions prevail. In this regard, case studies show the diversity of circumstances and different human needs. The second purpose of the case studies is to highlight the challenges that need to be addressed in the water resources sector. In the process, the skills and experience of both local water professionals and policy-makers are engaged and enhanced.
The World Water Assessment Programme is both global and local in scale, for it must check the accuracy of the big picture on the basis of snapshots of water in the field. In the global strategy to improve the overall quality of water resources, local actions often present the starting point the most fruitful efforts. The WWAP case studies aim to provide a snapshot of those efforts while showing the significance of the decisions taken at local, sub-national and national levels.
The lessons learned, from both successes and failures, may be shared with other countries interested in addressing such issues.

'''[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/water/wwap/sdg-6-synthesis-report/ SDG 6 – Synthesis Report]''' 

The SDG 6 Synthesis Report  aims to provide an overview of the status of SDG 6 implementation at the global and regional levels, as well as some comprehensive information about how SDG 6 is interlinked to other SDG targets and indicators of the Agenda 2030 and the overall sustainability challenges that nations around the world are faced with. By summarizing the progress towards the achievement of SDG 6, this report will provide Member States with the ‘big picture’ on water and sanitation issues, outlining ways to accelerate progress towards this goal. Lessons learned and win-win solutions by which more than one SDG is benefited from SDG 6-related actions, as well as trade-offs and the potential implication of policies adopted by countries will be highlighted. This will enable countries to develop a roadmap towards a more sustainable development, for which water is critical in many regards.
The World Water Assessment Programme coordinates a Task Force to Produce the SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018, composed by some UN-Water members, such as CEO Water Mandate, FAO, ILO, UN-Habitat, UN-Water Technical Advisory Unit (TAU), UNDP, UNECE, UNEP, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNU, WHO, WMO and World Bank.

Starting from the challenges of the WWDR, WWAP also focuses on Capacity Development, providing training and courses, such as the “Capacity Development Training Programme on Water and Sustainable Development” to supply tools to strengthen institutional capacity and the effectiveness of water (and water-related) governmental agencies and enhance countries’ capacity to deal with often complex water issues. The training modules focus on issues pertaining the realization of SDG 6 on Water and Sanitation, such as Data and Information regarding water management, the 'Water – Food – Energy and Environment nexus', adapting to extreme water-related events, integrated water resources management, and planning sustainable urban water infrastructure.

'''[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/water/wwap/water-and-gender/ Water and Gender]'''
 
In 2014 WWAP has started a ground-breaking project on gender-sensitive water assessment, monitoring and reporting, with a goal to demonstrate how water is a gendered issue. Although women play a key role in the provision, management and safeguarding on water, gender inequality persist on the globe. The Advisor Group on Gender Equality founded in 2010, developed a series of indicators for the collection of sex-disaggregated water data, which are contained/included in the “Toolkits”, with the aim of addressing the considerable data gap on gender and water issues at the global level. The project developed a methodology using the indicators with the aim of advocating for the implementation of gender-sensitive water monitoring in the post-2015 agenda and, in particular, in the monitoring framework of the SDGs.
