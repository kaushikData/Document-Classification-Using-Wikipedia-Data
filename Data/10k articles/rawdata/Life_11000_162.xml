[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A. Böhmer und sein Nachlass.'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-05-004498-9}}. (''Schriften der Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"''),  p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She stated to ''Focus'' that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970/&gt; At the time of the interview with ''Focus'', she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name=Telg10424957&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10424957/Art-experts-demand-Germany-releases-list-of-1-billion-Nazi-art-trove.html | title=Art experts demand Germany releases list of €1-billion Nazi art trove | work=The Telegraph | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Alexander, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/bern-fine-arts-museum_gurlitt-exhibition-attracts-droves-of-visitors/43793524| title = Gurlitt exhibition attracts droves of visitors| date = January 2, 2018| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A.I. Artificial Intelligence''''', also known as '''''A.I.''''', is a 2001 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[drama film]] co-written, co-produced, and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], co-written by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]], and based on the 1969 short story "[[Supertoys Last All Summer Long]]" by [[Brian Aldiss]]. It was co-produced by [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Bonnie Curtis]], and stars [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], and [[William Hurt]]. Set in a futuristic post-[[climate change]] society, ''A.I.'' tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike [[Android (robot)|android]] uniquely programmed with the ability to love.

Development of ''A.I.'' originally began with producer-director [[Stanley Kubrick]], after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, [[Bob Shaw]], Ian Watson, and [[Sara Maitland]]. The film languished in protracted [[development (film)|development]] for years, partly because Kubrick felt [[computer-generated imagery]] was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed ''A.I.'' to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's [[film treatment]] for the screenplay.

''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' divided critics, with the overall balance being positive, and grossed approximately $235 million. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (by [[John Williams]]). In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, the film was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |work=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=31 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |archivedate=January 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In the late 22nd century, [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] from [[global warming]] have wiped out coastal cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Venice]], and [[New York City|New York]] and drastically reduced the world's population. A new type of robots called Mecha, advanced humanoids capable of thought and emotion, have been created.

David, a Mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for his owners, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin, after contracting a rare disease, has been placed in [[suspended animation]] and not expected to recover. Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear that belonged to Martin.

Martin is cured of his disease and brought home. As he recovers, he grows jealous of David. He tricks David into entering the parents's bedroom at night and cutting off a lock of Monica's hair. This upsets the parents, particularly Henry, who fears David intended to injure them.

At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, activating David's self-protection programming. David grabs Martin and they fall into the pool. Martin is saved from drowning, but Henry persuades Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. Instead, she abandons David and Teddy in the forest. She warns David to avoid all humans, and tells him to find other unregistered Mecha who can protect him.

David is captured for an anti-Mecha "Flesh Fair", where obsolete, unlicensed Mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds. David is placed on a platform with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder. Before the pair can be destroyed with acid, the crowd, thinking David is a real boy, begins booing and throwing things at the show's emcee. In the chaos, David and Joe escape. They set out to find the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]], whom David remembers from ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', and who David believes can turn him into a real boy, allowing Monica to love him and take him home.

Joe and David make their way to the decadent [[resort town]] of Rouge City, where "Dr. Know", a [[Holography|holographic]] answer engine, directs them to the top of [[Rockefeller Center]] in the flooded ruins of [[Manhattan]]. There, David meets a copy of himself and destroys it. He then meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells David that he was built in the image of the professor's dead son David. David finds more copies of him, as well as female versions called Darlene, that have been made there.

Disheartened, David lets himself fall from a ledge of the building. He is rescued by Joe, flying an amphibicopter he has stolen from the police who were pursuing him. David tells Joe he saw the Blue Fairy underwater, and wants to go down to meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities, who snare him with an [[electromagnet]]. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to dive down to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue at the now-sunken [[Coney Island]]. The two become trapped when the [[Wonder Wheel]] falls on their vehicle. David repeatedly asks the Fairy to turn him into a real boy. Eventually the ocean freezes and David's power source is depleted.

Two thousand years later, humans are extinct, and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced silicon-based form called Specialists. They find David and Teddy, and discover they are original Mecha who knew living humans, making them special.

The Specialists revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David's memories to reconstruct the Swinton home. David asks the Specialists if they can make him human, but they cannot. However, he insists they recreate Monica from [[DNA]] from the lock of her hair, which Teddy has kept. The Mecha warn David that the clone can live for only a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.

==Cast==

==Production==

===Development===
Kubrick began development on an adaptation of "[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]" in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a [[film treatment]]. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Scott Brake |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |title=Spielberg Talks About the Genesis of ''A.I.'' |work=[[IGN]] |date=May 10, 2001 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N3Xvgw8?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to co-finance ''A.I.'' and cover distribution duties.&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]], and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989.&lt;ref name=connect&gt;{{Cite news |author=Steven Gaydos |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |title=The Kubrick Connection |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N47xlcn?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Shaw]] briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, "Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead." Kubrick handed Watson ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' for inspiration, calling ''A.I.'' "a [[picaresque]] robot version of ''[[Pinocchio]]''".&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Dana Haris |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |title=Spielberg lines up ''A.I.'', ''Report'' |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N4NHRKf?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on ''A.I.'' in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] Mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, "I guess we lost the [[toyetic|kiddie market]]."&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped ''A.I.'' to work on a film adaptation of ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', feeling [[computer animation]] was not advanced enough to create the David character. However, after the release of Spielberg's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', with its innovative computer-generated imagery, it was announced in November 1993 that production of ''A.I.'' would begin in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Christian Moerk |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |title=''A.I.'' next for Kubrick at Warners |date=November 2, 1993 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 7, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N6Bv8HO?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Muren]] and Ned Gorman, who worked on ''Jurassic Park'', became [[visual effects supervisor]]s,&lt;ref name=connect/&gt; but Kubrick was displeased with their [[previsualization]], and with the expense of hiring [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

===Pre-production===
In early 1994, the film was in [[pre-production]] with [[Christopher "Fangorn" Baker]] as [[concept art]]ist, and [[Sara Maitland]] assisting on the story, which gave it "a feminist fairy-tale focus".&lt;ref name=Ian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703134444/http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-03 |title=Plumbing Stanley Kubrick |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as ''A.I.'', but as ''Pinocchio''.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-18 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Cunningham]] became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for ''A.I.'' can be seen on the DVD, ''[[The Work of Director Chris Cunningham]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feature by Matt Bailey |url=http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719222500/http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-19 |title=notcoming.com &amp;#124; The Work of Director Chris Cunningham |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had [[Joseph Mazzello]] do a [[screen test]] for the lead role.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; Cunningham helped assemble a series of "little robot-type humans" for the David character. "We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing," producer Jan Harlan reflected. "But it was a total failure, it looked awful." [[Hans Moravec]] was brought in as a technical consultant.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;
Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought ''A.I.'' would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117799373 |title=A.I.

The film's [[soundtrack]] was released by [[Warner Sunset Records]] in 2001. The original [[Film score|score]] was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and featured singers [[Lara Fabian]] on two songs and [[Josh Groban]] on one.

===Marketing===
Warner Bros. used an [[alternate reality game]] titled ''[[The Beast (game)|The Beast]]'' to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org) including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]] that followed the storyline of ''The Beast'', but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking ''A.I.'' for a [[family film]], no action figures were created, although [[Hasbro]] released a talking Teddy following the film's release in June 2001.&lt;ref name=find/&gt;

''A.I.'' had its [[premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rooney|first=David|title='Dust' in the wind for Venice fest|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|website=Variety|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2017-04-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030032135/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|archivedate=October 30, 2008|date=April 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] by [[Warner Home Video]] on March 5, 2002 in both a standard full-screen release with no bonus features, and as a 2-Disc Special Edition featuring the film in its original 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format as well as an eight-part documentary detailing the film's development, production, music and visual effects. The bonus features also included interviews with [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[John Williams]], two teaser trailers for the film's original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production sills and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s original storyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/a-i-artificial-intelligence|title=A.I.

The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on April 5, 2011 by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] for the U.S. and by [[Warner Home Video]] for international markets. This release featured the film a newly restored high-definition print and incorporated all the bonus features previously included on the 2-Disc Special Edition [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/AI-Artificial-Intelligence-Blu-ray/8686/|title=A.I.

===Critical response===
Based on 192 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 73% of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism. ''A.I.'' is, in a word, fascinating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ai_artificial_intelligence/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708094802/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ai_artificial_intelligence/ |dead-url=no |archive-date=July 8, 2008 |title=A.I.

There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |title=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE &amp;#124; The mind behind AI |work=BBC News |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021220659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |archivedate=October 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,130942,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072644/http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0%2C8599%2C130942%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 26, 2008 |title=''A.I.''&amp;nbsp;– Spielberg's Strange Love&amp;nbsp;– ''TIME'' |date=June 17, 2001 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars, saying that it was "wonderful and maddening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amp/ai-artificial-intelligence-2001 |title=A.I.

[[Mick LaSalle]] gave a largely negative review. "''A.I.'' exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." Dubbing it Spielberg's "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the "useless" [[Jar Jar Binks]], yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |authorlink=Mick LaSalle |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/29/DD239232.DTL |title=Artificial foolishness |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67p5z3LQ2?url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2001%2F06%2F29%2FDD239232.DTL |archivedate=May 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2013}} [[Peter Travers]] gave a mixed review, concluding "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future."

In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/ai.html |title=Review: A.I |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] has speculated, "Worldwide, ''A.I.'' was very successful (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the [[alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]]-style beings in the final 20 minutes were [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |title=Author Talk: Ian Watson |publisher=Moon Milk Review |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67nCJehg6?url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |archivedate=May 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Spielberg told film critic [[Joe Leydon]] that "People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film&amp;nbsp;– all the stuff in the house&amp;nbsp;– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of ''A.I.'', not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leydon |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Leydon |url=http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |title='Minority Report' looks at the day after tomorrow&amp;nbsp;-- and is relevant to today &lt;!-- Apparently accidental typos in quoted refs should be "silently" repaired. --&gt; |work=Moving Picture Show |date=June 20, 2002 |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815010940/http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |archivedate=August 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1466">'''Abraham ibn Akra''' or '''Abraham ben Solomon Akra''' was a [[Jewish-Italian]] scholar and editor of scientific works who lived at the end of the 16th century. He edited the work ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090916041810/http://hebrewbooks.org/7049 Me-Harere Nemerim]'' (Venice, 1599), a collection of several methodological essays and commentaries on various [[Talmudic]] treatises. Akra is the author of a methodological treatise on the ''[[Midrash Rabbot]],'' which [[Isaiah Horowitz]] (של"ה) embodied in his work ''Shene Luḥot ha-Berit'' (ed. Amsterdam, p.&amp;nbsp;411), without credit. The same thing occurs in the [[Vilna]] edition of the ''Midrash Rabbot,'' where Akra's treatise is reproduced from the ''Shene Luḥot ha-Berit.'' Akra's work appeared originally as an appendix to the ''Arze Lebanon,'' a collection of [[kabalistic]] essays, Venice, 1601. Abraham makes there the interesting statement that he saw in Egypt the manuscript of the ''[[Midrash Abkir]].'' This is the last trace of the existence of that small ''midrash.''

'''Alexios V Doukas''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀλέξιος Ε[[ʹ]] Δούκας}}; {{abbr|d.|Died}}&amp;nbsp;December 1204), in Latinised spelling '''Alexius V Ducas''', was [[Byzantine emperor]] from 5 February to 12 April 1204, during the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|second and final siege]] of [[Constantinople]] by the participants of the [[Fourth Crusade]]. His family name was [[Doukas]], but he was also known by the nickname '''Mourtzouphlos''' or '''Murtzuphlus''' ({{lang|grc|Μούρτζουφλος}}), referring to either bushy, overhanging [[eyebrow]]s or a sullen, gloomy character.&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, p. 307, (see also: Head, p. 238) says that Alexios Doukas gained the name 'Mourtzouphlos' in his youth from his companions on account of his eyebrows meeting and overhanging his eyes.&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved power through a [[palace coup]], killing his predecessors in the process. Though he made vigorous attempts to defend Constantinople from the crusader army, his military efforts proved ineffective. His actions won the support of the mass of the populace, but he alienated the elite of the city. Following the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|fall]], sack, and occupation of the city, Alexios V was [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] by another ex-emperor and later executed by the new [[Latin Empire|Latin regime]]. He was the last Byzantine emperor to rule in Constantinople until the Byzantine [[recapture of Constantinople]] in 1261.

==Origins and character==
Though possessing the name of a leading Byzantine aristocratic family, there is very little definitely known concerning the ancestry of Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos. The noble [[Doukas (Byzantine family)|Doukas]] clan were not the only Doukai, as the surname was also employed by many families of humble origins. It has been claimed that Alexios Doukas was a great-great-grandson of the emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1081|1118}}) in the female line ([[cognatic]] descent). This is not improbable, as all other Byzantine emperors, and the majority of attempted usurpers, of the period had a connection with the former imperial house of the [[Komnenoi]], either by descent or marriage. A more precise theory has been proposed, that he was the son of an Isaac Doukas, and was the second cousin of [[Alexios IV Angelos]] ({{reign|1203|1204}}).&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; A letter sent to [[Pope Innocent III]], stated that Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos was 'a blood relation' of Alexios IV Angelos.&lt;ref&gt;Akropolites, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary historian [[Niketas Choniates]] was dismissed from office as [[Logothetes ton sekreton|logothete of the ''sekreta'']] by Mourtzouphlos. His assessment of the emperor's character might therefore be biased; however, Choniates allows that he was extremely clever by nature, though arrogant in his manner and lecherous.&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, pp. 311, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political intrigues and usurpation==
[[File:PriseDeConstantinople1204PalmaLeJeune.JPG|300px|thumb|The siege of Constantinople in 1204, by [[Palma il Giovane]]]]
The  participation of Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos in the attempted overthrow of [[Alexios III Angelos]] ({{reign|1195|1203}}) by [[John Komnenos the Fat]] in 1200 had led to his imprisonment. Mourtzouphlos was probably imprisoned from 1201 until the restoration to the throne of [[Isaac II Angelos]] ({{reign|1185|1195|1203|1204}}), the brother and predecessor of Alexios III. Isaac II, along with his son Alexios IV Angelos, were restored to the throne through the intervention of the leaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in July 1203. On release, Mourtzouphlos was invested with the court position of ''[[protovestiarios]]'' (head of the imperial finances). He had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of [[Eudokia Angelina]], a daughter of Alexios III.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, p. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of 1204, Isaac II and Alexios IV had inspired little confidence among the people of [[Constantinople]] with their efforts to protect the city from the [[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]] crusaders and their [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] allies, and the citizens were becoming restless. The crusaders were also losing patience with the emperors; they rioted and set fires in the city when the money and aid promised by Alexios IV was not forthcoming. The fires affected about a sixth of the area of Constantinople and may have made up to a third of the population homeless; the dislocation and desperation of those affected eventually sapped the will of the people to resist the crusaders. Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos emerged as a leader of the anti-Latin movement in the city. He won the approval of the populace by his valour in leading an attack on the Latins at "Trypetos Lithos"; in this clash his mount stumbled and he would have been killed or captured had a band of youthful archers from the city not defended him. Mourtzouphlos exploited the hatred of the people for the Latins to serve his personal ambition.&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, pp. 303–304, 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden (1995) p. 742&lt;/ref&gt;

The citizens of Constantinople rebelled in late January 1204, and in the chaos an otherwise obscure nobleman named [[Nicholas Kanabos]] was acclaimed emperor, though he was unwilling to accept the crown. The two co-emperors barricaded themselves in the [[Palace of Blachernae]] and entrusted Mourtzouphlos with a mission to seek help from the crusaders, or at least they informed him of their intentions. Instead of contacting the crusaders, Mourtzouphlos, on the night of 28–29 January 1204, used his access to the palace to bribe the "ax-bearers" (the [[Varangian Guard]]), and with their backing arrest the emperors. Choniates states that Mourtzouphlos, when bribing the guards, had the help of a eunuch with access to the imperial treasury. The support of the Varangians seems to have been of major importance in the success of the coup, though Mourtzouphlos also had help from his relations and associates. The young Alexios IV was eventually strangled in prison; while his father Isaac, both enfeebled and blind, died at around the time of the coup, his death variously attributed to fright, sorrow, or mistreatment. Kanabos, after refusing to take office under Alexios V, took sanctuary in the [[Hagia Sophia]], but was forcibly removed and killed on the steps of the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, pp. 307–309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, p. 118-120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor==
[[File:Gustave dore crusades mourzoufle parleying with dandolo.jpg|thumb|right|Alexios V negotiating with Doge Enrico Dandalo, by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
The timing of the deaths of the deposed emperors and of Kanabos, and their relation to the coronation of Alexios V are problematic. Alexios V appears to have been acclaimed emperor as early as the night he moved against the [[Angeloi]] co-emperors. Hendrickx and Matzukis suggest that Alexios V assumed the imperial insignia immediately, but was crowned later, possibly on 5 February. Finding the treasury empty, the new emperor confiscated money from the aristocracy and high officials to be put to public use. These actions endeared Alexios V to the citizens, but alienated his relations and other prominent supporters. Once in firm control, Alexios V closed the gates of the city to the crusaders and strengthened the [[Walls of Constantinople|fortifications]]. Sword in hand, he was active in leading attacks on sorties made by the crusaders in search of supplies. On 2 February, [[Henry of Flanders]] led a part of the crusader army to Filea (or Phileas), in order to obtain food supplies. As he returned towards Constantinople Alexios V attacked his rearguard. The Byzantines were defeated and the imperial standard and an important icon of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] (the ''[[Panagia]] Nikopoios'') were captured. The Byzantines lost some of their best soldiers in the clash, and Alexios V was lucky to escape alive. At about this time Alexios V attempted to destroy the crusader fleet with [[fire-ships]], but to little effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 120–122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, pp.311–312&lt;/ref&gt; 

The loss of the icon, traditionally seen as a physical embodiment of divine protection for the city, was a severe psychological blow. Its possession by the crusaders convinced many of the population of Constantinople that the victory of the Westerners was now divinely sanctioned, as a punishment for the sins of the Byzantines.&lt;ref&gt;Giarenis, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February Alexios V met the [[Doge of Venice]], [[Enrico Dandolo]], for peace talks. The conditions demanded by the Venetian, however, were too harsh for the Byzantines to consider. Choniates states that the meeting was brought to a close by an sudden attack by crusader cavalry on Alexios V and his entourage, the emperor narrowly escaping capture. According to Choniates, Alexios IV was killed the same day; the insistence by the crusaders that he be restored to the throne may have precipitated his death.&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, p.312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; When news of the death of Alexios IV reached the crusaders, relations between them and Alexios V deteriorated further. The forcible expulsion of all Latins resident in Constantinople in March seems to have been the tipping point which led the crusaders to begin actively negotiating amongst themselves regarding the [[Partitio Romaniae|partition]] of the Byzantine Empire. They also began to prepare for their final assault on the city, which took place the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fall of Constantinople, flight and death==
[[File:Alexius V Doukas.jpg|thumb|right|Alexios V Doukas, from a 15th-century Byzantine manuscript]]
The defenders of Constantinople held out against a crusader assault on 9 April. The crusaders' second attack three days later, however, proved too strong to repel. Breaking through the walls near the [[Petria Gate]], the crusaders entered the city and looted the Blachernae Palace. Alexios V attempted to rally the people to the defence of the city, but with no success. Alexios V then boarded a fishing boat and fled the city towards [[Thrace]] on the night of 12 April 1204, accompanied by Eudokia Angelina and her mother [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]]. In the Hagia Sophia [[Constantine Laskaris]] was acclaimed as emperor, but being unable to persuade the Varangians to continue the fight, in the early hours of 13 April he also fled, leaving Constantinople under crusader control.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 121–127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, p.p. 313-314&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexios V and his companions eventually reached [[Mosynopolis]], which had been occupied by the deposed emperor Alexios III Angelos and his followers. At first they were well received, with Alexios V marrying Eudokia Angelina. Later, however, Alexios III arranged for his new son-in-law to be made captive and [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]], thereby rendering him ineligible for the imperial throne. Having been abandoned by both his supporters and his father-in-law, Alexios V was captured near Mosynopolis, or possibly in [[Anatolia]], by the advancing Latins under [[Thierry de Loos]] in November 1204.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akropolites, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Constantinople as a prisoner, Alexios V was tried for treason against Alexios IV. In his trial the blind ex-emperor argued that it was Alexios IV who had committed treason to his country, through his intention to invite the crusaders to enter Constantinople in force. On being condemned, he was executed by novel means: he was thrown to his death from the top of the [[Column of Theodosius]].&lt;ref&gt;Choniates, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; The new, alien, Latin regime of conquerors in Constantinople may have viewed the public trial and execution of the man who murdered the last "legitimate emperor" as a way to cast an aura of legitimacy on themselves. Alexios V was the last Byzantine Emperor to reign in Constantinople before the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], which controlled the city for the next 57 years, until it was recovered by the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean Emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 127–131&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Alcott Hallett''' (August 4, 1975 &amp;ndash; March 29, 2009)&lt;ref name=LATObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Andy Hallett, actor appeared in 'Angel' dies at 33 |first=Andrew |last=Blankstein |first2=Michael |last2=Muskal |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2009 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-andy-hallett1-2009apr01,0,319761.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402131245/http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-andy-hallett1-2009apr01%2C0%2C319761.story |archivedate= 2 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] singer and actor who became known from playing the part of [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] in the television series ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' (2000–2004). He used his singing talents often on the show, and performed two songs on the series' 2005 soundtrack album, ''[[Angel: Live Fast, Die Never]]''.

==Early life==
Andrew Alcott Hallett was an only child. He was 6 foot 2&amp;nbsp;inches tall and hailed from the [[Cape Cod]] village of [[Osterville, Massachusetts]], which is part of the town of [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]]. He was a 1993 graduate from [[Barnstable High School]] and he went on to [[Assumption College]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20090402/News/904020317|title=Friends remember 'Angel' actor Andy Hallett|last=GOLD|first=ROBERT|newspaper=capecodtimes.com|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not begin singing publicly until he was invited onstage at a concert, and discovered the thrill of performing. He was in the audience at a [[Patti LaBelle]] concert, in [[Boston]], when she coaxed a group of guys onto the stage; "I'm this little white boy. I started singing, and we blew the house down. I sang a line and she said, 'This is a white boy with soul.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/04/01/andy_hallett_33_singer_known_for_tv_role_in_angel/ |title="Andy Hallett, 33, singer known for TV role in 'Angel,'" '&amp;#39;Boston Globe'&amp;#39;, Wednesday, April 1, 2009 |publisher=Boston.com |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After moving to [[Los Angeles]], Hallett worked as a runner for an agency and then as a property manager.  He eventually became a personal assistant to Kai Cole, wife of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' creator [[Joss Whedon]]. When the couple and their friends saw Hallett singing at the "B.B. Kings" lounge at [[Universal CityWalk]], Whedon conceived a new character for his new show ''Angel'': Lorne, an [[anagoge|anagogic]] demon who reads the hearts and futures of his guests as they sing in his [[karaoke]] bar.  Hallett was invited to try out for the part, and won it after three auditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton, Kristy and Ritchie, Jeff. [http://www.cityofangel.com/behindTheScenes/bts/andySpot.html "All This and Heaven Too"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905144947/http://www.cityofangel.com/behindTheScenes/bts/andySpot.html |date=September 5, 2008 }}, Andy Hallett interview, ''City of Angel'' magazine, December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angel'' was his first real job as an actor, though he did play an extra role in a 1999 episode of ''Buffy''; he acquired agent Pat Brady only after she spotted him singing and acting in "[[Judgment (Angel)|Judgment]]", the premiere episode of ''Angel'''s second season.&lt;ref name="Krug"&gt;Krug, Kurt Anthony. [http://www.mania.com/good-night-folks-andy-hallett-19752009_article_114182.html "Good Night, Folks" – Andy Hallett 1975-2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405094903/http://www.mania.com/good-night-folks-andy-hallett-19752009_article_114182.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}, ''Mania.com''. April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Lorne was featured as a [[recurring character]] in 45 episodes before Hallett was added to the title sequence as a series regular for the last nine episodes of the fourth season, and all of the fifth;&lt;ref name="Krug" /&gt; in total he appeared as Lorne in 76 of the show's 110 episodes. The character's demonic visage involved extensive [[prosthetic makeup]] and detailed coloring of his face, neck and hands, leading to early calls for at least two and a half hours of makeup before Hallett's filming day could begin.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;Andy Hallett Trivia. [https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0356468/trivia?ref_=m_nm_dyk_trv], ''IMDB.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the run of ''Angel'', Hallett appeared in two other small productions: ''The Enforcers'' (2001), a TV miniseries directed by ''Angel'' writer [[Mere Smith]], and ''[[Chance (2002 film)|Chance]]'' (2002), a film directed by ''Buffy'' actress [[Amber Benson]].

==Health complications and death==
According to a 2005 interview, about a month after filming the last episode of ''Angel'', Hallett suffered a dental infection which spread through the bloodstream to his heart, leading to a case of [[cardiomyopathy]], for which he spent five days in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

, ''Official UK Angel Magazine Issue #23'', June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he recovered, his heart muscle and valves were weakened and he found himself easily fatigued afterward. He did not return to acting (except for a voice part in the animated film ''Geppetto's Secret''), but pursued his music career and frequently appeared at media conventions for ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' and for science fiction and fantasy in general.&lt;ref&gt;Schou, Solvej [http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/news/bal-andy-hallett-0401,0,1999694.story "Actor from 'Angel' Dies at 33 of heart disease"], Associated Press, Wednesday, April 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after first experiencing heart problems, and after at least three additional hospitalizations, Hallett died from [[congestive heart failure]] on March 29, 2009 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles with his father by his bedside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Borzillo-Vrenna|first=Carrie|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b106789_angel_star_andy_hallett_dies_of_heart.html|title=Angel Star Andy Hallett Dies of Heart Failure|work=[[E!

==Legacy==
The character of Lorne continued on in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'', and a 48-page book about the character was written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].  Chris Ryall of [[IDW Publishing]] said, "the issue serves as a tribute to Andy as well as a final send-off for Lorne, too."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ryalltime.blogspot.com/2009/12/lornes-final-song.html Lorne's final song]", RyallTime blog, Wednesday, December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Birth trauma''' (BT) refers to damage of the tissues and organs of a newly delivered child, often as a result of physical pressure or trauma during [[childbirth]]. The term also encompasses the long term consequences, often of a cognitive nature, of damage to the brain or cranium.&lt;ref&gt;V.V.Vlasyuk Birth trauma and perinatal disorders of cerebral circulation. St. Petersburg, "Nestor History, 2009 - 252 p. {{ISBN|978-5-98187-373-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical study of birth trauma dates to the 16th century, and the morphological consequences of mishandled delivery are described in Renaissance-era medical literature. Birth injury occupies a unique area of concern and study in the medical canon. In [[ICD-10]] "birth trauma" occupied 49 individual codes (P10-Р15).

However, there are often clear distinctions to be made between brain damage caused by birth trauma and that induced by [[intrauterine asphyxia]]. It is also crucial to distinguish between "birth trauma" and "birth injury". Birth injuries encompass any systemic damages incurred during delivery ([[Intrauterine hypoxia|hypoxic]], [[toxic]], [[biochemical]], infection factors, etc.), but "birth trauma" focuses largely on mechanical damage. [[Caput succedaneum]], [[subcutaneous hemorrhage]]s, small [[subperiostal hemorrhage]]s, hemorrhages along the displacements of cranial bones, [[intradural bleeding]]s, [[subcapsular haematoma]]s of [[liver]], are among the more commonly reported birth injuries.  Birth trauma, on the other hand, encompasses the enduring side effects of physical birth injuries, including the ensuing compensatory and adaptive mechanisms and the development of pathological processes ([[pathogenesis]]) after the damage.

==Signs and symptoms==
Sequelae can occur in both the mother and the infant after a traumatic birth.

Birth trauma is uncommon in the Western world in relation to rates in the third world. In the West injury occurs in 1.1% of C-sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander JM, Leveno KJ, Hauth J |title=Fetal injury associated with cesarean delivery|journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=885–90 |date=October 2006|pmid=17012450 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000237116.72011.f3 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
*Cephalo-pelvic disproportion,
*the quick and rapid delivery,
*delayed and prolonged delivery,
*the abnormal birth position,
* [[Asynclitic birth]] (asinclitismus),
*abnormal fetal attitude (extensor inserting head),
*obstetric turn,
*acceleration and stimulation of the birth,
*breech presentation,
*forceps and vacuum extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Demissie K, Rhoads GG, Smulian JC |title=Operative vaginal delivery and neonatal and infant adverse outcomes: population based retrospective analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7456 |pages=24–9 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15231617 |pmc=443446 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7456.24 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While any number of injuries may occur during the birthing process.  A number of specific conditions are well described.  [[Brachial plexus injury|Brachial plexus palsy]] occurs in 0.4 to 5.1 infants per 1000 live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersen J, Watt J, Olson J, Van Aerde J |title=Perinatal brachial plexus palsy |journal=Paediatr Child Health |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=93–100 |date=February 2006 |pmid=19030261 |pmc=2435328 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head trauma and brain damage during delivery can lead to a number of conditions include: [[caput succedaneum]], [[cephalohematoma]], [[subgaleal hemorrhage]],  [[subdural hemorrhage]], [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], [[epidural hemorrhage]], and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]].

The most common fracture during delivery is that of the [[clavicle]] (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beall MH, Ross MG |title=Clavicle fracture in labor: risk factors and associated morbidities |journal=J Perinatol |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=513–5 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11774010 |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7210594 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bryan Joseph Law''' (1954–2013) was an Australian [[peace activist]] who became well-known after breaking into [[Pine Gap]] in 2005&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lawreport/the-pine-gap-4/3257796|title=The Pine Gap 4|author=|date=31 March 2008|website=Radio National|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a passive protest against the [[Iraq War]], and again for breaking into a military base at [[Rockhampton]] in 2011&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-0Du_F1P1w&amp;list=UUtGP9NY6qbdkw3TEnbUzpIQ&amp;index=11|title=Rocky Tiger Ploughshares - Action.|first=|last=Peace Convergence YouTube Video|date=20 December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hammering a hole in a military helicopter prevent it from operating. Law and his wife Margaret Pestorius coordinated the Cairns Peace by Peace organisation.&lt;ref name="cairnspeacebypeace.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairnspeacebypeace.org/|title=Peace by Peace – We aren't gunna study war no more!|author=|date=|website=www.cairnspeacebypeace.org|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law also disrupted logging activities on the [[World Heritage site]] [[Fraser Island]].

==Early life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Law was born in 1954 in the [[Brisbane]] suburb of Moorooka. Both his parents served in the army during World War II, His father in [[New Guinea]] and his mother in [[Townsville]]. Law attended [[Yeronga State School|Yeronga State High School]], excelling in the sciences. He attended the [[University of Queensland]], studying chemistry briefly before dropping out. He then worked briefly for the Education Department as a clerk. He subsequently drove taxis for 15 years in Cairns. In his thirties Law returned to Griffith University to study history and politics with a special interest in Asia and Pacific history and regional militarism. He was a campus activist and became President of the Student Union.

==Activism==
Law was radicalised during the government of [[Joh Bjelke Petersen]] and was first arrested at a large right to march street demonstration in Brisbane. He was arrested more than 30 times. Law blogged widely. He had ambitions to become a lawyer but felt he came from the wrong class at the wrong time. He revelled in the intellectual stimulation offered by the court room process. He was acknowledged by judges, barristers and adversaries as an honourable challenger. [[Ciaron O'Reilly|Ciaron O’Reilly]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the thousands arrested and bashed during that period, some of us remained "beat up but upbeat" turning towards, exploring and sustaining nonviolent resistance against war and war preparations. As some turned towards the U.S. traditions of the Catholic Worker and Berrigans, Law turned to a deep exploration of Gandhi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his later years the [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker tradition]] also influenced Law’s approach to nonviolence.

Between 1982 and the mid-2000s, Law worked on a range of campaigns and was judged by colleagues{{who|date=May 2016}} as the "foremost nonviolence strategist in Australia."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He applied nonviolence theory and techniques to local, regional and national projects. Campaigns he was involved with included [[Indigenous rights|Aboriginal rights]], which he initially explored in relation to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. He lived on Fraser Island during the blockade to interrupt logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdiary.com.au/cms/?q=node/858|title=Webdiary - Founded and Inspired by Margo Kingston - Webdiary - Independent, Ethical, Accountable and Transparent|author=|date=|website=webdiary.com.au|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in local issues such as improving bicycle facilities, the  Cairns Yacht Club and most recently the "Save City Place" campaign in Cairns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/10/16/10631_print-version.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a keen interest in opposing militarism and this became his primary passion. As an antimilitarist activist he first opposed visits of US and UK warships to Australia during the Bicentennial. It was during this time he started to explore the power of small group nonviolence. He teamed up with fellow nonviolent activist Margaret Pestorius and they followed their shared passion of educating ordinary people about the practice of nonviolence. With the  Cairns Peace by Peace group they began citizens' inspections of visiting US warships at a time when Law considered Australia was in a state of perpetual war.&lt;ref name="cairnspeacebypeace.org"/&gt; In 2005 he entered Pine Gap spy base near Alice Springs with three other people from Christians Against All Terrorism. This action was a turning point in Law's pursuit of more powerful types of activity and ultimately led to his His work culminated fittingly{{how|date=May 2016}} in the regional Queensland town of Rockhampton at a time when most{{who|date=May 2016}} looked toward Canberra and Washington for political change. decision to conduct a  ploughshare type action in Rockhampton during the 2011 Talisman Sabre Exercises.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

== Personal life ==
During the court case in Alice Springs in 2007 he probably{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} had his first heart attack and his health declined consistently from that point. He struggled with diabetes and heart disease and their consequences.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Law and Margaret Pestorius had a son, Joseph.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

|date=2011 |title=Surviving a Disaster}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''business continuity and resiliency planning''') is the process of creating systems of prevention and recovery to deal with potential threats to a company.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, D.; Swartz, E.; Herbane, B. (1999) Just waiting for the next big bang: business continuity planning in the UK finance sector. Journal of Applied Management Studies, Vol. 8, No, pp. 43–60. Here: p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any event that could negatively impact operations is included in the plan, such as [[supply chain]] interruption, loss of or damage to critical infrastructure (major machinery or computing /network resource). As such, BCP is a [[subset]] of [[risk management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flevy.com/blog/business-continuity-planning/|title=Business Continuity Planning|last=Intrieri|first=Charles|date=10 September 2013|publisher=Flevy|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, government entities refer to the process as ''continuity of operations planning'' (COOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/guidance-directives|title=Guidance &amp; Directives - FEMA.gov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Business Continuity Plan outlines a range of disaster scenarios and the steps the business will take in any particular scenario to return to regular trade. BCP's are written ahead of time and can also include precautions to be put in place. Usually created with the input of key staff as well as stakeholders, a BCP is a set of contingencies to minimize potential harm to businesses during adverse scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Continuity Planning (BCP) for Businesses of all Sizes|url=http://www.williamadvisorygroup.com/business-continuity-planning-bcp-for-businesses-of-all-sizes/|date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The analysis phase consists of impact analysis, threat analysis and impact scenarios.

Quantifying of loss ratios must also include "dollars to defend a lawsuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.jcrcny.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/EmergencyManual.2.0.pdf
|title=Emergency Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that a dollar spent in loss prevention can prevent "seven dollars of disaster-related economic loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |website=RI.gov

===Business impact analysis (BIA)===
{{main |Disaster recovery#IT Service Continuity}}
A Business impact analysis (BIA) differentiates critical (urgent) and non-critical (non-urgent) organization functions/activities. A function may be considered critical if dictated by law. 

For each function, two values are assigned:
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO) – the acceptable latency of data that will not be recovered. For example, is it acceptable for the company to lose 2 days of data?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last1=May|first1=Richard|title=Finding RPO and RTO
|url=http://www.virtualdcs.co.uk/blog/business-continuity-planning-rpo-and-rto.html|deadurl=yes
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224604/http://www.virtualdcs.co.uk/blog/business-continuity-planning-rpo-and-rto.html|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recovery point objective must ensure that the maximum tolerable data loss for each activity is not exceeded.
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO)&amp;nbsp; – the acceptable amount of time to restore the function.
The recovery time objective must ensure that the [[Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption]] (MTPoD) for each activity is not exceeded.

===Threat and risk analysis (TRA)===
After defining recovery requirements, each potential threat may require unique recovery steps. Common threats include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|
* [[Epidemic]]
* [[Earthquake]]
* Fire
* [[Flood]]
* [[Hacker (computer security)|Cyber attack]]
* [[Sabotage]] (insider or external threat)
* [[Hurricane]] or other major storm
* [[Power outage]]
* Water outage (supply interruption, contamination)
* Telecomms outage
* IT outage
* [[Terrorism]]/[[Piracy]]
* [[War]]/civil disorder
* Theft (insider or external threat, vital information or material)
* Random failure of mission-critical systems
* Single point dependency
}}
The above areas can cascade: Responders can stumble. During the 2002-2003 [[SARS]] outbreak, some organizations compartmentalized and rotated teams to match the [[incubation period]] of the disease. They also banned in-person contant during both business and non-business hours. This increased [[Resilience (organizational)|resiliency]] against the threat.

===Impact scenarios===
'''Impact scenarios''' are identified and documented:
* need for medical supplies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527309003582%26hl=en%26sa=X%26scisig=AAGBfm1Nte-MBwST_OAdiA9sQGGOy67KHQ%26nossl=1%26oi=scholarr

These should reflect the widest possible damage.

==Tiers of preparedness==
[[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]]'s seven tiers of [[disaster recovery]]&lt;ref&gt;developed by SHARE's Technical Steering Committee, working with IBM&lt;/ref&gt; released in 1992, were updated in 2012 by IBM as an eight tier model:&lt;ref name=IBM.2012&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://share.confex.com/share/118/webprogram/Handout/Session10387/Session%2010387%20Business%20Continuity%20Soloution%20Selection%20Methodology%2003-7-2012.pdf
|title=A Business Continuity Solution Selection Methodology |publisher=IBM Corp.
|author=Ellis Holman  |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tier 0''' - Nothing off-site... "recovery time .. unpredictable ..." - possibly not possible.
* '''Tier 1''' - What IBM calls "PTAM (Pickup Truck Access Method)" - but a hot site (backup hardware).
* '''Tier 2''' - Hot site - will require hours or even days to load the most recent backup tapes.
* '''Tier 3''' - Transaction data at the off-site is kept relatively current via an ongoing high-speed data link (electronic vaulting) and "an automated tape library at the remote site."
* '''Tier 4''' - "Point-in-time copies" so that less reprocessing of transactions will be needed.
* '''Tier 5''' - "Transaction integrity" - the hot site is kept as up-to-the-moment as possible.
* '''Tier 6''' - "Zero or Near-zero data loss" 
* '''Tier 7''' - "Highly automated" recovery - few if any manual steps following a main site failure; rollover to running at the hot site is automatic.

==Solution design==
Two main requirements from the impact analysis stage are:
* For IT: the minimum application and data requirements and the time in which they must be available.
* Outside IT: preservation of hard copy (such as contracts). A process plant must consider skilled staff and embedded technology. 

This phase overlaps with [[Disaster recovery|disaster recovery planning]].

The solution phase determines:
* [[crisis management]] command structure
* telecommunication architecture between primary and secondary work sites
* [[data replication]] methodology between primary and secondary work sites
* [[Backup site]] - applications, data and work space required at the secondary work site

==Current British standards==
In December 2006, the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] (BSI) released an independent standard for BCP—BS 25999-1. Prior to the introduction of [[BS 25999]], BCP professionals relied on information security standard [[BS 7799]], which only peripherally addressed BCP to improve an organization's information security procedures. BS 25999's applicability extends to all organizations. In 2007, the BSI published BS 25999-2 "Specification for Business Continuity Management", which specifies requirements for implementing, operating and improving a documented business continuity management system (BCMS).

In 2008 the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] launched a specific standard connected and supporting the Business Continuity Standard [[BS 25999]] titled BS25777 specifically to align computer  continuity with business continuity. This was withdrawn following the publication in March 2011 of ISO/IEC 27031 - Security techniques — Guidelines for information and communication technology readiness for business continuity.

[[ITIL|ITIL®]] has defined some of these terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=ITIL® glossary and abbreviations |url=https://www.axelos.com/glossaries-of-terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business continuity management is standardized across the UK by British Standards (BS) through BS 25999-2:2007 and BS 25999-1:2006.  BS 25999-2:2007 business continuity management is the British Standard for business continuity management across all organizations. This includes industry and its sectors. The standard provides a best practice framework to minimize disruption during unexpected events that could bring business to a standstill. The document gives a practical plan to deal with most eventualities—from extreme weather conditions to terrorism, IT system failure, and staff sickness.&lt;ref&gt;British Standards Institution (2006). Business continuity management-Part 1: Code of practice :London&lt;/ref&gt;

This document was released in July 2014 by the British standard BS EN ISO 22301:2014, the current standard for business continuity planning.&lt;ref&gt;British Standards Institution (2014). Societal security – Business continuity management Systems – Requirements: London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Contingencies Act===
In 2004, following crises in the preceding years, the UK government passed the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004|Civil Contingencies Act of 2004]]: Businesses must have continuity planning measures to survive and continue to thrive whilst working towards keeping the incident as minimal as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Office. (2004). overview of the Act. In: Civil Contingencies Secretariat Civil Contingencies Act 2004: a short. London: Civil Contingencies Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was separated into two parts: 
* Part 1: civil protection, covering roles &amp; responsibilities for local responders
* Part 2: emergency powers

==Implementation and testing==
The implementation phase involves policy changes, material acquisitions, staffing and testing.

===Testing and organizational acceptance===
The 2008 book ''Exercising for Excellence'', published by The [[British Standards Institution]] identified three types of exercises that can be employed when testing business continuity plans.
* '''Tabletop exercises''' - a small number of people concentrate on a specific aspect of a BCP. Another form involves a single representative from each of several teams. 
* '''Medium exercises''' - Several departments, teams or disciplines concentrate on multiple BCP aspects; the scope can range from a few teams from one building to multiple teams operating across dispersed locations. Pre-scripted "surprises" are added.
* '''Complex exercises''' - All aspects of a medium exercise remain, but for maximum realism no-notice activation, actual evacuation and actual invocation of a disaster recovery site is added.

While start and stop times are pre-agreed, the actual duration might be unknown if events are allowed to run their course.

==Maintenance==
Biannual or annual maintenance cycle maintenance of a BCP manual is broken down into three periodic activities.

* Confirmation of information in the manual, roll out to staff for awareness and specific training for critical individuals.
* Testing and verification of technical solutions established for recovery operations.
* Testing and verification of organization recovery procedures. 
Issues found during the testing phase often must be reintroduced to the analysis phase.

===Information/targets===
The BCP manual must evolve with the organization, and maintain information about '''who has to know what''' 
* a series of checklists
* definitions of terminology to facilitate timely communication during [[disaster recovery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.bcmpedia.org/|title=Glossary of Business Continuity Terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
* distribution lists (staff, important clients, vendors/suppliers)
* information about communication and transportation infrastructure (roads,bridges)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |website=CMS.gov
|url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/FFSProvCustSvcGen/Downloads/Disaster-Recovery-Plan-Checklist.pdf  |title=Disaster Recovery Plan Checklist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical===
Specialized technical resources must be maintained. Checks include:
* [[Computer virus|Virus]] definition distribution
* Application security and service patch distribution
* Hardware operability 
* Application operability 
* Data verification
* Data application

===Testing and verification of recovery procedures===
Software and work process changes must be (re)documented and validated, including verification that
documented work process recovery tasks and supporting disaster recovery infrastructure allow staff to recover within the predetermined recovery time objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10682">The '''constructive cooperative coevolutionary algorithm''' (also called C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is a [[global optimisation]] algorithm in [[artificial intelligence]] based on the multi-start architecture of the [[greedy randomized adaptive search procedure]] (GRASP).&lt;ref&gt;T.A. Feo and M.G.C. Resende (1989) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167637789900023 "A probabilistic heuristic for a computationally difficult set covering problem"]. ''Operations Research Letters'', 8:67&amp;ndash;71, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.A. Feo and M.G.C. Resende (1995) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01096763 "Greedy randomized adaptive search procedures"]. ''Journal of Global Optimization'', 6:109&amp;ndash;133, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates the existing [[Cooperative coevolution|cooperative coevolutionary algorithm]] (CC).&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Potter and K. A. D. Jong, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-58484-6_269 "A cooperative coevolutionary approach to function optimization"], in ''PPSN III: Proceedings of the International Conference on Evolutionary Computation. The Third Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature'' London, UK:Springer-Verlag, 1994, pp. 249–257.&lt;/ref&gt; The considered problem is decomposed into subproblems. These subproblems are optimised separately while exchanging information in order to solve the complete problem. An optimisation algorithm, usually but not necessarily an [[evolutionary algorithm]], is embedded in C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for optimising those subproblems. The nature of the embedded optimisation algorithm determines whether C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'s behaviour is [[deterministic]] or [[stochastic]].

The C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; optimisation algorithm was originally designed for [[Stochastic optimization|simulation-based optimisation]]&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2014b" /&gt; but it can be used for [[global optimization|global optimisation]] problems in general.&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2017b"&gt;Glorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B.: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10732-017-9351-z "Constructive cooperative coevolution for large-scale global optimisation"], ''Journal of Heuristics'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Its strength over other optimisation algorithms, specifically cooperative coevolution, is that it is better able to handle non-separable optimisation problems.&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glorieux E., Danielsson F., Svensson B., Lennartson B.: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-015-7012-7 "Constructive cooperative coevolutionary optimisation for interacting production stations"], ''International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology'', 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

An improved version was proposed later, called the Improved Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary Differential Evolution (C&lt;sup&gt;3i&lt;/sup&gt;DE), which removes several limitations with the previous version. A novel element of C&lt;sup&gt;3i&lt;/sup&gt;DE is the advanced initialisation of the subpopulations. C&lt;sup&gt;3i&lt;/sup&gt;DE initially optimises the subpopulations in a partially co-adaptive fashion. During the initial optimisation of a subpopulation, only a subset of the other subcomponents is considered for the co-adaptation. This subset increases stepwise until all subcomponents are considered. This makes C&lt;sup&gt;3i&lt;/sup&gt;DE very effective on large-scale global optimisation problems (up to 1000 dimensions) compared to [[Cooperative coevolution|cooperative coevolutionary algorithm]] (CC) and [[Differential evolution]].&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2015b"&gt;Glorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7376815/ "Improved Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary Differential Evolution for Large-Scale Optimisation"], 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The improved algorithm has then been adapted for [[multi-objective optimization]].&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2017a"&gt;Glorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B., [http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/0305215X.2016.1264220 "Multi-objective constructive cooperative coevolutionary optimization of robotic press-line tending"], Engineering Optimization, Vol. 49, Iss. 10, 2017, pp 1685-1703&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm==

As shown in the pseudo code below, an iteration of C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; exists of two phases. In Phase I, the constructive phase, a feasible solution for the entire problem is constructed in a stepwise manner. Considering a different subproblem in each step. After the final step, all subproblems are considered and a solution for the complete problem has been constructed. This constructed solution is then used as the initial solution in Phase II, the local improvement phase. The CC algorithm is employed to further optimise the constructed solution. A cycle of Phase II includes optimising the subproblems separately while keeping the parameters of the other subproblems fixed to a central blackboard solution. When this is done for each subproblem, the found solution are combined during a "collaboration" step, and the best one among the produced combinations becomes the blackboard solution for the next cycle. In the next cycle, the same is repeated. Phase II, and thereby the current iteration, are terminated when the search of the CC algorithm stagnates and no significantly better solutions are being found. Then, the next iteration is started. At the start of the next iteration, a new feasible solution is constructed, utilising solutions that were found during the Phase I of the previous iteraton(s). This constructed solution is then used as the initial solution in Phase II in the same way as in the first iteration. This is repeated until one of the termination criteria for the optimisation is reached, e.g. a maximum number of evaluations.

 '''WHILE''' termination criteria not satisfied  '''DO'''
    '''IF''' {'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;phase1&lt;/sub&gt;} == ∅ '''THEN'''

      '''END WHILE'''
 '''END WHILE'''

==Multi-Objective Optimisation==
The multi-objective version of the C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; algorithm &lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2017a" /&gt; is a Pareto-based algorithm which uses the same divide-and-conquer strategy as the single-objective C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; optimisation algorithm . The algorithm again starts with the advanced constructive initial optimisations of the subpopulations, considering an increasing subset of subproblems. The subset increases until the entire set of all subproblems is included. During these initial optimisations, the subpopulation of the latest included subproblem is evolved by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. For the fitness calculations of the members of the subpopulation, they are combined with a collaborator solution from each of the previously optimised subpopulations.  Once all subproblems' subpopulations have been initially optimised, the multi-objective C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; optimisation algorithm continues to optimise each subproblem in a [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin fashion]], but now collaborator solutions from all other subproblems' subspopulations are combined with the member of the subpopulation that is being evaluated. The collaborator solution is selected randomly from the solutions that make up the Pareto-optimal front of the subpopulation. The fitness assignment to the collaborator solutions is done in an optimistic fashion (i.e. an "old" fitness value is replaced when the new one is better).

==Applications==

The constructive cooperative coevolution algorithm has been applied to different types of problems, e.g. a set of standard benchmark functions,&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2014a"&gt;Glorieux E., Danielsson F., Svensson B., Lennartson B., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6899345/ "Optimisation of interacting production stations using a Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary approach"], 2014 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), pp.322-327, August 2014, Taipei, Taiwan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2017b"/&gt; optimisation of sheet metal press lines&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2014b"&gt;Glorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B., [http://hv.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A754165&amp;dswid=-2044 "A Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary Algorithm Applied to Press Line Optimisation"], Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing (FAIM), pp.909-917, May 2014, San Antonio, Texas, USA&lt;/ref&gt; and interacting production stations.&lt;ref name="Glorieux et al 2014b" /&gt; The C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; algorithm has been embedded with, amongst others, the [[Differential evolution|differential evolution algorithm]]&lt;ref&gt;Storn, Rainer, and Kenneth Price.

'''David Wayne Williams''' (February 29, 1972 – August 14, 2002)&lt;ref name=WHFS&gt;{{cite news |title=To Celebrate the 40th Birthday of Former Drowning Pool Lead Singer Dave Williams…We Give You the Bird |date=February 29, 2012 |url=http://whfs.cbslocal.com/2012/02/29/to-celebrate-the-40th-birthday-of-former-drowning-pool-lead-singer-dave-williams-we-give-you-the-bird/|website=Whfs.cbslocal.com|accessdate=2016-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American vocalist best known as the original lead singer for the [[nu metal]] band [[Drowning Pool]].

==Biography==
He grew up in [[Princeton, Texas]], living with his parents Charles Edward and Jo-Ann Williams.

In 1999, he joined Drowning Pool, who had formed in 1996 and had previously performed as an instrumental three-piece. The band released their debut album with Williams, ''[[Sinner (Drowning Pool album)|Sinner]]'', in 2001. Williams soon gained recognition for his performances with the band; his nickname "Stage" came from [[Pantera]] guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]], who gave it to him because of his known stage personality.

However, on August 14, 2002, Williams was found dead in the band's tour bus in Manassas, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 14, 2002 |title=Drowning Pool Singer Found Dead |author=Joe D'Angelo |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457028/drowning-pool-singer-dead.jhtml|website=Mtv.com|accessdate=2016-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy established that he had died from [[heart failure]] caused by [[cardiomyopathy]] (heart muscle disease), which went undiagnosed until his death.&lt;ref name=WHFS /&gt;

A public funeral was held in [[Plano, Texas]], on August 18, 2002 at 10:00 am. A DVD titled ''Sinema'' which chronicles his life, has since been released. His lifelong dream was to buy his parents a house; the sales from ''Sinema'' fulfilled his dream posthumously.

Williams's microphone was given to [[Cristian Machado]] from [[Ill Niño]]. They were good friends, so after his death, Drowning Pool and Williams' family gave it as a signal of respect. The band [[Memento (band)|Memento]] dedicated their set to Williams on the [[Ozzfest]] 2003 stage.

Williams was ranked in the Top 100 ''[[Heavy metal music|metal]]'' vocalists of all time by ''[[Hit Parader]]'' at #82.

The Dallas, Texas music community honored Williams and his legacy with a multi-venue music festival named "Stage Fest." Stage Fest was held in downtown Dallas' [[Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas|Deep Ellum]] district on August 14, 2007, the fifth anniversary of his death, and played in seven Deep Ellum venues including Club Dada, The Curtain Club, The Lizard Lounge, The Darkside Lounge, Red Blood Club, Reno's Chop Shop, and Tomcat's.

On August 14, 2012, the 10th anniversary of his death, Drowning Pool released a ballad titled "[[In Memory Of... (song)|In Memory Of...]]" dedicated to him.

Re-released 13th anniversary of Sinner album contains never before released footage of Dave Williams and his bandmates speaking about meaning of the songs on the ''Sinner'' album and more.

The footage of Dave Williams while he was in Fugly (one of his previous bands) surfaced on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/fuglydavewilliamsripdrowningpool |title=Fugly (Dave Williams, RIP, Drowning Pool) |publisher=[[ReverbNation]] |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the band Dave Williams mentioned in 13th anniversary ''Sinner'' release, while naming all the bands he was in before Drowning Pool.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">A '''dropleton''' or '''quantum droplet''' is a [[quasiparticle]] comprising a collection of [[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]] inside a [[semiconductor]]. Dropletons give the first known quasiparticle characterization where the quasiparticle behaves like a liquid.&lt;ref name="sa"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dropleton-quantum-droplet-quasiparticle/| title =Meet the Dropleton—a "Quantum Droplet" That Acts Like a Liquid |publisher =''[[Scientific American]]''|author=Clara Moskowitz|date=26 February 2014| accessdate =26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of dropletons was announced on 26 February 2014 in a ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article, which presented evidence for the creation of dropletons in an [[electron hole|electron–hole]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] inside a [[gallium arsenide]] [[quantum well]] by ultrashort [[laser]] pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7489/full/nature12994.html| title =Quantum droplets of electrons and holes |author= A.

Despite the relatively short lifetime of about 25 [[picosecond]]s, the dropletons are stable enough to be studied&lt;ref name="sa"/&gt; and possess favorable properties for certain investigations of [[quantum mechanics]]. They are approximately 200 [[nanometer]]s wide, the size of the smallest [[bacteria]], for which reason the discoverers have expressed hope that they might one day actually see quantum droplets.&lt;ref name="sa"/&gt;

'''Ersilia Cavedagni''' (1862-?) was an Italian-American [[anarcha-feminist]] activist, writer, and editor.

== Biography ==
Cavedagni was born in [[Northern Italy]] to Francesco and Enrica Amadei. At a young age she married the Bolognese anarchist Giulio Grandi, with whom she had a daughter, Edvige. The Grandi home became a gathering place for anarchists and provided shelter to militants such as P. Gori and Vivaldo Lacchini.{{sfn|Franco Serantini Library|2003}} 

Cavedagni (then known as Ersilia Grandi) was one of the few women in the region to play a significant role in the movement. She is said to have had a remarkable and lively intelligence as well as "belle fattezze" (beautiful features). She wrote propaganda and gave speeches to crowds of proletarian women. From September 1894 to April 1895 she was imprisoned in [[Bassano del Grappa|Bassano Veneto]] for her political activities.{{sfn|Franco Serantini Library|2003}}{{sfn|Guglielmo|2010|p=162}}

Sometime in the 1890s, she met and fell in love with [[Giuseppe Ciancabilla]], a fellow anarchist and a friend of [[Errico Malatesta]]. The pair fled Italy together during the police crackdown on workers' movements. They spent two years traveling in Switzerland, Belgium, and France, during which Cavedagni published several essays and letters in  ''La Questione Sociale'' (The Social Question). In one letter, she criticized women anarchists in the United States for failing to address the "woman question," writing, "If we were to have many anarchist women, oh, believe me, the movement would grow substantially....who does not remember the teachings of our mothers?"{{sfn|Franco Serantini Library|2003}}{{sfn|Guglielmo|2010|p=162}}

In 1898, Cavedagni and Ciancabilla moved to [[Paterson, New Jersey]], where Ciancabilla became editor of ''La Questione Sociale'' and later, editor of another anarchist newspaper, ''L'Aurora''. During her stay in the area she befriended and influenced the young anarchist [[Ernestina Cravello]] and joined the Teatro Sociale, a theater group that staged plays about women's emancipation.{{sfn|Guglielmo|2010|p=172}} She published essays in ''L'Aurora'' and ''[[Cronaca Sovversiva]]'',{{sfn|Cannistraro|2003|p=135}} and edited several issues of ''L'Aurora'' after Ciancabilla was arrested for praising [[Leon Czolgosz]] (the man who assassinated President McKinley in 1901).{{sfn|Zimmer|2015|p=67}} 

The couple moved to Chicago, then San Francisco, where they were closely monitored by the Italian authorities. Cavedagni was considered a "very dangerous anarchist," of "limited formal instruction but much audaciousness."{{sfn|Guglielmo|2010|p=162}} Ciancabilla suddenly fell ill and died in 1904 at the age of 32.&lt;ref name="anarchist"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/CiancabillaGiuseppe.htm |title=Giuseppi Ciancabilla |publisher=The Anarchist Encyclopedia: A Gallery of Saints &amp; Sinners |accessdate=2012-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002121220/http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/CiancabillaGiuseppe.htm |archivedate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What little is known of Cavedagni's later life is based on her correspondence and subscriptions to anarchist newspapers. She moved frequently, living at various times in Philadelphia, New York, Vancouver, and San Francisco. In 1912 she was living in Seattle with the Spanish anarchist Leon Morel. According to an Italian police report, she was still living "abroad" in 1941.{{sfn|Franco Serantini Library|2003}}

}}
'''Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II''', billed as "'''The Sound and the Fury'''" and afterwards infamously referred to as "'''The Bite Fight'''", was a professional boxing match contested on June 28, 1997 for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Heavyweight Championship. It achieved notoriety as one of the most bizarre fights in boxing history, after Tyson bit off part of Holyfield's ear. Tyson was disqualified from the match and lost his boxing license, though it was later reinstated.  

The fight took place at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. The [[Referee (boxing)|referee]] officiating the fight was [[Mills Lane]], who was brought in as a late replacement when Tyson's camp protested the original selection of [[Mitch Halpern]] (who officiated the first fight) as the referee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canoe.ca/BoxingTysonHolyfield/jun28_ref.html Lane late replacement, center of action], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via Slam! Boxing'', 1997-06-29, Retrieved on 2007-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tyson and Holyfield [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield|fought]] seven months earlier in Las Vegas. Tyson was making his first defense of the WBA championship he had won from [[Bruce Seldon]] in a first round knockout. Holyfield, despite being a former champion, was a significant underdog entering the match as he had been rather lackluster in several fights since he returned to fighting in 1995 after a brief retirement. However, Holyfield surprised Tyson by controlling the contest and knocked him down in the sixth round. Halpern stopped the fight in the eleventh round, giving Holyfield an upset victory.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}

==Match==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2011}}
The fight began with Holyfield dominating Tyson. Holyfield won the first three rounds. At 2:19 of the first round, an overhand right from Holyfield stunned Tyson, but Tyson fought back immediately pushing Holyfield backwards. At 32 seconds into the second round, Holyfield ducked under a right from Tyson. In doing so, he head-butted Tyson, opening a large cut over the latter's right eye (although trainer Ritchie Giachetti believed the cut happened in the first round). Tyson had repeatedly complained about head-butting in the first bout between the two fighters. Upon reviewing replays, referee Mills Lane stated the headbutts were unintentional and nonpunishable.&lt;ref name="butt1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/464513.stm Tyson: 'I'd bite again'], ''[[BBC]] Sports'',  1999-10-04, Retrieved on 2007-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the third round was about to begin, Tyson came out of his corner without his mouthpiece. Lane ordered Tyson back to his corner to insert it. Tyson inserted his mouthpiece, got back into position and the match resumed. Tyson began the third round with a furious attack. With forty seconds remaining in the round, Holyfield got Tyson in a clinch, and Tyson rolled his head above Holyfield's shoulder and bit Holyfield on his right ear. The bite avulsed a one-inch piece of cartilage from the top of the ear, and Tyson spit out the piece of ear onto the ring floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Rick|title=30: Tyson bites Holyfield's ear in rematch|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/30|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Holyfield shrieked in pain and jumped in circles, he managed to push Tyson away, at which point Lane called for a time-out. As Holyfield turned to walk to his corner, Tyson shoved him from behind. Lane sent Tyson to a neutral corner as an enraged Holyfield gestured for Mills Lane to look at his bitten ear, which was rapidly bleeding.

The fight was delayed for several minutes as Lane debated what to do. Lane's original decision was to immediately disqualify Tyson, but after the ringside doctor determined that Holyfield was able to continue despite the massive bite, Lane announced he would be deducting two points from Tyson and the fight would continue. [[Bobby Czyz]], who was calling the fight with [[Steve Albert]] for [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], said, "I wonder how this would have played in [[Mitch Halpern]]'s eyes," and Albert told Czyz, "That's a thought, Bobby." As Lane explained the decision to Tyson and his cornermen, Tyson asserted that the injury to Holyfield's ear was the result of a punch. "Bullshit," Lane retorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brookhouse|first1=Brent|title=Great moments in heavyweight rematch history: Tyson vs Holyfield II and 'The Bite'|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/12/25/3802010/ufc-155-great-heavyweight-rematch-history-tyson-holyfield-II-ear-bite|accessdate=6 March 2015|agency=SB Nation|publisher=[[Vox Media Inc.]]|date=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was resumed.

During another clinch, Tyson bit Holyfield's left ear. Holyfield threw his hands around to get out of the clinch and jumped back. Tyson's second bite just scarred Holyfield's ear. Lane did not stop the fight this time, so the two men continued fighting until time expired. The men walked back to their respective corners, and when the second bite was discovered, the fight was stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutz|first1=Tom|title=Mike Tyson 'wanted to kill' Evander Holyfield|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/23/mike-tyson-evander-holyfield-ear-bite|accessdate=6 March 2015|agency=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fight unrest===
After the fight was stopped, Tyson went on a rampage at Holyfield and his trainer Brooks while they were still in their corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=Tom|title=Tyson Disqualified for Biting Holyfield's Ears|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/29/sports/tyson-disqualified-for-biting-holyfield-s-ears.html|accessdate=6 March 2015|agency=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills Lane told Tyson's corner that he was disqualifying Tyson for biting Holyfield. To protect Holyfield, security surrounded him in his corner and Tyson was taken back to his corner by security. Mills Lane was interviewed, and  said he knew from experience that the bites were intentional. He had told Tyson not to bite anymore, and said Tyson asked to be disqualified by disobeying that order. Holyfield left the ring seconds after the interview, which gave the fans and audience the hint that the fight was over. Holyfield told the press afterward that Tyson bit him because he knew he was going to get knocked out and he chose to lose in a disqualification instead.{{fact|date=November 2015}}

Reporters then interviewed Mike Tyson's instructor, who was upset about Lane's decision. The instructor said, "They will have to explain that. I do not agree with it but it is what it is...all I know is Mike Tyson has a cut in his eye."{{fact|date=November 2015}}

Twenty-five minutes after the brawl ended, announcer [[Jimmy Lennon Jr]]. read the decision: "Ladies and gentlemen, this bout has been stopped at the end of round number three. The referee in charge, Mills Lane, disqualifies Mike Tyson for biting Evander Holyfield in both ears, the winner by way of disqualification and still the WBA Champion of the world, Evander 'The Real Deal' Holyfield!" As a result Holyfield remained the WBA Heavyweight champion.

Tyson said it was retaliation for the headbutts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/article-archive/2009/7287-mike-tyson-tells-oprah-why-he-bit-evander-holyfield|title=Mike Tyson Tells Oprah Why He Bit Evander Holyfield – The Sweet Science|website=thesweetscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during post-match interviews, Tyson was walking back to his locker room when a fan from the stadium tossed a bottle of water in his direction. Tyson, his instructor and a pain manager climbed over a temporary railing and up into the stands, made obscene gestures to the crowd, and made their way up the side of a stairway. Tyson had to be restrained as he was led off. When interviewed about his championship and the incident with Tyson, Holyfield said he already forgave Tyson for biting him since he has 100% faith in God and Jesus.

Nonetheless, Tyson was sentenced with a permanent suspension from boxing and his license cancelled indefinitely. Tyson was also fined $3,000,000 and had to serve a period of community service. After a year and an appeal in court, Tyson's license was reinstated. When Tyson and Holyfield retired from boxing they befriended each other and are now close friends today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawes|first1=Mike|title=Come ear and give me a hug!

==Aftermath==
The fight generated a total revenue of $180,000,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|180000000|1997|r=-6}}|}}), from [[live gate]], [[pay-per-view]], closed-circuit telecasts, foreign television rights, and casino profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy Beckons Tyson The Thug, The Quitter |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-07-05/sports/9707050120_1_tyson-holyfield-ring |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=July 5, 1997 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of biting Holyfield on both ears and other behavior, Tyson's boxing license was revoked by the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] and he was fined [[United States dollar|$]]3 million plus legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canoe.ca/BoxingTysonHolyfield/jul9_banned.html Tyson banned for life], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via Slam! Boxing'', 1997-07-09, Retrieved on 2007-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The revocation was not permanent; a little more than a year later on October 18, 1998, the commission voted 4–1 to restore Tyson's boxing license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/boxing/news/2002/0129/1319772.html Mike Tyson timeline], ''[[ESPN.com]]'', 2002-01-29, Retrieved on 2009-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 documentary ''[[Tyson (2008 film)|Tyson]]'', the boxer claimed he did it as retaliation for the headbutting.

On October 16, 2009 on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', Tyson apologized to Holyfield. Holyfield accepted his apology and forgave Tyson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Mike-Tyson-Apologizes-to-Evander-Holyfield-Video|title=Mike Tyson Apologizes Video|website=oprah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''The Bite Fight'' was made in 2013 by George Willis, illustrating the lives of Tyson and Holyfield before, during, and after the fight.

'''Gender violence''', also known as '''gender-based violence''' or '''gendered violence''', is the term used to denote harm inflicted upon individuals and groups that is connected to normative understandings of their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/755629989|title=Violence against women and girls : a compendium of monitoring and evaluation indicators|last=S.|first=Bloom, Shelah|date=2008|publisher=MEASURE Evaluation, Carolina Population Center|oclc=755629989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection can be in the form of cultural understandings of gender roles, institutional and structural forces that endorse violence based on gender and societal influences that shape violent events along gender lines.  While the term is often used synonymously with ‘violence against women’, gendered violence can and does occur for people of all genders including men, women, male and female children and gender diverse individuals.  

Activities heavily associated with violence are overwhelmingly shaped by understandings of gender and gender roles. War, for example, in contemporary understandings is divided between civilian and combatants with a general understanding that men make up the vast majority of combatants and women and young children the majority of civilians. In cases like the Srebenica massacre, in which 8,000 men and male children were killed, the basis of their murder was a gendered understanding that they had the potential of being, or becoming combatants in the Bosnian war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-03-11|title=Atrocities, Massacres, and War Crimes: An Encyclopedia2014 086  Edited by Alexander Mikaberidze   Atrocities, Massacres, and War Crimes: An Encyclopedia  Santa Barbara, CA ABC-Clio 2013 9781598849264 Contact publisher for pricing information|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/rr-11-2013-0271|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=28|issue=3|pages=18–18|doi=10.1108/rr-11-2013-0271|issn=0950-4125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing gender and violence at regional levels, the experiences of people who exist in transition between spaces or who are not counted within regional data can potentially be omitted from this discussion; these include displaced persons, people seeking asylum and refugees.

== Asia ==
Violence against women is a major concern in the Asian regions, especially the prevalence of marital violence varies considerably across South Asian countries. For married women aged 15–49 years, physical or sexual violence within marriage has been experienced by 20% in the Maldives, 26% in Pakistan, 28% in Nepal, 38% in India and 53% in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jejeebhoy|first=Shireen J.|last2=Santhya|first2=K.G.|last3=Acharya|first3=Rajib|date=2014-05-19|title=Violence against women in South Asia: The need for the active engagement of the health sector|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2014.916736|journal=Global Public Health|volume=9|issue=6|pages=678–690|doi=10.1080/17441692.2014.916736|issn=1744-1692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence against women is a very serious issue that can be attributed to the death. For example, India recorded over 40.000 dowry-related deaths between 2011 and 2015. In Nepal and Bangladesh, the Asia Foundation points out that gender-based violence is the first or second cause of international homicides in these countries. One of the biggest historical violence against women is the phenomenon of comfort women. Comfort women refers to tens of thousands of young women, majority from Korea who were forced into sex slaves for Japanese military during the Asia Pacific War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/225875908|title=The comfort women : sexual violence and postcolonial memory in Korea and Japan|last=Sarah.|first=Soh, Chunghee|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226767765|oclc=225875908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korea’s comfort women represent gender violence in the context of patriarchal colonial capitalism as the phenomenon reflects Japan’s colonial economy and traditional sexual cultures of Japanese and Korean patriarchy. Therefore, they were victims of sexism, classism, racism, colonialism, militarism, and capitalist imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/225875908|title=The comfort women : sexual violence and postcolonial memory in Korea and Japan|last=Sarah.|first=Soh, Chunghee|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226767765|oclc=225875908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle East ==
Gendered violence in the Middle East greatly targeted towards women and is justified by political and religious laws; acts of gendered violence take the form of forced early marriage, rape, and domestic violence. Gendered violence can also be found in instances where Islamic law is used to justify killing women in order to preserve male honor. In Yemen, for example, 400 women were subjected to honor killings between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadiqi|first=Fatima|date=2014-01-02|title=Gender and Violence in Islamic Societies: Patriarchy, Islamism and Politics in the Middle East and North Africa|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13552074.2014.889351|journal=Gender &amp; Development|volume=22|issue=1|pages=185–187|doi=10.1080/13552074.2014.889351|issn=1355-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which women are held to a code of honor include the practice of wearing scarves and refraining from using makeup, failure to do so can potentially result in physical and verbal harassment or loss of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennaji|first=Moha|date=2011-04-22|title=Gender and Violence in the Middle East|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203830727|doi=10.4324/9780203830727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars Islamic laws make it justifiable to rape, beat, and sell non-Muslim women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Ali|first=Nadje|date=2016-03|title=Sexual violence in Iraq: Challenges for transnational feminist politics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350506816633723|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=25|issue=1|pages=10–27|doi=10.1177/1350506816633723|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly patriarchal mindset that takes place in both religious and political laws makes it difficult for women to seek an alternative option.

Socioeconomic status plays a role as poor families are highly likely to marry their daughters for the right price, specifically in Yemen, where it is more difficult to marry daughters past the age of twenty because they are seen as too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ouis|first=Pernilla|date=2009-07-01|title=Honourable Traditions?

== Oceania ==
To understand the connection between Gender and Violence in the Oceanic context it is crucial to understand the effects of colonisation on Aotearoa (New Zealand), the Pacific islands and the many nations within the Australian continent. While practices of colonisation in these regions have not been homogenous, colonisation has disrupted gender roles, relationships and modes of production, which continue to influence both contemporary gender relations and practices of violence and domination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Atkinson, Judy. "Violence in Aboriginal Australia: Colonisation and Gender." ''Aboriginal and Islander Health Worker Journal'' 14, no. 2 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  As Atkinson discusses, in Australia ongoing colonial relationships of power continue to create and perpetuate gendered violence, particularly for Indigenous women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, for Aotearoa/New Zealand the introduction of colonial patriarchy and racialised colonial power has fundamentally altered Māori frameworks and relationships to the land which have transformed both Māori ways of being and interpersonal relationships such as connections between genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cavino, Hayley Marama. "Intergenerational Sexual Violence and Wh ā nau in Aotearoa/ New Zealand - Pedagogies of Contextualisation and Transformation." ''Sexual Abuse in Australia and New Zealand'' 7, no. 1 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have these changed relationships resulted in sexual gender based violence but also a broader adoption of masculine settler norms that foster violence and gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Jane, and James Ritchie. ''Violence in New Zealand.'' Huia, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these colonial legacies there is a strong focus on supporting peace and deconstructing gendered relations. For example, in the Pacific, the Women, Peace and Security agenda has a large role in preventing violence in Pacific communities as women within in this region play strong roles in advocating for peace and working to prevent violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=George|first=Nicole|date=2014-04-29|title=Promoting Women, Peace and Security in the Pacific Islands: hot conflict/slow violence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10357718.2014.902032|journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs|volume=68|issue=3|pages=314–332|doi=10.1080/10357718.2014.902032|issn=1035-7718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==
Gendered violence exists in North America in forms such as stalking, intimate partner violence, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual assault.

== South America ==
A major cause of gendered violence in Central and South America comes from a high prevalence of gangs affiliation and membership. In the past, criminal gangs were viewed through a male dominant perception but new research suggests recruitment and involvement of women in gangs is rapidly increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WILDING|first=POLLY|date=2010-11|title=‘New Violence’: Silencing Women's Experiences in the Favelas of Brazil|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022216x10001343|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=42|issue=04|pages=719–747|doi=10.1017/s0022216x10001343|issn=0022-216X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be the case that women would support partners who were gang members while, but now women are being used to commit crimes that were traditionally for men because their essence of innocence deters police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coker|first=Donna|date=2016-07-09|title=Domestic Violence and Social Justice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801215625851|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1426–1437|doi=10.1177/1077801215625851|issn=1077-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite women carrying out masculine roles within gangs, they are still the primary target of violence and face constant abuse by their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WILDING|first=POLLY|date=2010-11|title=‘New Violence’: Silencing Women's Experiences in the Favelas of Brazil|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022216x10001343|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=42|issue=04|pages=719–747|doi=10.1017/s0022216x10001343|issn=0022-216X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who try to leave gangs will often be threatened by other members and will stay in affiliation because they receive very little help from authorities. Some women believe it is safer to continue gang membership than to report to authorities because police in Central America, specifically in Guatemala, are notorious for abusing their power to abuse women and in other cases prove to be unresponsive to reports of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WILDING|first=POLLY|date=2010-11|title=‘New Violence’: Silencing Women's Experiences in the Favelas of Brazil|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022216x10001343|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=42|issue=04|pages=719–747|doi=10.1017/s0022216x10001343|issn=0022-216X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who attempt to seek refuge in the United States are usually denied due to their pre-existing gang membership, or because they do not have evidence of violence being perpetrated against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coker|first=Donna|date=2016-07-09|title=Domestic Violence and Social Justice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801215625851|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1426–1437|doi=10.1177/1077801215625851|issn=1077-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other legalities make it difficult for women to escape forms of violence such as rape or domestic violence. In Guatemala, “girls can be forced to marry their rapists to preserve their own and the family’s honor”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Lynne|date=2017-06-06|title=Viewing Gendered Violence in Guatemala Through Photovoice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801217708058|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=24|issue=4|pages=421–451|doi=10.1177/1077801217708058|issn=1077-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high influence of Christianity and Catholicism also make it unacceptable to leave a relationship due to domestic violence and many women are expected to put up with; religious influence on laws also make it impossible to receive an abortion even on occasions of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Lynne|date=2017-06-06|title=Viewing Gendered Violence in Guatemala Through Photovoice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801217708058|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=24|issue=4|pages=421–451|doi=10.1177/1077801217708058|issn=1077-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gendered violence is typical in South and Central America, and is mostly violence directed towards women. The lack of assistance by law enforcement make it possible for this violence to continue and the large scale presence of gangs further contribute to gendered violence happening against women despite the growing number of women with gang membership.

== Africa ==
The prevalence of violence against women is very severe in Africa where around one third of African women report to have experienced domestic violence both physical and sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/domestic-violence-and-poverty-in-africa-when-the-husbands-beating-stick-is-like-butter|title=Domestic Violence and Poverty in Africa: When the Husband’s Beating Stick is Like Butter|last=Christiaensen|first=Luc|date=2016-01-18|website=AfricaCan End Poverty|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence within the family, especially experienced by women is attributed to ancient socioeconomic conditions that shape social norms about marriage patterns, living arrangements and the productive role of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alesina|first=Alberto|last2=Brioschi|first2=Benedetta|last3=Ferrara|first3=Eliana La|date=2016-01|title=Violence Against Women: A Cross-cultural Analysis for Africa|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w21901|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is considered a form of gender based violation that has a great influence on women and girls’ bodies. More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to FGM in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East. FGM is not only a matter of discrimination against females, but it violates a person’s rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender violence does not only target women. In 33 African counties, adult same-sex acts are illegal, including 24 that criminalize lesbian acts, and many other countries have recently passed laws that restrict and punish groups that support work on sexual orientation and gender identity issues. Consequently, sexual minority people are subjected to gender violence, including being harassed, threatened and even killed in some places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keating|first=Christine (Cricket)|last2=Burack|first2=Cynthia|date=2017-09|title=11.

See Gongadze Case (2000–2008): A Legal Review by Dr iur Vyacheslav "Slavik" Bihun, LL.M. – http://www.bihun.info/jushits/jurhit/article/242/&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] politician and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] journalist and film director who was kidnapped and murdered in 2000. Along with [[Olena Prytula]] founded the internet newspaper [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] in 2000.

The circumstances of his death became a national scandal and a focus for protests against the government of the then President, [[Leonid Kuchma]]. During the [[Cassette Scandal]], audiotapes were released on which Kuchma, [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] and other top-level administration officials are allegedly heard discussing the need to silence Gongadze for his online news reports about high-level corruption. Former [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Interior Minister]] [[Yuriy Kravchenko]] died of two gunshots to the head on 4 March 2005, just hours before he was to begin providing testimony as a witness in the case.

==Biography==
===Early years and fall of the Soviet Union===
[[File:Kiew gedenktafel journalisten.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|A memorial plate in Kiev listing journalists who were killed while reporting.]]
Born in [[Tbilisi]], at the time the capital of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]], Gongadze was the son of a Georgian architect Ruslan Gongadze and a Ukrainian dentist Olesya Korchak (a native of [[Lviv]]).&lt;ref name=fwtj&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161116171137/http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2003/09/16/2995436/ From a warrior to a journalist (Від бійця до журналіста)]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 16 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; His parents met in [[Lviv]] where they studied in universities and eventually got married.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In 1967 the young Gongadze family moved to [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Georgiy was born as a twin, but his brother was taken away while both of them were at the maternity chamber.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Diminutive name for Georgiy was Giya.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; When Giya was 6 years old his parents divorced and his father later married for the second time and had another son from his second marriage.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Giya's mother stayed single and continued to live and work in [[Tbilisi]] until 1994.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

During his school years, Giya was an outstanding athlete and was part of the Soviet reserve Olympic team in sprint on 100 and 200 meters.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In his childhood Giya was growing up in multi-language environment speaking in Russian, Georgian, and English in school and Ukrainian at home.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In 1986 Giya enrolled in the Foreign Languages Institute in [[Tbilisi]] with specialization in [[English language]], but in 1987 he was already drafted in the [[Soviet Army]] serving in [[Turkmenistan]] on the border with [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; His mother said that she had to pay to avoid for Georgiy to be sent to [[Afghanistan]] ([[Soviet–Afghan War]]).&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; During that time the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] started his reforms [[perestroika]] along with liberalization of censorship ([[glasnost]]).&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; The process only sped up the process of [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Trying to stop the process and preserve the Soviet state, several armed and civil conflicts arose in the [[Soviet Union]] among which was the [[April 9 tragedy]] (Soviet troops killed 20 unarmed civilians)&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; which radicalized many Georgians including Georgiy Gongadze.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

In May 1989 Giya returned from the army.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Both Ruslan Gongadze and his son Georgiy Gongadze joined the National Movement "For free Georgia" where Georgiy was its spokesperson, while Ruslan Gongadze became the leader.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In 1989-90 Georgiy traveled to the [[Baltic states]] and [[Ukraine]] trying to find extra public support and rally more allies in the struggle to free Georgia from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; As part of his tour, in September 1989 Georgiy attended the first congress of the [[National Movement of Ukraine]] ([[People's Movement of Ukraine]]) in [[Kiev]] where he represented the Georgian organization.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Georgiy also attended the first non-communist music and youth festival [[Chervona Ruta (festival)|Chervona Ruta]] that in September 1989 was taking place in [[Chernivtsi]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; At the festival he met with Mariana Stetsko whom he married in 1990 and settled in [[Lviv]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; There Georgiy found a job as a teacher of [[English language]] and physical culture (fitness instructor).&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; While working, Gongadze also studied at the Romano-Germanic languages Faculty of [[Lviv University|Ivan Franko National University]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; On 24 August 1991 the [[Ukrainian parliament]] announced that all residents of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] are considered to be citizens of Ukraine ([[Ukrainian citizenship]]).&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

{{see also|Georgian Civil War|War in Abkhazia (1992–93)}}
In 1991 the first [[President of Georgia]] [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] announced several of his former allies as "enemies of people" among which was the father of Georgiy Gongadze.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Ruslan Gongadze was forced to hide in a basement of a building next to the parliament in [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In December 1991 a civil war ensued when government forces opened fire upon anti-Gamsakhurdia protestors in [[Tbilisi]], while a militia armed by the oppositional parties counter-attacked.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; At the end of 1991 during the ongoing war Georgiy Gongadze returned to his mother in [[Tbilisi]] along with "Kalashnikov" saying, "Mom, I arrived to protect the name and honor of my father".&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Giya was not using the rifle and led a team of medical emergency services transferring wounded to a hospital until snipers opened fire on medics.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; On 14 January 1992 [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] fled [[Tbilisi]] and struggle ended.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; The power was taken by the opposition and a new president was elected.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; It was [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], the former Soviet Foreign Minister&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; and Communist leader of Soviet Georgia. On 15 January 1992 Georgiy Gongadze returned to [[Lviv]] where he found out that his wife left him.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

In 1992 Gongadze founded a Georgian Culture Association in Lviv which was named after the Georgian Prince [[Bagrationi]] and served as an informational center.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; During the registration of the organization in government offices, Gongadze met Myroslava Petryshyn his future second wife.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Both of them wrote an article "Tragedy of leaders" ({{lang-uk|Трагедія лідерів}}) about the Georgian Civil War that was published in the Lviv newspaper "Post-Postup" in 1992.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Later in 1992 Gongadze returned to Tbilisi again to visit his mother who continued to work in a hospital as a nurse.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; At the time he had intentions to leave active politics and started an own business.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; But after speaking with several people changed his mind, while his mother was encouraging him to write about the victims of the civil war in Georgia.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Gongadze received a camera from his mother and filmed a documentary about the civil war in Georgia "The pain of my land" ({{lang-uk|Біль моєї землі}}).&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In February 1993 the film was shown on the Ukrainian channel UT-3.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; During that period in 1992 Abkhazia and South Osetia proclaimed their independence and Georgia accused Russia in instigating conflicts in those regions.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Soon new conflicts started.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

===Russian intervention to Georgia and journalism in Ukraine===
Gongadze volunteered to war in [[Abkhazia]], but was refused to be admitted to military service by the government authorities and offered for being a son of Ruslan Gongadze and a Ukrainian citizen to provide propaganda agitation in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Georgiy returned to [[Lviv]] to perform his "diplomatic mission" in an active support of Georgia in inter-ethnic conflict.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; At that time in Ukraine he only was able to find a marginal group of UNA-UNSO that were ready to dedicate itself to the Georgian cause.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Gongadze was visiting UNA-UNSO gatherings to find recruits for fighting in Georgia.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; UNA-UNSO that had for its goal "to exile communists and criminals from Ukraine and overpower the Russian expansionism" seemed to be coinciding with Georgian nationalists.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In July 1993 the UNA-UNSO battalion "Argo" led by [[Dmytro Korchynsky]] arrived to [[Tbilisi]] and was ready for fight in [[Abkhazia]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

{{see also|UNA-UNSO}}

Gongadze did not return to Georgia with UNA-UNSO, but rather stayed back in Ukraine as his father Ruslan Gongadze became ill with cancer and in March 1993 the government of Georgia send him to [[Ukraine]] for recovery.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Georgiy moved to [[Kiev]] and stayed with his father.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Ruslan Gongadze did not survive and died on 5 August 1993 at age 49.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; With the body of his father, Georgiy Gongadze returned to [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; After burying his father, Gongadze started to film a new documentary about the Ukrainian fighters in Abkhazia, funds for which he obtained from selling his "Kalashnikov" rifle.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; With the ongoing war that started in August 1992, the separatist forces supported by Russia took over most of Abkhazia and surrounded administrative center of Abkhazia, [[Sukhumi]].&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In September 1993 in exchange for a cease fire, the government of Georgia agreed to pull its troops and heavy armament from Sukhumi.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; However, instead of cease fire the separatists started to assault the city.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; The city was protected by an army of irregular detachments.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; The president of Georgia [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] who also was present during the siege appealed to the [[President of Russia]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to stop the attack, but Yeltsin chose to ignore it.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

On 17 September 1993 Gongadze left Tbilisi for Sukhumi to film the events.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Upon arrival, he was mobilized later that night and the following morning was at the frontlines along the [[Gumista River]] where the enemy was conducting the main assault.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Gongadze was in a trench when over his head blew up an artillery shell.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Shrapnel hit him in 26 places including his right hand.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; From imminent death he was saved by a steel helmet.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Two other people that stood next to him perished.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Those shards of shell forever were left inside of his body; and later were used to identify his dead body.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; About him being wounded, it was mentioned in a report from Sukhumi that was published in a Russophone Tbilisi newspaper "Svobodnaya Gruzia" on 21 September 1993.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Gongadze was right away taken to a field hospital where he turn attention to himself by requesting to return from the battlefield his bag with [[video cassette]]s.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; That fact recalled the local militant Konstantin Alania also known as Koba who later became his friend for life.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; The cassettes were recovered by volunteers.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; The same Saturday night Gongadze and several other seriously wounded were sent to Tbilisi on a plane not long before the separatists occupied the city.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Koba was left behind continue fighting and later managed to escape with some other militants withdrawing through mountain corridors.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In 1995 he left Georgia for [[Lviv]] where by an accident met again with Georgiy.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

In Tbilisi Gongadze continued with a treatment in a military hospital tended by his mother.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; However the worst situation was with food due to the situation in the country.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; His mother tried to send her son away from Georgia, but did not have enough money as the government did not pay the hospital staff since December 1991.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Olesya Gongadze managed to raise some funds through friends and relatives and after spending two weeks in the hospital Georgiy flew away to [[Lviv]] in October 1993.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; Olesya Gongandze stayed behind.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; In Ukraine Georgiy created a new documentary out of his video cassettes that was shown on the Ukrainian television "Shadows of war".&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt; He married Myroslava and in 1997 the couple had two daughter-twins.&lt;ref name=fwtj/&gt;

In 1996-1997 Gongadze worked for the Ukrainian television channel [[STB (TV channel)|STB]]. He worked for the [[Kiev]]-based radio station Kontynent, on which he had his own show called ''First round with Heorhiy Gongadze''. His strongly independent line soon attracted hostility from the increasingly authoritarian government of Leonid Kuchma; during the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1999|October 1999 presidential election]], his commentaries prompted a call from Kuchma's headquarters to say "that he had been blacklisted to be dealt with after the election." In 1999 he was a spokesman for the [[Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine]] [[Nataliya Vitrenko]]. Visiting New York in January 2000 with other Ukrainian journalists, he warned of "the strangulation of the freedom of speech and information in our state."

In April 2000, Gongadze co-founded a news website, ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' (''Ukrainian Truth''), as a means of sidestepping the government's increasing influence over the mainstream media. He observed that following the muzzling of a prominent pro-opposition newspaper after the election, "today there is practically no objective information available about Ukraine". The website specialized in political news and commentary, focusing particularly on President Kuchma, the country's wealthy "oligarchs" and the official media.

In June 2000, Gongadze wrote an open letter to Ukraine's chief prosecutor about harassment from the [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]], the Ukrainian secret police, directed towards himself and his ''Ukrayinska Pravda'' colleagues and apparently related to an investigation into a murder case in the southern port of [[Odessa]]. He complained that he had been forced into hiding because of harassment from the secret police, that he said he and his family were being followed, that his staff were being harassed, and that the SBU were spreading a rumor that he was wanted on a murder charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/932310.stm|work=BBC News | title=Outspoken Ukraine journalist missing|date=19 September 2000|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgiy's mother died in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudenko|first=Olga|title=Gongadze's mother dies at 69|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/gongadzes-mother-dies-at-69-332695.html|accessdate=30 November 2013|newspaper=Kiyv Post|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance and investigations==
Gongadze disappeared on 16 September 2000, after failing to return home. Foul play was suspected from the outset. The matter immediately attracted widespread public attention and media interest. Eighty journalists signed an open letter to President Kuchma urging an investigation and complaining that "during the years of Ukrainian independence, not a single high-profile crime against journalists has been fully resolved." Kuchma responded by ordering an immediate inquiry. This was, however, viewed with some skepticism. Opposition politician Hryhoriy Omelchenko reported that the disappearance had coincided with Gongadze receiving documents on corruption within the president's own entourage. The Ukrainian Parliament set up a parallel inquiry run by a special commission. Neither investigation produced any results.

Two months later, on 3 November 2000, a body was found in a forest in the [[Taraschanskyi Raion]] ([[Raion|district]]) of the [[Kiev Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]), some {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside Kiev near the city of [[Tarashcha]]. The corpse had been decapitated and doused in [[dioxine]], apparently to make identification more difficult; forensic investigations found that the dioxine bath and decapitation had occurred while the victim was still alive. The Russian-edited, Russian-language Ukrainian newspaper ''[[Sevodnya]]'' ("Today") reported that Gongadze had been abducted by policemen and accidentally shot in the head while seated in a vehicle, necessitating his decapitation (to avoid the bullet being recovered and matched to a police weapon). His body had been doused in petrol which had failed to burn properly, and had then been dumped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.for-ua.com/news/?id=197 ForUm: Breaking Ukrainian News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321103304/http://eng.for-ua.com/news/?id=197 |date=21 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of journalists first identified it as being that of Gongadze, a finding confirmed a few weeks later by his wife Myroslava. In a bizarre twist, the corpse was then confiscated by the [[militsiya|police]] and resurfaced in a morgue in Kiev. The authorities did not officially acknowledge that the body was that of Gongadze until the following February and did not definitively confirm it until as late as March 2003. The body was eventually identified and was to be returned to Gongadze's family to be buried two years after his disappearance. However, the funeral never took place. As of 23 June 2006 Gongadze's mother refused to accept the remains offered as it was not the body of her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://www.ostro.org/shownews_ks.php?id=27076&amp;lang=ru Мать Гонгадзе отказывается хоронить выданное ей тело и «устраивать похороны чужих останков»]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} // Остров – Новости.&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting Kiev in July 2006, Gongadze's widow Myroslava emphasized that the funeral had now become a solemn family issue and the date of the funeral would soon be appointed.

On 28 November 2000, opposition politician [[Oleksandr Moroz]] publicized secret tape recordings which he claimed implicated President Kuchma in Gongadze's murder. The recordings were said to be of discussions between Kuchma, presidential chief of staff [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]], and [[MVS (Ukraine)|Interior Minister]] [[Yuriy Kravchenko]], and were claimed to have been provided by an unnamed [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] officer (later named as Major [[Mykola Mel'nychenko]], Kuchma's bodyguard). The conversations included comments expressing annoyance at Gongadze's writings as well as discussions of ways to shut him up, such as deporting him and arranging from him to be kidnapped and taken to [[Chechnya]]. Killing him was, however, not mentioned and doubt was cast on the tapes' authenticity, as the quality of the recordings was poor. Moroz told the Ukrainian [[Verkhovna Rada]] (parliament) that "the professionally organized disappearance, a slow-moving investigation, disregard for the most essential elements of investigation and incoherent comments by police officials suggest that the case was put together."

In September 2001, the American [[Private investigator|detective agency]] [[Kroll Inc.]], contracted by [[Labor Ukraine]], had  carried out a six-month investigation and concluded that then-President Leonid Kuchma had nothing to do with the murder of Gongadze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/66589/ Cabinet involves U.S. Trout Cacheris in auditing activity of previous Cabinet], [[Kyiv Post]] (13 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/8152/print/ Private eyes could probe corpse case], [[Kyiv Post]] (29 March 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The affair became a major political scandal (referred to in Ukraine as the "[[Cassette Scandal]]" or "Tapegate"). Kuchma strongly denied Moroz's accusations and threatened a [[libel]] suit, blaming the tapes on foreign agents. He later acknowledged that his voice was indeed one of those on the tapes, but claimed that they had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NI1G_9j1AhcC&amp;pg=PA504#v=onepage&amp;q=Kuchma%20edited Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004] ([[Europa Publications]]), [[Routledge]], 12 December 2003, {{ISBN|1-85743-187-1}} (page 504)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, upon complaint of Gongadze's widow, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found Ukraine to violate right to life, right to effective remedy and prohibition of degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=788827&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR jugdgment on application No. 34056/02]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crises and controversy==
The affair became an international crisis for the Ukrainian government during 2001, with the [[European Union]] expressing dissatisfaction at the official investigation, rumors of Ukrainian suspension from the [[Council of Europe]], and censure from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], which described Gongadze's death as a case of "censorship by killing" and castigated the "extremely unprofessional" investigation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1169896.stm |work=BBC News|title=Ukraine's 'censorship killing'|date=14 February 2001|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine without Kuchma|Mass demonstrations]] erupted in Kiev in February 2001, calling for the resignation of Kuchma and the dismissal of other key officials. He did sack the head of the SBU, [[Leonid Derkach]], and the chief of the presidential bodyguard, Volodymyr Shepel, but refused to step down.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The government invited the US [[FBI]] to investigate, though it does not appear that this offer was ever taken up. The protests were eventually forcibly broken up by the police.

In May 2001, interior minister [[Yuriy Smirnov (minister)|Yuriy Smirnov]] announced that the murder had been solved—it was attributed to a random act of violence committed by two "[[hooligans]]" with links to a gangster called "Cyclops". Both of the killers were said to now be dead. The claim was dismissed by the opposition and by the government's own prosecutor-general, whose office issued a statement denying Smirnov's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1336002.stm |work=BBC|title=Judge denies journalist's murder solved|date=17 May 2001|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass protests again broke out in Kiev and other Ukrainian cities in September 2002 to mark the second anniversary of Gongadze's death. The demonstrators again called for Kuchma's resignation but the protests again failed to achieve their goal, with police breaking up the protesters' camp.

The prosecutor of the Tarascha district, where Gongadze's body was found, was convicted in May 2003 for abuse of office and falsification of evidence. Serhiy Obozov was found guilty of forging documents and negligence in the investigation and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. However, he was immediately released due to a provision of Ukraine's amnesty laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3007275.stm|work=BBC|title=Ukraine official sentenced over journalist murder|date=7 May 2003|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the government claimed that a convicted gangster identified only as "K" had confessed to Gongadze's murder, although there was no independent confirmation of the claim. The ongoing investigation received a setback when a key witness died of spinal injuries apparently sustained while in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3827859.stm|work=BBC News|title='Killer admits' Gongadze murder|date=21 June 2004|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gongadze's death became a major issue in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]], in which the opposition candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] pledged to solve the case if he became president. Yushchenko did become president following the subsequent [[Orange Revolution]] and immediately launched a new investigation, replacing the country's prosecutor-general.

The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] adopted on 27 January 2009 Resolution 1645 on the investigation of crimes allegedly committed by high officials during the [[Kuchma]] rule in Ukraine – the Gongadze case as an emblematic example. This Resolution calls on the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office to use all possible avenues of investigation to identify those who instigated and organised the murder of Giorgiy Gongadze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta09/ERES1645.htm  PACE Resolution 1645 (2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220205507/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta09%2FERES1645.htm |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2005, Yushchenko announced that the journalist's suspected killers had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4308681.stm|work=BBC|title='Gongadze killers' held by police|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor-General [[Svyatoslav Piskun]] announced the following day that the case had been solved, telling Ukrainian television that Gongadze had been strangled by employees of the Interior Ministry. Two of the alleged killers were said to be senior policemen working for the Interior Ministry's criminal investigations directorate (CID).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rferl.org/reports/corruptionwatch/2005/03/2-040305.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Former Interior Minister [[Yuri Kravchenko]], one of those recorded with Leonid Kuchma in the [[Cassette Scandal]], was also said to be under investigation. The two police colonels accused of the killing have been detained and a third senior policeman, identified as CID commander Oleksiy Pukach, was being sought on an international arrest warrant.

On 4 March, Yuri Kravchenko was found dead in a [[dacha]] in the elite residential area of Koncha-Zaspa, outside Kiev. He had died from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds, though some speculated that he might have been assassinated to prevent him from testifying as a witness. Hryhory Omelchenko, who chaired the parliamentary committee that investigated the Gongadze case, told the ''New York Times'' that Kravchenko had ordered Pukach to abduct Gongadze on President Kuchma's orders. Kuchma himself has denied this allegation but has since been interviewed by investigators. Kravchenko left an alleged suicide note: “My dear ones, I am not guilty of anything. Forgive me, for I became a victim of the political intrigues of President Kuchma and his entourage. I am leaving you with a clear conscious, farewell."&lt;ref name=KP/&gt;

In April/May 2005, Piskun released more details of the ongoing investigation. He told the press that after Gongadze was murdered, a second group disinterred him and re-buried him where he was eventually found, in the constituency of Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz. According to Piskun, the aim was to undermine the government (led by Viktor Yushchenko when he was still Prime Minister). The second group was part of or allied with the [[United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine]] (SDPUo), a pro-oligarch grouping which had been hit hard by Yushchenko's crackdown on corruption and therefore wanted to see his government toppled. According to the journal ''Ukrayina moloda'' (14 April 2005), the SDPUo moved Gongadze in order to discredit President Leonid Kuchma and force early elections, which could have led to party leader Medvedchuk succeeding Kuchma.

The trial against the three former policemen charged with the killing of Georgiy Gongadze started on 9 January 2006. The other main suspect, ex-police officer, Oleksiy Pukach was believed to have fled abroad and therefore charged but not on trial. No-one had been [[indictment|charged]] for ordering the murder. On the day the trial started Gongadze's [[widow]] [[Myroslava Gongadze]] commented on the fact that no-one has been charged for the killing: "They are known and they should be punished just the same as those who will be sitting in the dock today".

In mid March 2008, the three former police officers were sentenced to prison for the actual act of murder of Gongadze. Mykola Protasov was given a sentence of 13 years, while Valeriy Kostenko and Oleksandr Popovych were each handed 12-year terms. But so far the investigations have failed to show who ordered the murder.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7298422.stm|work=BBC| title=Ukraine journalist killers jailed|date=15 March 2008|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and trial of Oleksiy Pukach===
On 22 July 2009, Oleksiy Pukach, one of the chief suspects, was arrested in Ukraine's [[Zhytomyr Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-327487.html Employees of SBU and Prosecutor’s General office detained Pukach], [[UNIAN]] (22 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/13732 Events by themes: On July, 21 Aleksey Pukach was arrested near Zhytomir.

On 28 July 2009, Ukrainian media reported that the remains of Gongadze's skull were found near [[Bila Tserkva]], in a location specified by Pukach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/17825/ Source: Fragment of Gongadze's skull found], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (28 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prosecutor General's Office they did find fragments of a skull there that may belong to Gongadze.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8173441.stm Ukraine finds 'reporter's skull'], [[BBC News]] (28 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/211864.html UPDATE: PGO Finds Skull Fragments Allegedly Belonging To Gongadze] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801112454/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/211864.html |date=1 August 2009 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (29 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2009, Gongadze's mother Lesya gave consent to an examination of fragments of the skull found end-July 2009 under the condition she could take fragments of the skull for private DNA examination she plans to conduct at a private foreign laboratory after the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|2010 Ukrainian presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/25651/ Gongadze's mother agrees to DNA tests of skull that might belong to his son after presidential elections], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (20 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010 she stated that in her opinion, the fragments of the skull found in July 2009 had nothing to do with her son.&lt;ref name=Lesya/&gt;

On 6 December 2009, [[Mykola Melnychenko]] accused [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] of ordering the murder of Gongadze in 2000. Melnychenko offered no proof to back up the claim.

On 14 September 2010, Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General issued a statement stating that prosecutors had concluded that former Interior Minister [[Yuri Kravchenko]] had ordered Pukach to carry out the murder, and stating that Pukach had confessed to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Ukraine-Ex-Minister-Ordered-Journalists-Murder-102871839.html Ukraine Ex-Minister Ordered Journalist's Murder], [[Voice of America]] (14 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gongadze's widow, Myroslava Gongadze, "Kravchenko had had no grounds for such actions", she believes that several people ordered the killing of the journalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/82601/ Lawyer: Several people ordered Gongadze's murder], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Georgiy Gongadze's mother, Lesya, the statement was an attempt by the Prosecutor General's Office to excuse itself for its inactivity.&lt;ref name=Lesya&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/82284/ Lesya Gongadze: They want to blame my son's murder on a dead person], [[Kyiv Post]] (14 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September 2010 [[Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament]] [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] stated that the investigation into the murder of Gongadze confirmed his innocence in this crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/82627/ Lytvyn says investigation into Gongadze murder confirms his innocence in this crime], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pukach's trial, on allegations he strangled and beheaded Gongadze, began on 7 July 2011. It was closed to the public.&lt;ref name=KravCPJAug11&gt;[http://www.cpj.org/2011/08/gongadze-murder-suspects-trial-should-be-open-to-p.php Gongadze murder suspect's trial should be open to public], [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (16 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KPR29113PGC/&gt;

On 30 August 2011, Pukach claimed that former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] was the one who ordered the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/8733551/Former-policeman-carried-out-Georgiy-Gongadze-murder-on-behalf-of-Leonid-Kuchma.html Former policeman 'carried out Georgiy Gongadze murder on behalf of Leonid Kuchma'], [[Telegraph.co.uk]] (1 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial he also alleged that Kuchma's head of his [[Presidential Administration of Ukraine|Presidential Administration]] [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] (at the time of the trial [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukraine's parliament) and [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|member of the Verkhovna Rada]]) also ordered the murder of Gongadze.&lt;ref name=KPR29113PGC/&gt;

In December 2011, the Pechersk District Court refused to accept witness testimony of [[Mykola Melnychenko]] as he has not been authorized to gather evidences for a committing crime, while [[Cassette Scandal|conducting recordings in a cabinet]] of the [[President of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=notapes/&gt;

On 29 January 2013, Pukach was sentenced to a [[life imprisonment]] by the Pechersk District Courty of Kiev.&lt;ref name=KPR29113PGC/&gt; Oleksiy Pukach also was stripped of his rank "General of Militsiya".&lt;ref name=KPR29113PGC&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/court-gives-pukach-life-sentence-for-murdering-gongadze-disregards-contract-murder-319519.html Court sentences Pukach to life for murdering Gongadze, disregards claims against Kuchma, Lytvyn], [[Kyiv Post]] (29 January 2013)&lt;br/&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/29/ukraine-gongadze-sentence-idUSL5N0AYEEJ20130129 Ukraine police officer accuses ex-president after being jailed for life], [[Reuters]] (29 January 2013)&lt;br/&gt;[http://news.liga.net/video/politics/803761-ubiytsa_gongadze_ukazal_na_kuchmu_i_litvina_video_iz_suda.htm Gongadze killer pointed on Kuchma and Lytvyn].

On 9 July 2014, Gongadze's widow Myroslava withdraws her appeal against the sentence of Pukach; because (according to her lawyer Valentyna Telychenko) "if the Court of Appeals will meet our appeal, it will be forced to simultaneously release Pukach from custody. We believe that Pukach is a killer and should serve his sentence".&lt;ref name="Gongadze's wife withdraws appeal against sentence Pukach"/&gt; Telychenko blamed former First Deputy [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] [[Renat Kuzmin]] for "speculating with the Gongadze case" that according to her led to "exhausting Pukach length of stay in detention during the preliminary investigation".&lt;ref name="Gongadze's wife withdraws appeal against sentence Pukach"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/07/9/7031398/ Gongadze's wife withdraws appeal against sentence Pukach], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (9 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charges against Leonid Kuchma===
The General Prosecutor of Ukraine's Office cancelled its resolution to deny opening of criminal cases against former [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] and other politicians within the Gongadze-case on 9 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/85674/ Prosecutor general's office can open criminal cases against former President Leonid Kuchma and other politicians], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2011 Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kuchma with involvement in the murder.&lt;ref name="econ1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ukraine's ex-president: Catching Kuchma|journal=The Economist|volume=399|issue=8727|page=25|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|date=2–8 April 2011|url=http://www.economist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision prompted mixed reaction among the public. Former [[Ukrainian prime-minister|Prime Minister]] and the leader of the main [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc|opposition party]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] argued that Kuchma's arrest was no more than a PR stunt designed to distract people from their economic woes and prop up President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s sagging popularity.&lt;ref name="econ1"/&gt; Another theory was that Yanukovych was driven by the desire for revenge on Kuchma, who often humiliated Yanukovych and refused to use force to stop the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="econ1"/&gt; Political analysts suggested that Yanukovych's "display of justice" could also be aimed at winning credit from the West, which has criticised him for usurping power and squeezing out democracy.&lt;ref name="econ1"/&gt;

A Ukrainian district court ordered prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Kuchma on 14 December 2011 on grounds that evidence linking him to the murder of Gongadze was insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/118929/ Court clears Kuchma of Gongadze murder charges], [[Kyiv Post]] (14 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected [[Cassette Scandal|Mel'nychenko's recordings]] as evidence.&lt;ref name=notapes&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/118919/ Court rejects Melnychenko's tapes as evidence in Gongadze case], [[Kyiv Post]] (14 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Gongadze's widow [[Myroslava Gongadze]] [[appealed]] against this [[Judgment (law)|decision]] one week later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/118920/ Gongadze's widow to appeal court ruling to drop criminal case against Kuchma], [[Kyiv Post]] (14 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/119389/ Gongadze's widow appeals closure of criminal case against Kuchma], [[Kyiv Post]] (21 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

First Deputy [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] [[Renat Kuzmin]] claimed 20 February 2013 that his office had collected enough evidence confirming Kuchma's responsibility for ordering Gongadze's assassination.&lt;ref name=BBCNKG20213&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21525593 Ukraine's Leonid Kuchma 'implicated' in Gongadze death], [[BBC news]] (20 February 2013)&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/kuchma-outraged-by-reports-alleging-his-arrest-320725.html Kuchma outraged by reports alleging his arrest], [[Kyiv Post]] (21 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Kuchma's reply the next day was: "This is another banal example of a provocation, which I've heard more than enough in the past 12 years".&lt;ref name=BBCNKG20213/&gt;

===2014 revisit investigation===
On 9 July 2014 [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] [[Vitaliy Yarema]] stated that his Office would [[wiktionary:revisit|revisit]] investigations into high-profile cases "that were dropped unlawfully", including the cases dealing with the murder of Gongadze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukrainian-prosecutors-to-revisit-high-profile-cases-including-gongadze-killing-prosecutor-general-355294.html Ukrainian prosecutors to revisit high-profile cases, including Gongadze killing - prosecutor general], [[Kyiv Post]] (9 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A literary token of respect for the work and courage of Gongadze is to be found in the novel for young adults, "Fair Game: The Steps of Odessa" (Spire Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|1-897312-72-5}}) by James Watson. The book is dedicated to Giya Gongadze, but the theme, of a persecuted journalist and the impact of his revelations about government corruption on his football-playing daughter, Natasha, and his son Lonya, has strong similarities to Gongadze's own fate.

In [[Kiev]] and [[Lviv]] ceremonies marking the disappearance of Gongadze were held on 16 September 2010 (ten years after his disappearance).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/82591/ Residents of Kyiv, Lviv to mark Gongadze murder on 16 Sept.], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name spelling disambiguation==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Note that the [[pronunciation]] and sometimes [[spelling]] of Gongadze's name may differ following the [[phonetics]] of different languages. The original [[Georgian language|Georgian]] name, pronounced ''Georgi Gongadze'' in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], became Георгій Гонгадзе (''Heorhiy Honhadze'') and sometimes Георгій or Ґія Ґонґадзе (''Heorhiy'' or ''Giia Gongadze'') in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and Георгий Гонгадзе (''Georgiy Gongadze'') in Russian. Ukrainian officials often refer to him as ''Heorhiy Honhadze'', as per the pronunciation of the letter Г (H) in Ukrainian, but not of the letter Ґ (G). This pronunciation is also used in the common dialect of southern Russia.

After a recent linguistic reform, Ukrainians have recovered the letter [[Ghe with upturn|Ґ (Ghe with upturn)]] for G, a letter which had been banned during the [[Soviet Union]]. The letter [[Ghe with upturn|Ґ]], which is now used for G and just named "Ghe" in Ukrainian, was re-introduced after the independence of Ukraine, instead of the letter Г (used for G and named "Ghe" in Russian, but now named "He" and used for H in Ukrainian). It had been banned by the [[Soviet linguistic reform of 1933]] as being "non-Ukrainian" (possibly because the Ukrainian letter followed more closely the model of the Gamma letter of the Greek Alphabet, by not adopting the very distinctive letterform of the Russian letter "Ghe" used in cursive and italic styles).

Hence the more correct spelling of Gongadze's last name in Ukrainian (Ґонґадзе), according to the Georgian pronunciation. Some sources also refer to him as ''Georgy Gongadze''.

'''Gloria Taylor''' (c. 1948 – October 4, 2012) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] who was an advocate of [[Assisted suicide|medically-assisted dying]] and suffered from [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), also known as [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]. Taylor began to experience the early symptoms of ALS in 2003. A [[neurologist]] diagnosed her disease in 2009.

On June 29, 2011, Taylor filed an application with the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] asking to be added as a [[plaintiff]] in the [[BC Civil Liberties Association]]'s (BCCLA) death with dignity lawsuit. The BCCLA had filed the lawsuit in April 2011 to challenge the laws that make it a criminal offense to assist seriously and incurably ill individuals to die with dignity. The legal challenge seeks to allow seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults the right to receive medical assistance to hasten death under certain specific safeguards. This case is known as [[Carter v Canada (AG)]].

==Life==
Taylor was a postal worker, residential care worker, motorbike enthusiast and health advocate. She was born and raised in [[Castlegar, British Columbia]] and lived most of her life in [[Westbank, British Columbia]]. Her mother was a former hospice coordinator and volunteer.

After Taylor was diagnosed with ALS, Taylor founded a [[Kelowna]] support group for people living with ALS and she was actively involved in raising money for groups that support people who are living with ALS and their caregivers.

==Dying with Dignity Charter Challenge==
Taylor, the BCCLA, and the co-plaintiffs in the case argue that Criminal Code provisions against physician assisted-dying are unconstitutional because they deny individuals the right to have control over choices that are fundamental to their physical, emotional and psychological dignity and restrict the liberty of physicians to deliver end of life care to incurably ill patients.

The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults. Without a change in the law, seriously ill individuals will continue to suffer against their wishes at the end of life, without the choice and dignity that they deserve. The group argues that the prohibition of assisted dying violates [[Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] because it discriminates against people with [[degenerative diseases]] who have no physical means to end their lives without assistance. They also argued the ban violates their [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 7]] right to life because, if they do want to end their suffering, they would have to do so earlier than they might otherwise want, before they lose the capacity to act.

Justice Lynn Smith suspended her decision for one year, to allow the federal government to change the law to exempt [[physicians]] from [[criminal prosecution]]; but explicitly exempted Taylor from that suspension. The [[Harper government]] appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Assisted-suicide ruling to be appealed by Ottawa|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/07/13/pol-cp-federal-appeal-assisted-suicide.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor’s dream of legal change for herself and all Canadians was realized in June when the B.C. Supreme Court ruled that the right to die with dignity is protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and granted Taylor a personal exemption allowing her the right to seek a physician-assisted death. The case was a major victory for choice and individual rights at the end of life.

Mme Justice Jo-Ann Prowse of the [[BC Court of Appeal]] on 2012 08 10 ruled against the federal government, and in favour of Taylor's personal exemption, saying that revoking Taylor's exemption would cause irreparable harm to Taylor, which outweighs the federal government's interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=B.C. woman keeps exemption from doctor-assisted suicide ban|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/08/10/bc-doctor-assisted-suicide.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exemption allows Taylor to seek doctor-assisted suicide under certain conditions. [http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=gloria+taylor&amp;language=en&amp;searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&amp;path=/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2012/2012bcsc886/2012bcsc886.html The decision can be found here.]

==Death==
On October 4, 2012, Taylor died as a result of a severe infection resulting from a perforated colon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Assisted-suicide crusader Gloria Taylor dies in B.C.|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/10/05/bc-gloria-taylor-dies.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the acute nature and brief course of her illness from the infection, Taylor did not need to seek the assistance of a physician to end her life. Taylor died in hospital, with her mother and a close friend by her side.

==The Case Continues==
The B.C. Civil Liberties Association will be continuing with the death with dignity lawsuit, fighting to protect Taylor’s victory against government appeals. The federal government appealed the B.C. Supreme Court decision and a hearing for the B.C. Court of Appeal is scheduled for March 2013. The BCCLA and individual plaintiffs are represented by lawyers Sheila Tucker of Davis LLP and Joseph Arvay, Q.C. and Alison Latimer of Arvay Finlay.

[[Image:Ferdinand VI 2.jpg|thumb|[[Fernando VI]], who approved the Great Roundup.]]
The '''Great Gypsy Round-up''' ({{lang-es|Gran Redada de Gitanos}}), also known as the '''general imprisonment of the gypsies''' (''prisión general de gitanos''), was a raid authorized and organized by the [[Spanish Monarchy]] that led to the arrest of all gypsies ([[Romani people in Spain|Romani]]) in the region, and their imprisonment in [[labor camp]]s. The raid was approved by the King [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]], and organized by the [[Marquis of Ensenada]], and set in motion simultaneously across Spain on July 30, 1749.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Another Darkness Another Dawn|last=Taylor|first=Becky|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd.:|year=2014|location=London UK|pages=105|ISBN=978-1-78023-257-7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a royal edict by [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] in 1695, Spanish gypsies had been restricted to certain towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/roma/Source/FS2/3.3_roundup-spain_english.pdf |author=Antonio Gómez Alfaro |title=The Great "Gypsy" Round-up in Spain |page=4 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official edict in 1717 restricted them to only 75 towns and districts, so that they would not be concentrated in any one region.

== Organization ==
The plans for the roundup were developed in secrecy. Among the first to draw up plans was the appointed Governor of the Council of Castile, [[Gaspar Vázquez Tablada]], [[Bishop of Oviedo]]. It was later also supported by the opinion of the [[Jesuit]] Father [[Francisco Rávago]], confessor to Ferdinand VI, whose reply about the morality of the roundup can be summarised in his commentary that: 
{{quote|The means proposed by the governor of the council to root out this bad race, which is hateful to God and pernicious to man, seem good to me. The king will be making a great gift to God, Our Lord, if he manages to get rid of these people.}}

The plan entailed sending troops to the towns with gypsy settlements, each carrying sealed set of instructions, which were only to be revealed to the commanders on a date just prior to the roundup in August. The gypsy settlements were to be surrounded, and all able-bodied adult gypsy males were internally deported to [[forced labor]] in the Naval arsenals or to specified mines, prisons, or factories. The women and children were forced into clothing manufacture. Those too ill to travel would remain in military custody until well enough to travel, or until they reached a "Christian death". The operation was to be funded by confiscated goods and homes of the gypsies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Another Darkness Another Dawn|last=Taylor|first=Becky|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd.:|year=2014|location=London UK|pages=105|ISBN=978-1-78023-257-7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanics of the raid varied in efficiency from town to town. The roundup in [[Seville]], where the city gates were closed by the encircling army to prevent escape of the target, created alarm in the general public, who was ignorant of the goals. Special edicts were obtained to prevent the use of churches as [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. The definition of who exactly was a gypsy proved to be difficult in many cases, and was prone to abuse. For example, Gypsies married to non-gypsies were often spared. Nomadic gypsies, already less frequent, proved difficult to roundup. Ultimately, nearly 9-12 thousand gypsies were detained. The latter stages of transport and housing of the detainees proved less organized.

==Reversal==

As protests began to arise from different communities, the orders were repeatedly modified to permit the release of some gypsies, often creating confusion among the local military commanders. Gradually, further imprisonments became sporadic, and in 1763, those gypsies who still remained in forced labor were ordered to be released by the king, a process that took the better part of two years.

==Epilogue==
The ''Gran Redada'' can be viewed as one of the last attempts by the crown of Spain to ''purify'' the country of Spain by large-scale dislocation of a whole ethnic community, preceded by the [[Alhambra Decree|Expulsion of the Jews]] in 1492 and the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609.

The '''Guangxu Emperor''' (14 August 1871 – 14 November 1908), personal name '''Zaitian''', was the eleventh [[Emperor of China|emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], and the ninth [[Emperor of China|Qing emperor]] to rule over China proper. His reign lasted from 1875 to 1908, but in practice he ruled, under [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]'s influence, only from 1889 to 1898. He initiated the [[Hundred Days' Reform]], but was abruptly stopped when the empress dowager launched [[Wuxu Coup|a coup]] in 1898, after which he was put under house arrest until his death. His [[Chinese era name|regnal name]], "Guangxu", means "glorious succession".

==Accession to the throne and upbringing==
Zaitian was the second son of [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Yixuan (Prince Chun)]], and his primary spouse [[Yehenara Wanzhen]], a younger sister of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. On 12 January 1875, Zaitian's cousin, the [[Tongzhi Emperor]], died without a son to succeed him. Breaking the imperial convention that a new emperor must always be of a generation after that of the previous emperor, candidates were considered from the generation of the Tongzhi Emperor. [[Empress Dowager Ci'an]] suggested choosing one of [[Prince Gong]]'s sons to be the next emperor, but was overruled by her co-regent, Empress Dowager Cixi. Instead, Cixi nominated Zaitian (her nephew) and the imperial clan eventually agreed with her choice because Zaitian was younger than other adoptable children of the same generation.

Zaitian was named heir and successor to his late uncle, the [[Xianfeng Emperor]], rather than his cousin and predecessor, the [[Tongzhi Emperor]], so as to maintain the father-son succession law. He ascended to the throne at the age of four and adopted "Guangxu" as his [[Chinese era name|regnal name]], therefore he is known as the "Guangxu Emperor". He was adopted by Empress Dowager Ci'an and Cixi. For her part, she remained as regent under the title "Holy Mother, Empress Dowager" (聖母皇太后) while her co-regent Empress Dowager Ci'an was called "Mother Empress, Empress Dowager" (母后皇太后).

Beginning in 1876, the Guangxu Emperor was taught by [[Weng Tonghe]], who had also been involved in the disastrous upbringing of the Tongzhi Emperor yet somehow managed to be exonerated of all possible charges.&lt;ref&gt;Kwong, Luke S.K. A Mosaic of the Hundred Days: Personalities, Politics and Ideas of 1898 (Harvard University Press, 1984), pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Weng instilled in the Guangxu Emperor a  duty of filial piety toward the Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci'an.&lt;ref&gt;Kwong, pgs. 52 &amp; 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, when the Guangxu Emperor was nine, Empress Dowager Ci'an died unexpectedly, leaving Empress Dowager Cixi as sole regent for the boy. In Weng's diaries during those days, Guangxu was reportedly seen with swollen eyes, had poor concentration and was seeking consolation from Weng. Weng too expressed his concern that Cixi was the one who had been suffering from chronic ill health, not Ci'an. During this time, the imperial [[eunuch]]s often abused their influence over the boy emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Kwong, pgs. 47 &amp; 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Guangxu Emperor had also reportedly begun to hold some audiences on his own as an act of necessity.&lt;ref name="Kwong, pg. 54"&gt;Kwong, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taking over the reins of power==
In 1887, the Guangxu Emperor was old enough to begin to rule in his own right, but the previous year, several courtiers, including [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] and [[Weng Tonghe]], had petitioned Empress Dowager Cixi to postpone her retirement from the regency. Despite Cixi's agreement to remain as regent, by 1886 the Guangxu Emperor had begun to write comments on [[Memorial to the throne|memorials to the throne]].&lt;ref name="Kwong, pg. 54"/&gt; In the spring of 1887, he partook in his first field-plowing ceremony, and by the end of the year he had begun to rule under Cixi's supervision.

Eventually, in February 1889, in preparation for Cixi's retirement, the Guangxu Emperor was married. Much to the emperor's dislike, Cixi selected her niece, Jingfen, to be empress. She became known as [[Empress Dowager Longyu|Empress Longyu]]. She also selected a pair of sisters, who became Consorts [[Consort Jin|Jin]] and [[Consort Zhen|Zhen]], to be the emperor's concubines. The following week, with the Guangxu Emperor married, Cixi retired from the regency.

==Years in power==
Even after the Guangxu Emperor began formal rule, Empress Dowager Cixi continued to influence his decisions and actions, despite residing several months of the year at the [[Summer Palace]]. Weng Tonghe reportedly observed that while the emperor attended to day-to-day state affairs, in more difficult cases the emperor and the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] sought Cixi's advice.&lt;ref&gt;Kwong, pgs. 26 &amp; 27&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the emperor often journeyed to the Summer Palace to pay his respects to his aunt and to discuss state affairs with her.

In March 1891, the Guangxu Emperor received the foreign ministers to China at an audience in the "Pavilion of Purple Light", in what is now part of [[Zhongnanhai]], something that had also been done by the Tongzhi Emperor in 1873. That summer, under pressure from the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|foreign legations]] and in response to revolts in the Yangtze River valley that were targeting Christian missionaries, the emperor issued an edict ordering Christians to be placed under state protection.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, Sterling ''Dragon Lady: the Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China'' (Knopf, 1992), pg. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guangxu Emperor, while growing up, apparently had been instilled with the importance of frugality. In 1892, he tried to implement a series of draconian measures to reduce expenditures by the [[Imperial Household Department]], which proved to be one of his few administrative successes.&lt;ref&gt;Kwong, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt; But it was only a partial victory, as he had to approve higher expenditures than he would have liked to meet Cixi's needs.

1894 saw the outbreak of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. During the war, even though the Guangxu Emperor was nominally the sovereign ruler of the Qing Empire, officials often ignored him and instead sent their [[Memorial to the throne|memorial]]s to Cixi for her approval.&lt;ref&gt;Kwong, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, two sets of Grand Council memoranda were created, one for the emperor and the other for the empress dowager, a practice that continued until it was rendered unnecessary by the events in the autumn of 1898. Following the Qing Empire's defeat and forced agreement to the terms of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], the Guangxu Emperor reportedly expressed his wish to abdicate.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, pg. 186&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor and the Qing government faced further humiliation in late 1897 when the [[German Empire]] used the murders of two priests in [[Shandong|Shandong Province]] as an excuse to occupy [[Jiaozhou Bay]], prompting a "scramble for concessions" by other foreign powers.

Following the war and the scramble for concessions, the Guangxu Emperor came to believe that by learning from constitutional monarchies like Japan, the Qing Empire would become more politically and economically powerful. In June 1898, the emperor began the [[Hundred Days' Reform]], aimed at a series of sweeping political, legal and social changes. For a brief time, after Cixi's supposed retirement, the Guangxu Emperor issued edicts for a massive number of far-reaching modernizing reforms with the help of more progressive officials such as [[Kang Youwei]] and [[Liang Qichao]].

Changes ranged from infrastructure to industry and the [[Imperial examination|civil examination system]]. The Guangxu Emperor issued decrees allowing the establishment of a modern university in Beijing, the construction of the Lu-Han railway, and a system of budgets similar to that of Western governments. The initial goal was to make China a modern constitutional empire, but still within the traditional framework, as with Japan's [[Meiji Restoration]].

The reforms, however, were not only too sudden for a China still under significant [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] influence and other elements of [[Traditional Chinese culture|traditional culture]], but also came into conflict with Cixi, who held real power. Many officials, deemed useless and dismissed by the Guangxu Emperor, begged her for help. Although Cixi did nothing to stop the Hundred Days' Reform from taking place, she knew the only way to secure her power base was to stage a military coup. The Guangxu Emperor became aware of such a plan, so he asked Kang Youwei and his reformist allies to plan his rescue. They decided to use the help of [[Yuan Shikai]], who had a modernized army, albeit only 6,000-strong. Cixi relied on [[Ronglu]]'s army in Tianjin.

Ronglu also had an ally, General [[Dong Fuxiang]], who commanded 10,000 Muslim [[Kansu Braves]], including generals such as [[Ma Fuxiang]] and [[Ma Fulu]], stationed in the Beijing metropolitan area. Armed with more advanced firearms and artillery, they sided with Cixi's conservative faction during the coup.&lt;ref name="Ann Heylen 2004 203"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WSl5cl_wt24C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+gelaohui#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fuxiang%20gelaohui&amp;f=false|title=Chronique du Toumet-Ortos: looking through the lens of Joseph Van Oost, missionary in Inner Mongolia (1915–1921)|author=Ann Heylen|year=2004|publisher=Leuven University Press|location=Leuven, Belgium|page=203|isbn=90-5867-418-5|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z2japTNPRNAC&amp;pg=PA514&amp;dq=dong+fuxiang+catholic#v=onepage&amp;q=dong%20fuxiang%20catholic&amp;f=false|title=Han-Mongol encounters and missionary endeavors: a history of Scheut in Ordos (Hetao) 1874–1911|author=Patrick Taveirne|year=2004|publisher=Leuven University Press|location=Leuven, Belgium|page=514|isbn=90-5867-365-0|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day before the [[Wuxu Coup|staged coup]] was supposed to take place, Yuan Shikai revealed everything to Ronglu, exposing the Guangxu Emperor's plans. This gained Yuan Shikai the trust of Cixi, as well as the status of lifetime enemy of the Guangxu Emperor, and later the emperor's younger half-brother, [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun|Zaifeng]]. Following the exposure of the plot, the emperor and empress dowager met, and the emperor retreated to Yingtai Pavilion, a palace on a lake that is now part of the [[Zhongnanhai Compound]].

Lei Chia-sheng (雷家聖), a Taiwanese history professor, proposes an alternative view: that the Guangxu Emperor might have been led into a trap by the reformists led by [[Kang Youwei]], who in turn was in Lei's opinion tricked by British missionary [[Timothy Richard]] and former Japanese prime minister [[Itō Hirobumi]] into agreeing to appoint Itō as one of many foreign advisors.&lt;ref name="Richard1916"&gt;Richard, Timothy, [https://archive.org/details/fourtyfiveyears00richuoft ''Forty-five Years in China: Reminiscences''] publ. [[Frederick A. Stokes]] (1916)&lt;/ref&gt; British ambassador [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald|Claude MacDonald]] said that the reformists had actually "much injured" the modernisation of China.&lt;ref&gt;''Correspondence Respecting the Affairs of China, Presented to Both Houses of Parliament by Command of Her Majesty'' (London, 1899.3), No. 401, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lei, Cixi learned of the plot and decided to put an end to it and save China from coming under foreign control.&lt;ref&gt;Lei Chia-sheng雷家聖, ''Liwan kuanglan: Wuxu zhengbian xintan'' 力挽狂瀾：戊戌政變新探 [Containing the furious waves: a new view of the 1898 coup], Taipei: Wanjuan lou 萬卷樓, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under house arrest after 1898==
[[File:《载湉读书像》.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the Guangxu Emperor in his study]]

The Guangxu Emperor's duties after 1898 became rather limited. Some{{who|date=January 2014}} have argued that the emperor was effectively removed from power as emperor (despite keeping the title), but he did retain some status.

The emperor was kept informed of state affairs, reading them with Cixi prior to audiences,&lt;ref&gt;Derling, Princess ''Two Years in the Forbidden City, (New York: Moffat Yard &amp; Company'', pgs. 69-70 (New York: Moffat Yard &amp; Company, 1911), accessed June 25th, 2013 http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/DerYear.html&lt;/ref&gt; and was also present at audiences, sitting on a stool to Cixi’s left hand while Cixi occupied the main throne. He discharged his ceremonial duties, such as offering sacrifices during ceremonies, but never ruled alone again.

In 1898, shortly after the collapse of the [[Hundred Days' Reform]], the Guangxu Emperor's health began to decline, prompting Cixi to name Pujun, a son of the emperor's cousin, the reactionary [[Zaiyi|Prince Duan]], as heir presumptive. Pujun and his father were removed from their positions after the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. He was examined by a physician at the French Legation and diagnosed with chronic nephritis; he was also discovered to be impotent at the time.

During the [[Boxer Rebellion]], Emperor Guangxu fiercely opposed the idea of using usurpers as a means to counter foreign invasion. His letter to then [[United States]] [[President of the United States|president]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] is still preserved in U.S. government archives. On 14 August 1900, the Guangxu Emperor, along with Cixi, Empress Longyu and some other court officials, fled from Beijing as the forces of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] marched on the capital to relieve the legations that had been besieged during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].

Returning to the capital in January 1902, after the withdrawal of the foreign powers, the Guangxu Emperor spent the next few years working in his isolated palace with watches and clocks, which had been a childhood fascination, some say in an effort to pass the time until Cixi's death. He also read widely and spent time learning English from Cixi's Western-educated lady-in-waiting, [[Princess Der Ling|Yu Deling]]. His relationship with [[Empress Longyu]], Cixi's niece (and the Emperor's own first cousin), also improved to some extent.

==Death==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}

The Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908, a day before Cixi's death. He was only 37. For a long time there were several theories about the emperor's death, none of them completely accepted by historians. Most were inclined to believe that Cixi, herself very ill, poisoned the Guangxu Emperor because she was afraid he would reverse her policies after her death. Another theory is that the Guangxu Emperor was poisoned by [[Yuan Shikai]], who knew that if the emperor were to come to power again, Yuan would likely be executed for treason.&lt;ref name="mu"&gt;Mu, Eric. [http://www.danwei.org/front_page_of_the_day/kindergarden.php Reformist Emperor Guangxu was Poisoned, Study Confirms"]. ''Danwei''. 3 November 2008.  Retrieved 2 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no reliable sources to prove who murdered the Guangxu Emperor. In 1911, Cixi's former eunuch [[Li Lianying]] was murdered, possibly by Yuan, implying that they had conspired in the emperor's murder. This theory was offered by [[Puyi]] in his biography; he claimed he heard it from an old eunuch.

The medical records kept by the Guangxu Emperor's physician show the emperor suffered from "spells of violent stomachache", and that his face turned blue, typical symptoms of [[arsenic]] poisoning.&lt;ref name="mu" /&gt; To dispel persistent rumours that the emperor had been poisoned, the Qing imperial court produced documents and doctors' records suggesting that the Guangxu Emperor died from natural causes, but these did not allay suspicion.

On 4 November 2008, forensic tests revealed that the level of arsenic in the Guangxu Emperor's remains was 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people. Scientists concluded that the poison could only have been administered in a high dose one time. ''China Daily'' quoted a historian, [[Dai Yi]], who speculated that Cixi might have known of her imminent death and worried that the Guangxu Emperor would continue his reforms after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2008-11-04/world/china.emperor_1_arsenic-poisoning-arsenic-levels-china-central-television?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Arsenic killed Chinese emperor, reports say |publisher=CNN |date=4 November 2008 |access-date=9 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808130711/http://articles.cnn.com/2008-11-04/world/china.emperor_1_arsenic-poisoning-arsenic-levels-china-central-television?_s=PM:WORLD |archive-date=8 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guangxu Emperor was succeeded by Cixi's choice as heir, his nephew [[Puyi]], who took the [[Chinese era name|regnal name]] "Xuantong". The Guangxu Emperor's consort, who became [[Empress Dowager Longyu]], signed the abdication decree as regent in 1912, ending two thousand years of imperial rule in China. Longyu died childless in 1913.

After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911-1912, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Chinese Republic]] funded the construction of the Guangxu Emperor's mausoleum in the [[Western Qing Tombs]]. The tomb was robbed during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the underground palace (burial chamber) is now open to the public.

==Historical views==
In 1912, [[Sun Yat-sen]] praised the Guangxu Emperor for his educational reform package that allowed China to learn more about Western culture. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, historian Fan Wenlan (范文瀾) called the Guangxu Emperor "a Manchu noble who could accept Western ideas". Some historians{{who|date=August 2015}} believe that the Guangxu Emperor was the first Chinese leader to implement policies of modernisation and capitalism. Imperial power in the Qing dynasty saw its nadir under Guangxu, and he was the only Qing emperor to have been put under house arrest during his own reign.

==Family==
[[File:《光绪皇帝大婚图》之一.JPG|thumb|The wedding of the Guangxu Emperor and [[Empress Dowager Longyu|Empress Longyu]]]]

The Guangxu Emperor had one empress and two consorts in total.&lt;br&gt;The emperor was forced by [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] to marry her niece (his cousin) [[Empress Dowager Longyu|Jingfen]], who was two years his senior. Jingfen's father, Guixiang (Cixi's younger brother), and Cixi selected her to be the Guangxu Emperor's Empress Consort in order to strengthen the power of her own family. After the marriage, Jingfen was made empress and was granted the honorific title of "Longyu", meaning "auspicious and prosperous" ({{zh|隆裕}}) after the death of her husband. However, the Guangxu Emperor detested Empress Longyu, and spent most of his time with his favourite concubine, [[Consort Zhen]] ({{zh|珍妃}}), (better known in English as the "Pearl Consort"). Rumours say that in 1900, Consort Zhen was drowned by being thrown into a well on Cixi's order after Consort Zhen begged Empress Dowager Cixi to let the Guangxu Emperor stay in Beijing for negotiations with the foreign powers. That incident happened before Empress Dowager Cixi was preparing to leave the [[Forbidden City]] due to the occupation of Beijing by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in 1900. Like his predecessor, the [[Tongzhi Emperor]], the Guangxu Emperor died without issue. After the Guangxu Emperor's death in 1908, Empress Dowager Longyu reigned in cooperation with [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun|Zaifeng (Prince Chun)]].

==Media portrayals==
In the short [[alternative history]] story ''Foreign Devils'' by [[Walter Jon Williams]], China is invaded by the same fearsome Martians depicted in [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[War of the Worlds]]''. China suffers terrible death and destruction and the Emperor is forced to flee, but by the time the Martians have died off from earthly diseases, they have destroyed most of the Guangxu Emperor's human enemies. The Emperor then proceeds to eliminate his remaining foes, assume unquestioned power in China and enact his reforms, fully and unhinderd. He uses the disarray of European powers, which were also invaded by the Martians, to shake off colonial tutelage and make China a world power 50 years earlier than it did in our history. In this changed history, China remains a monarchy and there is no [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Chinese Republic]]. (The story appears in the collection ''[[War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches]]''.)

In [[Victor Segalen]]'s impressionistic novel ''[[René Leys]]'' (written in 1917 and published posthumously in 1922), the Belgian protagonist is obsessed with the Guangxu Emperor, about whom he is writing a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxrS3LwrMdsC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=rene+leys+book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiM44jbvMLcAhUCaq0KHaMoBJM4ChDoATADegQIARAT#v=onepage&amp;q=rene%20leys%20book&amp;f=false|title=From Occupation to Revolution: China Through the Eyes of Loti, Claudel, Segalen, and Malraux (1895-1933)|last=Hsieh|first=Yvonne Ying|date=1996|publisher=Summa Publications, Inc.|isbn=9781883479138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel also describes the contemporary political life within the Forbidden City.

[[File:Marquess of Waterford.jpg|thumb|The Marquess of Waterford dressed in Eglinton armour, by Robert Thorburn (1840).]]

'''Henry de La Poer Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford''' [[Order of St Patrick|KP]] (26 April 1811 &amp;ndash; 29 March 1859), styled '''Lord Henry Beresford''' before 1824 and '''Earl of Tyrone''' between 1824 and 1826, was an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peer]].

He was the second son of the [[Henry Beresford, 2nd Marquess of Waterford|2nd Marquess of Waterford]], but became heir apparent to the marquessate on the death of his elder brother, George Beresford, Earl of Tyrone, in 1824. He succeeded to the [[marquess]]ate on his father's death in 1826.

==First to "paint the town red"==
{{Wiktionary|paint the town red}}
In the early hours of Thursday, 6 April 1837, Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford and his fox-hunting friends arrived in Melton Mowbray at the Thorpe End tollgate. They had been drinking heavily at Croxton races, and understandably the tollkeeper asked to be paid before he opened the gate for them. Sadly for him some repairs were underway, and ladders, brushes and pots of red paint were lying nearby; the Marquess and his cronies seized these and attacked the tollkeeper, painting him and a constable who intervened red.  They then nailed up the door of the tollhouse and painted that red before moving into the town carrying the stolen equipment.  They rampaged down the Beast Market (now Sherrard Street), through the Market Place, and into Burton Street, painting doors as they passed, pulling on door knockers and knocking over flower pots.  At the Red Lion (now part of the Harborough Hotel), they pulled down the sign and threw it into the canal.  At the Old Swan Inn in the Market Place, next to what is now the Grapes, the Marquess was hoisted onto the shoulder of another man to paint the carved swan inn sign there red.  (In 1988, when the old Swan Porch fell down, traces of red paint were found on the back of the carved swan when it was removed for restoration).  They also vandalised the Post Office and the Leicestershire banking company before trying to overturn a caravan in which a man was fast asleep.  Solitary policemen tried to intervene at intervals and were beaten up and painted red for their trouble.  Eventually more police arrived in numbers and seized one of the men, Edward Raynard, who was put in the Bridewell prison.  The others promptly returned and rescued him, breaking three locks and beating two constables, threatening them with murder if they did not produce the key.  The following day there was uproar; when the Marquess of Waterford finally sobered up, he paid for all the damage to people and property, but the group were still brought to trial before the Derby Assize Court in July 1838.  They were found not guilty of riot, but were fined £100 each for common assault, a considerable sum then.  Following the incident, the phrase "paint the town red" entered the language {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}.

==The Fracas of Bergen, Norway==
In the late summer of 1837, the Marquess and his entourage, took a pleasure cruise on the yacht ''Charlotte'', belonging to the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]], to the seaport of [[Bergen]] in [[Norway]] - allegedly with the goal to reach [[The North Pole]]. According to the contemporary report in [[The Times]], the Marquess became, together with a local girl, involved in a disorder and he was given a blow on the head by the "morning star" of a local watchman. The Marquess' life was in danger, but he recovered after a period at the local hospital and his conduct was tried in court. It was reported that ‘The Marquis of Waterford is fully recovered, he was tried at Bergen and sentence passed, he was absolved from the accusation and the watchman from all further prosecution, the latter is to pay the costs’ - due to the interception of the local British consul.

Finally, on September the 18th, ''The Times'' duly printed a brief update of affairs stating: 'The Marquis of Waterford, who some time since received some serious injuries in what his Lordship and his friends are pleased to call a lark, at Bergen, is quite recovered, and has arrived we understand, in this country. One of the Marquis’s party arrived at Douglas’s hotel here on Tuesday, and left next day for the south. We believe the whole party arrived in the Marquis’s yacht at Aberdeen, from Norway.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnmcquaid.co.uk/p/painting-town.html Yesterday in Melton Mowbray]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to Spring-Heeled Jack==
A popular rumour that was in circulation as early as the 1830s claimed that Lord Waterford was the main suspect behind the "[[Spring Heeled Jack]]" phenomenon. However, as that character's acts continued after his death in 1859, Waterford cannot be given sole responsibility.

That Lord Waterford had some role has been accepted by several modern authors, who suggest that a humiliating experience with a woman and a police officer could have given him the idea of creating the character as a way of "getting even" with police and women in general.&lt;ref name="Haining"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Legend and Bizarre Crimes of Spring-heeled Jack| last=Haining| first=Peter| authorlink=Peter Haining (author)| year=1977| publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd| isbn=0-584-10276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speculate that he could have designed (with the help of friends who were experts in applied mechanics) some sort of apparatus for special spring-heeled boots, and that he may have practiced fire-spitting techniques in order to increase the unnatural appearance of his character. They also note the embroidered [[coat of arms]] with a "W" letter observed by the servant boy during the Ashworth incident, a notorious coincidence with his title's territorial designation.

Indeed, Waterford was frequently in the news in the late 1830s for drunken brawling, brutal jokes and vandalism, and was said to do anything for a bet; his irregular behaviour and his contempt for women earned him the moniker "the Mad Marquis", and it is also known that he was present in the London area at the time the first Spring Heeled Jack incidents took place. He was also pointed to as the perpetrator by the Revd E. C. Brewer in 1880, who attested that Waterford "used to amuse himself by springing on travellers unawares, to frighten them, and from time to time others have followed his silly example".&lt;ref name="fn_12_back"&gt;Simpson, Jacqueline. ''Spring-Heeled Jack'' (leaflet, January 2001). International Society for Contemporary Legend Research&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1838 news report referred to "that turbulent piece of aristocracy" and his "nocturnal vagaries in the neighbourhood of Melton", adding that his "name in many quarters is regarded with as much terror as that of Spring-heeled Jack himself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4162345 |title=CANADAS. |newspaper=[[The Courier (Hobart)|The Hobart Town Courier (Tas. : 1827 - 1839)]] |location=Tas. |date=12 October 1838 |accessdate=21 August 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sportsman==
Lord Waterford was a keen horseman and in [[1840 Grand National|1840]] he entered two horses in the [[Grand National]] [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]], regarded today as the most famous race over jumps in the world. Waterford chose to ride one of the horses, The Sea, himself but was sent off in a field of thirteen runners as a totally unconsidered outsider. Reporters noted that, at one stage during the four and a half mile contest, The Sea was almost half a mile behind the leaders, but Waterford persisted and completed the course to finish last of four to complete the course.

==Marriage, death and legacy==
[[File:Louisa Anne (née Stuart), Marchioness of Waterford by Sir Francis Grant.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Beresford's wife Louisa, by [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], 1859]]

In 1842, Lord Waterford married [[Louisa Beresford, Marchioness of Waterford|Louisa Stuart]], daughter of the [[Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay|1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay]], and settled in [[Curraghmore|Curraghmore House]] in Ireland, where he reportedly led an exemplary life until he died in a horse riding accident in 1859. Spring Heeled Jack remained notionally active for decades after, which leads the aforementioned modern researchers to the same conclusion as Brewer's: Waterford may well have been responsible for the first attacks, while it was up to other pranksters who occasionally imitated him to continue the task.

'''Armand-Jacques Leroy de Saint-Arnaud''' (20 August 1798&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/biography/Armand-Jacques-Leroy-de-Saint-Arnaud Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 29 September 1854) was a French soldier and [[Marshal of France]]. He served as French Minister of War until the [[Crimean War]] when he became Commander-in-chief of the army of the East.

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris, France|Paris]], he entered the army in 1817, but after ten years of garrison service he still held only the lowest commissioned grade. He then resigned, led a life of adventure in several lands and returned to the army at the age of thirty as a sub-lieutenant. He took part in the suppression of the {{ill|Vendée émeute|fr|Guerre de Vendée et Chouannerie de 1832}} (1832), and served for a time on the staff of [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud de la Piconnerie|General (Marshal) Bugeaud]]. However, his debts and the scandals of his private life compelled him to go to [[Algeria]] as a captain in the [[French Foreign Legion]]. There he distinguished himself on numerous occasions, and after twelve years had risen to the rank of ''maréchal de camp'' (major general).

In 1848 Saint Arnaud commanded a brigade during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution]] in Paris. On his return to Africa, possibly because [[Louis Napoleon]] considered him a suitable  military head of a potential ''coup d'état'', an expedition took place into Little [[Kabylie]] in northern Algeria, in which Saint Arnaud showed his prowess as a commander-in-chief and provided his superiors with the pretext for bringing him home as a general of division (July 1851).

He succeeded Marshal [[Bernard Pierre Magnan|Magnan]] as minister of war and superintended the military operations of the ''[[French coup of 1851|coup d'état]]'' of 2 December 1851, which placed Louis Napoleon on the throne as Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. A year later he became a [[Marshal of France]] and a senator, remaining at the head of the war office till 1854, when he set out to command the French forces in the [[Crimean War]], alongside his British colleague [[Fitzroy Somerset, 1st Lord Raglan|Lord Raglan]]. Ill with stomach cancer, he died on board ship, shortly after commanding at the [[Battle of Alma|Battle of the Alma]] (20 September 1854). His body, returned to France, lies buried in [[Les Invalides]].

==Legacy==
The town of [[St Arnaud, Victoria]], Australia  was named after Jaques and has a commemorative statue of him in the town's botanical gardens on Napier Street. Another town, located in Algeria, was called Saint Arnaud under [[French rule in Algeria|French rule]]; currently, its name is [[El Eulma]]. The [[Saint Arnaud Range]] and the nearby locality of [[Saint Arnaud, New Zealand|Saint Arnaud]] in [[New Zealand]] both derive their name from him.

'''James Usselman'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XloiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=james+carew#v=snippet&amp;q=james%20carew&amp;f=false The Green Book Magazine page 521 volume 9] Retrieved September 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  (February 5, 1876-April 4, 1938), known professionally as '''James Carew''', was an American actor who appeared in many films, mainly in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. He was born in [[Goshen, Indiana]] in 1876 and began work as a clerk in a publishing firm. He began acting on stage in [[Chicago]] in 1897 in ''Damon and Pythias''.

In 1905, Carew moved to [[England]], where he continued his stage career starting with the [[Lyric Theatre, London]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyranos.ch/spcare-e.htm "James Carew"],  cyranos.ch/spcare-e.htm; accessed 29 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; later working in two plays with Shakespearean actress [[Ellen Terry]], one of the best-known and noted British actresses of the day. In 1907, he married Terry, who was thirty years his senior. The couple divorced in 1910.

Carew made his screen debut by 1917, when he appeared in the film ''[[Profit and the Loss]]''. He continued to take leading roles in films until his death in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/17676 Profile], ftvdb.bfi.org.uk; accessed 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean de Ligne, [[House of Arenberg|Duke of Arenberg]]''' (ca. 1525 &amp;ndash; 1568) was Baron of Barbançon, founder of the [[House of Arenberg]] and [[stadtholder]] of the Dutch provinces of [[Friesland]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and [[Overijssel]] from 1549 until his death.

He was the son of [[Louis de Ligne]], Baron of Barbançon from the [[House of Ligne]] and Marie of Glymes, Lady of Zevenbergen (1503–1566), daughter of [[Cornelis of Glymes]].

Jean de Ligne belonged to the closest circles around [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and was made a Knight in the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in 1546.&lt;br&gt; 
In 1549 he became [[stadtholder]] of the Northern provinces of [[Friesland]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and [[Overijssel]].&lt;br&gt;  
By his marriage to Marguerite de la Marck-Arenberg, sister of [[Robert III von der Marck-Arenberg]] who died without children, he became the founder of the third [[House of Arenberg]]. 

He participated in the campaign in France and distinguished himself in the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)]] where he, together with [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], led the left wing of the infantry in the final attack against the French.

At the start of the rebellion he distanced himself of his good friend [[William the Silent]], [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]] and [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn]], and remained loyal to the King Philip II of Spain.

He was unable to stop the spread of Protestantism in his Northern provinces, but succeeded in 1567 to keep them loyal to the Crown without bloodshed. 

Back south, he joined the army under [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|the Duke of Alva]], but objected against the arrests of Egmont and Hoorn.&lt;br&gt;
When [[Louis of Nassau|Louis]] and [[Adolf of Nassau (16th century)|Adolf of Nassau]] (brothers of [[William I of Orange]]) invaded Groningen, he was sent back by Alva to repulse this army.  

There he was killed in the [[Battle of Heiligerlee (1568)|Battle of Heiligerlee]] on 23 May 1568. [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Cardinal Granvelle]] described his death as a great loss for the Catholic faith and the King.

Arenberg was buried in the Saint Catherine Church in [[Zevenbergen]], and his remains were moved in 1614 to the family vault in [[Enghien]].

He had seven children, amongst whom:
* [[Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg]] (1550–1616), his successor
* Margareth (1552–1611), married in 1569 with [[Philip de Lalaing (1537-1582)|Philip of Lalaing]]
* Robert (1564–1614), first Prince of Barbançon
* Antonia Wilhelmina (1557–1626), married in 1577 with [[Salentin IX of Isenburg-Grenzau]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], who left the clergy to marry her.

'''John Bishop Harman''', [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]], [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]] (10 August 1907 – 13 November 1994) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physician]], president of the [[Medical Defence Union]] and chairman of the [[British National Formulary]]. He was also notable as a medical [[expert witness]] for the defence in the trial of suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams]]. His daughter, [[Harriet Harman]], is a senior [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician.

==Early life==
Harman was born at 108 [[Harley Street]], the heart of medical London, and practised and lived there his whole life.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;[http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/heritage/munksroll/munk_details.asp?ID=2039 Royal College of Physicians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Nathaniel, trained as a [[Baptist]] minister but gained a [[British undergraduate degree classification|double first]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and became an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] consultant.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt; His mother was Katherine Chamberlain, a niece of politician [[Joseph Chamberlain]], and thus cousin to [[Austen Chamberlain|Austen]] and [[Neville Chamberlain|Neville]]. Katherine also qualified as a doctor but devoted herself to her family instead.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt; Both his parents were committed [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarians]], his mother by birth and his father by conversion before marriage; his mother gave a substantial sum of money towards the reconstruction of the headquarters building known as [[Essex Hall]]. His eldest sibling grew up to be a historian and writer, best known under her married name as [[Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford]].

Harman went to [[Oundle School]], where he was very left-wing. According to a classmate, Sir [[Cyril Clarke]], he later "became a staunch conservative, although he was nearly always anti-establishment simply for the fun of it." He went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and then studied at [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]].

==Career==
Harman stayed on at St Thomas's and became a consultant in 1938. He served in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps|RAMC]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Later he edited St Thomas's [[Pharmacopoeia]] reference book.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;

In 1971, Harman took over the chairmanship of the [[British National Formulary]] and between 1975–1978 was instrumental in persuading the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] to make it the [[National Health Service]]'s medicine handbook at a time when its existence was under threat.&lt;ref&gt;The Pharmaceutical Journal (vol.270) p280, 22 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Harman retired in 1972 and took on the presidency of the [[Medical Defence Union]].&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;

==Adams trial==
Doctor [[John Bodkin Adams]] was tried in 1957 for the [[murder]] of an 81-year-old patient, [[Edith Alice Morrell]]. Harman was called as the defence's main expert witness. He gave evidence that though the deceased was being prescribed high amounts of [[heroin]] and [[morphine]] by her [[general practitioner]], it was entirely justified under the circumstances and that it would have done more harm to the patient if the treatment was discontinued.&lt;ref name=Cullen&gt;Cullen, Pamela V., "A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams", London, Elliott &amp; Thompson, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904027-19-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[cross-examination]], however, it was established: that Harman had himself only ever worked as a general practitioner for a total of two weeks. He had only ever treated a handful of drug addicts – before the war. He had never seen 'spasms' caused by drug addiction, despite acting them out for the court in detail – he had only ever read about them. And furthermore, despite being a witness for the defence, he claimed he had at no time talked to Adams about his treatment of the patient.&lt;ref name=Cullen/&gt;

Adams was acquitted, and a second count of the murder of another patient, [[Gertrude Hullett]], was controversially withdrawn. The prosecutor [[Attorney-General]], Sir [[Reginald Manningham-Buller]], entered a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' which the presiding judge, [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]], later termed "an abuse of process".&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, Patrick; "Easing the Passing", London, The Bodley Head, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams was subsequently successfully prosecuted on 13 lesser charges of [[Medical prescription|prescription]] fraud, lying on [[cremation]] forms, obstructing a police search and failing to keep a dangerous drugs register. He was removed from the Medical Register in 1957 and reinstated in 1961.&lt;ref name=Cullen/&gt; [[Home Office]] [[pathologist]] [[Francis Camps]], however, suspected Adams of causing the deaths of 163 patients in total.&lt;ref name=Cullen/&gt;

==Death==
Harman died from a [[dissecting aortic aneurysm]], while driving his car to St Thomas's in 1994,&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt; aged 87.

==Family==
His sister, [[Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford|Elizabeth]] (wife of [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]]), introduced him to a lawyer, Anna Spicer. They married in 1946 and had four daughters who all became solicitors.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt; The best-known of these is [[Harriet Harman]], the Labour politician.

[[File:John Burns b1775.jpg|thumb|John Burns]]
'''John Burns''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], (13 November 1775 – 18 June 1850) was a Scottish surgeon.&lt;ref name=uni&gt;[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2098&amp;type=P John Burns]. Glasgow University&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the eldest son of [[John Burns (minister)|Rev. John Burns]], who was the minister of the Barony Church until his death.

Burns became a visiting surgeon at [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] and the proprietor of the College Street medical school. He was suspected in robbing graves to provide cadavres for dissecting studies. In 1799, he became Professor of Anatomy and Theory at Anderson's University, where he published several text books for students and became an international authority on abortion and midwifery.&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

In 1815 he was appointed the first [[Regius Professor of Surgery, Glasgow|Regius Professor of Surgery]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He wrote several medical textbooks such as ''Principles of Midwifery'' (1809), as well as two religious tracts.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Burns, the brother of two senior figures in the MacBrayne's and Cunard [[shipping]] businesses, was among fifty people who died when the [[G &amp; J Burns]] [[paddle steamship Orion|paddle steamship ''Orion'']] sank off [[Portpatrick]] in June 1850 on its way from Liverpool to Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Shipwrecks by Peter Moir and Ian Crawford (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Isabella, daughter of Rev. John Duncan of [[Alva, Clackmannanshire|Alva]] and had two children. Their first child, John (born 1806) was a member of the [[78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|78th Highlanders]] and later Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Royals and died in service at the Cape in 1853, unmarried. Their second son, Allan (born 1819), was a physician and died in 1843 by [[typhoid fever]] which he caught from a patient.

'''John "Dallas" Donnelly''' (1954&amp;ndash;1986) was an Australian professional [[rugby league]] footballer of the 1970s and 1980s. An [[Australian Kangaroos]] and [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales Blues]] representative, he played for the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] between 1975 and 1984 in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]].

Donnelly who was also commonly known by his [[nickname]] "Dallas", referring to his size, came from the [[New South Wales]] country town of [[Gunnedah]], representing [[New South Wales]] and winning the award for ''country player of the year'' in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crlnsw.com.au/index.php?id=117 Country Rugby League Player of the Year] at crlnsw.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Sydney]]'s [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] club in 1975 and quickly gained a reputation that grew to almost [[cult status]] for his fiery on-field play as well as his off-field [[larrikin]] persona.&lt;ref name="rlp"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Donnelly|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/john-donnelly/summary.html|author=Alan Whiticker|accessdate=7 January 2012| publisher=''Rugby League Project''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Wests, Donnelly formed part of one of the most dominant forward packs in Australian Rugby League history under coach [[Roy Masters (sport)|Roy Masters]] in the late 1970s, earning test selection for [[Australia]] in 1978 against New Zealand. By the 1980s however, he was plagued by increasing weight problems and constant suspensions, subsequently moving to [[England|English]] club [[Kent Invicta|Southend Invicta]] for the 1985-1986 seasons.

Donnelly returned to Australia in 1986 immediately after his season in [[England]] where he took on a position as Captain/Coach of the [[Byron Bay]] side. However, Donnelly who suffered from [[epilepsy]] throughout his career, drowned after suffering an epileptic [[seizure]] while [[surfing]] in the beach at [[Byron Bay, New South Wales]].

Donnelly was awarded Life Membership of the Western Suburbs Club after playing 150 first grade games. Former Wests coach and player Ron Watson said of Donnelly, "I've seen a lot of players come through this club. I've never known anyone as popular as Dallas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Sydney Morning Herald''|title=A town liked Dallas in 2BC|author=John MacDonald|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zWtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6447,7581625&amp;dq|page=41|accessdate=7 January 2012|date=27 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Alan Whiticker]] described his career, "central to the heart of the Wests club."&lt;ref name="rlp" /&gt;

In 2004 Donnelly was named at prop in the Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11786">'''Culling animals in zoos''' is the process of segregating animals from a group according to desired or undesired characteristics; the process often ends with the segregated animals [[Culling|being killed]].  Several reasons are given for culling in [[zoo]]s, including a lack of space, the [[gene]]s of the culled animals are over-represented in the zoo population, the (young) animal might be attacked or killed, or the culled animals have contracted a disease.

Because animals in zoos are killed for many reasons, such as old age or disease, just as [[pet animal]]s are often euthanized because of health problems, it is beyond the scope of this list to identify every case where an animal is killed in a zoo. The list focuses on controversial, unusual or otherwise noteworthy cases where the incident was reported in national or international sources.

'''Louis Lebègue de Presle Duportail'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/valleyforge/served/duport.html Historic Valley Forge – General Chevalier Louis Lebègue dePresle Duportail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources spell his name as '''Louis Le Bèque de Presle du Portail''', with a mistaken {{angle bracket|q}} instead of a {{angle bracket|g}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|lwi ləbɛɡ dəpʁɛl dypɔʁtaj|lang}}; 14 May 1743 &amp;ndash; 12 August 1802) was a French military leader who served as a volunteer and the [[Chief of Engineers|chief engineer]] in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He also served as the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Minister of Defense]] during the beginning of the [[French Revolution]].

Duportail was born near [[Orléans]], France, in 1743.  He graduated from the royal engineer school in [[Charleville-Mézières|Mézières]], France, as a qualified engineer officer in 1765. Promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] in the Royal Corps of Engineers, Duportail was secretly sent to America in March 1777 to serve in [[George Washington|Washington's]] [[Continental Army]] under an agreement between [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the government of [[King Louis XVI]] of France. He was appointed colonel and commander of all engineers in the Continental Army, July 1777; brigadier general, November 17, 1777; commander, [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], May 1779; and major general (Brevet), November 16, 1781.

Duportail participated in fortifications planning from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where he was captured following the surrender of the city in May 1780, and helped Washington evolve the primarily defensive military strategy that wore down the British Army.  Subsequently exchanged, he also directed the construction of [[siege]] works at the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]], site of the decisive Franco-American victory of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].  During the encampment at [[Valley Forge]] in late-1777 and early-1778, his headquarters was at [[Cressbrook Farm]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.arch.state.pa.us/| title = National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = ARCH: Pennsylvania's Historic Architecture &amp; Archaeology| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2012-11-02}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H001532_01H.pdf | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Cressbrook Farm| accessdate = 2012-11-03| author =Pennsylvania Register of Historic Sites and Landmarks| format = PDF| date= January 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to France in October 1783, Duportail became an infantry officer and in 1788 a Marechal-de-Camp (Brigadier General).  He served as France's [[Minister of Defence (France)|minister of war]] from November 16, 1790, through December 7, 1791, during the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] and promoted military reforms.  Forced into hiding by radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], he escaped to America and bought a farm near [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]].  He lived there until 1802, when he died at sea while attempting to return to France.

Harriman]] (1848–1909) and his wife, [[Mary Averell Harriman]] (1851–1932).&lt;ref name=McHenry&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHenry|first1=Robert|title=Famous American Women: A Biographical Dictionary from Colonial Times to the Present|date=1980|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-24523-3|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her siblings were Henry Neilson Harriman (1883–1888), Cornelia Harriman (1884–1966), who married [[Robert Livingston Gerry, Sr.|Robert Livingston Gerry]] (1877–1957),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1908/03/04/archives/miss-harriman-bride-of-robert-l-gerry-grace-church-so-crowded-by.html New York Times article dated March 4, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=tNQpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Robert+livingston+Gerry+1877+1957&amp;dq=Robert+livingston+Gerry+1877+1957&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjenp2D5cPeAhUosFQKHeD7CFIQ6AEIMDAB ''EL Harriman at Arden Farms'']&lt;/ref&gt; Carol Averell Harriman (1889–1948), who married R.

Roland Harriman|Edward Roland Noel Harriman]] (1895–1978), who married [[Gladys Fries Harriman|Gladys Fries]] (1896–1983).

Mary attended [[Barnard College]], where she specialized in sociology and was a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]].

== Career ==
=== The Junior League ===
[[Image:Rumsey, Charles, Mary, children.jpg|thumb|Charles, Mary Averell, Mary, Charles Jr., c.1919]]
Inspired by a lecture on the [[settlement movement]], Mary, along with several friends, began volunteering at the College Settlement on Rivington Street in New York City's [[Lower East Side]], a large immigrant enclave.  Through her work at the College Settlement, Mary became convinced that there was more she could do to help others.  Subsequently, Mary and a group of 80 debutantes established the Junior League for the Promotion of Settlement Movements in 1901, while she was still a student at Barnard College.  The purpose of the Junior League would be to unite interested debutantes in joining the Settlement Movement in New York City.

Realizing their lack of experience in dealing with the issues that faced people seeking help at the settlement house, Mary and League leaders brought together experts on the Settlement Movement to provide lectures and instruction to Junior League members.  With better preparation came greater engagement leading to increased interest in membership by women notable in New York society; members would come to include [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Dorothy Payne Whitney|Dorothy Whitney Straight]] and [[Ruth Draper]].

As word of the work of the young Junior League women in New York spread, women throughout the country and beyond formed Junior Leagues in their communities.  In time, Leagues would expand their efforts beyond settlement house work to respond to the social, health and educational issues of their respective communities. In 1921, approximately 30 Leagues banded together to form the Association of Junior Leagues of America to provide support to one another. With the creation of the Association, it was Mary that insisted that although it was important for all Leagues to learn from one another and share best practices, each League was ultimately beholden to its respective community and should thus function to serve that community’s needs.

As the 20th century progressed, more Junior Leagues were formed throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  Now known as the [[Association of Junior Leagues International Inc.]] (AJLI), the organization encompasses 292 member Leagues, with over 160,000 members committed to continuing the legacy established by its founder.

===Consumer Advisory Board===
In 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Mary to chair the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB) of the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA), the first government consumer rights group.&lt;ref name="McHenry" /&gt;

Despite her inexperience, Mary's work with farming cooperatives and belief in the power of cooperation would come to be her greatest assets.  Mary would promote the formation of consumer groups across the nation and encourage these groups to report their grievances to her office.

Mary Rumsey's legacy to New Deal reforms would be continued by her younger brother, [[W. Averell Harriman]].  Averell was encouraged by his older sister to leave his finance job and join her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal.  Averell joined the NRA, marking the beginning of his political career.

== Personal life ==
In 1910, Mary married sculptor and polo player [[Charles Cary Rumsey]] (1879–1922), shortly after the death of her father on September 9, 1909. Rumsey had been working at Arden House, creating one of the principal fireplace surrounds, as well as other decorative sculpture. By all accounts, the two had a happy marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://portwashington-news.com/mary-harriman-rumsey-a-woman-ahead-of-her-time/|title=Mary Harriman Rumsey: A woman ahead of her time|date=2015-09-07|work=Port Washington News|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had a daughter and two sons.

[[File:Merrillblossernappanee.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The young Merrill Blosser in [[Nappanee, Indiana]].]]
'''Merrill Blosser''' (May 28, 1892 – January 9, 1983) was the creator of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Freckles and His Friends]]'', which had a long run (1915–71).&lt;ref name=evening&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19450920&amp;id=Oo8LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GVUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4337,3383747 "Freckles and His Friends' is 30 Years Old" ''Evening Independent'', September 20, 1945.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although his strip was set in the small town of Shadyside, it was obviously based on Blosser's hometown of [[Nappanee, Indiana]], since Blosser often referenced real Nappanee locations, such as Johnson's Drug Store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciefield.net/blosserlinks.html Lucie's Genealogy: Blosser Information]&lt;/ref&gt; Six successful cartoonists lived in Nappanee as children, including [[Fred Neher]] (''[[Life’s Like That]]'') and [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]] (''[[Smokey Stover]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqa3S-HlqkoC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Freckles+and+His+Friends%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-qf3c3nUBH&amp;sig=T3godybIg1Kg9pewOt9oIh8dP8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA75,M1 Cavinder, Fred D. ''More Amazing Tales from Indiana''. Indiana University Press, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up in Nappanee, where he was born, Blosser was encouraged by his parents to take drawing lessons, and he signed up for [[Charles N. Landon]]'s correspondence course. When Blosser was 12 years old, ''National Magazine'' held a writing competition, and he was a winner with his essay, "The Best Way to Spend $300." The prize was a trip to Washington, D.C.

Touring the city, the prizewinners were taken to the White House to meet President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Lagging behind, Blosser drew a sketch of Roosevelt which prompted the President to exclaim, "Bully!" He then kept Blosser with him for half a day, advising him to continue in the field of art.&lt;ref name=albertan/&gt; Expelled from high school after he displayed caricatures of the high school faculty, including a drawing of the school principal as Satan, Blosser described the suspension as "the best break I ever had."

While attending Blue Ridge College in [[Union Bridge, Maryland]], in 1911, Blosser sold drawings to the ''[[Frederick News-Post|Frederick News]]'' in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. When he was 20, he quit school after selling a cartoon to the ''[[Baltimore News-American|Baltimore American]]'' in 1912. Blosser studied at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]]. He did cartoons for Chicago's ''Motor-Cycling'' magazine and magazines at the Denton Publishing Company in Cleveland, and he also drew political cartoons for the ''Wheeling Register'' and ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''.

==''Freckles and His Friends''==
[[File:Frecklesandhis122147.jpg|right|thumb|550px|Merrill Blosser's ''Freckles and His Friends'' and ''Hector'' (December 21, 1947)]]
Landon was also an editor at [[United Media|Newspaper Enterprise Association]], and in May 1915, he hired Blosser to work at NEA. Blosser was 23 when he began in the NEA art department, initially doing cartoons based on news events and then drawing five daily panels. One of these, titled ''Freckles'', began as a one-column daily gag panel on August 16, expanding into a full comic strip on September 20 when it was retitled ''Freckles and His Friends''. One by one, each of the other panels were dropped.

In July 1916, Blosser started another strip, ''Miniature Movies'', which evolved into ''Chestnut Charlie'', continuing until early in 1918 when Blosser concentrated exclusively on ''Freckles and His Friends''.&lt;ref name=albertan&gt;[http://ilovecomix.myjungledisk.com/ilovecomix/Comic%20Archives/Comic%20Strips/F/Freckles/FrecklesHistory.jpg ''The Albertan'', October 3, 1945.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazing"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cavinder | first = Fred D. | title = More Amazing Tales from Indiana | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 2003 | pages = 75 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqa3S-HlqkoC&amp;pg=PA75 | isbn = 0-253-21653-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Arcadia==
Blosser married shortly after he drew the earliest ''Freckles and His Friends'' strips. For years, the couple lived in Cleveland, where the NEA office was located, until they moved in 1927 to Los Angeles. During the early 1940s, they lived at 751 Masselin Avenue before moving to the Los Angeles suburb of [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]]. Asked about his activities away from his drawing table, Blosser responded that he "travels, swims, and lives a simple life." A 1945 syndicated  newspaper profile of Blosser described his life in Arcadia during the 1940s:
:Blosser had a beautiful home built to his own ideas. He has his own studio there and does all his work at home. He likes to raise flowers and vegetables, but he doesn't like to mow lawns, so he planted his front yard in variegated ivy instead of grass. It worked out fine. He is youthful, friendly and enthusiastic. He likes the outdoors, loves football games, long automobile rides and kids. He admires good art work and is a collector of fine paintings.&lt;ref name=evening/&gt;&lt;ref name=albertan/&gt;

Blosser, who said he aimed for "simply good humor," was influenced by cartoonist [[Walter Hoban]] (''Jerry on the Job''). After his first few decades of doing the strip, Blosser shared the work with [[Henry Formhals]], who began as Blosser's assistant in 1935. Eventually, Blosser drew the [[Sunday strip]]s, while Formhals, beginning in 1938, drew the [[daily strip]]s. The last daily strip signed by Blosser was on February 12, 1966. Daily strips between February 14 and March 19 have Formhals' signature covered with opaque white. The March 21, 1966, daily strip is the first to carry Formhals' signature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/b/blosser_m.htm Syracuse University Special Collections: Merrill Blosser]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Although the characters in the strip never joined up with the military during [[World War II]], Blosser's use of the strip to promote the sale of War Bonds brought him a personal citation from Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;"Freckles to Retire", ''Lawton Constitution'' (Lawton, Oklahoma) August 27, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York in May, 1965, the [[National Cartoonists Society]] held a testimonial dinner honoring Blosser. The NCS gave him an award "in recognition of the wholesome entertainment he has brought his myriad readers" and for the creation of "the oldest regular comic strip still piloted by its creator."&lt;ref&gt;[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/nappanee6.html Morehead, Toni. "The Nappanee Six: Hoosiers with National Exposure", Yesteryear in Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Blosser retired, and Formhals then worked alone on ''Freckles and His Friends'' from 1966 to 1971. The strip was discontinued on August 28, 1971. For most of his life, Blosser lived in Arcadia and [[Pasadena, California]], where he died in 1983.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3265">'''Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora''' (June 21, 1967 – May 24, 2000) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] cameraman and [[war correspondent]], working for [[Associated Press]].

After a successful career as a corporate [[lawyer]] in Barcelona, Spain, Miguel became a [[freelance]] [[war correspondent]] first in [[Sarajevo]] and later, an award winning cameraman for [[Associated Press Television News|AP Television]].

Leaving behind his career as a corporate lawyer in Spain, Miguel became a freelance war correspondent in Sarajevo and later in Kosovo, where he was one of the few Western cameraman to stay in [[Pristina]] during the Nato air campaign. His images of Albanians being herded on to railway carriages changed our understanding of what was happening in [[Kosovo]].

After that, he went to [[Grozny]] ([[Chechnya]]). His pictures from [[Chechnya]] were the people of [[Grozny]]'s only window to the world. He also was in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Liberia]], [[Ruanda]], [[Sudan]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. However, as he wrote himself, he experienced the most dangerous moments of his life in [[Chechnya]]. Miguel's images were some of the few informative documents registered by an international agency in that conflict.

Miguel was awarded as cameraman of the year by the Royal Television Society in 2000, recognizing its outstanding job in conflict areas.

Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora and Reuters Correspondent [[Kurt Schork]] were shot to death in an [[ambush]] to a [[Sierra Leone Army]] (SLA) convoy by the fighters of the [[Revolutionary United Front]] on May 24, 2000. In the attack  four SLA soldiers were killed and two other journalists, [[South Africa]]n cameraman Mark Chisholm and [[Greece|Greek]] photographer [[Yannis Behrakis]], were injured.&lt;ref name="Report 25-05-2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/sierra_leone/2000/05/25/two_journalists_killed_by_ruf_gunmen/|title=Two journalists killed by RUF gunmen; two others wounded|date=2000-05-25|work=[[Committee to Protect Journalists|CPJ]]|publisher=[[International Freedom of Expression Exchange|IFEX]]|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel, 32, was "a big man — big of heart," in the words of AP photographer Santiago Lyon.

== From Miguel's Mother ==

“Miguel was a truly extraordinary person, as a son, a brother, as everything. Miguel fought all his life for his ideals and has died for them. He lived the stories he covered, because he felt his mission was to give voice to those who did not have one”.
“I am filled with overwhelming sadness and grief, but in the end I find solace in the fact that Miguel was doing the job he loved and died doing the work he felt ordained for”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20543">A '''minigene''' is a minimal gene fragment that includes an [[exon]] and the control regions necessary for the gene to express itself in the same way as a [[wild type]] gene fragment. This is a minigene in its most basic sense. More complex minigenes can be constructed containing multiple exons and [[Introns|intron(s)]]. Minigenes provide a valuable tool for researchers evaluating [[RNA splicing|splicing]] patterns both ''[[in vivo]]'' and ''[[in vitro]]'' biochemically assessed experiments.&lt;ref name=Stoss /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Specifically, minigenes are used as splice reporter [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] (also called [[Exon trapping|exon-trapping]] vectors) and act as a probe to determine which factors are important in splicing outcomes. They can be constructed to test the way both [[cis-regulatory element]]s (RNA effects) and [[trans-regulatory element]]s (associated [[proteins]]/[[splicing factor]]s) affect gene expression.&lt;ref name=Desviat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desviat|first=LR|last2=Pérez|first2=B|last3=Ugarte|first3=M|title=Minigenes to confirm exon skipping mutations|journal=Methods Mol.

==History==

Minigenes were first described as the somatic assembly of DNA segments and consisted of DNA regions known to encode the protein and the flanking regions required to express the protein. The term was first used in a paper in 1977 to describe the cloning of two minigenes that were designed to express a peptide.&lt;ref name=Poonian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poonian|first=MS|last2=McComas|first2=WW|last3=Nussbaum|first3=AL|title=Chemical synthesis of two deoxyribododecanucleotides for the attachment of restriction termini to an artificial minigene|journal=Gene|year=1977|volume=1|issue=5–6|pages=357–72|pmid=590743|doi=10.1016/0378-1119(77)90040-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA splicing was discovered in the late 1970s through the study of adenoviruses that invade mammals and replicate inside them. Researchers identified RNA molecules that contained sequences from noncontiguous parts of the virus’s genome. This discovery led to the conclusion that regulatory mechanisms existed which affected mature RNA and the genes it expresses.&lt;ref name=Clancy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancy|first=S|title=RNA splicing: introns, exons and spliceosome|journal=Nature Education|year=2008|volume=1|issue=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using minigenes as a splice reporting vector to explore the effects of RNA splicing regulation naturally followed and remains the major use of minigenes to date.

In order to provide a good minigene model, the gene fragment should have all of the necessary elements to ensure it exhibits the same [[Alternative splicing|alternative splicing (AS)]] patterns as the [[wild type]] gene, i.e., the length of the fragment must include all upstream and downstream sequences which can affect its splicing.&lt;ref name=Stoss /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Therefore, most minigene designs begin with a thorough ''[[in silico]]'' analysis of the requirements of the experiment before any "wet" lab work is conducted.&lt;ref name=Burge&gt;{{cite web|last=Burge|first=Christopher|title=Burge Lab Software|url=http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/software.html|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[Bioinformatics]] and widespread use of computers, several good programs now exist for the identification of cis-acting control regions that affect the splicing outcomes of a gene&lt;ref name="Ab initio"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Divina|first=Petr|author2=Kvitkovicova, Andrea |author3=Buratti, Emanuele |author4= Vorechovsky, Igor |title=Ab initio prediction of mutation-induced cryptic splice-site activation and exon skipping|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=14 January 2009|volume=17|issue=6|pages=759–765|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2008.257 |pmid=19142208 |pmc=2947103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grodecka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grodecká|first=Lucie|last2=Lockerová|first2= Pavla |last3=Ravčuková|first3= Barbora |last4=Buratti|first4= Emanuele |last5=Baralle|first5= Francisco E.|last6=Dušek|first6= Ladislav |last7=Freiberger|first7= Tomáš |last8= Spilianakis|first8= Charalampos Babis |title=Exon First Nucleotide Mutations in Splicing: Evaluation of In Silico Prediction Tools|journal=PLoS ONE|date=21 February 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=e89570|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0089570 |pmid=24586880 |pmc=3931810}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and advanced programs can even consider splicing outcomes in various tissue types.&lt;ref name=AVISPA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barash|first=Yoseph|last2=Vaquero-Garcia|first2= Jorge |last3=González-Vallinas|first3= Juan |last4=Xiong|first4= Hui |last5=Gao|first5= Weijun |last6=Lee|first6= Leo J.|last7= Frey|first7= Brendan J.|title=AVISPA: a web tool for the prediction and analysis of alternative splicing|journal=Genome Biology|volume=14|issue=10|pages=R114|doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r114 |pmid=24156756 |pmc=4014802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in minigenes are usually reflected in the final size of the fragment, which is in turn a reflection of the complexity of the minigene itself. The number of foreign DNA elements (exon and introns) inserted into the constitutive exons and introns of a given fragment varies with the type of experiment and the information being sought. A typical experiment might involve [[wild type]] minigenes which are expected to express genes normally in a comparison run against genetically engineered [[Allele|allelic variations]] which replace the wild-type gene and have been cloned into the same flanking sequences as the original fragment. These types of experiments help to determine the effect of various mutations on [[pre-mRNA]] splicing.&lt;ref name=Desviat /&gt;

==Construction==

Once a suitable genomic fragment is chosen (Step 1), the exons and introns of the fragment can be inserted and amplified, along with the flanking constitutive exons and introns of the original gene, by [[PCR]]. The primers for PCR can be chosen so that they leave "[[sticky ends]]" at 3' sense and anti-sense strands (Step 2). These "sticky-ends" can be easily incorporated into a TOPO Vector by ligation into a commercially available source which has ligase already attached to it at the sight of incorporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Life sciences|title=Steps in producing a TOPO Vector|url=http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/life-science/cloning/topo/topo-resources/the-technology-behind-topo-cloning.html|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Step 3). The subsequent TOPO Vectors can be transfected into E.coli cells (Step 4). After incubation, total RNA can be extracted from the bacterial colonies and analyzed using [[RT-PCR]] to quantify ratios of exon inclusion/exclusion (step 5). The minigene can be transfected into different cell types with various splicing factors to test trans-acting elements (Step 6). The expressed genes or the proteins they encode can be analyzed to evaluate splicing components and their effects via a variety of methods including [[Nucleic acid hybridisation#Hybridization|hybridization]] or [[size-exclusion chromatography]].&lt;ref name=Stoss /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;

==Uses==

[[RNA splicing]] errors have been estimated to occur in a third of genetic diseases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} To understand [[pathogenesis]] and identify potential targets of therapeutic intervention in these diseases, explicating the splicing elements involved is essential.&lt;ref name=Kian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=Kian|author2=Huat |last3=Ferraris|first3= Luciana |last4=Filloux|first4= Madeleine E.|last5=Raphael|first5=Benjamin J.|last6= Fairbrother|first6= William G.|title=Using positional distribution to identify splicing elements and predict pre-mRNA processing defects in human genes|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=108|issue=27|pages=11093–6|doi=10.1073/pnas.1101135108|pmid=21685335|accessdate=|pmc=3131313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the complete set of components involved in splicing presents many challenges due to the abundance of alternative splicing, which occurs in most human genes, and the specificity in which splicing is carried out ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;  Splicing is distinctly conducted from cell type to cell type and across different stages of cellular development. Therefore, it is critical that any ''[[in vitro]]'' or bioinformatic assumptions about splicing regulation are confirmed ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=Stamm&gt;{{cite web|last=Stamm|first=Stefan|title=Stamms-lab.net|url=http://www.stamms-lab.net/minigenes.htm|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Minigenes are used to elucidate ''cis''-regulatory elements, ''trans''-regulatory elements and other regulators of pre-mature RNA splicing ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Thomas A.|title=Use of minigene systems to dissect alternative splicing elements.|journal=Methods|date=December 2005|volume=37|issue=4|pages=331–340|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2005.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minigenes have been applied to the study of a diverse array of genetic diseases due to the aforementioned abundance of alternatively spliced genes and the specificity and variation observed in splicing regulation.&lt;ref name=Stoss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoss|first=O|last2=Stoilov|first2=P|last3=Hartmann|first3=AM|last4=Nayler|first4=O|last5= Stamm|first5=S|title=The in vivo minigene approach to analyze tissue-specific splicing.|journal=Brain Research. Brain Research Protocols|date=Dec 1999|volume=4|issue=3|pages=383–94|pmid=10592349|doi=10.1016/s1385-299x(99)00043-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stamm /&gt; The following are examples of minigene use in various diseases. While it is not an exhaustive list, it does provide a better understanding of how minigenes are utilized.

===Endocrine diseases===

RNA splicing errors can have drastic effects on how proteins function, including the hormones secreted by the [[endocrine system]]. These effects on hormones have been identified as the cause of many endocrine disorders including thyroid-related pathological conditions, [[rickets]], [[hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia]] and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].&lt;ref name="Miranda, Endocrine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosaria de Miranda|first=Elizabete|title=Splicing variants impact in thyroid normal physiology and pathological conditions|journal=Arq Bras Endocrino Metab.|year=2009|volume=53|issue=6|pages=709–714|doi=10.1590/S0004-27302009000600003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One specific example of a splicing error causing an endocrine disease that has been studied using minigenes is a type of [[growth hormone deficiency]] called isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), a disease that results in growth failure. IGHD type II is an autosomal dominant form caused by a mutation in the intervening sequence (IVS) adjacent to exon 3 of the gene encoding growth hormone 1, the GH-1 gene. This mutated form of IVS3 causes exon 3 to be skipped in the mRNA product. The mRNA (-E3) encodes a truncated form of hGH that then inhibits normal hGH secretion.  Minigenes were used to determine that a [[point mutation]] within an intron splice enhancer (ISE) embedded in IVS3 was to blame for the skipping of E3.  Moreover, it was determined that the function of the ISE is influenced by a nearby [[Ac/Ds Activator/Dissociation Transposable Element|transposable AC element]], revealing that this particular splicing error is caused by a trans-acting factor.&lt;ref name="Mullis - Endocrine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullis|first=PE|title=Genetics of isolated growth hormone deficiency.|journal=J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol|year=2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=52–62|doi=10.4274/jcrpe.v2i2.52|pmc=3014602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurodegenerative diseases===

Accumulation of [[tau protein]] is associated with [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]] including [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] diseases as well as other [[Tauopathy|tauopathies]].&lt;ref name="Kar, Neuro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kar|first=Amar|first2= Kazuo |last2=Fushimi|first3= Xiaohong|last3= Zhou|first4= Payal |last4=Ray|first5= Chen |last5=Shi|first6= Xiaoping|last6= Chen|first7= Zhiren |last7=Liu|first8= She |last8=Chen|first9= Jane Y.|last9= Wu|title=RNA Helicase p68 (DDX5) Regulates tau Exon 10 Splicing by Modulating a Stem-Loop Structure at the 5′ Splice Site|journal=Mol.

The regulation of tau splicing is specific to stage of development, physiology and location. Errors in tau splicing can occur in both exons and introns and, depending on the error, result in changes to protein structure or loss of function.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez-Martin, Neuro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez-Martin|first=Teresa|author2=Karen Anthony|author3= Mariano A.

Minigenes have been used by several researchers to help understand the regulatory components responsible for mRNA splicing of the TAU gene.&lt;ref name="Kar, Neuro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez-Martin, Neuro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anfossi - Neuro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anfossi|first=M|last2=Vuono|first2=R|last3= Maletta|first3=R|last4= Virdee|first4=K|last5= Mirabelli|first5=M|last6= Colao|first6=R|last7= Puccio|first7=G|last8= Bernardi|first8=L|last9= Frangipane|first9=F|last10= Gallo|first10=M|last11= Geracitano|first11=S|last12= Tomaino|first12=C|last13= Curcio|first13=SA|last14= Zannino|first14=G|last15= Lamenza|first15=F|last16= Duyckaerts|first16=C|last17= Spillantini|first17=MG|last18= Losso|first18=MA|last19= Bruni|first19=AC|title=Compound heterozygosity of 2 novel MAPT mutations in frontotemporal dementia|journal=Neurobiol Aging|year=2011|volume=32|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.12.013|pages=757.e1–757.e11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
Cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease that can be hereditary or the result of environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Rajan Cancer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajan|first=P.|last2=Elliott|first2=DJ|last3=Robson|first3=CN|last4=Leung|first4=HY|title=Alternative splicing and biological heterogeneity in prostate cancer.|journal=Nat Rev Urol |date=Aug 2009 |pages=454–460 |volume=6|issue=8|doi=10.1038/nrurol.2009.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Minigenes are used to help oncologists understand the roles [[Precursor mRNA|pre-mRNA]] splicing plays in different cancer types. Of particular interest are cancer specific genetic mutations that disrupt normal splicing events, including those affecting [[spliceosome]] components and [[RNA-binding protein]]s such as [[Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle|heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticules (hnRNP)]], [[SR protein|serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins]] and [[snRNP|small ribonucleoproteins (snRNP)]].&lt;ref name="Adler - cancer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adler|first=AS|last2=McCleland|first2=ML|last3=Yee|first3=S|last4=Yaylaoglu|first4=M|last5=Hussain|first5=S|last6=Cosino|first6=E|last7=Quinones|first7=G|last8=Modrusan|first8=Z|last9=Seshagiri|first9=S|last10=Torres|first10=E|last11=Chopra|first11=VS|last12=Haley|first12=B|last13=Zhang|first13=Z|last14=Blackwood|first14=EM|last15=Singh|first15=M|last16=Junttila|first16=M|last17=Stephan|first17=JP|last18=Liu|first18=J|last19=Pau|first19=G|last20=Fearon|first20=ER|last21=Jiang|first21=Z|last22=Firestein|first22=R|title=An integrative analysis of colon cancer identifies an essential function for PRPF6 in tumor growth|journal=Genes Dev.|date=May 2014|pmid=24788092|doi=10.1101/gad.237206.113|volume=28|issue=10|pages=1068–84|pmc=4035536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guo - Cancer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guo|first=Rong|author2=Yong Li |author3=Jinying Ning |author4=Dan Sun |author5=Lianjun Lin |author6=Xinmin Liu |title=HnRNP A1/A2 and SF2/ASF Regulate Alternative Splicing of Interferon Regulatory Factor-3 and Affect Immunomodulatory Functions in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=4|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0062729 |pages=e62729 |pmid=23658645 |pmc=3639176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins encoded by aberrantly spliced pre-mRNAs are functionally different and contribute to the characteristic anomalies exhibited by cancer cells, including their ability to proliferate, invade and undergo angiogenesis, and metastasis.&lt;ref name="Guo - Cancer" /&gt; Minigenes help researchers identify genetic mutations in cancer that result in splicing errors and determine the downstream effects those splicing errors have on gene expression.&lt;ref name="Acedo breast cancer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acedo|first=Alberto |author2=David J Sanz |author3=Mercedes Durán |author4=Mar Infante |author5=Lucía Pérez-Cabornero |author6=Cristina Miner |author7=Eladio A Velasco|title=Comprehensive splicing functional analysis of DNA variants of the BRCA2 gene by hybrid minigenes|journal=Breast Cancer Research|year=2012|volume=14|issue=3|doi=10.1186/bcr3202 |pages=R87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using knowledge obtained from studies employing minigenes, oncologists have proposed tests designed to detect products of abnormal gene expression for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref name="Di Giacomo - Cancer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di Giacomo|first=D.|last2=Gaildrat|first2=P|last3=Abuli|first3=A|last4=Abdat|first4=J|last5=Frébourg|first5=T|last6=Tosi|first6=M|last7=Martins|first7=A|title=Functional analysis of a large set of BRCA2 exon 7 variants highlights the predictive value of hexamer scores in detecting alterations of exonic splicing regulatory elements|journal=Hum.

'''Miro Aaltonen''' (born 7 June 1993) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]. He is currently playing with [[HC Vityaz]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-sign-khl-forward-miro-aaltonen-entry-level-contract/  | title = Miro Aaltonen signing with Toronto Maple Leafs | publisher = ''[[Sportsnet.ca]]'' | date = 2017-03-17 | accessdate = 2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaltonen was selected by [[Atlant Moscow Oblast]] in the 2nd round (45th overall) of the [[2011 KHL Junior Draft]], and he was also selected by the [[Anaheim Ducks]] in the 6th round (177th overall) of the [[2013 NHL Entry Draft]].

==Playing career==
Following the [[2016-17 KHL season|2016–17]] season, after recording a career best 44 points in 59 games after his first season with [[HC Vityaz]] in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], he signed an entry-level contract with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] on March 17, 2017.

Despite a strong push for a roster spot as the Leafs' [[Line (ice hockey)|fourth-line]] center, he was assigned to the Maple Leafs [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, the [[Toronto Marlies]] for the [[2017–18 AHL season|2017–18]] season. In adapting to his first North American season, Aaltonen established himself among the offensive leaders with the Marlies, contributing with 20 goals and 43 points in 64 regular season games. Unable to earn a call up to the NHL, Aaltonen continued in the post-season with the Marlies, helping claim the club's first [[Calder Cup]] in posting 13 points in 20 games.

As an impending restricted free agent from the Maple Leafs but unable to make his NHL debut, Aaltonen opted to return to the KHL on a contract with former Russian club, Vityaz on July 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb| url = http://www.hcvityaz.ru/news.php?full=9650 | title = Miro Aaltonen returns to Vityaz | publisher = ''[[HC Vityaz]]'' | date = 2018-07-01 | accessdate = 2018-07-01 | language = Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His fighter crashed near [[Raqqa]], Syria, on 24 December 2014 during the [[Military intervention against ISIL|military intervention against the Islamic State]]. United States and Jordanian officials said that the crash was caused by mechanical problems, while ISIL claimed that the plane was hit by a heat-seeking missile.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31021927|title= Profile: IS-held Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YT20141226 /&gt;

ISIL held al-Kasasbeh captive before killing him in early January 2015. It then conducted negotiations with the Jordanian government, claiming it would spare al-Kasabeh's life and free Japanese journalist [[Kenji Goto]] in exchange for [[Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi|Sajida al-Rishawi]], a woman sentenced to death by Jordan for attempted terrorism and possessing explosives.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/family-jordanian-pilot-held-islamic-state-demands-word-071810825.html|title=Jordan committed to anti-IS coalition, despite hostage drama|date=1 February 2015|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Jordanian government insisted on freeing al-Kasasbeh as part of the deal and showing proof that he was alive before it would exchange al-Rishawi, ISIS released a video on 3 February 2015 showing al-Kasasbeh being burned to death while trapped inside a cage.

Al-Kasasbeh's killing provoked widespread outrage in Jordan, and condemnation by leading figures of the Islamic world and subsequently led the Jordanian government to execute two Iraqi militants on death row in retaliation over the killing. In retaliation, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]] ordered [[Operation Martyr Muath]], a series of airstrikes that killed a number of ISIL militants over the course of three days.

==Personal life==

== Career ==

In 2009, al-Kasasbeh graduated from the [[King Hussein Air College]] and joined the [[Royal Jordanian Air Force]]. He completed his F-16 training in The Royal Jordanian Air Force, By 2012 he qualified as an operational F-16 pilot and was assigned to No. 1 Squadron at [[Muwaffaq Salti Air Base]].&lt;ref name="alarabiya1"/&gt;

At the time of his capture, al-Kasasbeh was a [[First Lieutenant]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1"/&gt; He was posthumously promoted to the rank of Captain.

==Capture==
[[File:Two F-16 of the Royal Jordanian Air Force.jpg|thumb|left|Jordanian F-16s, similar to those operated by Al-Kasasbeh, in October 2009]]
The plane al-Kasasbeh was piloting, a [[Lockheed Martin F-16]] formerly used by the [[Royal Belgian Air Force]], crashed after suffering from mechanical problems on 24 December 2014 during a bombing raid on a brick factory during the military intervention against the Islamic State.&lt;ref name=YT20141226&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan pilot ejected over Syria after 'technical failure'|url=https://news.yahoo.com/jordan-denies-jihadists-shot-down-warplane-131419028.html|website=Yahoo News|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordanian government said a technical failure caused him to eject after flying at low altitude, but the Islamic State claimed it shot down his aircraft.&lt;ref name=YT20141226 /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31021927|title=Profile: IS-held Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ejected and parachuted into a lake near [[Raqqa|Raqqa, Syria]].

Unsuccessful negotiations took place for his release. His family applied pressure on the Jordanian government to arrange for his release. Originally, it was proposed to trade him and a kidnapped Japanese journalist, [[Kenji Goto]], for [[Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi|Sajida al-Rishawi]], a failed Iraqi [[suicide bomber]] incarcerated in Jordan since she took part in the [[2005 Amman bombings|2005 Amman hotel bombings]], and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31121160|title= Jordan pilot hostage Moaz al-Kasasbeh 'burned alive'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordanian government insisted on proof that al-Kasasbeh was still alive before it could proceed with a swap. The Islamic State refused and published the video of his killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordantimes.com/jordan-confirms-death-of-pilot-says-killed-january-3 |title=Jordan confirms death of pilot, says killed January 3 |publisher=The Jordan Times |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have assessed IS's offer of prisoner exchange as a gimmick that was meant to put into disrepute or mock the commitment of the Jordanian government to the military intervention against it. There have also been suggestions that the proposal was a tactic intended to free its valued member in exchange for a corpse.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A military operation to free al-Kasasbeh, possibly by [[Joint Special Operations Command (Jordan)|Jordanian special forces]], may have been made on 1 January 2015. Members of an anti-IS group in Raqqa, named [[Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently]], said they witnessed coalition jets bombing targets in Raqqa in some of the fiercest strikes of the anti-IS campaign, while four helicopters dropped off soldiers wearing purported Jordanian Army uniforms. The mission was aborted when IS fighters in the area began firing anti-aircraft missiles at the helicopters, forcing a retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/special-forces-may-have-tried-rescue-jordanian-pilot-muath-al-kasaesbeh-1805416|title=Special Forces May Have Tried To Rescue Jordanian Pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh|date=4 February 2015|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
ISIS supporters used the Arabic hashtag #SuggestAWayToKillTheJordanianPilotPig on Twitter, crowdsourcing and publicizing their execution of al-Kasasbeh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2939196/Was-Jordanian-pilot-burned-alive-sick-Twitter-campaign-ISIS-supporters-method-death.html|title=Was Jordanian pilot burned alive after sick Twitter campaign among ISIS supporters to name his method of death?|publisher=dailymail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/isis-polls-twitter-for-gruesome-suggestions-of-how-to-kill-jordanian-pilot-9949550.html|title=Isis militants 'using Twitter to ask for suggestions on how to kill Jordanian pilot'|publisher=independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.640631|title=ISIS Video Shows Captured Jordanian Pilot Being Burned Alive|publisher=haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film released by the group showed al-Kasasbeh was [[Death by burning|burned to death]] by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] members in January 2015.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/01/us-mideast-crisis-jordan-dilemma-idUSKBN0L51OZ20150201|title=Pilot held by Islamic State puts Jordan's king in a tough spot|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; His killing was recorded on video and shown near the end of a 22-minute "[[snuff film]]" entitled ''Healing the Believers' Chests'', credited to the ISIS official [[Al Furqan Media Foundation]] and distributed via a Twitter account known as a source for IS propaganda, and on video-sharing sites.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/jordan-pilot-ISIS-execution-unity-Mouath-al-Kasaesbeh-King-Abdullah-revenge/385147/|title=Jordan's King Abdullah Vows Revenge for Death of Mouath al-Kasaesbeh, Who Was Burned Alive by ISIS |work=The Atlantic|author=Adam Chandler|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aol.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2015/02/03/video-claims-to-show-isis-terrorists-burning-pilot-alive/21138558/|title=Video claims to show ISIS terrorists burning pilot alive|work=AOL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nieuws.thepostonline.nl/2015/02/03/isis-verbrandt-gevangengenomen-jordaanse-piloot-levend/|title=Video: IS verbrandt gevangengenomen Jordaanse piloot levend|publisher=The Post Online|date=3 February 2015}} (in Dutch; includes a [http://www.dumpert.nl/embed/6638265/30337e4b/ excerpt] of the immolation via LiveLeak as an inline illustration)&lt;/ref&gt;

The video shows him with a [[Black eye|black left eye]], first at a table and then confined in a black steel cage outdoors and dressed in an orange jumpsuit before an ISIL militant sets alight a trail doused in [[gasoline]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; leading towards the cage. He was burned alive while numerous armed ISIL fighters in sand-colored [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]]s and desert-style camouflage watched on from a distance. A truck finally extinguishes the fire by dumping rocks and sand on it.&lt;ref name="aol.com1"/&gt;

Before he was burned to death, al-Kasasbeh was made to reveal the names and workplaces of a number of his fellow Royal Jordanian Air Force pilots.&lt;ref name="aol.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2015/02/03/video-claims-to-show-isis-terrorists-burning-pilot-alive/21138558/|title=Video claims to show ISIS terrorists burning pilot alive - AOL.com|work=AOL Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martinchulov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/jordan-executes-female-would-be-suicide-bomber-wanted-for-release-by-isis|title=Jordan executes would-be suicide bomber wanted for release by Islamic State|author=Martin Chulov|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their names and photographs were displayed at the end of the video, with an ISIS bounty offer of 100 [[Modern gold dinar#Islamic State|gold dinar]]s (approximately $20,000) for each Jordanian Air Force pilot killed.&lt;ref name="aol.com2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martinchulov"/&gt;

Most Western media outlets refused to show the full video, sometimes describing it or showing images immediately preceding al-Kasasbeh's immolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/02/03/islamic-state-burning-video-news-organizations-describe-it-dont-show-it/|title=Islamic State burning video: News organizations describe it, don't show it|publisher=Washington Post|date=3 February 2015|author=Erik Wemple}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]] posted the complete video on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/02/04/new-isis-video-purpotedly-shows-jordanian-pilot-being-burned-alive.html|title=Jordan executes 2 prisoners after ISIS video shows pilot being burned alive|publisher=Fox News|date=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/04/fox-news-shows-isis-video-jordan-pilot/|title=Fox News website embeds unedited Isis video showing brutal murder of Jordanian pilot|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 February 2015|author=Nicky Woolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian government assessed that al-Kasasbeh was killed [[Death by burning|by burning]] on 3 January, rather than 3 February, when the video was released on Twitter. This confirmed that the ISIS never intended to exchange him for al-Rishawi.

Later on 4 February, Jordan launched its first military response to al-Kasasbeh's killing.

According to U.S. officials, the attacks took place near [[Raqqa]] and involved 20 Jordanian F-16s, and American refueling and radio jamming aircraft assisted. After the jets completed their mission, they overflew al-Kasasbeh's hometown of Karak while on their way back to base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/02/05/shocked-jordanians-rally-behind-king-against-isis-after-video-pilot-killing/|title=Jordanian fighter jets strike hard at ISIS, pay tribute to murdered pilot|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11397577|title=Jordanian warplanes bomb Isis targets|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jordan Radio and Television Corporation]] aired footage shot prior to those attacks, of pilots scribbling messages onto bombs slated to be used in the strikes.

Several clerics, leading figures of the Islamic world and news outlets roundly condemned the killing as murder. However, IS said it could be justified through [[Islamic law]], despite cremation being illegal per Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Even Al-Qaeda condemn murder of Jordanian pilot as 'deviant'... and leading Muslim cleric calls for ISIS militants to be killed, crucified and have limbs 'chopped'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2939536/Even-Al-Qaeda-condemn-murder-Jordanian-pilot-deviant-leading-Muslim-cleric-calls-ISIS-militants-killed-crucified-limbs-chopped.html|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=Daily Mail|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38U4bEhQmM|title=Scholar Khola Hasan on Murder of Jordanian Pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh by ISIS|date=9 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian branch of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the [[Islamic Action Front]], condemned the killing of al-Kasasbeh. Their statement described it as a "crime", without mentioning ISIS. The IAF's leader, Sheikh Hammam Saïd, in a 5 February interview with Radio Sawa, asked Jordan to withdraw from the anti-ISIS coalition, saying "Jordan should not be part of a coalition run by the United States."&lt;ref name="Yoni Ben Menachem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/muslim-brotherhood-refuses-to-condemn-islamic-state|title=Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan Refuses to Condemn Islamic State for Killing Jordanian Pilot|author=Yoni Ben Menachem |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA)|location=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Salam Salameh, a [[Hamas]] member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] (PLC), said "IS members are, in one way or another, considered Muslims and we must not stand with the enemies of [[Allah]] against the people of Allah (the IS)." He added, "Jordan is the reason for al-Kasasbeh having been burned. It was the Jordanian government's decision to send its army into [[Syria]] to assist the [Syrian] government against the rebels in their war, in which it [Jordan] has no interest. It should have adopted a similar position to [[Turkey]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Jordan-Muslim-Brotherhood-ISIS-pilot/2015/02/10/id/623890/|title=Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood Won't Condemn ISIS' Murder of Pilot|publisher=Newsmax|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoni Ben Menachem"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palwatch.org/pages/news_archive.aspx?doc_id=14499|title=Hamas justifies IS' brutal murder of Jordanian pilot - Palestinian Daily News|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Per-Erik Burud''' (15 October 1962 – 13 July 2011)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10080551&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] billionaire and head of the grocery chain [[Kiwi (store)|Kiwi]]. He joined Kiwi in 1991, and by 2007 he was Norway's 134th richest man with a fortune of [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 1.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dt.no/article/20070921/NYHET/709210011/1001/NYHET|title=Rikingene har aldri vært rikere|accessdate=15 May 2008|date=21 September 2007|language=Norwegian|work=[[Drammens Tidende]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
As a five-year-old, Burud worked in his father's shop in [[Drammen]], sorting bottles and wrapping clementines.&lt;ref name="e24"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://e24.no/naeringsliv/ble-kremmer-som-5-aaring/20078980|title=Ble kremmer som 5-åring|accessdate=14 July 2011|author1=Sverre Rørvik Nilsen |author2=Øistein Svelle |author3=Ole Martin Skaug |date=13 July 2011|work=[[E24 Næringsliv]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later went to business school, and was also an active [[gymnastics|gymnast]].

== Kiwi ==
Burud bought a share post in [[Kiwi (store)|Kiwi]] in 1991, when the chain had eight stores. During Burud's time in charge of the grocery chain it has expanded, and by 2008 had almost quadrupled the number of employees and stores, and increased revenues six-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwi.no/page.html?catid=3&amp;subcat=14|title=Mål og utvikling|publisher=[[Kiwi (store)|Kiwi]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521031650/http://www.kiwi.no/page.html?catid=3&amp;subcat=14|archivedate=21 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the chain had 413 stores.&lt;ref name="e24"/&gt; In 2011 the chain had 450 stores, 8,000 employees and the company had a turnover of NOK 20 billion.

Burud was known for his use of inventive marketing campaigns. In 2000, Burud started a campaign in which the chain gave away every fifth pack of diapers for free. The agreement was the start of a fierce price competition in the Norwegian market for diapers. At the same time a campaign started in which the stores promised the customer the item for free if they discovered items that had reached their expiration date. In 2007, Burud launched a campaign against the [[MOMS|value added tax]] on fruit and vegetables, in which the group covered the VAT on 14 percent of all fresh fruits and vegetables, and he challenged the authorities to make the tax cut permanent.&lt;ref name="e24"/&gt;

== Boating accident ==
On 13 July 2011, Burud was reported missing after a boating accident outside [[Tjøme]], where his wife was confirmed dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tb.no/nyheter/kiwi-toppsjef-per-erik-burud-48-savnet-etter-batulykke-1.6362936|title=Kiwi-toppsjef Per-Erik Burud (48) savnet etter båtulykke|accessdate=13 July 2011|date=13 July 2011|language=Norwegian|work=[[Tønsbergs Blad]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police declared on the evening of 13 July that they assumed Burud was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10088581|title=Kiwi-sjefen antas omkommet|accessdate=13 July 2011|date=13 July 2011|language=Norwegian|work=[[Verdens Gang]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several days of intensive search, on 21 July the body of a man was found in the area where Burud went missing.&lt;ref name="Lundh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10097157|title=Mann funnet død ved Tjøme|last=Lundh|first=Francis|author2=Arild Færaas |author3=Heidi Erikssen |date=21 July 2011|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the man was identified as Burud.&lt;ref name="Brustad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/07/22/nyheter/innenriks/ulykke/batulykke/per-erik_burud/17408697/|title=Død mann identifisert som Per-Erik Burud|last=Brustad|first=Line|author2=Tuva Bønke Grønning |author3=Linn Kongsli Lundervold |date=22 July 2011|work=[[Dagbladet]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pinus yorkshirensis''''' is an extinct [[species]] of [[pine]] [[tree]]. The fossil [[pine cone]] came from [[Hauterivian]] and [[Barremian]]-aged [[sedimentary rocks]] loated in the [[Speeton Clay]] in [[Yorkshire]] (hence the [[Specific name (zoology)|species epithet]]).

==Discovery and naming==
The [[type specimen]] of ''P. yorkshirensis'' was discovered during a [[field trip]] at the [[University of Birmingham]]. It is one of four known fossil pine cones from [[Europe]]. It was 5 million years older than the previous record holder, ''[[Pinus belgica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patricia E. Ryberg |author2=Gar W. Rothwell |author3=Ruth A. Stockey |author4=Jason Hilton |author5=Gene Mapes |author6=James B.

The fossil was destroyed for [[science]] so [[scientists]] could study the fossil in more detail. All that remains are a few microscope slides and a single image. They are currently housed at [[Lapworth Museum of Geology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6122">In [[genetic algorithm]]s, the term of '''premature convergence''' means that a population for an [[optimization problem]] converged too early, resulting in being [[suboptimal]]. In this context, the parental solutions, through the aid of [[genetic operator]]s, are not able to generate offspring that are superior to, or outperform, their parents. Premature convergence is a common problem found in genetic algorithms, as it leads to a loss, or convergence of, a large number of alleles, subsequently making it very difficult to search for a specific gene in which the alleles were present.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Leung, Y., ''et al.'' (1997). Degree of population diversity – A perspective on premature convergence in genetic algorithms and its markov chain, ''IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks'', vol. 8, pp. 1165 – 1176.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Baker, J.E. &amp; Grefenstette, J. (2014). ''Proceedings of the First International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and their Applications''. Hoboken: Taylor and Francis, pp. 101 - 105.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An allele is considered lost if in a population a gene is present where all individuals are sharing the same value for that particular gene. An allele is, as defined by De Jong, considered to be a converged allele, when 95% of a population share the same value for a certain gene (see also [[Convergence (evolutionary computing)|convergence]]).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;De Jong, K.A. (1975). Analysis of the behaviour of a class of genetic adaptive systems, ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)#Uniform Crossover and Half Uniform Crossover|uniform crossover]],
* favored replacement of similar individuals (''preselection'' or ''crowding''),
* segmentation of individuals of similar fitness (''fitness sharing''),
* increasing population size.

The genetic variation can also be regained by [[mutation]] though this process is highly random.

== Identification of the occurrence of premature convergence ==
It is hard to determine when premature convergence has occurred, and it is equally hard to predict its presence in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One measure is to use the difference between the average and maximum fitness values, as used by Patnaik &amp; Srinivas, to then vary the crossover and mutation probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Patnaik, L.M. &amp; Srinivas, M. (1994). Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation in genetic algorithms. ''IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybern.'', vol. 24, pp. 656-667.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Population diversity]] is another measure which has been extensively used in studies to measure premature convergence. However, although it has been widely accepted that a decrease in the population diversity directly leads to premature convergence, there have been little studies done on the analysis of population diversity. In other words, by using the term population diversity, the argument for a study in preventing premature convergence lacks robustness, unless specified what their definition of population diversity is.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Günter, R. (2001). Self-adaptation may lead to premature convergence , ''Fachbereich Informatik, LS XI,'' Universität Dortmund, pp. 1 - 13.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Causes for premature convergence ==
There are a number of presumed or hypothesized causes for the occurrence of premature convergence.

=== Self-adaptive mutations ===
Rechenberg introduced the idea of self-adaptation of mutation distributions in [[Evolution strategy|evolutionary strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rechenberg, I. (1973). Evolutionsstrategie: Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution. ''Frommann-Holzboog Verlag'', Stuttgart.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; According to Rechenberg, the control parameters for these mutation distributions evolved internally through self-adaptation, rather than predetermination. He called it the ''1/5-succes rule of evolutionary strategies'' (1 + 1)-ES: The step size control parameter would be increased by some factor if the relative frequency of positive mutations through a determined period of time is larger than 1/5, vice versa if it is smaller than 1/5. Self-adaptive mutations may very well be one of the causes for premature convergence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accurately locating of optima can be enhanced by self-adaptive mutation, as well as accelerating the search for this optima. This has been widely recognized, though the mechanism’s underpinnings of this have been poorly studied, as it is often unclear whether the optima is found locally or globally.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Self-adaptive methods can cause global convergence to global optimum, provided that the selection methods used are using [[Genetic algorithm#Elitism|elitism]], as well as that the rule of self-adaptation doesn’t interfere with the mutation distribution, which has the property of ensuring a positive minimum probability when hitting a random subset.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rudolph, G. (1999). ''Global convergence and self-adaptation: A counter-example. In Proceedings of the 1999 Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC 1999)''. IEEE Press, New Jersey, pp. 646–651.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is for non-convex objective functions with sets that include bounded lower levels of non-zero measurements. A study by Günter suggests that self-adaption mechanisms among elitist evolutionary strategies do resemble the 1/5-succes rule, and could very well get caught by a local optimum that include a positive probability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Image:A7L plss.jpg|thumb|A Portable Life Support System from the Apollo [[A7L]] suit, with its outer cover removed]]

A '''Primary''' (or '''Portable''' or '''Personal''') '''Life Support System''' (or '''Subsystem''') ('''PLSS'''), is a device connected to an astronaut or cosmonaut's [[spacesuit]], which allows [[extra-vehicular activity]] with maximum freedom, independent of a spacecraft's [[life support system]]. The PLSS is generally worn like a backpack. The functions performed by the PLSS include:
*regulating suit pressure
*providing breathable [[oxygen]]
*removing [[carbon dioxide]], [[humidity]], odors, and contaminants from breathing oxygen
*cooling and recirculating oxygen through the pressure garment, and water through a [[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment]] or Liquid Cooling Garment.
*two-way voice communication
*display or [[telemetry]] of suit health parameters
*telemetry of an indicator of the wearer's immediate health (e.g. heart rate)

The air handling function of a PLSS is similar to that of a diving [[rebreather]], in that exhaled gases are recycled into the breathing gas in a closed loop.

When used in a [[microgravity]] environment, a separate propulsion system is generally needed for safety and control, since there is no physical connection to a spacecraft.

==Apollo PLSS==
[[File:Apollo portable life support system.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the Apollo PLSS.]]
[[File:Plss100.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of the A7L PLSS and OPS, with interfaces to the astronaut and the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] cabin]]

The Portable Life Support System used in the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar landing missions used [[lithium hydroxide]] to remove the carbon dioxide from the breathing air, and circulated water in an open loop through a [[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|Liquid Cooled Garment]], expelling the water into space, where it turned to ice crystals. Some of the water was also used to remove excess heat from the astronaut's breathing air, and collected for dumping into the [[Apollo Lunar Module|spacecraft]]'s wastewater tank after an EVA. The PLSS also contained a [[radio transceiver]] and antenna for communications, which were relayed through the spacecraft's communication system to Earth. PLSS controls were provided in the Remote Control Unit (RCU) mounted on the astronaut's chest. Oxygen and water were rechargeable for multiple EVA's from the spacecraft's environmental control system.

Lunar surface EVA times for the first four missions (Apollo 11 through 14) were limited to 4 hours, with oxygen stored at {{convert|1020|psi|MPa}}, {{convert|3.0|lb|kg}} of lithium hydroxide, 8.5 pounds (3.9 liters) of cooling water, and a 279 watt-hour battery. For the extended missions of Apollo 15 through 17, the EVA stay time was doubled to 8 hours by increasing oxygen to {{convert|1430|psi|MPa}}, lithium hydroxide to {{convert|3.12|lb|kg}}, cooling water to 11.5 pounds (5.2 liters), and battery capacity to 390 watt-hours.&lt;ref name="ALSJ"/&gt;

An emergency backup was provided in case the main system failed, by a separate unit called the '''Oxygen Purge System''' (OPS), mounted on top of the PLSS, immediately behind the astronaut's helmet.
The OPS maintained suit pressure and removed carbon dioxide, heat and water vapor through a continuous, one-way air flow vented to space. 
When activated, the OPS provided oxygen to a separate inlet on the pressure suit, once a vent valve on a separate suit outlet was manually opened. The OPS provided a maximum of about 30 minutes of emergency oxygen for breathing and cooling.&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be extended to 75 to 90 minutes with a "buddy system" hose that used the other astronaut's functional PLSS for cooling (only). This allowed the vent valve to be partly closed to decrease the oxygen flow rate.&lt;ref name="ALSJ"&gt;{{cite web

The PLSS was {{convert|26|in|cm}} high, {{convert|18|in|cm}} wide, and {{convert|10|in|cm}} deep. It was tested at the Houston Flight Center by James P. Lucas, working for [[Hamilton Standard]] and by various astronauts in neutral buoyancy tanks at Dallas. It was tested in space for the first time by [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]] in a stand-up EVA in Earth orbit on [[Apollo 9]]. His PLSS weighed {{convert|84|lb|kg}} on Earth, which translated to a weight of only 14&amp;nbsp;lb (equivalent to the Earth weight of {{convert|14|lb|kg|disp=output only}}) on the Moon. The OPS weighed {{convert|41|lb|kg}} on Earth (6.8&amp;nbsp;lb (equivalent to the Earth weight of {{convert|6.8|lb|kg|disp=output only}}) on the Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The OPS was also used as a backup on tethered in-space EVAs where a spacecraft provided oxygen to the astronaut through an umbilical hose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Space Shuttle/International Space Station PLSS==
Similar systems have been used by [[Space Shuttle]] astronauts, and are currently used by [[International Space Station]] crews.

The '''Primary Life Support System''' for the [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]] suit used on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station is manufactured by [[Hamilton Sundstrand]]. It is mounted to the back of the [[Hard Upper Torso]] (HUT) assembly.

[[Oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[water vapor]] are drawn from the extremities of the suit by the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment or [[LCVG]], which sends the gas to the PLSS. When gas enters the PLSS, [[activated carbon|activated charcoal]] removes odors and [[lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH) removes carbon dioxide. Next, the gas passes through a fan which maintains a [[Volumetric flow rate|flow rate]] of about six cubic feet per minute. A sublimator then condenses [[water vapor]], which is removed by a "slurper" and a rotary separator. The removed water is stored and used to supplement the water supply used in the LCVG. The sublimator also cools the remaining oxygen to about 55 °[[Fahrenheit|F]] (~12.8 °[[Celsius|C]]). A [[Flow measurement|flow sensor]] monitors the flow rate.

Extra oxygen is added to the flow from a storage tank as necessary, downstream of the flow sensor. The oxygen is then returned to the suit at the back of the head, where it flows down over the [[astronaut]]'s face. By delivering oxygen to the helmet and drawing gas from the extremities, the suit is designed to ensure that the suit occupant breathes the freshest oxygen possible.

The operating pressure of the suit is maintained at {{convert|4.3|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}} during [[Extra-vehicular activity|extravehicular]] operations, and {{convert|0.7|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} relative to external pressure while in intravehicular mode, i.e., before and after extra-vehicular activity (EVA).

==Developing technologies==
Technologies being considered for application in future PLSSs include [[Pressure Swing Adsorption]] (PSA), a process by which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be separated from gas more efficiently, and through a repeatable process, as opposed to the current LiOH canisters, which become saturated with each use, and are limited to around 8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16146">The '''Red Guardian''' (Russian: Красный страж, ''Krasnij Straj'') is the name of several fictional [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]]; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name is no longer officially used, though at least two people have claimed the name.

==Fictional character biography==
Many people have taken up the mantle of Red Guardian:

===Aleksey Lebedev===
Aleksey Lebedev, the Golden Age version of Red Guardian, first appeared in ''Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual'' #1. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|Captain America]] (William Naslund) and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]], in July, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redgrd.htm |title=Red Guardian (Russian, World War II, Captain America ally) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career during World War II and met the [[All-Winners Squad]] (formerly the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) on only one recorded occasion, shortly after the war's end.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America.{{issue|date=March 2013}} He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update 2010''#4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was the second version of Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

====Fictional character biography====
Alexei Shostakov was born in [[Moscow]], and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: the latter became the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the "Red Guardian".

Alexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union's most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he shot down a large number of [[Luftwaffe]] fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the [[Soviet Air Force]] win air supremacy over the skies of [[Stalingrad]] and [[Kursk]]. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the [[Mig 15]]. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the [[U.S. Air Force]] over [[MiG Alley]] during the [[Korean War]]. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalie (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.

As the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexi Shostakov over [[Yuri Gagarin]] who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with her KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed "something familiar" about him, he revealed his identity to her. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when the laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, a [[Life Model Decoy]] was patterned after Shostakov. It was destroyed in its first battle with the Black Widow.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Shostakov was much later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]] as [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]. He became responsible for a plot to capture Natasha and try his former wife for crimes as a Soviet super soldier. Natasha foiled his plan with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dr. Tania Belinsky===
{{Main|Starlight (Marvel Comics)}}
Dr. Tania Belinsky, a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed identity of Red Guardian and joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Defenders'' #35 (May 1976).

====Publication history====
Red Guardian first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #352-353 (April–May 1989), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Kieron Dwyer]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Avengers'' #319-324 (July–October 1990), ''Incredible Hulk'' #393 (May 1992), and ''Soviet Super-Soldiers'' #1 (November 1992). The character subsequently appears as the '''Steel Guardian''' in ''Iron Man'' #9 (October 1998).

Red Guardian appeared as part of the "Supreme Soviets" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #7.

====Fictional character biography====
The fourth Red Guardian, Josef Petkus, was a special operative for the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, and appeared as a member of the militant [[Supreme Soviets]]. Alongside the Supreme Soviets, he attacked the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside Captain America, he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the [[Darkforce]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #352-353&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Soviets were later renamed the post-Soviet [[Russia]]n super-team called the [[Winter Guard]]. Alongside this confederacy, he teamed with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Alpha Flight]] to battle the Peace Corpse, the [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] Army, and the Combine.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #319-324&lt;/ref&gt; Petkus later joined a Winter Guard splinter group called the [[People's Protectorate]], now calling himself the "Steel Guardian".&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #9&lt;/ref&gt; When he and his team went off in search of the timelord [[Immortus]] hoping to find a way to resurrect Vanguards sister Lanyia. They agreed to fighting off Dire Wraiths invading his realm in exchange for this favor, Joseph being killed while in the line of duty.&lt;ref&gt;''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

===Krassno Granitsky===
A fifth Red Guardian, Krassno Granitsky, appeared in ''[[David North (comics)|Maverick]]'' #10. He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord.

The name "Krassno Granitsky" comes from the [[James Bond]] novel, ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia With Love]]''; it is the Russianized name of the assassin Donovan "Red" Grant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He also appeared in the first issue of [[Ed Brubaker]]'s ''Captain America'', where he was executed by [[Aleksander Lukin]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Anton===
The sixth Red Guardian, Anton,&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' Vol 2. #35&lt;/ref&gt; made his first appearance in the first issue of [[Jeph Loeb]]'s ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'' series as a member of the [[Winter Guard (comics)|Winter Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Hulk vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Anton claims to be an engineer and a former Crimson Dynamo pilot, and was later revealed to be (at least partially) a [[Life Model Decoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference|Title = Hulk: Winter Guard|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = December 2009|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was decapitated by a [[Dire Wraith]], although his head was kept in storage, seemingly still alive.&lt;ref name="Darkstar-2-3"&gt;''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicolai Krylenko===
Nicolai Krylenko, also known as [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]], is the seventh Red Guardian, and leads the Winter Guard.&lt;ref name="Darkstar-2-3" /&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
None of the Red Guardians have been revealed to possess [[superhuman]] powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence, the Ultimate version, the seventh Red Guardian, and Krylenko. All are highly skilled athletes. Shostakov was an expert pilot, a master hand-to-hand combatant, and was trained in espionage techniques by the KGB&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a Steel shield similar to that used by Captain America. Alexei and Tania used a "belt-buckle" disc, a hurling weapon which magnetically returned to the wearer's hand when thrown, and was a part of their costume's [[Buckle|belt buckle]]. The fourth Red Guardian; Josef Petkus often employed an energized sword as a secondary armament alongside his shield.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' Vol 1 #393 May 1 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth Red Guardian was an LMD named Anton, whose powers are cybernetic based. His falsified backstory was that he's an expert engineer and former Crimson Dynamo pilot, his real strength lies in his moderate degree of enhanced cybernetic physicality. The latest Red Guardian is [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Nikolai Krylenko/Vanguard]], brother to Laynia Petrovna; whose powers are derived from his mutation.&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet Super Soldiers'' Vol 1 #1 Nov 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Which stems to a fullbody force field that repels electromagnetic and kinetic energy, forces he can best guide and direct through a medium like the technically advanced Vibranium Shield supplied to him by Central Command.&lt;ref&gt;''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' Vol 1 #2–3 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Or through a crux like the symbol of his home country; A sickle and hammer.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' Vol 1 #109-112 1978&lt;/ref&gt; He also directs this force against the earth itself to obtain flight. Nikolai wears a more advanced suit than previous Red Guardians, which is lined with circuitry that works in conjunction with the compact computer on his shield. Not only enabling the guided flight and return of which through their digital connection, but the amplification of the effects of his own energy field.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Heroes'' Vol 1 #3 Jul 21 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Exiles/Earth-3470===
In one of the ''[[Exiles]]'' realities, a Red Guardian in full body armor on Earth-3470 appears.&lt;ref&gt;''Exiles'' #84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War: House of M===
Red Guardian was seen as a member of the Soviet Super Soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Civil War: House of M #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Zombies===
A Red Guardian is seen as one of the many zombies roaming New York looking for victims.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Alexei Shostakov is a Russian super soldier codenamed "Captain Russia" meant to be the Russian version of [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]]. This version is certifiably insane and uses a makeshift shield created partially from human remains, and possesses superhuman strength and durability. A fight between the two results in Captain America defeating him, by stabbing him with splintered wood that acts as a stake through the chest, declaring "Fighting is about winning".&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Nightmere'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Shostakov was once married to [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and is now deceased.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colonel Abdul al-Rahman''' from [[Azerbaijan]] (leader of the ''Liberators'') was based on the Red Guardian as the character was a parallel to Captain America, and wears a predominantly red costume and was transformed into a super-soldier by [[Russians|Russian]] scientists. He faces off against Steve Rogers in front of the White House, one on one but is defeated when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] throws his [[Captain America's shield|shield]] to sever his hands and Rogers kills him with his weapon, resembling a double bladed [[lightsaber]]. His body is later taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates 2'' #1-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullet Points===
In the ''[[Bullet Points (comics)|Bullet Points]]'' reality, Alexi Shostakov was shown as many of the heroes stopping [[Galactus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bullet Points'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
A version of Red Guardian appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "Secret Avengers," voiced by [[Troy Baker]] in a Russian accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Secret Avengers|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=17|airdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears as a member of the Winter Guard. A misunderstanding between the [[Avengers (comics)|Secret Avengers]] and the Winter Guard over a power source (which turned out to be the Russian [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]) incited a fight between them, Red Guardian and the Winter Guard ended up working with Captain America's group when the destabilizing Russian facility they were in was about to endanger a nearby village. Afterwards, Red Guardian is the one who explained to Captain America's group that the Winter Guard are Russia's superhero team and that they work for Central Command (which is the Russian counterpart of S.H.I.E.L.D.).

The '''social environment''', '''social context''', '''sociocultural context''' or '''milieu''' refers to the immediate physical and social setting in which [[people]] live or in which something happens or develops. It includes the [[culture]] that the individual was educated or lives in, and the people and [[institutions]] with whom they interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1446600 | pmid=11249033 | volume=91 | title=A definition of "social environment" | journal=Am J Public Health | page=465 | last1 = Barnett | first1 = E | last2 = Casper | first2 = M | doi=10.2105/ajph.91.3.465a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical and social environment is a determining factor in active and [[healthy]] [[aging]] in place, being a central factor in the study of environmental [[gerontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography. Socio-spatial implications in Latin America" | journal=Revista de geografía Norte Grande | page=97-114 | author1 = Sanchez-Gonzalez, D | doi=10.4067/S0718-34022015000100006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction may be in person or through communication media, even anonymous or one-way,&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Taylor, ''Imaginary Companions'' (1999) p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and may not imply equality of [[social status]].  Therefore, the social environment is a broader concept than that of [[social class]] or [[social circle]].

==Solidarity==

People with the same social environment often develop a sense of [[social solidarity]]; people often tend to trust and help one another, and to congregate in [[social group]]s.  They will often think in similar styles and patterns even when their conclusions differ.

==Natural/artificial environment==

In order to enrich their lives, people have used natural resources and in the process have brought about many changes in the [[natural environment]]. Human settlements, roads, farmlands, dams and many other things have all developed through this. All these man-made components are included in our cultural environment, [[Erving Goffman]] in particular stressing the deeply social nature of the individual environment.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milieu/social structure==

[[C. Wright Mills]] contrasted the immediate milieu of jobs/family/neighbourhood with the wider formations of the [[social structure]], highlighting in particular a distinction between "the personal troubles of milieu" and the "public crises of social  structure".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emile Durkheim]] took a wider view of the social environment (''milieu social''), arguing that it contained internalised norms and representations of social forces/social facts:&lt;ref&gt;P. Hamilton ed., ''Emile Durkheim: Critical Assessments, Vol I'' (1990) p. 385-6&lt;/ref&gt; "Our whole social environment seems to be filled with forces which really exist only in our own minds"&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; – [[collective representations]].

==Phenomenology==

Phenomenologists contrast two alternative visions of society, as a deterministic constraint (''milieu'') and as a nurturing shell (''ambiance'').&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 174-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Scheler]] distinguishes between milieu as an experienced value-world, and the objective social environment on which we draw to create the former, noting that the social environment can either foster or restrain our creation of a personal milieu.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Dürrschmidt, ''Everyday Living in the Global City'' (2000) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social surgery==

[[Pierre Janet]] saw neurosis as in part the product of the [[identified patient]]'s social environment – family, social network, work etc. – and considered that in some instances what he called "social surgery" to create more space in that environment would be a beneficial measure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Ellenberger]], ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) p. 380-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar ideas have since been taken up in [[community psychiatry]] and [[family therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''[[Families and How to Survive Them]]'' (1993) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical usages of the concept==

===Plato===
In his dialogue ''[[Symposium (Plato)|The Symposium]]'', [[Plato]] has [[Aristophanes]] present a story about soulmates. Aristophanes states that humans originally had four arms, four legs, and a single head made of two faces. He continues that there were three genders: [[man]], [[woman]] and the "[[Androgynous]]", each with two sets of genitalia with the Androgynous having both [[Penis|male]] and [[Vagina|female]] genitalia. The men were children of the sun, the women were children of the earth and the Androgynous were children of the moon, which was born of the sun and earth. It is said that humans had great strength at the time and threatened to conquer the gods. The gods were then faced with the prospect of destroying the humans with [[Thunderbolt#In mythology|lightning]] as they had done with the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] but then they would lose the tributes given to the gods by humans. [[Zeus]] developed a creative solution by splitting humans in half as punishment for humanity's pride and doubling the number of humans who would give tribute to the [[Greek gods|gods]]. These split humans were in utter misery to the point where they would not eat and would perish so [[Apollo]] had sewn them up and reconstituted their bodies with the [[navel]] being the only remnant harkening back to their original form. Each human would then only have one set of genitalia and would forever long for his/her other half; the other half of his/her soul. It is said that when the two find each other, there is an unspoken understanding of one another, that they feel unified and would lie with each other in unity and would know no greater joy than that.&lt;ref name="Plato's Symposium"&gt;"The Internet Classics Archive&amp; ''The Symposium'' by Plato". Classics.mit.edu. Retrieved 2012-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theosophy===
According to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], whose claims were modified by [[Edgar Cayce]], God created [[androgynous]] souls—equally male and female. Later theories postulate that the souls split into separate genders, perhaps because they incurred [[karma]] while playing around on the [[Earth]], or "separation from God." Over a number of reincarnations, each half seeks the other. When all karmic debt is purged, the two will fuse back together and return to the ultimate.&lt;ref&gt;Krajenke, Robert W. (1972). ''Suddenly We Were!: a Story of Creation Based on the Edgar Cayce Readings''. A.R.E. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soulevolution.org/twinflames/twinflames.htm |title=What is a Twin Flame? |publisher=Soulevolution.org |accessdate= 2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage ==
In current usage, "soulmate" usually refers to a romantic or platonic partner, with the implication of an exclusive lifelong bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soul%20mate |title=Soul mate - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say, the word is used with more rarity than other terms associated with 'romantic' or 'platonic' partner. It is a very versatile term, being defined differently by different individuals, as it is related to the concept of love. It commonly holds the connotation of being the strongest bond with another person&lt;ref name="naturalhealthmag1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhealthmag.com.au/content/do-soul-mates-exist |title=soulmate |publisher= Natural Health Magazine |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that one can achieve. Soulmate is not used as often as other terms representing the same idea, and this is likely to lead to its perceived rarity in meaning. The definition ranges widely and cannot be pinpointed. It is commonly accepted that one will feel 'complete' once they have found their soulmate, as it is partially in the perceived definition that two souls are meant to unite. The term "soulmate" first appeared in the English language in a letter by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in 1822.

==Speculated term confusion==

According to spiritual teachers like [[Mark L. Prophet]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], one’s true love, perfect match, or literal other half is a ''twin flame''; a soulmate is something else. Twin flames are actually a single soul that was created at the beginning of time, but then divided, as in Plato's idea. The soulmate is a separate entity with whom one has spent many lifetimes as a friend, lover, co-worker or partner, and to whom one is usually drawn to fulfill a specific mission.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Clare Prophet, ''Soulmates and Twin Flames: The Spiritual Dimension of Love and Relationships.'' Summit University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mark Prophet: "A soulmate relationship has to do with the seat of the soul [[chakra]], that chakra just above the base" (this refers to the [[Svadhisthana]] center, which believers locate in the lower back or about three inches below the navel, above the [[Manipura]] "base" chakra) at the genitals). "The connection is one of parallel and mutual evolution rather than origin."&lt;ref name="Soulmates and Twin Flames"&gt;Prophet, Mark and Elizabeth, ''The Ascended Masters On Soulmates And Twin Flames: Initiation by the Great White Brotherhood: Volume 2.'' Summit University Press, 1988, pg 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Believers describe Svadhisthana as "the creativity and sexual chakra".&lt;ref&gt;For example, http://www.chopra.com/articles/awaken-your-creativity-chakra-svadhisthana. Awaken Your Creativity Chakra:Svadhisthana. Retrieved 2016-12-10&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Prophets claim that a true "literal other half" relationship doesn't center around energies or activities believed to be related to the sacral chakra, but is a "profound" relationship with your direct counterpart -- the twin flame you have known as your other self from the first moment of your creation."&lt;ref name="Soulmates and Twin Flames" /&gt; similar to what Plato describes: he says "the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else."&lt;ref name="Plato's Symposium" /&gt; 

In the 1988 released ''The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and Twin Flames'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lonerwolf.com/20-twin-flame-signs/|title=20 Twin Flame Signs – Who is Your Mirror Soul?|last=|first=|date=2015-07-08|work=LonerWolf|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark and Elizabeth Prophet describe the "one true love" or "origin" based twin flame relationship that is oftentimes referred to as a soulmate relationship by saying "They are called twin flames because they came out of the original single ovoid. The Electronic Presence of each soul is the exact duplicate of the other. And when they descend into form, one assumes the positive or masculine and one assumes the negative or feminine polarity."&lt;ref name="Soulmates and Twin Flames" /&gt; The Prophet’s ideas about the physical nature of a "true love" relationship are not completely inconsistent with the words and ideas expressed by ancient philosophers and in various religious traditions. The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] is quoted as saying "Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/aristotle143026.html . Aristotle Love Quote. Retrieved 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Zohar]] states that "Each soul and spirit prior to its entering into this world, consists of a male and female united into one being. When it descends on this earth the two parts separate and animate two different bodies. At the time of marriage, the Holy One, blessed be He, who knows all souls and spirits, unites them again as they were before, and they again constitute one body and one soul, forming as it were the right and left of one individual."&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, Christian, The Kabbalah (Routledge Revivals): Its Doctrines, Development, and Literature. Routledge,  2015,  pg 116.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In [[Hinduism]], the gods [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] fit the "right and left of one individual" description given in the [[Judaism]] related Zohar when represented in their composite androgynous form [[Ardhanarishvara]]. It is said that Ardhanarishvara "represents a synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Haviland, William; Prins, Harald; Walrath, Dana; McBride, Bunny, ''Anthropology: The Human Challenge Fifteen Edition''.  Cengage Learning, 2016, pg 561
&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Christian]] literature, there is mention of an Ardhanarishvara like "two into one" union in the [[Gospel of Mark]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew]] "the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblica.com/bible/online-bible/niv/mark/10/ . Mark 10:8. Retrieved on 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblica.com/bible/online-bible/niv/matthew/19/ . Matthew 19:5-6. Retrieved on 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the [[Gospel of Thomas]], [[Jesus]] reportedly describes a "two into one", yin and yang like or Ardhanarishvara like relationship to his disciples as the way to enter the Kingdom. "Jesus said to them, "When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female, when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you will enter [the kingdom].".&lt;ref&gt;http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html . Thomas Gospel 22. Retrieved on 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, it is believed that the [[Prophet Muhammad]] once said "women are the twin halves of men".&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, Jamal ''Sacred Laughter of the Sufis: Awakening the Soul with the Mulla's Comic Teaching Stories &amp; Other Islamic Wisdom'', Sky Light Paths, 2014, pg 141.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prophets and other spiritual teachers around the world teach or have taught that one can have many soulmates but only one true love or twin flame. Spiritual teachers like Mark and Elizabeth Prophet ultimately define or describe a soulmate as one of many potential spiritual brothers or sisters "even though there may be a great attraction and bond between soulmates, fundamentally, in the ultimate sense, you could define it more as a brother/sister relationship, even though soulmates have great marriages and a great union of hearts."&lt;ref name="Soulmates and Twin Flames" /&gt;

==Bashert: [[Judaism|Jewish]] view of soulmates ==
Bashert ({{lang-yi|באַשערט}}) is a [[Yiddish]] word that means "destiny".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209135254/http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/dictionary/%D7%91%D7%90%D6%B7%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%98.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used in the context of one's divinely foreordained spouse or soulmate, who is called "basherte" (female) or "basherter" (male). It can be used to express the seeming fate or [[destiny]] of an auspicious or important event, friendship, or happening.

The idea of basherte or basherter comes from statements found in classical [[rabbinic literature]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} A proverb that "marriages are made in heaven" is illustrated by a story in a [[midrash]] collection:

{{quote|A Roman matron, on being told by Rabbi [[Jose ben Halafta]] that God arranges all marriages, said that this was an easy matter and boasted that she could do as much herself. Thereupon she assembled her male and female slaves and paired them off in couples; but on the [[wikt:Special:Search/morrow|morrow]] they all went to her with complaints. Then she admitted that divine intervention is necessary to suitable marriages|(''Genesis Rabba'' lxviii. 3-4).}}
{{quote|Even God Himself finds it as difficult an undertaking as the dividing of the Red Sea. Forty days before a child is born its mate is determined upon
|(''Genesis Rabba'' lxviii 3-4; also [[Babylonian Talmud]], tractates Soṭah 2a; Sanhedrin 22a; comp. M. Ḳ. 18b; "Sefer Hasidim," § 1128).}}

In modern usage, Jewish singles will say that they are looking for their bashert, meaning they are looking for that person who will complement them perfectly and whom they will complement perfectly. Since it is considered to have been foreordained by God whom one will marry, one's spouse is considered to be one's bashert by definition, independent of whether the couple's marital life works out well or not.

==Criticism==
Some [[psychologists]] state that believing that a soulmate exists specifically for a person is an [[Unrealistic optimism|unrealistic expectation]].&lt;ref name="naturalhealthmag1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Springer |first=Shauna |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-joint-adventures-well-educated-couples/201207/soul-mates-do-exist-just-not-in-the-way-we-us |title=Soul Mates Do Exist—Just Not In the Way We Usually Think |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2012-07-28 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Auzeen |first=Goal |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/millennial-media/201206/do-soulmates-exist |title=Do Soulmates Exist? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vacuum extraction''' ('''VE'''), also known as '''ventouse''', is a method to assist delivery of a baby using a [[vacuum]] device. It is used in the second stage of [[childbirth|labor]] if it has not progressed adequately. It may be an alternative to a [[forceps in childbirth|forceps delivery]] and [[caesarean section]].  It cannot be used when the baby is in the [[breech birth|breech position]] or for [[premature birth]]s.  The use of VE is generally safe, but it can occasionally have negative effects on either the mother or the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3389.htm eMedicine - Vacuum Extraction : Article by Christian S Pope, DO] Retrieved December 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the French word for "suction cup."

==Medical uses==

There are several indications to use a vacuum extraction to aid delivery:
*Maternal exhaustion
*Prolonged second stage of labor
*Foetal distress in the second stage of labor, generally indicated by changes in the foetal heart-rate (usually measured on a [[cardiotocography|CTG]])
*Maternal illness where prolonged "bearing down" or pushing efforts would be risky (e.g. cardiac conditions, blood pressure, aneurysm, glaucoma). If these conditions are known about before the birth, or are severe, then an elective [[caesarean section]] may be performed.

==Technique==
[[File:Vacuum-assisted Delivery.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Vacuum-assisted Delivery.]]

The woman is placed in the [[lithotomy position]] and assists throughout the process by pushing.  A [[suction cup]] is placed onto the head of the baby and the suction draws the skin from the scalp into the cup. Correct placement of the cup directly over the [[flexion point]], about 3&amp;nbsp;cm anterior from the occipital (posterior) [[fontanelle]], is critical to the success of a VE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vacca|first=Aldo|title=Handbook of Vacuum Extraction in Obstetric Practice, 3rd edition|year=2009|publisher=Vacca Research|isbn=978-1-920818-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ventouse devices have handles to allow for traction.  When the baby's head is delivered, the device is detached, allowing the birthing attendant and the mother to complete the delivery of the baby.

For proper use of the ventouse, the maternal [[cervix]] has to be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. Preferably the operator of the vacuum extractor needs to be experienced in order to safely perform the procedure. The baby should not be [[preterm]], previously exposed to [[scalp sampling]] or failed [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps delivery]].&lt;ref&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/271175-overview#a6&lt;/ref&gt; If the ventouse attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by forceps or [[caesarean section]].

==History==
In 1849 the [[Edinburgh]] professor of obstetrics [[James Young Simpson]], subsequently known for pioneering the use of [[chloroform]] in childbirth, designed the Air Tractor which consisted of a metal syringe attached to a soft rubber cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=O'Grady|title=Vacuum Extraction|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/271175-overview|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the earliest known vacuum extractor to assist childbirth but it did not become popular.&lt;ref name=BBCVenema&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25137800 | title=Odon childbirth device: Car mechanic uncorks a revolution | first=Vibeke | last= Venema | publisher=BBC World Service | date=3 December 2013 | accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish professor Tage Malmstrom developed the ventouse, or Malmstrom extractor in the 1950s. Originally made with a metal cap, new materials such as plastics and siliconised rubber have improved the design so that it is now used more than forceps.&lt;ref name=BBCVenema /&gt;

==Comparisons to other forms of assisted delivery==

===Positive aspects===
* An [[episiotomy]] may not be required.
* The mother still takes an active role in the birth.
* No special [[anesthesia]] is required.
* The force applied to the baby can be less than that of a forceps delivery, and leaves no marks on the face.
* There is less potential for maternal trauma compared to forceps and caesarean section.

===Negative aspects===
*The baby will be left with a temporary lump on its head, known as a [[chignon (medical term)|chignon]].
*There is a possibility of [[cephalohematoma]] formation, or [[subgaleal hemorrhage]].
*There is a higher risk of failure to deliver the baby than forceps, and an increased likelihood of needing a Caesarean section.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cochrane.org/CD005455/PREG_instruments-for-assisted-vaginal-delivery&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Aglionby''' (c.1642–1705) was an English physician, known also as an art historian, translator and diplomat.

==Life==
It has been inferred that he was the son of [[George Aglionby]], who was tutor to [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]] from 1629, and who married Sibella Smith in 1635, dying in 1643. He had an M.D. degree from the [[University of Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name="Hanson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig Ashley Hanson|title=The English Virtuoso: Art, Medicine, and Antiquarianism in the Age of Empiricism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNLHRBH722AC&amp;pg=PA95|date=15 May 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-31587-4|pages=94–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluency in French later caused him trouble when claiming to be English in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sir William Trumbull in Paris 1685–1686|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GiA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA96|publisher=CUP Archive|page=96|id=GGKEY:UZA45ZPKLNP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aglionby was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1667.&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;[https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27aglionby%27%29 Royal Society database, ''Aglionby; William (c 1642 – 1705)''.]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1669 to 1671 he acted as tutor for [[Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet]] and then for [[Robert Paston, 1st Earl of Yarmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cambridge University Library|author2=Churchill Babington|author3=Charles Cardale Babington|author4=John Thomas Abdy, William Reynolds Collett, John Henry Webster, John Glover, William Wayman Hutt, Thomas Bendyshe, George Williams, Charles Brodrick Scott, John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor, Edward Ventris|title=A Catalogue of the Manuscripts Preserved in the Library of the University of Cambridge: Ed. for the Syndics of the University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71JFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA457|year=1856|publisher=University Press|pages=457–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Robertson|title=A Union for Empire: Political Thought and the British Union of 1707|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUh_OAfTQ-YC&amp;pg=PA40|date=2 November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02988-9|page=40 note 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1679 he was secretary to [[Sir William Temple]] at [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt;

During the 1680s Aglionby was in practice in London as a physician. He was based in [[Broad Street (ward)|Broad Street]], and was licensed by the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1687. At this period he took an active part in the Royal Society.&lt;ref name="Hanson2009"/&gt;

In 1698 Aglionby was attempting to negotiate a postal treaty with the French Farmer-General of Posts, in [[Calais]].&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt; Other diplomatic postings were to Madrid, Turin and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Black|title=British Diplomats and Diplomacy, 1688–1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_anug566SpAC&amp;pg=PA119|date=1 January 2001|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=978-0-85989-613-9|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Aglionby's major work was ''Painting Illustrated in Three Diallogues'' {{sic}} (1685).&lt;ref name="Hanson2009"/&gt; It has been described as the first original English book of its kind, based on the theory that Italian [[history painting]] was the leading genre of art;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig Ashley Hanson|title=The English Virtuoso: Art, Medicine, and Antiquarianism in the Age of Empiricism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNLHRBH722AC&amp;pg=PA93|date=15 May 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-31587-4|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contained eleven biographies of Italian painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Doorly|title=Truth About Art, The|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oegtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|date=30 August 2013|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=978-1-78099-841-1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aglionby used [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives]]'', but selectively, and imposing his own views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Lindsay Sohm|title=The Artist Grows Old: The Aging of Art and Artists in Italy, 1500–1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8PAFLLKHYB0C&amp;pg=PA136|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-12123-7|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Professor David Cast|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Giorgio Vasari|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WF68AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT290|date=28 February 2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-1392-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began with lives of [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto]], interpolating in the series then a dialogue on the history of painting. There followed: [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[Pierino del Vaga]], [[Titian]] and [[Donatello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Rigby Hale]]|title=England and the Italian Renaissance: The Growth of Interest in its History and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t4F0gg2tHhQC&amp;pg=PA45|date=17 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-5222-8|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources used include [[Gian Pietro Bellori]] and [[Carlo Cesare Malvasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=conte Carlo Cesare Malvasia|title=Malvasia's Life of the Carracci: Commentary and Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrI_nLwBWKcC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2000|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-01899-2|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dismissive of [[Nicolas Poussin]], Aglionby mentions favourably if not at length four artists from northern Europe: [[Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], [[Rubens]], [[Van Dyck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig Ashley Hanson|title=The English Virtuoso: Art, Medicine, and Antiquarianism in the Age of Empiricism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNLHRBH722AC&amp;pg=PA106|date=15 May 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-31587-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two latter were among the 12 ''Vite'' of Bellori, from which he borrows heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Pietro Bellori|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC&amp;pg=PA1|date=21 November 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78187-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a nationalistic point of view, Aglionby pointed to a revival of the arts at the Restoration of 1660, and promoted the painter [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]], and the sculptor [[Grinling Gibbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Kevin Sharpe (historian)|Kevin Sharpe]]|title=Reading Authority and Representing Rule in Early Modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTtyiYgExk0C&amp;pg=PA204|date=6 June 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-5675-4|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=23651|title=Riley, John|first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6266">The '''Women Power Line 1090''' is a [[Interactive voice response|IVRS]] based dedicated service in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], to empower women from all forms of [[harassment]] and ensure their safety in society.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in The Times of India"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women power line to get ‘power angels’ soon|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/Women-power-line-to-get-power-angels-soon/articleshow/46686693.cms|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=The Times of India|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1090 is a toll-free number that provides immediate help to the harassed women suffering from an antisocial behaviour or any other format of assistance which is sought. This helpline handles the cases of offense against women and ensures speedy protection to women and girls.

== History ==
''Women Power Line'' was initiated by the Uttar Pradesh Government under the leadership of [[Akhilesh Yadav]], the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, on November 15, 2012 which is being operated by the Uttar Pradesh Police department headed by Navniet Sekera. The service was started to deal with the crime against women and to control the antisocial activities against women happening in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The idea came to light when the cases of ragging started to increase in universities.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in Amajurala"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Power Helpline Number 1090 starts in Uttar Pradesh|url=http://www.amarujala.com/news/samachar/national/women-power-helpline-number-1090-starts-in-uttar-pradesh/|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=Amajurala|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past three years (till 25 March 2015), about 3,230 cases have been registered of which around 3,170 cases have been successfully solved.

== Purpose and mission ==
The helpline has been launched with the purpose of providing effective help to girls/women who become victims of any antisocial behaviour like eve-teasing, harassment, disrespect, or any other form of violence. The WPL personnel first goes for a counselling and then takes due legal action against the offender. 
The mission of Women Powerline is to bring a revolutionary change in controlling crimes against women and creating a society where women can protest against harassment and molestation with courage.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in NGO Express"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Power Helpline in NGO Express|url=http://www.ngoexpress.com/big-issuedetails.aspx?Id=22|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=NGO Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Women Powerline 1090.png|thumb|alt=Graphic or work process of Women Power Line 1090|Graphic of the work process of Women Power Line 1090]] --&gt;
To resolve the cases of harassment, the state police have set up an ultra-modern powerline and trained women police personnel to redress the cases of social harassment. The victim women can dial 1090 which is accessible from any telephone or mobile number to lodge complaints against harassment. A special team of women constables attend the calls and provide timely help to victims. The women constables, have received sensitivity and physiological training to ensure a safe and secure environment for all the callers. The identity of the caller is kept secret at all times.&lt;ref name="Women Power Line 1090 in Firstpost"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Power Helpline in Firstpost|url=http://www.firstpost.com/topic/place/uttar-pradesh-cm-akhilesh-yadav-inaugurated-women-power-line-1090-aaj-ki-khabar-video-Ox0YXxQXa00-91628-1.html|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=Firstpost|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire process is divided into stars which acts as a measure at each stage:

*'''One star''': The victim registers her complaint by calling on 1090. The women constable there would register her complaint with all the details and the number through which she has been harassed. This number is then transferred to a male cop.
*'''Two star''': The male cop would send a first level warning to the accused. All the details cited by the victim is then narrated to the accused with much needed proof of acquisition. He might even be sent for counselling if need be. The details of the women are not shared with the accused.
*'''Three star''': The call centre will call the victim after 24 hours of registering the complaint to get a tap on the harassment. If the harassment continues from the accused, a detailed call records would be called for and analysed. He is then again sent for a counselling
*'''Four star''': The call centre will call the victim after 7 days of registering the complaint to get a tap on the harassment. If the harassment continues from the accused, a detailed call records would be called for and analysed. He given a final warning and then again sent for a counselling
*'''Five star''': The call centre will call the victim after 30 days of registering the complaint to get a tap on the harassment. If the harassment continues from the accused, a detailed call records would be called for and analysed. The case is then handed over to the respective DIG who then takes the necessary legal action &lt;ref name="Women Power Line in The Times of India"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dial 1090, report a crank caller to police|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Dial-1090-report-a-crank-caller-to-police/articleshow/16830852.cms|accessdate=2016-02-01|newspaper=The Times of India|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
