Another large factor on petroleum demand has been human [[population growth]]. Because [[world population]] grew faster than oil production, production per capita peaked in 1979 (preceded by a plateau during the period of 1973–1979).&lt;ref name="RCDuncan2001"&gt;

====Role of fuel subsidies====
State fuel subsidies shielded consumers in many nations from higher market prices, but many of these subsidies were reduced or removed as the governmental cost rose.

In June 2008, AFP reported that:
{{quote|text=China became the latest Asian nation to curb energy subsidies last week after hiking retail petrol and diesel prices as much as 18 percent... Elsewhere in Asia, Malaysia has hiked fuel prices by 41 percent and Indonesia by around 29 percent, while Taiwan and India have also raised their energy costs.&lt;ref name=chinesecut&gt;

In the same month, Reuters reported that:
{{quote|text=Countries like China and India, along with Gulf nations whose retail oil prices are kept below global prices, contributed 61 percent of the increase in global consumption of crude oil from 2000 to 2006, according to JPMorgan.

Other than Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, most Asian nations subsidize domestic fuel prices. The more countries subsidize them, the less likely high oil prices will have any affect {{sic}} in reducing overall demand, forcing governments in weaker financial situations to surrender first and stop their subsidies.

That is what happened over the past two weeks. Indonesia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia have either raised regulated fuel prices or pledged that they will.&lt;ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' reported: "Half of the world's population enjoys fuel subsidies. This estimate, from Morgan Stanley, implies that almost a quarter of the world's petrol is sold at less than the market price."&lt;ref&gt;

===Supply===
{{further|Peak oil}}
An important contributor to the price increase was the slowdown in oil supply growth, which has been a general trend since oil production surpassed new discoveries in 1980. The likelihood that [[oil depletion|global oil production will decline]] at some point, leading to lower supply, is a long-term [[Supply and demand|fundamental cause of rising prices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/primer.php|title=Peak Oil Primer - Resilience|author=|date=|website=www.energybulletin.net|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201174938/http://www.energybulletin.net/primer.php|archivedate=1 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is contention about the exact time at which global production will peak, a majority of industry participants acknowledge that the concept of a production peak is valid.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  However, some commentators argued that [[global warming]] awareness and new energy sources would limit demand before the effects of supply could, suggesting that reserve depletion would be a non-issue.&lt;ref&gt;

A large factor in the lower supply growth of petroleum has been that oil's historically high ratio of [[EROEI|Energy Returned on Energy Invested]] is in significant decline.  Petroleum is a [[non-renewable resource|limited resource]], and the remaining accessible reserves are consumed more rapidly each year. Remaining reserves are increasingly difficult to extract and therefore more expensive. Eventually, reserves will only be economically feasible to extract at extremely high prices. Even if total oil supply does not decline, increasing numbers of experts{{Who|reason=specifically, need citation to back up claim of increasing numbers|date=April 2010}} believe the easily accessible sources of [[sweet crude oil|light sweet crude]] are almost exhausted and in the future the world will depend on more-expensive [[unconventional oil]] reserves and [[heavy crude oil]], as well as renewable energy sources. It is thought by many, including energy economists such as [[Matthew Simmons]], that prices could continue to rise indefinitely until a new market equilibrium is reached at which point supply satisfies worldwide demand.

Timothy Kailing, in a 2008 ''Journal of Energy Security'' article, pointed out the difficulty of increasing production in mature petroleum regions, even with vastly increased [[EROEI|investment in exploration and production]]. By looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort, he claimed that very little increase of production could be attributed to increased drilling. This was due to a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort: As drilling effort increased, the energy obtained per active [[drill rig]] was reduced according to a severely diminishing [[power law]]. This analysis suggested that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to lead to significantly increased oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region like the United States.&lt;ref name="TDKailing2008"&gt;{{cite journal

A prominent example of investment in non-conventional sources is seen in the Canadian [[oil sands]]. They are a far less cost-efficient source of heavy, low-grade oil than conventional crude; but when oil trades above $60/bbl, the tar sands become attractive to exploration and production companies.  While Canada's oil sands region is estimated to contain as much "heavy" oil as all the world's reserves of "conventional" oil,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} efforts to economically exploit these resources lag behind the increasing demand of recent years.&lt;ref&gt;

However, in an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]],'' [[Daniel Yergin]], previously known for his quotes that the price of oil would soon return down to "normal", amended the company's position on 7 May 2008 to predict that oil would reach $150 during 2008, due to tightness of supply.&lt;ref&gt;

Many factors have resulted in possible and/or actual concerns about the reduced supply of oil. The post-[[9/11]] [[war on terror]], labor strikes, hurricane threats to oil platforms, fires and terrorist threats at refineries, and other short-lived problems are not solely responsible for the higher prices. Such problems do push prices higher temporarily, but have not historically been fundamental to long-term price increases.{{Clarify|date=July 2008}}&lt;!-- all look like Supply concerns, should this be moved to Supply section, with cites? Is this another way of saying the market tries to anticipate future prices (from supply and demand beliefs) which applies to any traded commodity? --&gt;

===Investment/speculation demand===
Investment demand for oil occurs when investors purchase ''[[futures contract]]s'' to buy a commodity at a set price for future delivery. "Speculators are not buying any actual crude. ... When [the] contracts mature, they either settle them with a cash payment or sell them on to genuine consumers."&lt;ref name="Economist 2008-05-29" /&gt;

Several claims have been made implicating financial speculation as a major cause of the price increases. In May 2008 the transport chief for Germany's Social Democrats estimated that 25 percent of the rise to $135 a barrel had nothing to do with underlying supply and demand.&lt;ref name='Ban'&gt;

An interagency task force on commodities markets was formed in the U.S. government to investigate the claims of speculators' influence on the petroleum market. The task force concluded in July 2008 that "market fundamentals" such as supply and demand provided the best explanations for oil price increases, and that increased speculation was not statistically correlated with the increases. The report also noted that increased prices with an elastic supply would cause increases in petroleum inventories. As inventories actually declined, the task force concluded that market pressures were most likely to blame. Other commodities that were not subject to market speculation (such as coal, steel, and onions) saw similar price increases over the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;

In June 2008 U.S. energy secretary [[Samuel Bodman]] said that insufficient oil production, not financial speculation, was driving rising crude prices. He said that oil production had not kept pace with growing demand. "In the absence of any additional crude supply, for every 1% of crude demand, we will expect a 20% increase in price in order to balance the market," Bodman said.&lt;ref&gt;

In September 2008, Masters Capital Management released a study of the oil market, concluding that speculation did significantly impact the price. The study stated that over $60 billion was invested in oil during the first six months of 2008, helping drive the price per barrel from $95 to $147, and that by the beginning of September, $39 billion had been withdrawn by speculators, causing prices to fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Effects==
There is debate over what the '''effects of the 2000s energy crisis''' will be over the long term. Some speculated that an oil-price spike could create a recession comparable to those that followed the [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979 energy crises]] or a potentially worse situation such as a global [[oil crash]]. Increased petroleum prices are reflected in a vast number of products derived from petroleum, as well as those transported using petroleum fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081020031452/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-oilQ%26A_15bus.ART.State.Edition1.4dc8e7b.html Gas costs are reflected in nearly everything you buy], ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', 15 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[George Friedman]] has postulated that if high prices for oil and food persist, they will define the fourth distinct geopolitical regime since the end of World War II, the previous three being the [[Cold War]], the 1989–2001 period in which [[economic globalization]] was primary, and the post-9/11 "[[war on terror]]".&lt;ref&gt;

In addition to high oil prices, from year 2000 volatility in the price of oil has increased notably and this volatility has been suggested to be a factor in the financial crisis which began in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/50923|title=Was Volatility in the Price of Oil a Cause of the 2008 Financial Crisis? - Resilience|author=|date=|website=www.energybulletin.net|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430000052/http://www.energybulletin.net/node/50923|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived increase in oil price differs internationally according to currency market fluctuations and the purchasing power of currencies. For example, excluding changes in relative purchasing power of various currencies, from 1 January 2002 to 1 January 2008:&lt;ref&gt;To see table and sources : [[Talk:Oil price increases since 2003#World view]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In US$, oil price rose from $20.37 to nearly $100, about ''4.91'' times more expensive;
* In the same period, the [[NT$|Taiwanese dollar]] gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in Taiwan ''4.53'' times more expensive;
* In the same period, the [[Japanese Yen]] gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in Japan ''4.10'' times more expensive;
* In the same period, the Euro gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in the [[Eurozone]] 2.94 times more expensive.

On average, oil prices roughly quadrupled for these areas, triggering widespread protest activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-05-13-2421632551_x.htm | title=High gasoline prices spawning songs, signs, symbolic acts | date=13 May 2008 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar price surge for petroleum-based fertilizers contributed to the [[2007–08 world food price crisis]] and further unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reguly |first=Eric |date=12 April 2008 |title=How the cupboard went bare |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080412.FOOD12/TPStory/International/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415055334/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080412.FOOD12/TPStory/International/ |archivedate=15 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High oil prices typically affect less-affluent countries first, particularly the developing world with less discretionary income. There are fewer vehicles per capita, and oil is often used for electricity generation as well as private transport. The [[World Bank]] has looked more deeply at the effect of oil prices in the developing countries.

==Forecasted prices and trends==
According to informed observers, OPEC, meeting in early December 2007, seemed to desire a high but stable price that would deliver substantial needed income to the oil-producing states, but avoid prices so high that they would negatively impact the economies of the oil-consuming nations. A range of US$70–80 per barrel was suggested by some analysts to be OPEC's goal.&lt;ref name="OPEC_nytimes"&gt;{{cite news

In November 2008, as prices fell below $60 a barrel, the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] warned that falling prices could lead to both a lack of investment in new sources of oil and a fall in production of more-expensive unconventional reserves such as the [[oil sands]] of Canada. The IEA's chief economist warned, "Oil supplies in the future will come more and more from smaller and more-difficult fields," meaning that future production requires more investment every year. A lack of new investment in such projects, which had already been observed, could eventually cause new and more-severe supply issues than had been experienced in the early 2000s according to the IEA. Because the sharpest production declines had been seen in developed countries, the IEA warned that the greatest growth in production was expected to come from smaller projects in [[OPEC]] states, raising their world production share from 44% in 2008 to a projected 51% in 2030. The IEA also pointed out that demand from the developed world may have also peaked, so that future demand growth was likely to come from developing nations such as China, contributing 43%, and India and the Middle East, each about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bde7a8ba-b0b2-11dd-8915-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1IEA IEA warns of new oil supply crunch (Subscription Required)].

As many countries throughout the world entered an economic recession in the third quarter of 2008 and the global banking system came under severe strain, oil prices continued to slide. In November and December, global demand growth fell, and U.S. oil demand fell an estimated 10% overall from early October to early November 2008 (accompanying a significant drop in auto sales).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12564013 Well Prepared] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109045746/http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12564013 |date=9 November 2008 }}.

==Possible mitigations==
{{further|Mitigation of peak oil}}

Attempts to mitigate the impacts of oil price increases include:
* Increasing the supply of petroleum
* Finding substitutes for petroleum
* Decreasing the demand for petroleum
* Attempting to reduce the impact of rising prices on petroleum consumers

In mainstream economic theory, a [[free market]] rations an [[scarcity|increasingly scarce commodity]] by increasing its price. A higher price should [[Price elasticity of supply|stimulate producers to produce more]], and [[Price elasticity of demand|consumers to consume less]], while possibly shifting to [[substitute good|substitutes]]. The first three mitigation strategies in the above list are, therefore, in keeping with mainstream economic theory, as government policies can affect the supply and demand for petroleum as well as the availability of substitutes. In contrast, the last type of strategy in the list (attempting to shield consumers from rising prices) would seem to work against classical economic theory, by encouraging consumers to overconsume the scarce quantity, thus making it even scarcer. To avoid creating outright [[shortage]]s, attempts at [[price controls|price control]] may require some sort of [[rationing]] scheme.

Economists say that the [[consumer theory#Substitution effect|substitution effect]] will spur demand for [[alternative fuel|alternate fossil fuel]]s, such as coal or [[liquefied natural gas]] and for [[renewable energy]], such as [[solar energy|solar power]], [[wind power]], and [[biofuel|advanced biofuel]]s.

For example, China and India are currently heavily investing in natural gas and [[coal liquefaction]] facilities. Nigeria is working on burning natural gas to produce electricity instead of simply flaring the gas, where all non-emergency gas flaring will be forbidden after 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/20062006/eog.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008194654/http://www.tribune.com.ng/20062006/eog.html |archivedate=8 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatelaw.org/media/gas.flaring/report/section5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211105203/http://www.climatelaw.org/media/gas.flaring/report/section5 |archivedate=11 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the U.S., more than 50% of oil is consumed for stationary, non-transportation purposes such as electricity production where it is relatively easy to substitute natural gas for oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/analysis_publications/oil_market_basics/demand_text.htm|title=Home - Energy Explained, Your Guide To Understanding Energy - Energy Information Administration|author=|date=|website=www.eia.doe.gov|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727120729/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/analysis_publications/oil_market_basics/demand_text.htm|archivedate=27 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil companies including the [[supermajor]]s have begun to fund research into alternative fuel. [[BP]] has invested [[Energy Biosciences Institute|half a billion dollars for research]] over the next several years. The motivations behind such moves are to acquire the patent rights as well as understanding the technology so [[vertical integration]] of the future industry could be achieved.

====Electric propulsion====
The rise in oil prices caused renewed interest in electric cars, with several new models hitting the market, both hybrid and purely electric. The most successful among the former being the [[Toyota Prius]] and among the latter the cars of companies like [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]]. Several countries also incentivized the use of electric cars through tax-breaks or subsidies or by building charging stations.

====High speed rail====
In a similar vein as the original TGV that was switched from gas turbine to electric propulsion after the 1973 oil crisis, several countries have renewed and increased their efforts for electric propulsion in their rail systems, specifically [[High-speed rail]]. In the time since 2003, the global High speed rail network almost doubled and there are plans globally that amount to the network being doubled again within the next ten to twenty years, based on current constructions. China in particular went from having no High speed rail whatsoever in 2003 to [[High-speed rail in China|the longest network in the world in 2015]].

===Bioplastics and bioasphalt===
{{Main|Bioplastic}}
Another major factor in petroleum demand is the widespread use of petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, [[cornstarch]], pea starch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;CFTOKEN=19120617&amp;PJ_RCN=7901178&amp;CFID=6808047|title=Development of a pea starch film with trigger biodegradation properties for agricultural applications|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224130423/http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;CFTOKEN=19120617&amp;PJ_RCN=7901178&amp;CFID=6808047|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[microbiota (microbiology)|microbiota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chua | first1 = H. | last2 = Yu | first2 = P.

The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.

[[Bioasphalt]] can also be used as a replacement of petroleum asphalt.

===United States Strategic Fuel Reserve===
The United States [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] could, on its own, supply current U.S. demand for about a month in the event of an emergency, unless it were also destroyed or inaccessible in the emergency. This could potentially be the case if a major storm were to hit the [[Gulf of Mexico]], where the reserve is located. While total consumption has increased,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec11_21.pdf |format=PDF| title=Demand | publisher = [[Energy Information Administration]]| accessdate= 27 December 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090103041426/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec11_21.pdf| archivedate= 3 January 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the western economies are less reliant on oil than they were twenty-five years ago, due both to substantial growth in productivity and the growth of sectors of the economy with little oil dependence such as finance and banking, retail, etc. The decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in most developed countries has reduced the amount of oil per unit GDP; however, since these items are imported anyway, there is less change in the oil dependence of industrialized countries than the direct consumption statistics indicate.

===Fuel taxes===
{{Main|Fuel tax}}
One recourse used and discussed in the past to avoid the negative impacts of oil shocks in the many developed countries which have high fuel taxes has been to temporarily or permanently suspend these taxes as fuel costs rise.

France, Italy, and the Netherlands lowered taxes in 2000 in response to protests over high prices, but other European nations resisted this option because public service finance is partly based on energy taxes.&lt;ref name=james092000&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue came up again in 2004, when oil reached $40 a barrel causing a meeting of 25 EU finance ministers to lower economic growth forecasts for that year. Because of budget deficits in several countries, they decided to pressure [[OPEC]] to lower prices instead of lowering taxes.&lt;ref name=meller062004&gt;{{cite web

In the United Kingdom, where fuel taxes were raised in October and were scheduled to rise again in April 2008, there was talk of protests and [[roadblock]]s if the tax issue was not addressed.&lt;ref name=kanter112007&gt;{{cite web

This method of softening price shocks is even less viable to countries with much lower gas taxes, such as the United States.

Locally decreasing fuel tax can decrease fuel prices, but globally prices are set by supply and demand, and therefore fuel tax decreases may have no effect on fuel prices, and fuel tax increases might actually decrease fuel prices by reducing demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.com/archive/2012/march/why-are-gasoline-prices-high-and-what-can-be-done-about-it Why Are Gasoline Prices High (And What Can Be Done About It)?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702151945/http://www.american.com/archive/2012/march/why-are-gasoline-prices-high-and-what-can-be-done-about-it |date=2 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But this depends on the [[price elasticity of demand]] for fuel which is -0.09 to -0.31, meaning that fuel is a relatively inelastic commodity, i.e. increasing or decreasing prices have overall only a small effect on demand and therefor price change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tomas Havranek |author2=Zuzana Irsova |author3=Karel Janda |title=Demand for gasoline is more price-inelastic than commonly thought|date=January 2012|publisher=Energy Economics|pages=201–207|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2011.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demand management===
[[Transportation demand management]] has the potential to be an effective policy response to fuel shortages&lt;ref&gt;Gueret, Thomas [http://www.iea.org/textbase/work/2005/oil_demand/Oilintransportwkshp/pdffiles-day2/gueret.pdf Travel Demand Management Insights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627125143/http://www.iea.org/textbase/work/2005/oil_demand/Oilintransportwkshp/pdffiles-day2/gueret.pdf |date=27 June 2008 }} IEA conference 2005&lt;/ref&gt; or price increases and has a greater probability of long term benefits than other mitigation options.&lt;ref&gt;Litman, Todd [http://www.vtpi.org/fuelprice.pdf "Appropriate Response to Rising Fuel Prices"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627125143/http://www.vtpi.org/fuelprice.pdf |date=27 June 2008 }} Victoria Transport Policy Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

There are major differences in energy consumption for private transport between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for private transport as a Chinese urban resident. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking, cycling, and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including [[urban density]] and urban design.&lt;ref&gt;Kenworthy, J R [http://cst.uwinnipeg.ca/documents/Transport_Greenhouse.pdf Transport Energy Use and Greenhouse Emissions in Urban Passenger Transport Systems : A Study of 84 Global Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909205842/http://cst.uwinnipeg.ca/documents/Transport_Greenhouse.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }} Murdoch University&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals, [[telecommuting]] provides alternatives to daily commuting and long-distance air travel for business. Technologies for telecommuting, such as [[videoconferencing]], e-mail, and [[corporate wiki]]s, continue to improve, in keeping with the overall improvement in information technologies ascribed to [[Moore's law]]. As the cost of moving human workers continues to rise, while the cost of moving information electronically continues to fall, presumably market forces should cause more people to substitute virtual travel for physical travel. [[Matthew Simmons]] explicitly calls for "liberating the workforce" by changing the corporate mindset from paying people to show up physically to work every day, to paying them instead for the work they do, from any location.&lt;ref name="simmons_liberate_work_force"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow many more [[knowledge worker|information worker]]s to work from home either part-time or full-time, or from satellite offices or [[Internet cafe]]s near to where they live, freeing them from long daily commutes to central offices. However, even full adoption of telecommuting by all eligible workers might only decrease energy consumption by about 1% (with present energy savings estimated at 0.01–0.04%). By comparison, a 20% increase in automobile fuel economy would save 5.4%.&lt;ref&gt;

===Political action against market speculation===
The [[#Mid 2008 increases|price rises of mid-2008]] led to a variety of proposals to change the rules governing energy markets and energy futures markets, in order to prevent rises due to market speculation.

On 26 July 2008, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the [[Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008]] (H.R. 6377),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h6377/show Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908030846/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h6377/show |date=8 September 2008 }}, Opencongress.org&lt;/ref&gt; which directs the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) "to utilize all its authority, including its emergency powers, to curb immediately the role of excessive speculation in any contract market within the jurisdiction and control of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, on or through which energy futures or swaps are traded, and to eliminate excessive speculation, price distortion, sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in prices, or other unlawful activity causing major market disturbances that prevent the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for energy commodities."

'''Republic of Ireland vs France''' was a [[Two-legged tie|two-legged]] [[association football|football]] [[play-off]] held on 14 and 18 November 2009 between the national teams of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[France national football team|France]] as part of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|UEFA second round of qualification]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. The first match was held on 14 November in [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and ended in a 1–0 victory for France with [[Nicolas Anelka]] scoring. The second leg, played on 18 November in the [[Stade de France]] outside Paris, France, finished 1-0 to the Republic of Ireland (with [[Robbie Keane]] scoring).  The tie went to extra time and a controversial [[William Gallas]] goal made the score 2-1 on aggregate and France progressed to the World Cup at Ireland's expense.

After the second leg, the French captain [[Thierry Henry]] admitted to Irish defender [[Richard Dunne]] that he had [[Misconduct (association football)|illegally]] handled the ball in the build-up to Gallas' match-winning goal, which had been scored in [[extra time]] with 17 minutes remaining in the game.

The incident led to calls from the [[Football Association of Ireland]] and [[Government of Ireland]] to the world governing body [[FIFA]] for the result to be set aside and for the game to be replayed, and later for Ireland to be allowed to enter the World Cup as an unprecedented supernumerary 33rd team.&lt;ref name=FIFA20Nov09FIFAStatementOnFAIRequest/&gt; Henry, previously seen by many in the sport as a fair footballer, was characterised as cheating,&lt;ref name=AFP21Nov09IrelandAdmitsDefeat/&gt; with the incident being compared to [[Diego Maradona]]'s [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)|"Hand of God" goal]], and [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] comparing Henry's goal (sometimes called "Le Hand of God"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/20/sports/la-sp-world-cup-henry20-2009nov20|title=Thierry Henry's handball gets a big thumbs-down in Europe – Los Angeles Times|last=Culpepper|first=Chuck|date=20 November 2009|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to a top ten list of sporting cheats.&lt;ref name=TimeMagazine19Nov09Top10SportingCheats/&gt; Henry considered retiring from international football due to the reactions to the game, while the [[Sweden|Swedish]] match referee [[Martin Hansson]] considered quitting as a referee.&lt;ref name=AFP23Nov09HenryConsideredQuitting/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov09RefereeConsideredQuitting/&gt;

The result sparked debate on the issue of fair play in football, and fuelled the ongoing debate on the introduction of [[video referee]]ing and [[Assistant referee (association football)#New developments|Additional Assistant Referees]] into the sport. At an emergency meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee called in part as a result of the handball controversy, FIFA announced it was setting up an inquiry into the options for technology or extra officials in football, but ruled out any changes being introduced in time for the 2010 World Cup. Henry's case was passed to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for investigation, which ruled that it could not sanction Henry under the text of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.

==Route to the matches==
{{Main article|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification}}
The [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification process for the 2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]] began in 2007, and as Europe-affiliated teams (both being members of [[UEFA]]) France and the Republic of Ireland became two of 53 teams competing for 13 places in the finals.

Under the rules for the 2010 tournament, UEFA qualification was a two-stage process, as had previously been the case for [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification in 2006]]. Teams were able to qualify automatically by winning one of nine qualifying groups (the first round), and a second chance to qualify was given to eight of the nine second-place finishers via a knock-out phase (the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|second round]]) of four games between those eight second-placed teams, contested over [[two-legged tie|two legs]], [[home (sports)|home]] and [[away (sports)|away]], with the winners of each pairing being awarded one of the four remaining UEFA qualifying places. Both France and the Republic of Ireland failed to qualify as winners of their first-round groups (France in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 7|Group 7]], the Republic in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 8|Group 8]]), but both teams finished in second place with enough points to allow them to advance to the second round.

FIFA announced on 29 September 2009 that it would modify the [[lottery|draw]] system used to select second-round pairings by introducing a seeding system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Decisions Reached in Rio |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid=1109930.html |publisher=FIFA |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615060937/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid%3D1109930.html |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the draw, held in [[Zürich]] on 19 October, the eight teams were divided into two pots of four; France were seeded along with [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Russia national football team|Russia]], while Ireland was unseeded, alongside [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].

The 18 November date of the second leg of the France vs Republic of Ireland play-off in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] coincided with the date of a number of other World Cup qualification matches around the world, marking the completion of the entire qualification process for 2010. With their win, France ultimately joined [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] as the last of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification#Qualified teams|32 competitors]] in South Africa.

Under the agreed tie-break criteria, the team scoring more goals on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]] wins the play-off. If scores are level on aggregate, the team with the higher number of away goals advances. If teams are level on away goals, 30 minutes of [[Overtime (association football)|extra time]] is played. If the score is level after extra time, the match goes to penalties.

==Pre-match==

===Venue selection===
The Dublin leg of the tie was held at [[Croke Park]] instead of the Republic of Ireland's traditional home venue of [[Lansdowne Road]], owing to ongoing redevelopment of that venue as the [[Aviva Stadium]]. The French leg was held at [[Stade de France]], the French team's national stadium near Paris.

===Analysis===
Before 1990, the Republic of Ireland had never qualified for the FIFA World Cup finals, while France's best record was two third-place finishes, in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]. Between 1990 and 2006 (the year in which the most recent FIFA World Cup had been held), the Republic of Ireland and France had each qualified for three finals tournaments. The two teams' records for the tournament were as follows:

===Saint-Denis leg===

====Summary====
A controversial instance of [[Misconduct (association football)|misconduct]] occurred during [[Overtime (association football)|extra time]] in the second leg of the [[two-legged tie]], when the overall score was standing at 1–1 [[Aggregate score|on aggregate]]. French player [[Florent Malouda]] took a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] just outside the [[Association football pitch#Other markings|centre circle]] in the Irish half of the field. He lofted it toward French captain [[Thierry Henry]], who was making a run in the [[penalty area]] to Irish [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Shay Given]]'s right-hand side. The ball bounced once to Henry, now inside the [[goal area]] to the left of the goal. As it bounced upwards, Henry handled the ball twice with his left hand, stopping it going [[Ball in and out of play#Out of play|out of play]] and bringing the ball under control, before tapping the ball with the outside of his right foot past Given standing at the near goal post. The ball travelled the short distance to [[William Gallas]] arriving in the middle of the goal, who headed the ball into the Irish net to confirm France's place at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

The referee immediately signalled the goal as being valid. Irish players inside the penalty box appealed the decision by raising their arms, and as Henry wheeled away in celebration around the back of the Irish goal, Given ran to the referee gesticulating that a handball offence had occurred, while Irish manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] did the same to the [[fourth official]].

The handball offence was not seen by the referee or his two assistants, according to the BBC.&lt;ref name=BBCSport19Nov09IrishAskFifaForFranceReplay/&gt; The match officials also missed an [[offside (association football)|offside]] during the same phase of play.&lt;ref name=SkySportsNews20Nov09HenryReplayFairestSolution/&gt;

==== Thierry Henry ====
Henry told a reporter after the incident, "Yes, there was hand, but I'm not the referee. 'Toto' ([[Sébastien Squillaci]]) was going for the front, I was behind two Irishmen, the ball ricocheted and hit my hand. Of course, I continued to play... The referee did not whistle 'hand' but I can't say there wasn't hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/coupe-du-monde-2010-football/mondial-2010-oui-il-y-a-main-avoue-thierrry-henry-18-11-2009-716117.php|title=Thierry Henry admits there was hand|date=18 November 2009|accessdate=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry later defended himself against criticism, stating, "Obviously I would have preferred that things panned out differently but I am not the official.

After FIFA denied the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) request for a replay, Henry released a statement.&lt;ref name=SkySportsNews20Nov09HenryReplayFairestSolution/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN20Nov09CNNHenryReplayFairestSolution/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fairest solution would be to replay the game but it is not in my control...Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way that we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa...I have said at the time and I will say again that 'yes' I handled the ball. I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times to be able to make a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.&lt;ref name=CNN20Nov09CNNHenryReplayFairestSolution&gt;{{cite news

Henry later called FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] over the incident.&lt;ref name=AFP29Nov09BlatterBreaksSilence/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP29Nov09BlatterNotHenrysFault/&gt; Blatter stated Henry had told him his family had been threatened over the incident by fans.&lt;ref name=AFP30Nov09FIFAMayPutMoreOfficialsAtWC/&gt;

==== Match referee ====
The match was officiated by a [[Swedish Football Association|Swedish]] team.

==== Team managers ====
Ireland manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] stated he did not blame Henry, nor did he expect a replay would occur, but he did believe the incident would bring further pressure on FIFA to introduce [[goal-line technology]], stating "There is a 30-second stop and we clarify the situation...I'm sure in the future they will have to do something about it. It wasn't up to Henry to say 'I touched it with my hand'".&lt;ref name=BBCSport19Nov09IrishAskFifaForFranceReplay&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trapattoni also questioned the selection of the match referee, stating "For this important game we needed a stronger referee – an important referee", and went on to also question the format of the qualifying round matches.&lt;ref name=BBCSport19Nov09IrishAskFifaForFranceReplay/&gt;

French team manager [[Raymond Domenech]] said of the game, "I don't see what we could have done better...We needed to qualify and we did that, even if it was painful. Victories like this one, at the end of a difficult campaign, give this side heart and soul", although criticism in France of his team, which had existed before the game, continued.&lt;ref name=Reuters19Nov09FrancesHenryGetsHandSlapped/&gt; Domenech later criticised the condemnation of Henry and France, and questioned the right of former French players like Cantona and Lizarazu to criticise his record as the French coach.&lt;ref name=ESPN24Nov09DefiantDomenech/&gt;

==== Other players ====
Ireland captain and scorer of Ireland's goal in the controversial match [[Robbie Keane]] criticised the presidents of [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] following the result, claiming they would be 'delighted' that France had gone through.&lt;ref name=LATimes19Nov09ThumbsDown/&gt; He told [[BBC Radio Five Live]], "They're all probably clapping hands, Platini sitting up there on the phone to Sepp Blatter, probably texting each other, delighted with the result."&lt;ref name=LATimes19Nov09ThumbsDown/&gt; After Henry's statement, Keane concurred with his call for a replay in the interest of fair play, stating "On behalf of the Republic of Ireland players, I would like to thank Thierry Henry... As captain of the French team, to make such a statement took courage and honour, and all of us recognise that".&lt;ref name=BBC21Nov09RepublicAdmitDefeatOverReplay/&gt;

In general, the Irish players blamed the officials rather than Henry. Damien Duff&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfootballnews.co.uk/news_jump.html?player_id=284&amp;story=33384 Damien Duff's reaction]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; admitted he would have done the same had it been to Ireland's advantage, and said: "If it was down the other end and it was going out of play, I would have chanced my arm. You can't blame him (Henry). He's a clever player – but you expect the ref to see it, it was so blatant." Many players, including Duff, supported call for the introduction of video technology. [[Sean St Ledger]] hoped France would be put in a '[[group of death]]' in the World Cup draw, but feared they might go on to win the tournament.&lt;ref name=Telegraph27Nov09SeanStLedgerHopesFranceFail/&gt;

Defender [[Richard Dunne]] later spoke of how he was unaware of the extent of Henry's involvement when he sat down with him on the pitch at the end of the match and admitted the handball.&lt;ref name="2009/1204/dunner.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1204/dunner.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605134347/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1204/dunner.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }} Dunne ready to put Paris behind him, Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Friday, 4 December 2009 15:34&lt;/ref&gt; Dunne properly viewed the incident for the first time on a computer in his team's dressing room.&lt;ref name="2009/1204/dunner.html"/&gt; He also described how "heartbreaking" the whole experience was, his lack of interest in the draw or who France's opponents might be in the finals and how "disappointing" it would be when the tournament eventually took place.&lt;ref name="2009/1204/dunner.html"/&gt;

Given was critical of Sepp Blatter's later actions, stating his various announcements "rubbed salt in the wounds" and his contradictory comments about Henry were "beyond a joke".&lt;ref name=Telegraph04dec09Given/&gt; He expressed doubt he would get over the incident in his lifetime.&lt;ref name=Telegraph04dec09Given/&gt; Of Henry, he said "I'm not saying he's a cheat but what he's done is illegal".&lt;ref name=UKPA05Dec09Dunne/&gt;

Dunne was later critical of Blatter's offer of moral compensation, describing it as "[[Taking the piss|taking the mickey]]".&lt;ref name=BBC05Dec09Dunne/&gt; He doubted Robbie Keane would be going to FIFA to collect any such award.&lt;ref name=BBC05Dec09Dunne/&gt; He reiterated the belief that ever since the earlier seedings controversy, FIFA had been showing France unfair favour.&lt;ref name=UKPA05Dec09Dunne/&gt;

===Action taken===

====FAI appeal====
The FAI filed a formal complaint with FIFA and the FFF, stating, "The handball was recognised by the FIFA commissioner, the referee observer and the match officials, as well as by the player himself."&lt;ref name=BBCSport19Nov09IrishAskFifaForFranceReplay/&gt; The FAI cited precedent for the invalidation of the result, using the example of a previous World Cup qualification match between [[Uzbekistan national football team|Uzbekistan]] and [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]], overturned by FIFA due to a 'technical error by the referee of the match'.&lt;ref name=BBCSport19Nov09IrishAskFifaForFranceReplay/&gt;&lt;ref name=SkySportsNews20Nov09HenryReplayFairestSolution/&gt; In that game, the referee had failed to have a penalty kick re-taken after an attacker encroached on the penalty area.&lt;ref name=Independent20Nov09Wenger/&gt; FAI chief executive [[John Delaney (football administrator)|John Delaney]] said "It is up to the people who govern the game now, if they really believe in the principles of fair play then step forward....If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy"&lt;ref name=BBCSport19Nov09IrishAskFifaForFranceReplay/&gt; The president of the (FFF) Jean-Pierre Escalettes said "You have to take a philosophical approach to this match."&lt;ref name=IrishTimes20Nov09SmallDetail/&gt;

On 20 November, FIFA rejected the request for a replay, stating to the FAI:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The result of the match cannot be changed and the match cannot be replayed. As is clearly mentioned in the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], during matches, decisions are taken by the referee and these decisions are final.&lt;ref name=FIFA20Nov09FIFAStatementOnFAIRequest&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After FIFA and Thierry Henry's statement, the FAI urged the FFF to respect their views and those of the captains of both teams, to replay the game to "protect the integrity of the game worldwide".&lt;ref name=BBC21Nov09RepublicAdmitDefeatOverReplay/&gt; The FFF, while sympathetic, endorsed the FIFA ruling.&lt;ref name=BBC21Nov09RepublicAdmitDefeatOverReplay&gt;{{cite news

Following the FFF's refusal to support a replay, the FAI expressed "deep disappointment".&lt;ref name=BBC21Nov09RepublicAdmitDefeatOverReplay/&gt;

====FAI proposals and 33rd team place====
At the request of the FAI, Sepp Blatter met an Irish delegation in [[Zürich]] for 90 minutes on Friday 27 November.&lt;ref name=SkySports30Nov09FIARevealMeetingDetails/&gt; The FAI proposed a number of ways the incident could be prevented in future and, agreeing that the match could not be replayed, they instead also officially requested to be allowed to enter the World Cup as an unprecedented extra 33rd entrant.&lt;ref name=AFP30Nov09IrishAskToBeTeam33/&gt; Blatter stated that he would raise the Irish request at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] (EGM) of the FIFA executive committee.&lt;ref name=BBC20Nov09ROIAsksForWCPlace/&gt;&lt;ref name=RTESport30Nov09FAIFinalPlea/&gt; [[RTÉ Sport]] speculated that the request would be "politely turned down".&lt;ref name=RTESport30Nov09FAIFinalPlea/&gt; The request drew 'laughter' when he relayed it to the Soccerex conference the following Monday.&lt;ref name=AFP30Nov09IrishAskToBeTeam33/&gt; Blatter was of the opinion that if the Republic of Ireland were admitted as an extra entrant, [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] would also have to be considered as well, having also been unfairly eliminated by an offside goal in a play-off against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].&lt;ref name=BBC20Nov09ROIAsksForWCPlace/&gt;&lt;ref name=RTESport30Nov09FAIFinalPlea/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP30Nov09BlatterFIFADiscussExtraRefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKPA30Nov09IrelandAskForSABerth/&gt; FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke had ruled it out on 1 December, one day before the meeting, clarifying that Blatter's comments regarding other teams had already shown the request was "impossible" and had "no hope" of being granted.&lt;ref name=BBC01Dec09ROIPleaRejected&gt;{{cite news

The FAI's proposals included: no changes to competition formats mid-tournament (referring to the play off group seeding change), introduce video technology at the highest level, implement additional [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referees]] behind the goal line for all international matches, introduce stronger sanctions for players who breach the Laws of the Game in a "match defining way", and issuing a statement that "FIFA does not condone breaches" of those Laws, referring to Sepp Blatter's previous statements of empathy with Henry.&lt;ref name=SkySports30Nov09FIARevealMeetingDetails/&gt;&lt;ref name=IrishExaminer03Dec09DelaneyFIFAAreTheBigLosers/&gt; The FAI stated they did not ask for any action to be taken against Henry.&lt;ref name=IrishExaminer03Dec09DelaneyFIFAAreTheBigLosers/&gt;

Delaney reacted angrily to Blatter's public disclosure of what was intended to be a confidential submission to the FIFA executive committee, complaining to the FIFA general secretary and calling it "disrespectful to our country", and stating the 33rd team proposal had been "very much peripheral" to their suggestions, and was only discussed "for a minute or two" in the meeting.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes03Dec09FIFABiggestLosersDelaney/&gt; The FAI asserted that the 33rd place request had not even been included in any of the written submissions to FIFA.&lt;ref name=IrishExaminer03Dec09DelaneyFIFAAreTheBigLosers/&gt;

====Sepp Blatter====
Blatter had initially faced criticism for refusing to comment on the incident.&lt;ref name=AFP29Nov09BlatterBreaksSilence/&gt; His first comments came with a report in ''[[L'Équipe]]'', and during his opening address at the Soccerex football conference in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, both on Sunday 29 November.&lt;ref name=AFP29Nov09BlatterBreaksSilence/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP29Nov09BlatterNotHenrysFault/&gt;&lt;ref name=RTESport30Nov09FAIFinalPlea/&gt;

Blatter said that it had not been Henry's responsibility to tell the referee of the misdemeanour, comparing a similar incident in his own playing career, when he did not tell the referee about an advantage gained by shirt-pulling.&lt;ref name=AFP29Nov09BlatterBreaksSilence/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP29Nov09BlatterNotHenrysFault/&gt; Blatter said that referee Hansson "should have taken the time to reflect rather than immediately awarding the goal".&lt;ref name=AFP29Nov09BlatterBreaksSilence/&gt;

On the issue of fair play, Blatter said "There is a lack of discipline and respect in the game by the players because they are cheating" and "How can it happen that all over the world, through TV cameras, we have seen through a cheating handball that a pass was given for a goal? Everyone is asking what is and what isn't fair play. The highest crime in football is touching the ball with the hands".&lt;ref name=RTESport30Nov09FAIFinalPlea/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP30Nov09BlatterFIFADiscussExtraRefs/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian30Nov09IrelandAsked33rdTeam/&gt; Referring to the possibility of using assistant referees or goal line technology, Blatter stated, "match control is now is on the agenda. How shall we avoid such situations as we have seen in this very specific match?"&lt;ref name=BBC20Nov09ROIAsksForWCPlace/&gt; Blatter repeated his stated opposition to [[instant replay|video refereeing]], saying, "With technology, you have to stop a match. You have a look at cameras... We have to maintain the human face of football and not go into technology."&lt;ref name=AP30Nov09BlatterFIFADiscussExtraRefs/&gt;

On the issue of fair play at the World Cup, Blatter commented after the FIFA executive committee's EGM:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I appeal to all the players and coaches to observe this fair play. In 2010 we want to prove that football is more than just kicking a ball but has social and cultural value... So we ask the players 'please observe fair play' so they will be an example to the rest of the world&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09FIFAToInvestigateHenry/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blatter apologised to the FAI on 2 December for the public disclosure of the FAI's submission to FIFA and for the media's perception of his comments at Soccerex, saying, "I have nothing against the Irish, they were very sporting people when they came to FIFA and it is a pity that it has been now communicated in this way."&lt;ref name=SkySports02Dec09BlatterApologises/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09BlatterMakesApologyToRepublic/&gt; After the EGM, John Delaney described FIFA as the "biggest losers" in the controversy for having "made one mistake after another", referring to the mid-competition change in seeding rules for the play-off, the negative imagery of football as a whole generated by FIFA's actions and Henry's goal, and Sepp Blatter's subsequent dealings with the FAI.&lt;ref name=IrishExaminer03Dec09DelaneyFIFAAreTheBigLosers/&gt;

==== FIFA executive committee ====
On 23 November FIFA announced that the FIFA executive committee would hold an [[extraordinary general meeting]] (EGM) on 2 December in [[Cape Town]], where members were already due to meet to discuss the seedings for the World Cup, in order to discuss various recent incidents affecting the world game.&lt;ref name=BBC23Nov09FIFAEGM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8375320.stm|title=Fifa to meet over play-off issues|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 November 2009|date=23 November 2009 |archiveurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8375320.stm |archivedate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] sports news correspondent Gordon Farquhar, the Henry incident would be "high on the agenda".&lt;ref name=BBC23Nov09FIFAEGM/&gt; [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]], the chief executive of the [[Scottish Football Association]] and a member of the [[International Football Association Board]], believed that introduction of AARs in time for the World Cup would be pressed for at the EGM by UEFA president [[Michel Platini]], who had been a long-time supporter of the concept; Smith said of the proposal, "I feel that it has its advantages at the highest levels of the games. When there's massive TV coverage the problems are highlighted all over the world so this is something we may have to look at."&lt;ref name=UKPA24Nov09BlatterCrisisMeeting&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] confirmed on 30 November that the EGM would consider the use of AARs and goal-line technology in the 2010 World Cup, and changing the two-legged play-off qualification format, possibly in favour of a single game played at a neutral venue.&lt;ref name=AFP30Nov09FIFAMayPutMoreOfficialsAtWC/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20Nov09ROIAsksForWCPlace/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP30Nov09BlatterFIFADiscussExtraRefs/&gt;

The EGM was held on 2 December at the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]].&lt;ref name=AP02Dec09NoExtraRefsInvestigateHenry/&gt; The executive committee at the time consisted of FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]], eight vice-presidents and 15 members, and the FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke. The membership included representatives of various confederations and associations around the world.&lt;ref name=FIFAExecutiveCommitteeAsAtDec2009/&gt; In response to Blatter's comments at Soccerex and before the EGM, the FAI formally notified FIFA in writing that they were withdrawing their request to enter the World Cup as a 33rd team, and accordingly this matter was not considered.&lt;ref name=IrishExaminer03Dec09DelaneyFIFAAreTheBigLosers/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09BlatterApologisesOverComments/&gt;&lt;ref name=IrishTimes02Dec09FAISetsRecordStraight/&gt; The FAI's other suggestions were, however, discussed.&lt;ref name=IrishExaminer03Dec09DelaneyFIFAAreTheBigLosers/&gt;

According to FIFA, the EGM discussion resulted in "concrete proposals" to ensure that improvements were made on the issues raised.&lt;ref name=FIFA02Dec09FIFAProposesMeasuresToTackleFootballIssues/&gt; According to Blatter, the committee recognised the game was at a "crossroads" and that, at the highest levels, where 32 cameras were to be used to film the 2010 World Cup, it was now "impossible" for just the referee and his two assistants to "see everything".&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09NoExtraOfficialsForWC/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs/&gt;

The EGM announced that FIFA would be setting up an inquiry into future use of extra assistants and technology. The new inquiry would, according to Blatter, "have a look at technology or additional persons".&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09NoExtraOfficialsForWC/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs/&gt; Described as a "full inquiry"&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09NoExtraOfficialsForWC/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs/&gt; or "working party"&lt;ref name=AP02Dec09NoExtraRefsInvestigateHenry/&gt; by media commentators, it was to comprise a new FIFA committee with input drawn in part from the existing FIFA referees', football, technical and medical committees.&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs/&gt;

The expected introduction of AARs for the 2010 World Cup was ruled out.&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09NoExtraOfficialsForWC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheTimes02Dec09FIFARulesOutAssistants/&gt; The committee "stressed that it would be too soon to implement this new system at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa."&lt;ref name=FIFA02Dec09FIFAProposesMeasuresToTackleFootballIssues/&gt; Blatter explained that, as AARs had not yet been trialled outside of Europe, the committee was of the opinion that any experiment must be carried out "globally" before it could be used in a World Cup.&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs/&gt; Blatter confirmed that the experiment with AAR's in the [[Europa League]] would continue into the 2010 knock-out stages.&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs/&gt; The meeting also ruled out the use of [[video referee]]ing systems similar to those seen in rugby, cricket and tennis.&lt;ref name=AFP02Dec09FIFARulesOutRefAids/&gt; Blatter stated that two companies investigating [[goal-line technology]] were due to report their results to [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) in March 2010.&lt;ref name=AP02Dec09NoExtraRefsInvestigateHenry/&gt; FIFA also called on the general secretaries of the [[List of football federations#Continental|Continental Federations]] to propose improvements to the format of the qualification and play-off phase of the World Cup competition, for submission by March 2010.&lt;ref name=FIFA02Dec09FIFAProposesMeasuresToTackleFootballIssues/&gt;

====Henry disciplinary investigation====
On the issue of possible disciplinary sanctions against Henry individually, a FIFA spokesperson stated "The [independent] disciplinary commission...will decide if the case is of interest [when they meet sometime in the next two weeks].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of FIFA disciplinary action taken against players for incidents missed by the referee based on video evidence include banning [[Mauro Tassotti]] for eight games for use of an elbow during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] quarter-final, and banning [[Marco Materazzi]] for two games for his verbal provocation of [[Zinedine Zidane]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]], resulting in the infamous headbutting incident.&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Nov09HenryCouldFaceWorldCupBan/&gt;

On 2 December after the FIFA EGM it was announced that FIFA's disciplinary committee would open an investigation into Henry's handball.&lt;ref name=TheTimes02Dec09FIFARulesOutAssistants/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP02Dec09FIFAInvestigateBlatterSorry/&gt; No timetable was given for when the investigation, chaired by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] lawyer Marcel Mathier, would rule on the case.&lt;ref name=AP02Dec09NoExtraRefsInvestigateHenry/&gt;

Blatter said of the decision to single out Henry for investigation of a handball:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have not said that Thierry Henry will be punished, I have said that Thierry Henry will be examined [by the committee]...it's not a question of this player or another – it was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world...let [the committee] make the decision. Fair play must be maintained in our game&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09FIFAToInvestigateHenry/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheTimes02Dec09FIFARulesOutAssistants/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Associated Press, the committee had the "authority to impose a one-match suspension on Henry, which would take effect at the start of the World Cup in June".&lt;ref name=AP02Dec09NoExtraRefsInvestigateHenry/&gt; According to the BBC, FIFA said "there was no certainty Henry would be banned if found guilty".&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09FIFAToInvestigateHenry/&gt;

On 18 January 2010 it was announced that Henry would face no sanctions in relation to the incident, after the committee found it had "no legal foundation" to deal with the case, as the relevant rules only covered sanctions for preventing a goal by illegally handling the ball.&lt;ref name=BBC18Jan2010HenryEscapesBan/&gt; FIFA rules reportedly forbade any other action as the referee had not seen the original incident.&lt;ref name=AFP18Jan2010HenryEscapes/&gt; FIFA released the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Disciplinary Committee reached the conclusion that there was no legal foundation for the committee to consider the case because handling the ball cannot be regarded as a serious infringement as stipulated in article 77a of the FIFA Disciplinary Code. There is no other legal text that would allow the committee to impose sanctions for any incidents missed by match officials.&lt;ref name=FIFA18Jan2010StatementOnHenry/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The FFF president Jean-Pierre Escalettes hoped the announcement would mark the end of the incident, stating of the decision that is "not astonishing, it is logical".&lt;ref name=AFP18Jan2010HenryEscapes/&gt;

====France national team====
FIFA secretary general Jérôme Valcke later denied that France's absence from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup seeding|top 8 seeded teams]] for the 2010 World Cup draw had been a result of the controversy, stating that the change to the seeding system (using the world rankings as they stood at October 2009) was fairer than past systems.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian03Dec09NoAgendaAgainstFrance&gt;{{cite news

In a quirk of the resulting draw, the lack of seeding ultimately did not have a detrimental effect on France, as they were drawn into [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group A|Group A]]; since the seeding place in Group A had already been allocated to the host nation [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]], a Group A draw was the only possible outcome where France would not have been placed into a group with one of the top seven seeded teams.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes04Dec09FinalistsGuaranteed6mEuros/&gt; South Africa were ranked 86th in the world at the time, making them the lowest-ranked team competing in the tournament; ''The Irish Times'' commented that this turn of events in France's favour would cause the Irish to feel particularly aggrieved.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes04Dec09FinalistsGuaranteed6mEuros/&gt; At the finals, France ultimately failed to qualify from their group, failing to win a game and managing only a solitary point in their first match against Uruguay; following a [[List of 2010 FIFA World Cup controversies#French team discord|major disruption]] at the team's camp by the French players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After the FIFA EGM, John Delaney said, "In terms of the football side, this is the end of the matter", but that "the incident will linger long in the memory like [[Hand of God goal|Diego Maradona's handball]]."&lt;ref name=Reuters02Dec09BlatterApologyAcceptedFAI/&gt; Delaney hoped the promise of an inquiry into refereeing and technology was "not a [[wikt:fudge the issue|fudge]]."&lt;ref name=IrishTimes03Dec09FIFABiggestLosersDelaney/&gt; The FAI and FIFA were however due to meet again after the EGM according to Blatter, to discuss some form of non-financial compensation for the controversy.&lt;ref name=BBC03Dec09FIFAChiefsToMeetWithRepublic/&gt; On 4 June 2015 it emerged during an RTÉ interview that FIFA had bought the FAI's silence with a €5 million payment which would prevent any legal action against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/eamon-dunphy-the-fifa-payment-to-the-fai-was-like-something-from-the-sopranos-31279282.html|title= Eamon Dunphy: The FIFA payment to the FAI was like something from The Sopranos|date=4 June 2015|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/04/fifa-paid-fai-after-thierry-henry-handball-john-delaney|title= Fifa made payment to FAI after Thierry Henry handball, claims John Delaney|date=4 June 2015|work=Guardian |accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Match officials====
In January 2010, match referee Hansson and his assistant Stefan Wittberg were both selected as one of the thirty officiating teams to be used at the 2010 World Cup; however, Hansson's other assistant on the day of the incident, Fredrik Nilsson who missed the handball, was not selected, being replaced by [[Henrik Andren]].&lt;ref name=IrishTimes6Feb2010HanssonMakesFinals/&gt; FIFA had insisted at the time of the incident that, since selection of referees for the World Cup referee was based on long-term assessments, Hansson would probably make it to the finals.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes6Feb2010HanssonMakesFinals/&gt; UEFA president [[Michel Platini]] called it a good decision, defending Hansson as having not been responsible for the incident as he had not seen the handball.&lt;ref name=AFP6Feb2010Platini/&gt;&lt;ref name=IrishIndependent7Feb2010PlatiniFansFlames/&gt;

[[Henry Winter]] of ''The Telegraph'' wrote that FIFA had "gained some credibility" by deciding to investigate Henry after the EGM, whose presence at the World Cup would otherwise overshadow the Fair Play campaign, and that the Henry controversy made the case for having a panel of experts examine every major game after the event for infractions missed by the referee.&lt;ref name=Telegraph03Dec09BlatterCatchesMood/&gt; Winter contrasted any possible punishment of Henry with the two-month ban issued to [[Diego Maradona]] for simply 'insulting reporters'.&lt;ref name=Telegraph03Dec09BlatterCatchesMood/&gt; Diana Worman on [[Aljazeera.net]] criticised FIFA's decision to investigate Henry for an act that happens all the time, and would have only warranted a yellow card, writing "Henry should never have been expected to make a 'sportsmanlike' decision after the goal and it's unfair for Fifa to make an example of him".&lt;ref name=Aljazeera03Dec09InDefenceOfHenry/&gt; ''[[The Canadian Press]]'' criticised FIFA's "cowardly" decision to investigate Henry and do nothing to change the situation for the 2010 World Cup.&lt;ref name=CanadianPress03Dec09FIFAMissingMessage/&gt; The ''Irish Times'' stated that the FAI's recommendations to FIFA in the wake of the controversy had been "effectively disregarded" at the EGM.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes03Dec09FIFABiggestLosersDelaney/&gt;

On 4 December 2009, [[Charlize Theron]] co-presented the draw for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, accompanied by several other celebrities of South African origin. During rehearsals she drew an [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] ball instead of [[France national football team|France]] as a joke at the expense of FIFA, referring to the [[Thierry Henry]] handball controversy and France's controversial qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/theron-has-a-ball-at-fifas-expense-1962410.html |title=Theron has a ball at FIFA's expense |first=Jason |last=O'Brien |newspaper=Irish Independent |date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=354&amp;fArticleId=5273884 |title=Charlize puts Ireland in the finals |date=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stunt alarmed FIFA enough for it to fear she might do it again in front of a live global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irishcentral.com/sports/fifa-shock-as-charlize-theron-picks-ireland-as-first-team-for-world-cup-78329492-237673231.html |title=FIFA shock as Charlize Theron picks Ireland as first team in World Cup draw |first=Sean |last=O'Shea |work=irishcentral.com |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish fans donned [[sombrero]]s and cheered as [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] beat France 2–0 in their second group stage match on 17 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Carbray |first=Paul |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2010/06/20/france%E2%80%99s-misery-has-the-irish-smiling/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718120335/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2010/06/20/france%E2%80%99s-misery-has-the-irish-smiling/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=France's misery has the Irish smiling |work=National Post |date=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; France was subsequently eliminated from the World Cup following a 2–1 loss to host nation [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in their final group stage match, and finished at the bottom of [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group A|Group A]].

During the World Cup, English comedian [[James Corden]] refused to acknowledge France on his "human wallchart" during his post-World Cup match TV show [[James Corden's World Cup Live]], replacing France with Ireland, and when chatting with the Irish member of the wallchart, referred to players such as "Terry Henry" and "Paddy Evra", Irish variants of the names of France players Theirry Henry and [[Patrice Evra]].&lt;ref&gt;James Corden's World Cup Live, June 2010, ITV&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish playwright and novelist [[Dermot Bolger]]'s stage play, ''The Parting Glass'', is based around this game in Paris, with most of the second half of the play occurring during the actual match in the Stade de France, as an Irish father and son watch their final Ireland game together before the son emigrates to find work in Canada.

===Comparison to other events===
The [[2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final]] between [[Louth GAA|Louth]] and [[Meath GAA|Meath]] held at Croke Park on 11 July 2010 drew comparisons with Thierry Henry's cheating due to its controversial ending in which Louth were wrongfully defeated by a last minute Meath goal which was thrown into the net and therefore should not have stood. Louth were in the lead at the time and would have won their first Leinster Senior Football Championship in 53 years if Meath had not been given the goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0712/1224274518490.html "Referee shoved in chest after GAA final"]. ''The Irish Times''. 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Louth fans burst onto the pitch as the final whistle blew, chasing and physically assaulting the referee around the field, while a steward was knocked unconscious with a bottle during ugly scenes played out on live television. The referee was struck on at least three different points as he scrambled away from the baying mob.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/8808677.stm "Referee Martin Sludden struck after Leinster decider"]. BBC Sport. 11 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Meath chairman Barney Allen compared calls for the game to be replayed with Henry's moment of shame, saying "Ireland didn't get a replay when France got a lucky goal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/mayhem-and-madness-as-fans-attack-referee-2254900.html "Mayhem and madness as fans attack referee"].

''The Belfast Telegraph''. 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; RTÉ analyst [[Pat Spillane]] called it a "disgrace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0711/crokerpark_meath_louth.html "Referee is attacked in Croke Park"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712234014/http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0711/crokerpark_meath_louth.html |date=12 July 2010 }}. RTÉ Sport. 11 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Setanta Sports]] said the "goal" would "now go down in infamy as the GAA's Thierry Henry incident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setanta.com/ie/Articles/2010/07/11/Royal-robbery-as-officials-fail-luckless-Louth/gnid-72449/ "Royal robbery as officials fail luckless Louth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329052620/http://www.setanta.com/ie/Articles/2010/07/11/Royal-robbery-as-officials-fail-luckless-Louth/gnid-72449/ |date=29 March 2012 }}.

===TV===
In 2011, "L'Affair Henry the, ahem, touchiest sporting controversy in living memory" received its own episode of ''[[Scannal]]'', the TV series dedicated to scandalous events. The ''[[Evening Herald]]'' reviewer called it an "entertaining, tightly-packaged edition" of the show but also opined, "Where ''Scannal'' stumbled, however, was in its failure to go in with both feet on the cringe-inducing elephant in the room: John Delaney's embarrassing plea to Fifa boss, the odious Sepp Blatter, to let Ireland be "the 33rd team" at the World Cup".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/hand-of-henry-haunts-us-again-2954746.html|title=Hand of Henry haunts us again|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=6 December 2011|work=Evening Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''20th Anniversary Farewell Tour''' was a concert tour by former members of [[Rhapsody of Fire|Rhapsody]].

Fabio has stated that the original band would no longer exist as the other members want to do different music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/fabio-lione-talks-rhapsody-reunion-after-this-tour-the-original-band-rhapsody-will-not-exist-anymore|title=FABIO LIONE Talks RHAPSODY Reunion – "After This Tour The ‘Original’ Band RHAPSODY Will Not Exist Anymore"|first=|last=bravewords.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keyboardist [[Alex Staropoli]] did not play on this tour.

'''Africa Source''' was a set of events, held in 2004 and 2006 in Namibia and Uganda respectively, to promote the use of [[free software|Free/Libre and Open Source Software]] ([[alternative terms for free software|FLOSS]]) among non-profit and non-governmental organisations. Africa Source was part of the wider "Source Camps" organised by [[Tactical Technology Collective]] (Tacticaltech.org) and its partners, and was also linked to the [[Asia Source]] and other parallel events held elsewhere.

==Africa Source 1==
Africa Source's first camp was held from March 15 to 19, 2004 at Okahandja, Namibia. It had around 60 participants from across Africa. This event's focus was on "the practical challenges of realising F/OSS [Free/Libre and Open Source Software] in the African context, the aim was to build cooperation between Africa's most active F/OSS individuals and projects in the longer term."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacticaltech.org/africasource Africa Source website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Africa Uganda IT meet AfricaSource2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Sharing notes]] Through "practical skill-share sessions", a range of issues were discussed, from localising of GNU/Linux distributions (or "distros") to setting up of wireless networks, work on content management systems, and designing or managing large databases.

It was organised by [http://www.tacticaltech.org Tactical Tech], [http://www.allafrica.co.za AllAfrica] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060908014230/http://www.schoolnet.na/ SchoolNet Namibia]. It was supported by the [[Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa]] (OSISA), [[Open Society Initiative for West Africa]] (OSIWA), OSI Budapest, [[USAID]] and O'Reilly.

==Africa Source 2==
[[Image:Open Source dinner.jpg|thumb|350px|right|At the camp lunch table, on a rainy, indoors day.]]
Africa Source 2 was organised in the first fortnight of January 2006 in [[Kalangala]], an island on [[Lake Victoria]], in [[Uganda]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060912170041/http://wiki.africasource2.tacticaltech.org/post/main/02bI6-i3uh5JWHYG Organisers announced] that the Africa Source II agenda was to be developed for the following primary target audiences:
* NGO (non-government organisation) IT practitioners working with educational institutions, resource and community centres, rights based NGOs and health information organisations
* IT developers, advocates and implementors
* People interested in the localization of software

Main themes for the event were:
* migration and adoption
* alternative access, education and resource centres;
* information handling and advocacy;
* localisation

[[Image:Africa IT event AfricaSource2 smilingfaces.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Faces from the event]]
Many issues came up for debate at the Africa Source 2. Among them were that FLOSS is still too complicated for non-profit organisations and schools to use, and the need for translating FLOSS into African languages.

[[Image:Africa Uganda Kalangala Island.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Campsite view.]]

The event had three tracks: 'migration for NGOs', 'migration for education', and 'information management'

[[Image:Africa Source 2 Skillshares.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Skills: wanted, offered]] In the information track, participants voiced a range of needs. Some asked for details about online tools for publishing. Others wanted the low-down on building and managing community portals. There also was a request for inputs on multimedia authoring and publishing (in both video and audio). Participants also wanted to know how to build a news website.

'''''All About Eve''''' is a 1950 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], and produced by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. It was based on the 1946 short story "[[The Wisdom of Eve]]" by [[Mary Orr]], although screen credit was not given for it.

The film stars [[Bette Davis]] as Margo Channing, a highly regarded but aging [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star. [[Anne Baxter]] plays Eve Harrington, an ambitious young [[fan (aficionado)|fan]] who insinuates herself into Channing's life, ultimately threatening Channing's career and her personal relationships. The film co-stars [[George Sanders]], [[Celeste Holm]], and features [[Gary Merrill]], [[Hugh Marlowe]], [[Thelma Ritter]], [[Marilyn Monroe]] in one of her earliest roles, [[Gregory Ratoff]], [[Barbara Bates]] and [[Walter Hampden]].

Praised by critics at the time of its release, ''All About Eve'' received 14 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations&lt;ref group=notes&gt;This feat was only matched by the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and the 2016 film ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and won six, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. ''All About Eve'' is the only film in [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] history to receive four female acting nominations (Davis and Baxter as [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], Holm and Ritter as [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]). ''All About Eve'' was selected in 1990 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] and was among the first 50 films to be registered. ''All About Eve'' appeared at #16 on [[American Film Institute|AFI]]'s 1998 list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies#List|100 best American films]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/100years/movies.aspx "America's Greatest Movies"] AFI.com. Retrieved 8 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--but dropped to #28 in the 10th anniversary list--&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Bette Davis in All About Eve trailer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Bette Davis]] as Margo Channing]]
Margo Channing ([[Bette Davis]]) is one of the biggest stars on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. But having just turned forty she is worried about what her advancing age will mean for her career. After a performance of Margo's latest play, ''Aged in Wood,'' Margo's close friend Karen Richards ([[Celeste Holm]]), wife of the play's author Lloyd Richards ([[Hugh Marlowe]]), brings in a besotted fan, Eve Harrington ([[Anne Baxter]]), to meet Margo. Eve tells the group gathered in Margo's dressing room—Karen, Lloyd, Margo's boyfriend Bill Sampson ([[Gary Merrill]]), a director who is eight years her junior, and Margo's maid Birdie ([[Thelma Ritter]])—that she followed Margo's last theatrical tour to New York after seeing her perform in [[San Francisco]]. She tells an engrossing story of growing up poor in Wisconsin and losing her young husband in [[World War II]]. Moved, Margo quickly befriends Eve, takes her into her home, and hires her as her assistant, leaving Birdie, who instinctively dislikes Eve, feeling put out.

[[File:Anne Baxter in All About Eve trailer.jpg|thumb|right|187px|[[Anne Baxter]] in wig and costume as Eve Harrington, Margo Channing's understudy]]

Eve quickly insinuates herself into Margo's life, acting as her secretary and adoring fan. She seems to anticipate Margo's every need, including placing a long-distance phone call to Bill when Margo forgets his birthday. Margo becomes increasingly distrustful and bitter towards her, particularly after she catches Eve taking a bow to an empty theatre while pretending to wear Margo's costume for ''Aged in Wood''. Margo asks her producer, Max Fabian, to hire Eve at his office, but instead Eve manages to become Margo's understudy without Margo's knowledge. As Margo's irritation grows, Karen feels sorry for Eve. In hopes of humbling Margo, Karen arranges for her to miss a performance of ''Aged in Wood,'' so Eve will have to give the performance in her place. Eve invites the city's theatre critics, including the acerbic Addison DeWitt ([[George Sanders]]), to attend that evening's performance, which is a triumph for her. After that evening's performance, Eve tries to seduce Bill, but he rejects her. Instead, Addison takes her under his wing and interviews her for a column that criticizes Margo for not making way for new talents like Eve. Margo and Karen are furious.

That evening, Margo and Bill announce their engagement at dinner with the Richardses in the Cub Room of the [[Stork Club]]. Eve, who was dining at a nearby table with DeWitt, calls Karen into the ladies' room and, after first appearing regretful, tells her to either ask Lloyd to give her the part of Cora—the lead in Lloyd's next play, ''Footsteps on the Ceiling''—or she will reveal Karen's role in Margo's missed performance. Before Karen can talk with Lloyd, Margo announces to everyone's surprise that she does not wish to play Cora and would prefer to continue in ''Aged in Wood.''

Eve is cast as Cora. Just before the out-of-town premiere of ''Footsteps on the Ceiling'' at the [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert]] in [[New Haven]], Eve presents Addison with her next plan: to marry Lloyd, who, she claims, has come to her professing his love and his eagerness to leave his wife for her. Now, Eve exults, Lloyd will write brilliant plays showcasing ''her.'' Angered that Eve believes she can manipulate him as easily as she does everyone else, Addison reveals he knows that her back story is all lies. Her real name is Gertrude Slescynski, she was never married, and she had been paid to leave town over an affair with her boss. Addison blackmails Eve, informing her that she will not be marrying Lloyd or anyone else; in exchange for Addison's silence, she now "belongs" to him.

A year later, Eve is a shining Broadway star headed for Hollywood. At an awards banquet, she thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd, and Karen with characteristic effusion, while all four stare back at her coldly. Eve skips a party in her honor, and returns home alone, where she encounters Phoebe ([[Barbara Bates]])—a high-school-aged fan—who has slipped into her apartment and fallen asleep. The young girl professes her adoration and begins at once to insinuate herself into Eve's life, offering to pack Eve's trunk for Hollywood. While Eve rests in the other room, Phoebe dons the elegant robe that Eve wore to the banquet and poses in front of a multi-paned mirror, holding the award as if it were a crown.

==Production==

===Development===
The story of ''All About Eve'' originated in an anecdote related to [[Mary Orr]] by actress [[Elisabeth Bergner]]. While performing in ''[[The Two Mrs. Carrolls]]'' during 1943 and 1944, Bergner allowed a young fan, Martina Lawrence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gussow|first1=Mel|title=FILM; The Lasting Allure Of 'All About Eve'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/01/movies/film-the-lasting-allure-of-all-about-eve.html|accessdate=24 July 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=1 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become part of her household and employed her as an assistant, but later regretted her generosity when the woman attempted to undermine her.  Referring to her only as "the terrible girl," Bergner related the events to Orr, who used it as the basis for her short story "[[The Wisdom of Eve]]" (1946). In the story, Orr gives the girl a more ruthless character and allows her to succeed in stealing the older actress' career.  Bergner later confirmed the basis of the story in her autobiography ''Bewundert viel, und viel gescholten'' (''Greatly Admired and Greatly Scolded'').

In 1949, Mankiewicz was considering a story about an aging actress and, upon reading "The Wisdom of Eve," felt the conniving girl would be a useful added element. He sent a memo to [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] saying it "fits in with an original idea [of mine] and can be combined.  Superb starring role for [[Susan Hayward]]." Mankiewicz presented a [[film treatment]] of the combined stories under the title ''Best Performance.'' He changed the main character's name from Margola Cranston to Margo Channing and retained several of Orr's characters — Eve Harrington, Lloyd and Karen Richards, and Miss Casswell — while removing Margo Channing's husband completely and replacing him with a new character, Bill Sampson. The intention was to depict Channing in a new relationship and allow Eve Harrington to threaten both Channing's professional and personal lives. Mankiewicz also added the characters Addison DeWitt, Birdie Coonan, Max Fabian, and Phoebe.

Zanuck was enthusiastic and provided numerous suggestions for improving the screenplay. In some sections, he felt Mankiewicz's writing lacked subtlety or provided excessive detail. He suggested diluting Birdie Coonan's jealousy of Eve so the audience would not recognize Eve as a villain until much later in the story. Zanuck reduced the screenplay by about 50 pages and chose the title ''All About Eve'' from the opening scenes in which Addison DeWitt says he will soon tell "more of Eve ... All about Eve, in fact."&lt;ref name="staggs"&gt;Staggs, Sam: ''All About "All About Eve"''. St Martin's Press, 2001.  {{ISBN|0-312-27315-0}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the actresses originally considered to play Margo Channing were Mankiewicz's original inspiration, [[Susan Hayward]], who was rejected by Zanuck as "too young," [[Marlene Dietrich]], dismissed as "too [[Germany|German]]," and [[Gertrude Lawrence]], who was ruled out of contention when her lawyer insisted that Lawrence not have to drink or smoke in the film, and that the script would be rewritten to allow her to sing a [[torch song]].&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt; Zanuck favored [[Barbara Stanwyck]], but she was not available. [[Tallulah Bankhead]] was also considered, as was [[Joan Crawford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendaryjoancrawford.com/castaphrocies.html|title=Legendaryjoancrawford.com|author=|date=|work=legendaryjoancrawford.com|accessdate=April 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905231400/http://www.legendaryjoancrawford.com/castaphrocies.html|archive-date=September 5, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was already working on the film ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]].''

Eventually, the role went to [[Claudette Colbert]], but she withdrew after an injury shortly before filming began. Mankiewicz briefly considered [[Ingrid Bergman]] for the aging diva role, before giving it to Bette Davis.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes&gt;TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=67044&amp;category=Notes "Notes"] on [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Davis, who had recently ended an 18-year association with [[Warner Bros.]] after several poorly received films, immediately accepted the role after realizing it was one of the best she had ever read. Channing had originally been conceived as genteel and knowingly humorous, but with the casting of Davis, Mankiewicz revised the character to be more abrasive. Mankiewicz praised Davis both for her professionalism and for the caliber of her performance.

[[Anne Baxter]] had spent a decade in supporting roles and had won the 1946 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]].'' She got the role of Eve Harrington after the first choice, [[Jeanne Crain]], became pregnant. Crain was at the height of her popularity and had established a career playing likable heroines; Zanuck believed she lacked the "bitch virtuosity" required by the part and that audiences would not accept her as a deceitful character.

The role of Bill Sampson was originally intended for [[John Garfield]] or [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan's future wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy Davis]] was considered for Karen Richards and [[José Ferrer]] for Addison DeWitt. [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] actively sought the role of Phoebe without realizing the producers were considering her, along with [[Angela Lansbury]], for Miss Casswell.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Mankiewicz greatly admired [[Thelma Ritter]] and wrote the character of Birdie Coonan for her after working with her on ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' in 1949. As Coonan was the only one immediately suspicious of Eve Harrington, he was confident Ritter would contribute a shrewd characterization casting doubt on Eve and providing a counterpoint to the more "theatrical" personalities of the other characters. [[Marilyn Monroe]], relatively unknown at the time, was cast as Miss Casswell, referred to by DeWitt as a "graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art." Monroe got the part after a lobbying campaign by her agent,&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller, Frank [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67044/All-About-Eve/articles.html#05 "All About Eve"] on [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; despite Zanuck's initial antipathy and belief that she was better suited to comedy.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Angela Lansbury had been originally considered for the role.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; The inexperienced Monroe was cowed by Bette Davis, and it took 11 takes to complete the scene in the theatre lobby with the star; when Davis barked at her, Monroe left the set to vomit.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; Smaller roles were filled by [[Gregory Ratoff]] as the producer Max Fabian, [[Barbara Bates]] as Phoebe, a young fan of Eve Harrington, and [[Walter Hampden]] as the master of ceremonies at an award presentation.&lt;ref name="staggs" /&gt;

===Critical reaction===
''All About Eve'' received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics upon its release on October 13, 1950 at a [[New York City]] premiere. The film's competitor, ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]],'' released the same year, drew similar praise, and the two were often favorably compared. Film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' loved the film, stating that "a fine Darryl Zanuck production, excellent music and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire."&lt;ref name="Bosley"&gt;[[Bosley Crowther|Crowther, Bosley]].

Writing in 2000, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' praised the film, saying Bette Davis' character "veteran actress Margo Channing in ''All About Eve'' was her greatest role."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000611/REVIEWS08/6110301/1023 "All About Eve (1950)"] ''Chicago Sun-Times'' (11 June 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Boxoffice.com stated that it "is a classic of the American cinema&amp;nbsp;– to this day the quintessential depiction of ruthless ambition in the entertainment industry, with legendary performances from Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders anchoring one of the very best films from one of Hollywood's very best Golden Era filmmakers: Joseph L.

===Thematic content===
Critics and academics have delineated various themes in the film. Rebecca Flint Marx, in her ''[[Allmovie]]'' review, notes the antagonism that existed between Broadway and Hollywood at the time, stating that the "script summoned into existence a whole array of painfully recognizable theatre types, from the aging, egomaniacal grand dame to the outwardly docile, inwardly scheming ingenue to the powerful critic who reeks of malignant charm."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Rebecca Flint.

Retrieved 8 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], in his review in ''[[The Great Movies]]'', says Eve Harrington is "a universal type," and focuses on the aging actress plot line, comparing the film to ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]].''&lt;ref name="Great Movies by Roger Ebert, All About Eve"&gt;Ebert, Roger.

She reasons that Margo has three options: "To continue to work, she can perform the role of a young woman, one she no longer seems that interested in. She can take up the position of the angry bitch, the drama queen who holds court (the deliberate [[Notes on "Camp"|camp]] that [[Susan Sontag]] finds in this film). Or she can accept her culture's gendered discourse of aging which figures her as in her moment of fading. Margo ultimately chooses the latter option, accepting her position as one of loss."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Kathleen M.

Professor Robert J. Corber, who has studied [[homophobia]] within the cultural context of the [[Cold War]] in the United States, posits that the foundational theme in ''All About Eve'' is that the defense of the norms of [[heterosexuality]], specifically in terms of patriarchal marriage, must be upheld in the face of challenges from female agency and [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;Field, Douglas. "Gender and Sexuality&amp;nbsp;– All about the Subversive Femme&amp;nbsp;– Cold War Homophobia in All About Eve" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=DztQtydwimMC ''American Cold War Culture''], Edinburgh University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0-7486-1923-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7486-1923-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nurturing heterosexual relationships of Margo and Bill and of Karen and Lloyd serve to contrast with the loveless relationship predation and sterile careerism of the homosexual characters, Eve and Addison.&lt;ref name="unInvited"&gt;White, Patricia. "A Star is Beaten" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPxwl7uSYfYC ''unInvited: Classical Hollywood Cinema and Lesbian Representability''], Indiana University Press, 1999. p. 202-12. {{ISBN|0253213452}}, {{ISBN|9780253213457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eve uses her physical femininity as a weapon to try to break up the marriages of both couples, and Addison's extreme cynicism serves as a model of Eve's future. Even film reviewer Kenneth Geist, despite being critical of the emphasis that Sam Staggs' book ''All About All About Eve'' places on the film's homosexual elements, nonetheless acknowledged that Eve's [[lesbianism]] seemed apparent; specifically, Geist states that "manifestations of Eve’s lesbianism are only twice briefly discernible."&lt;ref name="Geist"&gt;Geist, Kenneth. [http://www.filmsinreview.com/2001/06/23/all-about-all-about-eve/ "All About 'All About Eve'"]. ''Films in Review'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Geist asserted that Mankiewicz "was highly contemptuous of both male and female homosexuals,"&lt;ref name="Geist" /&gt; although Mankiewicz himself suggested otherwise in an interview in which he argued that society should "drop its vendetta against them."&lt;ref&gt;Mankiewicz, Joseph L. and Dauth, Brian. [https://books.google.com/books?id=scIks6TovMEC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=all+about+eve+Mankiewicz+homosexuality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82Shoe8IJv&amp;sig=Zki6cYoq_YJJL7NKI82vIS8G0H8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VNNITKK1GsH98Aa_h7WRDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=homosexual&amp;f=false ''Joseph L.

[[File:George Sanders in All About Eve trailer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|George Sanders as Addison DeWitt]]
[[Homosexuality]] was often linked to [[communism]] during the [[Cold War]]'s [[Lavender Scare]] and critics have written about film's subtle, yet central, Cold War narrative. The fair amount of subtlety employed in ''All About Eve'' is seen as primarily being due to [[Production Code]] restrictions on the depiction of homosexuals in the media during this time.&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cold War Femme"&gt;Corber, Robert. [http://glq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/11/1/1 "Cold War Femme: Lesbian Visibility In ... All About Eve"]. ''GLQ Journal'' [[Duke University]], 2005 11(1):1–22; {{doi|10.1215/10642684-11-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, notwithstanding those restrictions, Corber cites the film as but one example of a recurrent theme within American film of the homosexual as an emotionally bereft predator.&lt;ref name="Culture" /&gt; The documentary ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' also affirms this theme to which Corber refers, including citing numerous other film examples from the same Production Code time period in which ''All About Eve'' was made.&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Celluloid Closet"&gt;Russo, Vito. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DH1ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=celluloid+closet+all+about+eve&amp;q=all+about+eve&amp;pgis=1 The Celluloid Closet]. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1981 {{ISBN|0-06-090871-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-06-090871-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important theme of the film, in terms of war politics and sexuality, involves the post-[[World War II]] pressure placed upon women to acquiesce [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. This pressure to resume "traditional" female roles is especially illustrated in this film in the contrast between Margo's mockery of Karen Richards for being a "happy little housewife" and her lengthy and inspired monologue, as a reformed woman later, about the virtuousness of marriage, including how a woman is not truly a woman without having a man beside her. This submissive and effeminate Margo is contrasted with the theatricality, combativeness, and egotism of the earlier career woman Margo, and the film's two homosexual characters. Margo quips that Eve should place her award "where her heart should be," and Eve is shown bereft at the end of the film. At dinner, the two married couples see Eve and Addison in a similarly negative light, with Margo wondering aloud what schemes Eve was constructing in her "feverish little brain." Additionally, Eve's utility as a personal assistant to Margo early in the film, which is a subtle construct of a same-sex intimate relationship, is decried by Birdie, the same working-class character who immediately detected the theatricality in Eve's story about her "husband." Birdie sees such agency as being unnatural, and the film contrasts its predatory nature ("studying you like a blueprint") with the love and warmth of her later reliance upon Bill. The pressure to acquiesce agency and more highly value patriarchy, following the return of men from the war, after having been shown propaganda promoting agency such as [[Rosie the Riveter]] and after having occupied traditionally male roles such as bomb-building factory worker, was deemed "the problem that has no name" by well-known [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]].&lt;ref name=Rosie&gt;Hunt, Heather. [http://www.honors.umd.edu/HONR269J/projects/hchunt/main.htm ''What Happened To Rosie The Riveter?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202125847/http://honors.umd.edu/HONR269J//projects/hchunt/main.htm |date=February 2, 2009 }}, University of Maryland, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite what critics such as Corber have described as the homophobia pervasive in the movie,&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; ''All About Eve'' has long been a favored film among gay audiences, likely due to its [[campy]] overtones (in part due to the casting of Davis) and its general sophistication. Davis, who long had a strong gay fan base, expressed support for gay men in her 1972 interview with ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name=TimesOnline&gt;Burston, Paul.

When [[American Film Institute|AFI]] named Bette Davis #2 on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female American screen legends]], ''All About Eve'' was the film selected to highlight Davis' legendary career.

The [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild of America]] has ranked the film's screenplay as the fifth greatest ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-greatest-screenplays/list |title=101 Greatest Screenplays |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarah Siddons Award===
The film opens with the image of a fictitious award trophy, described by DeWitt as the "highest honor our theater knows: the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for Distinguished Achievement." The statuette is modelled after the famous [[Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse|painting of Siddons]] costumed as the tragic Muse by Joshua Reynolds, a copy of which hangs in the entrance of Margo's apartment and often visible during the party scene. In 1952, a small group of distinguished [[Chicago]] theater-goers began to give [[Sarah Siddons Award|an award with that name]], which was sculpted to look like the one used in the film. It has been given annually, with past honorees including Bette Davis and Celeste Holm.

==Adaptations==
The first radio adaptation was broadcast on the [[Lux Radio Theatre]] on NBC on October 1, 1951 starring Bette Davis, Gary Merrill and Anne Baxter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genericradio.com/show.php?id=MTA5OTI2NTI4Mw6|title=GENERIC RADIO WORKSHOP OTR SCRIPT: Lux Radio Theater|author=|date=|work=genericradio.com|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second radio version of ''All About Eve'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]] as Margo Channing was presented on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]'' by the Theatre Guild of the Air on November 16, 1952. Bankhead and many contemporary critics felt that the characterization of Margo Channing was patterned on her, a long-rumored charge denied by both Mankiewicz and Davis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/190997%7c0/Trivia-All-About-Eve.html|title=Trivia – All About Eve|author=|date=|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but attested by costume designer [[Edith Head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUFplyZZAZsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224|title=All About All About Eve|author=|date=|work=google.com|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Bankhead's rivalry with her understudy ([[Lizabeth Scott]]) during the production of ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Mary Orr, "The Wisdom of Eve," ''Cosmopolitan'', May 1946, pp. 72–75, 191–95&lt;/ref&gt; is cited as an alternative hypothesis for the origin of [[Mary Orr]]'s ''The Wisdom of Eve,'' the original short story that formed the basis for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Kirle (Southern Illinois University Press; 1st edition, October 24, 2005), ''Unfinished Show Business: Broadway Musicals as Works-in-process,'' p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Kilgallen (Thursday, June 24, 1943), "The $64 Questions," ''The Voice Of Broadway'', Times Herald (Olean, New York), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Bette Davis played three roles on film that had been originated by Tallulah Bankhead — ''[[Dark Victory]]'', ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' and ''[[The Little Foxes]]'', much to Bankhead's chagrin. Bankhead and Davis were considered to be somewhat similar in style.&lt;ref name="finger"&gt;Source: liner notes, ''All About Eve,'' Moving Finger LP MF002&lt;/ref&gt; Several decades later Davis called Channing "the essence of a Tallulah Bankhead kind of actress" in an interview with [[Barbara Walters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqb3boYrOIQ|title=Bette Davis Interview by Barbara Walters Pt1|author=|date=June 1, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production is notable in that Mary Orr, of ''The Wisdom of Eve,'' played the role of Karen Richards. The cast also featured Alan Hewitt as Addison DeWitt (who narrated), [[Beatrice Pearson]] as Eve Harrington, Don Briggs as Lloyd Richards, [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Bill Samson, Florence Robinson as Birdie Coonan, and Stefan Schnabel as Max Fabian.&lt;ref name="finger"/&gt;

In 1970, ''All About Eve'' was the inspiration for the [[musical theatre|stage musical]] ''[[Applause (musical)|Applause]],'' with book by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], lyrics by [[Lee Adams]], and music by [[Charles Strouse]]. The original production starred [[Lauren Bacall]] as Margo Channing, and it won the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] that season. It ran for four previews and 896 performances at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. After Bacall left the production, she was replaced by Anne Baxter in the role of Margo Channing.

==In popular culture==
* The plot of the film has been used numerous times, frequently as an outright homage to the film, with one notable example being a 1974 episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]],'' "A New Sue Ann."  In the episode, the character of [[Sue Ann Nivens]] ([[Betty White]]), hostess of a popular local cooking show, hires a young, pretty and very eager fan as her apprentice and assistant, but the neophyte quickly begins to sabotage her mentor, in an attempt to replace her as host of the show. Sue Ann, however, unlike Margo Channing, prevails in the end, countering the young woman's attempts to steal her success and sending her on her way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starpulse.com/movie/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show%3A_A_New_Sue_Ann/V269407/0/2/ "A New Sue Ann"] Starpulse.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[All About Eve (band)|English rock band of the same name]] took their name from the film.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Bible"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://thegreatrockbible.com/portfolio-item/eve-biography/ | title= All About Eve biography | publisher=The Great Rock Bible | first=Martin C. | last=Strong | accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2008 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]],'' "[[All About Lisa]]," is influenced by this film. In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson]] becomes [[Krusty the Clown]]'s assistant, eventually taking his place on television and receiving an entertainment award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=100521&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=7723638 The Simpsons on Fox] TVGuide.com. Retrieved 18 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s 1999 [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Spanish language]] film, ''[[Todo sobre mi madre]]'' (''[[All About My Mother]]''), has elements similar to those found in ''All About Eve.'' The title of the film itself is an homage to the 1950 film. In the first scene, the character of Manuela and her son, Esteban, are watching a dubbed version of the film on television when the film is introduced as "Eve Unveiled." Esteban comments that the film should be called "Todo Sobre Eva" ("All About Eva"). Later in the scene, he begins writing about his mother in his notebook and calls the piece "Todo sobre Eva." Additionally, Manuela replaces Nina Cruz as Stella for a night in a production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]],'' leading a furious Nina to accuse her of learning the part "just like Eve Harrington!"
* In a season 3 episode of ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]],'' titled "Enough About Eve," [[Blair Waldorf]] has a dream where she is Margo Channing.
* In the fifth season of ''[[The L Word]],'' a fan becomes Jenny Schecter's assistant while she is directing a movie; later the fan blackmails the movie studio into letting her direct and she proceeds to take over Jenny's life.
* In the second season of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]],'' [[Kurt Hummel]] calls his fellow glee club member [[Santana Lopez]] "a Latina Eve Harrington," after learning she is blackmailing a closeted jock into becoming her "beard" and running mate for Prom Queen and King.
* In the first season of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', Grace becomes dependent on a maid to give her a confidence boost during a design competition. This prompts her drunken assistant Karen to suspect a plot and she confronts the maid, exclaiming "I've seen 'All About Eve.' Poooor Eve!"
* In the pilot episode of ''[[Political Animals (miniseries)|Political Animals]],'' when Susan suspects Georgia, a fellow reporter, has a crush on her boyfriend and is attempting to outshine her at the newspaper, she says, "If Eve Harrington were an actual person today, she would look like Georgia. She would bake cupcakes, and she would have a blog."
* In the third season of ''[[Gilligan's Island]],'' the episode "All About Eva" concerns a character coming on the island and taking over Ginger's persona, with both roles played by actress [[Tina Louise]].

==Synopsis==
The film deals with Thomas’s ([[Juliano Mer-Khamis]]) incestuous love for his sister, Mariana ({{ill|Smadar Kilchinsky|he|סמדר קילצ'ינסקי}}): After they arrive together in Tel Aviv-Yafo, after escaping from Migdal HaEmek due to the death of their Christian mother, Ewa ({{ill|Rahel Shor|he|רחל שור}}), and setting up housekeeping in the sleazy side of town, Thomas makes his money as “kept man” for two different women who are nightclub entertainers at a bar filled with homosexual, deformed, and inebriated workers, Luna (Belinka Metzner) and Zara a.k.a. Sarah Azulay ({{ill|Irit Sheleg|he|עירית שלג}}). He first attempts to work at a hotel yet is fired upon being caught stealing supplies for Mariana and has to resort to a dirty shelter. At the same time, he attracts the attentions of an amorous transvestite prostitute and stripper (“Ada Valerie-Tal” i.e. Sergiu Valerie) calling himself “Apolonia Goldstein” (a character based on Abraham Goldstein a.k.a. “[[Gila Goldstein]]” who ran a real-life bar called Bar 51) who allows the siblings to live at his apartment. His unnatural love for his sister goes unexpressed, however, his jealousy cannot be controlled. If his sister wants to lead any sort of a normal life, it will be up to her to break her dependence on her brother and move on.

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Brian Alexander Eaton''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CB|CBE|DSO1|DFC}} (15&amp;nbsp;December 1916&amp;nbsp;– 17&amp;nbsp;October 1992) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in [[Tasmania]] and raised in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he joined the RAAF in 1936 and was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II. He held training positions before being posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] at the beginning of 1943, flying [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighter-bombers in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. Despite being shot down three times within ten days soon after arriving, Eaton quickly rose to become the unit's commanding officer, and by year's end had been awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. His leadership earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]] in 1944–45, and command of [[List of Royal Air Force wings|No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing RAF]] in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], with the temporary rank of [[group captain]]. He was also awarded the US [[Silver Star]] in 1946 in recognition of his war service.

In the decade following World War II, Eaton led [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing]] in Japan, and [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]] in [[Malta]]. He commanded [[RAAF Base Williamtown]] from 1957 to 1959, after which he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]. As Director-General of Operational Requirements in 1965, Eaton argued for increased RAAF co-operation with the [[Australian Army]] in light of growing involvement in the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]]. He was promoted to air vice marshal the next year, and became [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]]. Posted to [[Singapore]] as [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[List of Royal Air Force groups|No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group RAF]] in 1967, he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] for his work as chief of staff at Headquarters [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Air Force]] in 1969. He then served as [[Air Member for Personnel (Australia)|Air Member for Personnel]], before being selected as AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]] in 1973. Eaton retired from the RAAF in December that year, and became an executive for [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] in [[Canberra]]. He died in 1992 at the age of 75.

His early ambition to be a doctor was curtailed when his father died and he had to leave school early.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title='The Boss' packs it in|newspaper=[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]] |page=25|date=12 January 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted as an air cadet in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1936, undergoing flying training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Station Point Cook]].&lt;ref name="WW2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1204686 |title=Eaton, Brian Alexander|publisher= World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate=  10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] upon graduation from flying school in January 1937, and posted to [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]]. Within six months he was promoted to [[flying officer]] and joined [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; In 1938, he became an [[flight instructor|instructor]] at Point Cook's [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], where he also took part in the RAAF's early long navigation exercises.&lt;ref name="Air Marshals"&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Air Marshals of the RAAF'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on [[Invasion of Poland|1&amp;nbsp;September 1939]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;

==World War II==

===Early war service===
{{stack|[[File:MED0687Kittyhawk3Sqn1942.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|P-40 Kittyhawk of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron RAAF during the North African Campaign|alt=Single-engined military monoplane on desert airfield]]}}
In April 1940, Eaton was assigned to the newly re-formed [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] at [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, as an instructor. Promoted to temporary [[squadron leader]] in September 1940, he was transferred to the Directorate of Training in June 1941. He became a fighter controller at [[No. 5 Fighter Sector RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Fighter Sector Headquarters]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, in March 1942.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Air Marshals"/&gt; In October that year, he departed Australia for [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] via India and the United Kingdom, fearful that the fighting would be over before he arrived. He posted in to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Middle East Training School in January 1943 prior to taking up duties with [[No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron RAAF]], which was then engaged in the [[Tunisia Campaign|Battle of Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;

Eaton's combat career began inauspiciously, when he was shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawk]] was hit by [[20 mm caliber|20&amp;nbsp;mm]] cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, "I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened. But my God was I surprised." Eaton brought his crippled aircraft in for a forced landing at [[El Hamma]]—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88&amp;nbsp;mm]] anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Me&amp;nbsp;109]] that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, {{convert|80|mi|km}} away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling on."&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mordike"&gt;Mordike, ''The RAAF in Europe and North Africa 1939–1945'', pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squadron and wing command===

Despite his early setbacks in combat, Eaton soon rose to command No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron, taking over from Squadron Leader [[Bobby Gibbes]] on 21&amp;nbsp;April 1943. He led the unit as it relocated to [[Malta]] the following month, in preparation for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]].&lt;ref name ="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/21.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 567] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305080713/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/21.pdf |date=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illness forced him to hand over command in June–July, but he returned to take charge of the squadron in August as it continued to fly escort and [[interdiction]] missions in Sicily with other units of [[List of Royal Air Force wings|No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing RAF]].&lt;ref name="Herington"&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/03.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 57] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161942/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/03.pdf |date=27 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force.

He repeated the exercise on 7&amp;nbsp;November, when the squadron scored hits on vessels in two separate raids in the harbour at [[Split (city)|Split]]. On 19&amp;nbsp;November, when the rest of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing was unable to complete any missions due to adverse weather, Eaton found a hole in the clouds and led eight Kittyhawks in a successful attack on [[Opi (town)|Opi]] in central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; On 14&amp;nbsp;December, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for pressing home a night attack on [[Axis powers|Axis]] armour at [[Termoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110019.pdf|title= Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 10 April 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132159/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110019.pdf|archivedate= 5 March 2016|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citation was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 36459 |supp=y|page=1616|date=14 December 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16&amp;nbsp;February 1944, the day after the contentious destruction of [[Monte Cassino]], Eaton took No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/04.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 104] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306023621/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/04.pdf |date=6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; He handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final [[Battle of Monte Cassino|assault on Monte Cassino]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt; The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy.

Raised to acting [[group captain]],&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; Eaton was given command of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing on 3&amp;nbsp;August 1944, taking responsibility for No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron and [[No.&amp;nbsp;450 Squadron RAAF]], [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;112 Squadron]] and [[List of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons|No.&amp;nbsp;260 Squadron RAF]], No.&amp;nbsp;5 Squadron of the [[South African Air Force]], and No.&amp;nbsp;250 Squadron of the [[Royal Rhodesian Air Force]]. Credited with leading "many outstanding raids", he was known to his staff as "The Boss", and often flew twice a day with a different squadron on each mission; when his superiors found out how many sorties he was personally undertaking and ordered him to cut back, he simply ceased recording his flying hours.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/14.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 351] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144548/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/14.pdf |date=27 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wing's two RAF squadrons had already re-equipped with [[P-51 Mustang]]s when Eaton took over; No.&amp;nbsp;5 converted in September and No.&amp;nbsp;3 in November. As well as supporting the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] in Italy, the Mustang units carried out missions in Yugoslavia in concert with the [[Balkan Air Force]], prior to Axis forces surrendering on 2&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 353–356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scutts, ''Mustang Aces of the Ninth &amp; Fifteenth Air Forces &amp; the RAF'', pp. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton was unofficially credited with shooting down as many as seven enemy aircraft during the Mediterranean campaigns, but was never listed among Australian [[flying ace]]s. Many of the missions that he undertook with No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron and in command of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing were ground attack or anti-shipping sorties, rather than air-to-air combat. He was also known as a leader who, when opportunities did arise to engage other aircraft, would attempt to manoeuvre his rookie pilots into position to make a "kill", rather than take the shot himself.&lt;ref name="Mordike"/&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;June, he was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his Distinguished Service Order for "Outstanding skill and leadership against heavy odds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110018.pdf |title=Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Service Order |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=10 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144600/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110018.pdf |archivedate=27 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 37125 |supp=y|page=3083|date=12 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; His war service also earned him the US [[Silver Star]], permission to wear it being [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 14&amp;nbsp;June 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=391320|title=Recommendation: US Silver Star|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=10 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606092943/http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=391320|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 37610 |supp=y|page=3007|date=14 June 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==

===Rise to senior command===
[[File:JK0145EatonKorea1951.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Wing Commander Eaton in a No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron [[Gloster Meteor|Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], October 1951|alt=Man in flying cap and goggles sitting in aircraft cockpit]]
Eaton was posted to Britain following the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II, and attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover|RAF Staff College]] the next year.&lt;ref name="Air Marshals"/&gt;  In September 1947, he was appointed Officer Commanding [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 (Fighter) Wing]] in Japan, as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). The Australian contingent initially comprised three combat units, [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;76]], [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77]] and [[No. 82 Squadron RAAF|82 Squadrons]], as well as No.&amp;nbsp;381 (Base) Squadron, No.&amp;nbsp;481 (Maintenance) Squadron, No.&amp;nbsp;111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and [[No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Airfield Construction Squadron]]. By mid-1949, it had been reduced to No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron alone, and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded; Eaton served as "RAAF Component" commander for the remainder of his tenure in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 208–211, 214, 217, 222&lt;/ref&gt; As well as surveillance patrols, training and inter-service exercises, the Australian airmen took part in ceremonial flypasts. On one such occasion, over Tokyo, Eaton led his formation of thirty Mustangs into cloud with a faulty [[artificial horizon]] in his plane, with the result that he and his comrades, who were following his lead, became badly disorientated and were fortunate to avoid collision; RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered this a not-atypical example of the casual attitude to flying safety exhibited at the time by the veteran pilots of World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 216–219&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Australia in November 1949, Eaton became Deputy Director of Training at the Department of Air, [[Canberra]], where he remained until 1951. Later that year, he was appointed Officer Commanding [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 (Fighter) Wing]] at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He had reverted to a substantive rank of wing commander since leaving Japan, as the RAAF shrank dramatically with demobilisation and many senior officers lost the temporary or acting ranks they had gained in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;September, he landed a [[De Havilland Vampire|Vampire]] jet fighter at Point Cook with one flat tyre and one wheel retracted, after its undercarriage had become jammed. The plane skidded off the runway but Eaton was able to walk away, reportedly remarking "Well, I didn't wreck it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18496297?|title=Jet Lands on one flat tyre|newspaper=[[Sunday Herald (Australia)|Sunday Herald]] |date=16 September 1951 |accessdate=18 April 2010|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Josephine Rumbles at [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]] Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1952; the couple later had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;Draper, ''Who's Who in Australia 1983'', p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zCcRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GcQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=eaton%20raaf&amp;pg=7224%2C1315745|title=Jet Fighter CO weds|newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=12 May 1952 |accessdate=18 April 2010|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Britain's request to the Australian government for a Commonwealth garrison in the Mediterranean, in July 1952 Eaton led No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing on deployment to [[RAF Hal Far]] near [[Valletta]], Malta, where its combat squadrons, [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]] and 76, were equipped with leased Vampire FB9s.

Completing his tour with No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing in mid-1954, Eaton joined Air Vice Marshal [[Alister Murdoch]] on an international mission to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft for the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', pp. 142, 160&lt;/ref&gt; The team's report advocated the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]] as a replacement for the [[CAC Sabre]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear-capable]] British [[V bomber|V-bomber]] strike aircraft to augment Australia's [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, and [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] transports to replace the [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]]. While the proposals for V-bombers and the F-104 were not taken up, the Australian Government acquired the C-130 in 1958. Described as second only to the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] as the "most significant" purchase by the RAAF, the Hercules gave the Air Force its first [[Airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlift]] capability, which in years to come would provide a "lifeline" to Australian forces deployed to [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and other parts of the South-West Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 416–18&lt;/ref&gt; The mission also recommended the locally built Vampire T35 as a jet trainer for No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School; sixty-nine were later delivered by the [[de Havilland]] factory in [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton served as RAAF Director of Operations during 1955–56, and as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Williamtown and Commandant of the co-located School of Land-Air Warfare from March 1957 until February 1959.&lt;ref name="Air Marshals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force: Bases'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1959 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41728 |supp=y|page=3736|date=13 June 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his tour at Williamtown, Eaton spent two years as Director of Joint Services Plans before attending the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College, London]] in 1961. Raised to [[air commodore]], he was appointed Director-General Operational Requirements in 1962. Concurrently he became an Honorary [[Aide-de-Camp]] to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]], in which capacity he served until 1965.&lt;ref name="Air Marshals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt; As the Army reorganised to deal with [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's increasing commitments to the Vietnam War]] in the mid-1960s, it sought to procure a dozen twin-engined aircraft of a size hitherto only operated by the RAAF, and also proposed a joint review of [[close air support]]. RAAF senior command chose to deal with the Army's proposals by ignoring them. As Director-General of Operational Requirements, Eaton argued that if the RAAF did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army, then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations, undermining the RAAF's position as the main provider of Australia's air power. Pointing out to the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal Murdoch, that it was "clearly the Army's intention to have complete command and control" of air-to-ground assets, he warned of a parallel situation in America, where the [[United States Army|US Army]] was looking to take over all battlefield air support in response to the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] failing to keep up to date in the provision of basic attack aircraft. The RAAF's refusal to adequately deal with its ground support responsibilities led to long-running inter-service enmity, and contributed to the Australian government's decision twenty years later to transfer control of battlefield helicopters to the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 317–322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Eaton also led the acquisition team that selected the [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326]] as the RAAF's new jet trainer, as it met all requirements, could be licence-built in Australia, and was relatively inexpensive. The first of ninety-seven was delivered by the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 161–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to [[air vice marshal]], Eaton became [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] in 1966. In December that year, with Australian [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]] transports and [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Iroquois]] helicopters already serving in Vietnam, Eaton advocated building up the RAAF's "sharp end" there, increasing air support for ground troops. He preferred deploying Sabre or [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage]] fighters rather than the mooted Canberra bombers, which he saw as more suitable for a strategic role. Above all, he accepted the "[[domino theory]]" and believed that if Australia did not aid South Vietnam, "we'd lose the lot". In the event, Canberras were despatched rather than fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', pp. 124, 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Eaton became the last AOC of [[List of Royal Air Force groups|No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group RAF]] under the British Far East Air Force (FEAF) in [[Singapore]], as permanent squadrons were dropped from its strength. This reorganisation led to him taking over as chief of staff at Headquarters FEAF the following year.&lt;ref name="Air Marshals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 44864 |supp=y|page=5995|date=14 June 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Australia, Eaton became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in October 1969. As AMP, he sat on the [[Air Board (Australia)|Air Board]], the RAAF's controlling body, consisting of its most senior officers and chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.&lt;ref name="Solo"&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1973, he was appointed AOC Operational Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]).&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solo"/&gt; He served in this position until retirement, his tenure witnessing the introduction of the F-111C [[Variable-sweep wing|swing-wing]] bomber to service in Australia, when the first machines touched down at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, in July. Leaving the military on 15&amp;nbsp;December 1973,&lt;ref name="WW2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton became Regional Executive for [[Rolls Royce plc|Rolls Royce Australia]] in Canberra. He remained with the company for the next decade, continuing to live in Canberra until his death on 17&amp;nbsp;October 1992, at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="Air Marshals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt; In 1996, his widow Josephine donated funding for the Air Vice-Marshal B.A.&amp;nbsp;Eaton 'Airman of the Year' Award to the RAAF, to annually recognise "significant contribution to both the Service and the community" by [[Ranks of the RAAF#Airmen|airmen and airwoman]] ranked [[corporal]] or below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/Awards/ |title=Air Vice-Marshal B.A. Eaton Award (Airman of the year)|publisher= [[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate= 16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 52 Dharavi near Mahim Junction.jpg|thumb|The [[Dharavi]] slum in [[Mumbai]], the film's setting.]]
[[Mumbai]] Police commissioner Ajay Bhardwaj announces the end of the "[[Mafia Raj]]" in the city, to try to bring peace to the city's streets. However, a ruthless south Indian named Vijay Surya comes to the city, aspiring to be the most powerful Mafia Don there. Staying in [[Dharavi]] with his friend, he is introduced to a local politician Laalu, who is in trouble and offers him help. He recruits a portion of the gangsters and criminals living in Mumbai led by Naseer to work under him. Surya's henchman Shakeel manages to kill a witness of Laalu's crimes in the jail where he is kept in, winning Laalu's friendship.

After this, Surya promises to clear the debts of Dharavi locals so that their houses will not be repossessed. His men rob the original copies of the loan documents in the local branch of [[Bank of Maharashtra]] and destroy the bank records. Surya slowly becomes both popular and feared as an extortionist, while Dharavi locals praise him as their saviour. Surya is aware of Bhardwaj's intentions. To safeguard himself, he traps Bhardwaj's daughter Chitra, a keen painter, by posing as a NRI businessman interested in arts. They both fall in love. However, by the time Surya realises that he truly loves her, Bhardwaj has exposed Surya's real nature to Chitra which makes her hate him. Surya is immediately arrested.

Surya is released after manipulating Bhardwaj by having his associates kidnap Chitra. He promises to leave crime behind him and asks Bhardwaj for permission to marry Chitra. When they refuse his proposal, he insists to Bhardwaj that he will set up a business which is untouchable by the police, and will eventually marry Chitra. Surya sets up a company named "Surya Exports &amp; Imports" as a front for the organised crime that they indulge in. He plans to grow his organised crime network all over India and begins to set up branch offices for "Surya Exports &amp; Imports" in all major cities, towns and villages all over India. He recruits local gangsters for staff and begins to forcibly collect a two percent tax on every contract made in that area. Surya amasses a huge fortune, making him a billionaire, and during the inauguration of his "Business Bank", he reveals his thirst for power to Bhardwaj. He claims that the crime rate dropped significantly after he started to recruit all the gangsters. He also states that he wants to rid India of crime and help the needy.

Next, Surya helps Laalu to become the Mayor of Mumbai by defeating Arun Ghokle, endorsed by Ghanapuleti Jai Dev, a powerful national politician who wants to become the new prime minister of India in the upcoming elections. Ghokle then reveals Jai Dev's illegal scams to Bhardwaj, after which he is killed by Jai Dev. After the meeting, Surya comes to know that Jai Dev is planning to kill Bhardwaj and Chitra. He reaches Chitra's house and saves her but fails to save Bhardwaj. Chitra is devastated and Surya reveals to her that he was an American-born Indian who lost his philanthropist NRI father and mother at an early age; they were cheated and killed by Jai Dev. This incident and the peoples' attitudes towards orphans while growing up made him hate that society.

Surya shifts his attention towards the upcoming [[Elections in India|Indian parliament elections]] and meets Guru Govind Patel, the head of the opposition party through Laalu. He makes a deal with him, offering {{INR}}350 billion for election campaigning and also promises him that he would make him the prime minister of India. Surya spends millions on every constituency in India, making Jai Dev unable to contest in the elections by revealing his illegal affairs. Jai Dev kidnaps Chitra to seek revenge on Surya, who fights with Jai Dev's henchmen. He is injured, but eventually kills Jai Dev, saving Chitra and proposing to her for the last time. It is revealed at the end that Surya successfully installed Guru Govind Patel as the Prime Minister of India.

Surya is last seen recuperating in a hospital in the company of Chitra, who accepts his proposal.

=== Development ===
[[Ram Gopal Varma]] signed [[Suriya]] for a multilingual [[crime film]] titled ''The Businessman'' in May 2010, to be directed by [[Puri Jagannadh]] simultaneously in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. The film's protagonist was supposed to be a south Indian coming to [[Mumbai]] and setting up a crime business using tact and intelligence to emerge as one of the biggest gangsters.&lt;ref name="suriya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/suriya-signs-another-rgv-film-news-tamil-kkfq7Mdagbesi.html|title=Suriya signs another RGV film?|publisher=[[Sify]]|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=18 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218171043/http://www.sify.com/movies/suriya-signs-another-rgv-film-news-tamil-kkfq7Mdagbesi.html|archivedate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's production was expected to begin in October 2010 once Suriya completed his part in ''[[7aum Arivu]]'' (2011) and was scheduled for release in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref name="suriya" /&gt; Jagannadh stated in an interview that [[principal photography]] would begin in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmibeat.com/telugu/news/2010/puri-speaks-businessman-240510.html|title=Puri Jagannath speaks on The Businessman|author=Ramchander|publisher=[[Oneindia.com|Oneindia Entertainment]]|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=18 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218171050/http://www.filmibeat.com/telugu/news/2010/puri-speaks-businessman-240510.html|archivedate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that the film was to be based on the real-life story of a gangster who had moved from the [[Cuddalore district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] to Mumbai in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmibeat.com/tamil/news/2010/surya-businessman-gangster-220610.html|title=Surya's Businessman&amp;nbsp;— a biopic on a gangster?|author=Ramchander|publisher=Oneindia Entertainment|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=18 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218171040/http://www.filmibeat.com/tamil/news/2010/surya-businessman-gangster-220610.html|archivedate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was revived later by [[R. R. Venkat]] later in January 2011 with a tagline "Guns do not need agreements". He signed  [[Mahesh Babu]] as the protagonist who worked with Jagannadh in the past for ''[[Pokiri]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-babu-s-the-businessman-news-telugu-lbvthLgejhbsi.html|title=Mahesh Babu`s `The Businessman`|publisher=Sify|date=22 January 2011|accessdate=18 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218171240/http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-babu-s-the-businessman-news-telugu-lbvthLgejhbsi.html|archivedate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venkat added that the film would be produced under the banner [[R.

S. Thaman was criticised for copying the tunes of the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisan]] song "[[Bella ciao]]" for the song "Pilla Chao"and "[[He Lives in You]]", a song written and performed by [[Lebo M]] and his South African Choir for the album ''[[Rhythm of the Pride Lands]]'' (1995), for the song "Chandamama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/how-bella-ciao-turned-into-pilla-chao/article2750486.ece|title=How ‘Bella Ciao' turned into ‘Pilla Chao'|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|date=27 December 2011|accessdate=23 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223150632/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/how-bella-ciao-turned-into-pilla-chao/article2750486.ece|archivedate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pilla Chao" was one of the more successful songs on the soundtrack and many music lovers left angry comments about the plagiarism on the song's [[YouTube]] video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Pilla-Chao-is-a-copy/articleshow/11362761.cms |title=Pilla Chao is a copy |last=Kavirayani |first=Suresh |publisher=''The Times of India'' |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223150629/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Pilla-Chao-is-a-copy/articleshow/11362761.cms |archivedate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The makers violated the rules of The Cinematograph Act, 1952 and the Central Board of Film Certification regarding the re-working of its title from ''The Businessman'' to ''Businessman'' after the board cleared the film with the former title. The Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber of Commerce cleared the registration of the film title as ''The Businessman'' on 1 January 2011 through a letter and was renewed up to 22 April 2012. The set of posters sent to the board for certification purpose carried the full title. The film was publicised without the definite article, which was also missing from the posters. Also the 'A' certification was omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Businessman-throws-rules-to-the-winds/articleshow/11855200.cms |title='Businessman' throws rules to the winds |publisher=''The Times of India'' |date=12 February 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223150628/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Businessman-throws-rules-to-the-winds/articleshow/11855200.cms |archivedate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suresh Krishnamoorthy of ''[[The Hindu]]'' called ''Businessman'' a "wholesome package" and a "pure entertainer", quoting "Puri Jagannath has proved that he's still the director with the Midas touch with his latest release, ''Businessman''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/article2800156.ece|title=A cool escape from reality, literally|last=Krishnamoorthy|first=Suresh|publisher=''The Hindu''|date=14 January 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222154329/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/article2800156.ece|archivedate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Y.

[[Indo-Asian News Service]] gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and called ''Businessman'' a film for Mahesh's fans and highlighted Mahesh's performance and Jagannadh's dialogues as the film's strong points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/telugu-review-businessman-is-a-must-watch/221104-62-131.html|title=Telugu Review: 'Businessman' a must watch for punchy dialogues, Mahesh's superb acting|author=IANS|publisher=IBN Live|date=15 January 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222154518/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/telugu-review-businessman-is-a-must-watch/221104-62-131.html|archivedate=22 February 2015}} {{rating|3|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer from IANS called the film "senseless yet entertaining" and stated "Mahesh's dashing performance as a mafia kingpin with a hidden personal agenda is commendable and deserves high appreciation. ''Businessman'' may be perverse and appeal only to the masses, yet is a winner for unexplainable reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/businessman-review-this-tamil-film-is-for-the-masses/309332-40.html|title='Businessman' Review: This Tamil film is for the masses|author=IANS|publisher=IBN Live|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222154516/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/businessman-review-this-tamil-film-is-for-the-masses/309332-40.html|archivedate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radhika Rajamani of [[Rediff.com]] gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and opined that ''Businessman'' was an entertaining film if watched uncritically. She added "There's no doubt that Puri Jagan has played to the gallery and kept the masses and Mahesh's image in mind while conceiving this film. It's just Mahesh all the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/south-review-businessman-is-a-treat-for-mahesh-fans/20120113.htm|title=Review: Businessman is a treat for Mahesh fans|last=Rajamani|first=Radhika|publisher=Rediff.com|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222154640/http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/south-review-businessman-is-a-treat-for-mahesh-fans/20120113.htm|archivedate=22 February 2015}} {{rating|2.5|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sify]] felt that the film was strictly for Mahesh's fans but praised Jagannadh's work saying that the "story sounds far fetched, demanding logic. The screenplay is a saving grace, which works like magic, making the audiences forget the monotony in between." The reviewer highlighted Mahesh's performance, the dialogues and the songs as the film's stronger elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/businessman-review-watch-it-for-mahesh-babu-s-sake-review-telugu-14988630.html|title=Businessman review: Watch it for Mahesh Babu`s sake|publisher=Sify|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222154638/http://www.sify.com/movies/businessman-review-watch-it-for-mahesh-babu-s-sake-review-telugu-14988630.html|archivedate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramchander of [[Oneindia.in|Oneindia Entertainment]] called ''Businessman'' a serious film with limited appeal, which might be enjoyed by Mahesh's fans but which would be an average for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmibeat.com/telugu/reviews/2012/businessman-movie-review-130112.html|title=Businessman&amp;nbsp;— Movie Review|author=Ramchander|publisher=Oneindia Entertainment|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222154637/http://www.filmibeat.com/telugu/reviews/2012/businessman-movie-review-130112.html|archivedate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; B.

'''Castle Walk''' is a [[dance]] originated and made famous by [[Vernon and Irene Castle]]. The Castle Walk  became  popular through its introduction into the [[Tango (dance)|Tango]].

In this dance, the man continually goes forward and the lady backward. In order that the lady may be properly guided about the room, the man's arm encircles her just under her arm, while her left hand rests on the man's right arm. The position of the lady's right arm and the man's left arm is high, with their hands clasped, see the illustration.&lt;ref name=aabc&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/musdi:@field(DOCID+@lit(M16127)) the description] from ''[[An American Ballroom Companion]]''&lt;/ref&gt;


The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady backward with her right, simply walking with gliding steps keeping on the toes, one count of the music to each step. This step is continued to the end of the room, where a large circle is begun, which is gradually made smaller and smaller, until it is ended by whirling completely around three times, to three counts of the music and then dip.&lt;ref name=aabc/&gt;

The Castle Walk may be varied by describing the figure eight or zig-zag instead of the large circle.&lt;ref name=aabc/&gt;

To make the three whirls is rather a difficult matter, as it must be done very rapidly to accomplish
a complete revolution to one beat of the music, but with a little practice it is soon learned.&lt;ref name=aabc/&gt;

[[Troy Kinney]] describes the Castle Walk as part of [[One-Step]] as follows: &lt;ref name=kinney&gt;[[Troy Kinney]], [[Margaret West Kinney]] (1914) "The Dance: Its Place in Art and Life" ([[public domain]], digitized  by [[Google]])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a walking step
of direct advance and retreat, not used to move to the
side. The couple are in closed position, the woman,
therefore, stepping backward as the man steps forward,
and vice versa. The advancing foot is planted in fourth
position, the knee straight, the toe down so that the ball
of the foot strikes the floor first. The walk presents an
appearance of strutting, although the shoulders are held
level, and the body firm; a sharp twist that punctuates

'''Contesting''' (also known as ''[[radiosport]]'') is a competitive activity pursued by [[amateur radio operators]].  In a contest, an [[amateur radio station]], which may be operated by an individual or a team, seeks to contact as many other amateur radio stations as possible in a given period of time and exchange information.  Rules for each competition define the [[amateur radio frequency allocations|amateur radio bands]], the mode of communication that may be used, and the kind of information that must be exchanged.  The contacts made during the contest contribute to a score by which stations are ranked.  Contest sponsors publish the results in magazines and on web sites.

Contesting grew out of other amateur radio activities in the 1920s and 1930s.  As intercontinental communications with amateur radio became more common, competitions were formed to challenge stations to make as many contacts as possible with amateur radio stations in other countries.  Contests were also formed to provide opportunities for amateur radio operators to practice their message handling skills, used for routine or [[Amateur radio emergency communications|emergency]] communications across long distances.  Over time, the number and variety of radio contests has increased, and many amateur radio operators today pursue the sport as their primary amateur radio activity.

There is no international authority or governance organization for this sport.  Each competition is sponsored separately and has its own set of rules.  Contest rules do not necessarily require entrants to comply with voluntary international band plans.  Participants must, however, adhere to the amateur radio regulations of the country in which they are located.  Because radio contests take place using amateur radio, competitors are generally forbidden by their national amateur radio regulations from being compensated financially for their activity.  High levels of amateur radio contest activity, and contesters failing to comply with international band plans, can result in friction between contest participants and other amateur radio users of the same radio spectrum.

==Contesting basics==
Radio contests are principally sponsored by amateur radio societies, radio clubs, or radio enthusiast magazines.  These organizations publish the rules for the event, collect the operational logs from all stations that operate in the event, cross-check the logs to generate a score for each station, and then publish the results in a [[magazine]], in a society journal, or on a [[web site]].  Because the competitions are between stations licensed in the Amateur Radio Service (with the exception of certain contests which sponsor awards for [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]]), which prohibits the use of radio frequencies for pecuniary interests, there are no professional radio contests or professional contesters, and any awards granted by the contest sponsors are typically limited to paper certificates, plaques, or trophies.&lt;ref name="amateur_service_definition"&gt;[[International Telecommunications Union]] (2005).

[[File:Contesting-multioperator.JPG|thumb|left|270px|A multioperator contest effort involves a team of operators at one station.]]

During a radio contest, each station attempts to establish two-way contact with other licensed amateur radio stations and exchange information specific to that contest.  The information exchanged could include an [[R-S-T system]] signal report, a name, the national region, i.e. a province or US state, in which the station is located, the geographic zone&lt;ref name="waz_map_1947"&gt;''CQ Amateur Radio''.  [http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/wazmap.jpg CQ DX Zones of the World map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719125707/http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/wazmap.jpg |date=2006-07-19 }}.  Originally published 1947.  Retrieved Jan. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the station is located, the [[Maidenhead grid locator]] in which the station is located, the age of the operator, or an incrementing serial number.  For each contact, the radio operator must correctly receive the [[call sign]] of the other station, as well as the information in the "exchange", and record this data, along with the time of the contact and the band or frequency that was used to make the contact, in a log.

A contest score is computed based on a formula defined for that contest.  A typical formula assigns some number of points for each contact, and a "multiplier" based on some aspect of the exchanged information. Often, rules for contests held on the [[Very High Frequency|VHF]] amateur radio bands assign a new multiplier for each new Maidenhead grid locator in the log, rewarding the competitors that make contacts with other stations in the most locations.  Many [[High frequency|HF]] contests reward stations with a new multiplier for contacts with stations in each country - often based on the "entities" listed on the [[DX Century Club|DXCC country list]] maintained by the [[American Radio Relay League]] ("ARRL").  Depending on the rules for a particular contest, each multiplier may count once on each radio band or only once during the contest, regardless of the radio band on which the multiplier was first earned.  The points earned for each contact can be a fixed amount per contact, or can vary based on a geographical relationship such as whether or not the communications crossed a [[continents|continental]] or political boundary.  Some contests, such as the Stew Perry Top Band Distance Challenge, award points are scaled to the distance separating the two stations.&lt;ref name="stew_perry"&gt;Boring Amateur Radio Club. [http://www.kkn.net/stew/stew.rules.txt Rules, Stew Perry Top Band Distance Challenge].  Retrieved Aug 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most contests held in Europe on the VHF and microwave bands award 1 point per kilometre of distance between the stations making each contact.&lt;ref name="point-kilometre"&gt;Radio Society of Great Britain General Rules for VHF Contests (2012), [http://www.rsgbcc.org/vhf/rules/12rules/frameindex.html], Deutscher Amateur Radio Club General Rules for VHF Contests (2006) [http://www.darc.de/referate/ukw-funksport/index.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

After they are received by the contest sponsor, logs are checked for accuracy.  Points can be deducted or credit and multipliers lost if there are errors in the log data for a given contact.  Depending on the scoring formula used, the resulting scores of any particular contest can be either a small number of points or in the millions of points.  Most contests offer multiple entry categories, and declare winners in each category.  Some contests also declare regional winners for specific geographic subdivisions, such as continents, countries, U.S. states, or Canadian provinces.&lt;ref name="all_asia_2004"&gt;An example of published results that break down winning entries by continent: Japan Amateur Radio League (2004).

The most common entry category is the single operator category and variations thereof, in which only one individual operates a radio station for the entire duration of the contest.  Subdivisions of the single operator category are often made based on the highest power output levels used during the contest, such as a [[QRP operation|QRP]] category for single operator stations using no more than five [[watt]]s of output power, or a High Power category that allows stations to transmit with as much output power as their license permits.  Multi-operator categories allow for teams of individuals to operate from a single station, and may either allow for a single [[radio transmitter]] or several to be in use simultaneously on different amateur radio bands.  Many contests also offer team or club competitions in which the scores of multiple radio stations are combined and ranked.&lt;ref name="club_competition"&gt;[[American Radio Relay League]] (2005).

==Types of contests==
A wide variety of amateur radio contests are sponsored every year.  Contest sponsors have crafted competitive events that serve to promote a variety of interests and appeal to diverse audiences.  Radio contests typically take place on weekends or local weeknight evenings, and can last from a few hours to forty-eight hours in duration.  The rules of each contest will specify which stations are eligible for participation, the radio frequency bands on which they may operate, the communications [[Modulation|modes]] they may employ, which other amateur radio stations they may contact, and the specific time period during which they may make contacts for the contest.

Some contests restrict participation to stations in a particular geographic area, such as a continent or country.  Contests like the European HF Championship&lt;ref name="euhfc"&gt;Slovenia Contest Club (2005). [http://lea.hamradio.si/~scc/euhfcrules.htm Rules, European HF Championship].  Retrieved Jan. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; aim to foster competition between stations located in one particular part of the world, specifically Europe.  There are contests in which any amateur radio station worldwide may participate and make contact with any other stations for contest credit.  The CQ World Wide DX Contest permits stations to contact other stations anywhere else on the planet, and attracts tens of thousands of participating stations each year.&lt;ref name="cqww"&gt;''CQ Amateur Radio'' (2005). [http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cqwwhome.html CQ World Wide DX Contest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107213535/http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cqwwhome.html |date=2006-01-07 }}.  Retrieved Jan. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In large contests the number of people taking part is a significant percentage of radio amateurs active on the [[High frequency|HF bands]], although they in themselves are a small percentage of the total amateurs in the world.

There are regional contests that invite all stations around the world to participate, but restrict which stations each competitor may contact.  For example, Japanese stations in the Japan International DX Contest (sponsored by ''[[Five Nine]]'' magazine) may only contact other stations located outside Japan and vice versa.&lt;ref name="jidx"&gt;JIDX Contest Committee (2005). [http://www.jidx.org/jidxrule-e.html Japan International DX Contest Rules].  Retrieved Jan. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also contests that limit participation to just the stations located in a particular continent or country, even though those stations may work any other station for points.

All contests use one or more amateur radio bands on which competing stations may make two-way contacts.  HF contests use one or more of the [[160 meters|160 meter]], [[80 meters|80 Meter]], [[40 meters|40 Meter]], [[20 meters|20 Meter]], [[15 meters|15 Meter]], and [[10 meters|10 Meter]] bands.  VHF contests use all the amateur radio bands above [[Megahertz|50 MHz]].  Some contests permit activity on all HF or all VHF bands, and may offer points for contacts and multipliers on each band.  Other contests may permit activity on all bands but restrict stations to making only one contact with each other station, regardless of band, or may limit multipliers to once per contest instead of once per band.  Most VHF contests in North America are similar to the ARRL June VHF QSO Party,&lt;ref name="junevhf"&gt;[[American Radio Relay League]] (2005). [http://www.arrl.org/contests/rules/2005/june-vhf.html 2005 ARRL June VHF QSO Party Rules].  Retrieved Jan. 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and allow contacts on all the amateur radio bands 50&amp;nbsp;MHz or higher in frequency.  Most VHF contests in the United Kingdom, however, are restricted to one amateur radio band at a time.&lt;ref name="rsgb_vhf"&gt;[[Radio Society of Great Britain]] VHF Contest Committee (2012).

Retrieved Jan. 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  An HF contest with worldwide participation that restricts all contest activity to just one band is the ARRL 10 Meter Contest.&lt;ref name="arrl10"&gt;Jones, David K4DLJ (2005).  "The 2004 ARRL 10 Meter Contest Results".  ''[[QST]]''.  July, 2005, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contests exist for enthusiasts of all modes.  Some contests are restricted to just [[Continuous wave|CW]] emissions using the [[Morse code]] for communications, some are restricted to [[telephony]] modes and spoken communications, and some employ digital emissions modes such as [[RTTY]] or [[PSK31]].  Many popular contests are offered on two separate weekends, one for CW and one for telephony, with all the same rules.  The CQ World Wide WPX Contest, for example, is held as a phone-only competition one weekend in March, and a CW-only competition one weekend in May.&lt;ref name="cqwpx"&gt;Bolia, Stephen N8BJQ (2006). [http://home.woh.rr.com/wpx/ CQ WPX Contest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117043940/http://home.woh.rr.com/wpx/ |date=2006-01-17 }}.  Retrieved Jan. 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some contests, especially those restricted to a single radio frequency band, allow the competing stations to use several different emissions modes.  VHF contests typically permit any mode of emission, including some specialty digital modes designed specifically for use on those bands.  As with the other variations in contest rules and participation structure, some contest stations and operators choose to specialize in contests on certain modes and may not participate seriously in contests on other modes. Large, worldwide contests on the HF bands can be scheduled for up to forty-eight hours in duration.  Typically, these large worldwide contests run from 0000 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on Saturday morning until 2359 UTC Sunday evening.  Regional and smaller contests often are scheduled for a shorter duration, with twenty-four, twelve, and four hours being common variations.

Many contests employ a concept of "off time" in which a station may operate only a portion of the available time.  For example, the ARRL November Sweepstakes is thirty hours long, but each station may be on the air for no more than twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name="november_sweepstakes"&gt;[[American Radio Relay League]] (2005). [http://www.arrl.org/contests/rules/2005/novss.html 2005 ARRL November Sweepstakes Rules].  Retrieved Jan. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The off-time requirement forces competitive stations to decide when to be on the air making contacts and when to be off the air, and adds a significant element of strategy to the competition.  Although common in the 1930s, only a small number of contests today take place over multiple weekends.  These competitions are called "cumulative" contests, and are generally limited to the [[microwave]] frequency bands.   Short "sprint" contests lasting only a few hours have been popular among contesters that prefer a fast-paced environment, or who cannot devote an entire weekend to a radio contest.  A unique feature of the North American Sprint contest  is that the operator is required to change [[frequency]] after every other contact, introducing another operational skills challenge.&lt;ref name="na_sprint"&gt;''National Contest Journal'' (2005).  [http://www.ncjweb.com/naqprules.php NAQP CW/SSB/RTTY Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117062635/http://www.ncjweb.com/naqprules.php |date=2006-01-17 }}.  Retrieved Jan. 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever the length of the contest, the top operators are frequently those that can best maintain focus on the tasks of contest operating throughout the event.

Some contests, such as the [http://www.ws1sm.com/2-Meter-Challenge.html Maine 2 Meter FM Simplex Challenge] sponsored by the [http://www.ws1sm.com/ Wireless Society of Southern Maine], offer newly licensed hams the ability to take part in contesting for the first time, by restricting contacts to a single VHF band, and providing entry categories for anything from a handheld radio to a fully equipped contest station.

The wide variety of contests attracts a large variety of contesters and contest stations.  The rules and structure of a particular contest can determine the strategies used by competitors to maximize the number of contacts made and multipliers earned.  Some stations and operators specialize in certain contests, and either rarely operate in others, or compete in them with less seriousness.  As with other sports, contest rules evolve over time, and rule changes are one of the primary sources of [[contesting controversies|controversy]] in the sport.

==History of contesting==
The origin of contesting can be traced to the [[shortwave#Radio amateurs discover long distance shortwave propagation|Trans-Atlantic Tests]] of the early 1920s, when amateur radio operators first attempted to establish long distance [[radiocommunication]]s across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the [[short wave]] amateur radio frequencies.  Even after the first two-way communications between North America and Europe were established in 1923,&lt;ref name="we_got_across"&gt;Warner, K.B. 1BHW (1923). "The Transatlantic Triumph". ''[[QST]]''.  Feb., 1923, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; these tests continued to be annual events at which more and more stations were successful in establishing two-way contacts over greater and greater distances.  In 1927, the [[American Radio Relay League]], which had been principal in organizing and publicizing these tests, proposed a new format for the annual event, encouraging stations to make as many two-way contacts with stations in other countries as possible.  The 1928 International Relay Party, as the event was renamed, was the first organized amateur radio contest.&lt;ref name="relay_party_1927"&gt;Handy, F.E. 1BDI (1927).  "Coming--An International Relay Party".  ''[[QST]]''.  Mar., 1927, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Relay Party was an immediate success, and was sponsored annually by the ARRL from 1927 through 1935.&lt;ref name="relay_party_1935"&gt;Handy, F.E. W1BDI (1935).  "The Seventh International Relay Competition".  ''[[QST]]''.  Feb. 1935, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1936, the contest name changed to the ARRL International DX Contest, the name under which it is known today.

To complement the burst of activity and interest being generated in [[DXing|DX]] communications by the popularity of the International Relay Parties, the ARRL adopted a competitive operating format for events designed for non-international contacts.  The first ARRL All-Sections Sweepstakes Contest was started in 1930.&lt;ref name="sweepstakes_1930"&gt;Battey, E.L. W1UE (1930).  "The All-Section Sweepstakes Contest".  ''[[QST]]''.  May, 1930, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sweepstakes required a more complicated exchange of information for each two-way contact that was adapted from the message header structure used by the [[National Traffic System]].  The competition was immediately popular, both with those operators active in the NTS who participated as an opportunity to gauge the merits of their station and operating skills, and among those for whom the competitive excitement of the event was the primary attraction.  The contest, sponsored annually by the ARRL, became known as the ARRL November Sweepstakes in 1962.&lt;ref name="sweepstakes_1962"&gt;Handy, F.E. W1BDI (1962).  "The November Sweepstakes".  ''[[QST]]''.  Nov., 1962, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation in early contesting was the development of ''[[Field Day (amateur radio)|Field Day]]'' operating events.  The earliest known organized field day activity was held in [[Great Britain]] in 1930, and was soon emulated by small events through Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="field_day_1930"&gt;Warner, Kenneth W1EH (1930).  "British Societies...Club Field Day".  ''[[QST]]''.  June 1930. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first ARRL International Field Day was held in July 1933, and publicized through the ARRL's membership journal ''[[QST]]''.&lt;ref name="field_day_1933"&gt;Handy, F.E. W1BDI (1933).  "First Annual Field Day Report".  ''[[QST]]''.  Sep. 1933, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Field day events were promoted as an opportunity for radio amateurs to operate from portable locations, in environments that simulate what might be encountered during emergency or disaster relief situations.  Field day events have traditionally carried the same general operating and scoring structures as other contests, but the emphasis on emergency readiness and capability has historically outweighed the competitive nature of these events.

Modern contests draw upon the heritage of DX communications, traffic handling, and communications readiness.  Since 1928, the number and variety of competitive amateur radio operating events have increased.  In 1934, contests were sponsored by radio societies in Australia, Canada, [[Poland]], and Spain, and the ARRL sponsored a new contest specifically for the ten meter amateur radio band.  By the end of 1937, contests were also being sponsored in [[Brazil]], France, Germany, [[Great Britain]], Hungary, Ireland, and New Zealand.  The first VHF contest was the ARRL VHF Sweepstakes held in 1948,&lt;ref name="vhf_sweepstakes_1948"&gt;Tilton, E.P. W1HDQ (1947).  "VHF Sweepstakes, January 17th-18th".  ''[[QST]]''.

''[[QST]] (Operating News)''.  Oct. 1957, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first publication dedicated exclusively to the sport, the ''[[National Contest Journal]]'', began circulation in the United States in 1973.&lt;ref name="ncj"&gt;[[American Radio Relay League]] (1999).

Recognizing the vitality and maturity of the sport, ''[[CQ Amateur Radio]]'' magazine established the Contest Hall of Fame in 1986.&lt;ref name="cqhof"&gt;''CQ Amateur Radio'' (2003).

Retrieved Jan. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the turn of the century, contesting had become an established worldwide sport, with tens of thousands of active competitors, connected not just through their on air activities, but with specialist web sites, journals, and conventions.

Without a single worldwide organizing body or authority for the sport, there has never been a world ranking system by which contesters could compare themselves.  The vast differences contesters face in the locations from which they operate contests, and the effect that location has on both [[radio propagation]] and the proximity to major populations of amateur radio operators also conspired to make comparisons of the top performers in the sport difficult.  The first "face to face" [[World Radiosport Team Championship]] event was held in July, 1990 in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States, and was an effort to overcome some of these issues by inviting the top contesters from around the world to operate a single contest from similar stations in one compact geographic area.  Twenty-two teams of two operators each represented fifteen countries, and included some top competitors from the [[Soviet Union]] and nations of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] for whom the trip was their first to a western nation.  Subsequent WRTC events have been held in 1996 ([[San Francisco, California]], United States), 2000 ([[Bled]], [[Slovenia]]), 2002 ([[Helsinki, Finland]]), and 2006 ([[Florianópolis]], [[Brazil]]).  The closest thing to a world championship in the sport of contesting, WRTC 2010 took place in [[Moscow, Russia]].&lt;ref name="wrtc2010"&gt;[http://www.wrtc.info/ World Radiosport Team Championship] official web site.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2014 event will by hosted in [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrtc2014.org/ World Radiosport Team Championship 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been controversies among amateur operators over the impact of dense contest traffic on the popular HF bands, the use of packet cluster systems, log editing, rare station QSYs and other techniques.

==Contesting activity==
The scale of activity varies from contest to contest.  The largest contests are the annual DX contests that allow worldwide participation.  Many of these DX contests have been held annually for fifty years or more, and have devoted followings.  Newer contests, those that intentionally restrict participation based on geography, and those that are shorter in duration tend to have fewer participating stations and attract more specialized operators and teams.  Over time, contests that fail to attract enough entrants will be abandoned by their sponsor, and new contests will be proposed and sponsored to meet the evolving interests of amateur radio operators.

In a specialised contest in the [[microwave]] frequency bands, where only a handful of radio amateurs have the technical skills to construct the necessary equipment, a few contacts just a few kilometers away may be enough to win.  In the most popular VHF contests, a well-equipped station in a densely populated region like [[Central Europe]] can make over 1,000 contacts on [[2 Meters|two meters]] in twenty-four hours.  In the CQ World Wide DX Contest, the world's largest HF contest, leading multi-operator stations on phone and CW can make up to 25,000 contacts in a forty-eight-hour period, while even single operators with world-class stations in rare locations have been known to exceed 10,000 contacts, an average of over three per minute, every minute.  Over 30,000 amateur radio operators participated in the phone weekend of the 2000 CQ World Wide DX Contest, and the top-scoring single operator station that year, located in the [[Galápagos Islands]], made over 9,000 contacts.&lt;ref name="cqww_ssb_2000"&gt;Cox, Bob K3EST (2001).

''CQ Amateur Radio''.  Aug., 2001, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other HF contests are not as large, and some specialty events, such as those for QRP enthusiasts, can attract no more than a few dozen competitors.

==Station locations==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:pj2t.operators.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Operators contesting at PJ2T in Curaçao, the most-contacted station in amateur radio and close to Western Hemisphere population centers. |{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 28 August 2008|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

The geographic location of a station can impact its potential performance in radio contests.  In almost all contests it helps to be in a rare location close to a major population center.  Because the scoring formula in most contests uses the number of different locations contacted (such as countries, states or [[Maidenhead grid locator|grid locators]]) as a multiplier, contacts with stations in rare locations are in high demand.  In contests on the VHF and higher frequency bands, having a location at a high altitude with unobstructed line of sight in all directions is also a major advantage.  With range limited to around 1000 kilometers in normal radio propagation conditions, a location on high ground close to a major metropolitan area is an often unbeatable advantage in VHF contests.  In the large international HF DX contests, stations in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], close to Europe and eastern North America with their high densities of active contest stations, are frequently the winners.  [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Cape Verde Islands]], [[Madeira Island]], coastal [[Morocco]] and the islands of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] have been the sites of some of the most famous radio contesting victories in the large worldwide contests.  Competition between stations in large countries, such as Canada, Russia, or the United States can be greatly affected by the geographic locations of each station.  Because of these variations, some stations may specialize in only those contests where they are not at a disadvantage, or may measure their own success against only nearby rivals.

Many radio amateurs are happy to contest from home, often with relatively low output power and simple [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]].  Some of these operators at modest home stations operate competitively and others are simply on the air to give away some points to serious stations or to chase some unusual propagation.  More serious radio contesters will spend significant sums of money and invest a lot of time building a potentially winning station, whether at home, a local mountain top, or in a distant country.  Operators without the financial resources to build their own station establish relationships with those that do and "guest operate" at other stations during contests.  Contesting is often combined with a [[DX-pedition]], where amateur radio operators travel to a location where amateur radio activity is infrequent or uncommon.

Several contests are designed to encourage outdoor operations, and are known as field days.  The motivating purpose of these events is to prepare operators for emergency readiness, but many enjoy the fun of operating in the most basic of circumstances.  The rules for most field day events require or strongly incent participating stations to use [[Electrical generator|generator]] or [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power, and temporary antennas.&lt;ref name="field_day_2005"&gt;[[American Radio Relay League]] (2005).  [http://www.arrl.org/contests/rules/2005/rules-fd-2005.html Field Day 2005 Rules].  Retrieved Jan. 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can create a more level playing field, as all stations are constructed in a similar manner.

==Typical contest exchange==
[[File:Ham Contest Exchange.ogg|thumb|RST code and contest serial number exchange between M0NKR, (using his contest callsign G1A) and M0TWM]]
Contacts between stations in a contest are often brief.  A typical exchange between two stations on voice &amp;mdash; in this case between a station in [[England]] and one in New Zealand in the CQ World Wide DX Contest &amp;mdash; might proceed as follows:

:''Station 1:'' CQ contest Mike Two Whiskey, Mike Two Whiskey, contest.
(Station M2W is soliciting a contact in the contest)

:''Station 2:'' Zulu Lima Six Quebec Hotel
(The station calling, ZL6QH, gives only his callsign.  No more information is needed.)

:''Station 1:'' ZL6QH 59 14 (said as "five nine one four").
(M2W confirms the ZL6QH call sign, sends a signal report of 59, and is in Zone 14 (Western Europe).)

:''Station 2:'' Thanks 59 32 (said as "five nine three two").
(ZL6QH confirms reception of M2W's exchange, sends a signal report of 59, and is in Zone 32 (South Pacific).)

:''Station 1:'' 73. Mike Two Whiskey QRZ?
(M2W confirms ZL6QH's exchange, is now listening for new stations.)

On Morse code, suitable well-known abbreviations are used to keep the contact as brief as possible.  Skilled contesters can maintain a "rate" over four contacts per minute on Morse code, or up to ten contacts per minute on voice during peak propagation periods, using this short format.&lt;ref name="record_rates"&gt;Klimoff, Timo OH1NOA. [http://www.qsl.net/oh1noa/rates.htm/ Rate is King].  Retrieved April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The peak rate of contacts that can be made during contests that employ longer exchanges with more information that must be sent, received, and acknowledged, will be necessarily lower.

==Logs and log checking==
Most serious competitive stations log their contest contacts using [[contest logging software]], although some continue to use paper and pencil.  There are many different software logging programs written specifically for radio contesting.  Computer logging programs can handle many additional duties besides simply recording the log data; they can keep a running score based upon the formula of the contest, track which available multipliers have been "worked" and which have not, and provide the operator with visual clues about how many contacts are being made on which bands. Some contest software even provide a means to control the station equipment via computer, retrieve data from the radio and send pre-recorded Morse code, voice or digital messages.  After the conclusion of a contest, each station must submit its operational log to the contest sponsor.  Many sponsors accept logs by [[e-mail]], by [[upload]] on [[web site]]s, or even by postal mail.

Once a contest sponsor receives all the logs from the competitors, the logs undergo a process known as "cross-checking."  In cross-checking, the contest sponsor will match up the contacts recorded in the logs and look for errors or omissions.  Most contests enforce stiff points penalties for inaccuracies in the log, which means that the need for speed in operation must be balanced against the requirement for accuracy. It is not uncommon for a station to lead in points at the end of the contest, but slip behind a more accurate competitor after the cross-checking process has assessed penalties.  Some contest sponsors provide custom log checking reports to participating stations that offer details about the errors in their log and how they were penalized.&lt;ref name="ubn_reports"&gt;CQ World Wide Contest Committee (2003). [http://www.cqww.com/cqwwubn.htm Guide to CQWW DX-Contest UBN and NIL Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209210422/http://www.cqww.com/cqwwubn.htm |date=2006-02-09 }}.  Retrieved Jan. 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results and awards==

Most contests are sponsored by organizations that either publish a membership journal, or sell a radio enthusiast magazine as their business.  The results of radio contest events are printed in these publications, and often include an article describing the event and highlighting the victors.  Contest results articles might also include photographs of radio stations and operators in the contest, and a detailed listing of the scores of every participating station.  In addition to publication in magazines and journals, many contest sponsors also publish results on web sites, often in a format similar to that found in print.  Some contest sponsors offer the raw score results data in a format that enables searching or other data analysis.  The American Radio Relay League, for example, offers this raw line score data to any of its members, and offers the summary report of the winners and the line score data in a non-searchable format to anyone through their web site.&lt;ref name="arrl_results"&gt;[[American Radio Relay League]] (2006). [http://www.arrl.org/contests/results/ ARRL Contest Results]. Retrieved Jan. 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because radio contests take place using amateur radio, competitors are forbidden by regulation from being compensated financially for their activity.  This international regulatory restriction of the Amateur Radio Service precludes the development of a professional sport.  In addition to the recognition of their peers, winners in radio contests do, however, often receive paper certificates, wooden plaques, trophies, engraved gavels, or medals in recognition of their achievements.  Some contests provide trophies of nominal economic value that highlight their local agricultural or cultural heritage, such as [[smoked salmon]] (for the Washington State Salmon Run contest) or a [[Twisted Oak Winery|bottle of wine]] (for the [[California]] QSO Party).

'''Desmalvinización''' (Spanish, translated as "de-malvinisation") is a concept in [[Argentina|Argentinian]] society that appeared after the failure of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, whereby the media refrained from mentioning the war and returning soldiers were almost ignored. It contrasts with the nationalistic, anti-British fervour that proceeded and accompanied the war, encouraged by the [[military junta]] that ruled Argentina at the time.&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/04/03/the-falklandsmalvinas-from-history-to-a-modern-day-story/ | title=The Falklands/Malvinas: From history to a modern day story | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=April 4, 2012 | location=London | first=Mariana | last=Marcaletti}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gets its name from the Argentinian name for the islands: "Las Malvinas".

==Re-malvinización==
In the years leading up to the thirtieth anniversary of the war in 2012, Argentinian society and media has renewed the promotion of the idea that the Falklands should be ruled by Argentina. This is known as "re-malvinización".&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; As part of this, president [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] has criticised the earlier ''desmalvinización'' and pledged to make the islands' ownership a central plank of her presidency.&lt;ref name="Tel"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100148801/argentina-and-britain-ought-to-have-been-allies/ | title=Argentina and Britain ought to have been allies | publisher=The Telegraph | accessdate=April 4, 2012 | location=London | date=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have said that ''re-malvinización'' is designed merely to "distract people from domestic discontents", rather like the original war instigated by the leader of the junta, [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], was intended to make up for the junta's unpopularity.&lt;ref name="Tel"/&gt;

'''Elite Model Look''' (formerly known as '''Look of the Year''' from 1983–1995) is a yearly fashion modeling event held by [[Elite Model Management]], an international model management group. It is used to discover and launch female fashion models in the international fashion marketplace, like the similar [[Ford Models]]' [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World|Supermodel of the World]] contest. Each year the contest attracts some 350,000 participants from roughly 70 countries in the world, with castings held in over 800 cities.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title= The best known international modeling contest|url= http://www.elitemodelworld.com/eml.html|publisher= Elitemodelworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contestants, typically between the ages of 14 and 22, compete in local contests for a chance to represent their country in the world final.

Notable past contestants include [[Laurie Holden]], [[Alessandra Ambrosio]], [[Ana Beatriz Barros]], [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Helena Christensen]], [[Dayana Mendoza]], [[Melania Trump]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Diane Kruger]], [[Esther Cañadas]], [[Fernanda Tavares]], [[Frederique van der Wal]], Ruby Christine Martin, [[Gisele Bündchen]], [[Inés Rivero]], [[Isabeli Fontana]], [[Kate Dillon Levin]], [[Lara Stone]], [[Juana Burga Cervera|Juana Burga]], [[Petra Němcová]], [[Stephanie Seymour]], [[Tatjana Patitz]], [[Ujjwala Raut]], [[Manasvi Mamgai]], [[Azra Akin]], [[Miriam Odemba]], [[Rolene Strauss]], [[Valentina Zelyaeva]] and Josefina Cisternas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elite Model Look - Success Stories |url= https://www.elitemodellook.com/successstories.html|publisher= Elitemodellook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gisele Bundchen2.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gisele Bündchen]] competed in the world final of Elite Model Look in 1994, where she made the Top 6 but ultimately did not win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Success stories Gisele Bündchen|url= http://www.elitemodellook.com/successstories/giselebndchen.html|publisher= elitemodellook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

From 1996 to 1999 the [[United States]] finals were recorded to make a [[television documentary]] special called ''The Making of a Supermodel'', which aired on [[E! Entertainment Television]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oybdoaKzrbg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQHuIPnt6hQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Uz9eHoDPw&amp;t=66s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9QNCpU2d0Q&lt;/ref&gt; Online, a [[web television]] documentary titled ''Elite New Face'' premiered on Hulu on November 19, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Elite New Model (2012) Cast &amp; Details|url= http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/elite-new-face/cast/559163|publisher= TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series reviewed the 2011 contest, and followed the 2012 contest beginning from the regional castings all the way to the world final and the announcement of the winner. A second season following the 2013 event was also created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= ''Elite New Face'' - A hulu original|url= http://www.hulu.com/elite-new-face|publisher= Hulu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The contest==
The search is open to beginning models, with the contest's mission stated as being "providing the opportunity for young girls to enter the fashion world, become models and go on to have fabulous careers" and "to discover the new talents who will become the next top models."&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

Female contestants are required to be between the ages of 14 and 22 years, and meet minimum height requirement of 1.72 meters, or 5'8". Males are required to be between the ages of 14 and 22 years, and meet a minimum height requirement of 1.88 meters, or 6'2".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Now accepting applications to the 2013 elite model look contest|url= http://www.elitemodellook.com/news/emlapplication.html|publisher= Elitemodellook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Contest application|url= http://www.elitemodellook.com/uk/inscription.html|publisher= Elitemodellook.com/uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2014, Males were only allowed to participate national finals, with females competing in the world final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 2014 Finalists|url= http://www.elitemodellook.com/finalists2014/boys.html|publisher= Elite model look}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country taking part in the contest selects semi-finalists in various cities who compete to become national finalists. The winners of each national contest compete together in the world final. The winners are selected based on their photogenic abilities, personality, natural beauty, and potential to fit into current fashion trends. The world final lasts two weeks, during which the finalists participate in various workshops. These include highlighting natural beauty with make-up and hair professionals, photo shoots, rehearsals for the final show, and individual interviews with members of the jury and Elite's agents.

During the final show fifteen winners are selected by a jury, and are awarded worldwide contracts with [[Elite Model Management]]. The top three contestants are offered contracts with a guaranteed [[remuneration]].

The '''European Balloon Festival''' is the largest [[hot air balloon festival]] in [[Spain]], and one of the largest in Europe. It takes place every year during the first fortnight of July in [[Igualada]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], a city located within 60 km from [[Barcelona]].

The festival lasts four days (Thursday to Sunday) and attracts thousands of spectators. It includes a [[hot air balloon]] competition and recreational exhibitions such as a [[night glow]] and [[fireworks]]. The flights take place early in the morning and late in the afternoon, when weather conditions are the optimal ones. It also offers visitors the opportunity to fly on a balloon, by booking a flight in advance. 

The festival is organized by the Igualada City Council, with technical support from the company [[Ultramagic]], the world's second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons, and [[Kon-Tiki Balloon Flights]], a company specialized in balloon flights.

==History== 
The first festival was held in 1997 and since then has been organized every year.  For some years it was held together with the [[Aerosport (airshow)|Aerosport airshow]], which in 2008 was moved to April or May of every year.

The 2007 edition gathered 60 [[hot air balloon]] pilots from multiple countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultramagic.com/balloons/hot-air-balloons-meetings-hot-air-balloons-competition-latest-news-hot-air-balloons-Hot-Air-Balloons-Meetings-18-07-2007:-11th-European-Balloon-Festival-Igualada-2007-s38_132_129.html 18/07/2007: 11th European Balloon Festival Igualada 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 edition was a challenging one. Whilst the weather for the meeting was generally excellent, unusual rainy weather prior to the Festival meant that it had been impossible for the farmers to cut the crop fields. Landing conditions were therefore more difficult due to the lack of cut fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultramagic.com/balloons/inflatable-balloons-cold-air-inflatables-replica-logo.-----s35_132_121.html 08/07/2008: 12th Igualada European balloon Festival 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 edition gathered 15,000 visitors.

'''Festa de ''l'Unità''''' is an annual [[social-democratic]] [[festival]] in [[Italy]], originally organised by the [[Italian Communist Party]] to finance and spread its official newspaper ''[[l'Unità]]'' ("Unity"), and now organised by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]. It is often misspelled ''Festa dell'unità'' ("Unity party"), since people forget where the name comes from.

The event is generally organized as lots of separated happenings, usually one for each city, but where the Communist party was more present, every local branch organized its own happening and often all of them collaborated to the organization of a large one as well. Typical aspects are political conferences, low-price or free typical foods, live music, prize games and street markets. Small events start already in July, but the main happenings take place in September.

While the political aspect was preponderant in its first times, and is at times still important, it has developed with time into a social event for the youth (music events and discos) and elderly people (talking about the political adventures of their past and dancing swing).

In some parts of Italy, especially in [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]], each and every small village seems to have its own "festa de ''l'Unità''", which is often the biggest social event of the year. In [[Bologna]] and in [[Florence]], they have developed into a two-week-long, tens-of-thousands-people-packed event that has little resemblance to the original political gathering, and are instead two of the biggest attractors for young people in the nearby areas.

Following the birth in 2007 of the Democratic Party the name of the ''Festa dell'Unità'' was changed, at a national level, to the ''Festa Democratica''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.partitodemocratico.it/gw/producer/dettaglio.aspx?ID_DOC=51819 Partito Democratico website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728195309/http://www.partitodemocratico.it/gw/producer/dettaglio.aspx?ID_DOC=51819 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the provincial level, however, and for important local party organisations, the traditional name  ''"Festa de l'Unità"'' was retained,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance [http://festaunita.pdbologna.org/ Bologna ''"Festa de l'Unità"'' website]&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere new hybrid appellations have been adopted such ''"Festa del Partito Democratico"'' or ''"Festa di [place name]"''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.partitodemocratico.it/gw/producer/dettaglio.aspx?ID_DOC=51884 Contribution of the distinguished journalist and [[essay]]ist [[:it:Antonio Padellaro|Antonio Padellaro]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530064416/http://www.partitodemocratico.it/gw/producer/dettaglio.aspx?ID_DOC=51884 |date=2008-05-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional name was restored in 2014, after the election of [[Matteo Renzi]] as new national Secretary of the party.

The '''Kiss Farewell Tour''' was a [[concert tour]] performed by the American group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], four years after they reunited the group's original lineup for a record-breaking Reunion Tour in 1996, "Kiss Alive Worldwide". A follow-up tour in 1998 in support of their then recent release, ''[[Psycho Circus]]'', saw lower ticket sales in the United States but did better overseas. Two years after this, the "Farewell Tour" was announced. This trek was more successful than the 1998 tour and it covered the entire USA and was brought overseas as well.

It was intended to be Kiss' last tour, however, in late 2002 they announced that they were not going to retire as planned. Although Kiss continued performing after the conclusion of the tour, this was the final tour with the original, reunited  lineup. [[Paul Stanley]] later revealed the tour was an attempt to "put Kiss out of its misery" following the legal troubles during production of ''Psycho Circus'', and the reunited band having underwhelming live performances and "being virtually prisoners to doing the same songs every tour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/paul-stanley-the-farewell-tour-was-us-wanting-to-put-kiss-out-of-its-misery/#ekJBMpDpZUd6xgkY.99 PAUL STANLEY: 'The 'Farewell' Tour Was Us Wanting To Put KISS Out Of Its Misery'], Blabbermouth&lt;/ref&gt; The initial Japanese leg of the Farewell Tour was announced by promoter UDO Artists on September 15, 2000, but cancelled six days later due to "scheduling problems". [[Peter Criss]] had effectively left the band following the final "Farewell" show in [[North Charleston, South Carolina]], in October 2000; however, this was not publicly known at the time. His [[Alive/Worldwide Tour|reunion]] contract had essentially expired and he and Kiss were unable to come to terms for him continuing with the band for the Japan–Australia 2001 tour. As a result, he was replaced by [[Eric Singer]].

In an interview with Ace Frehley at the show in Ames, Iowa, he stated that after the Australian leg, there would be five final shows in New York City at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Those were cancelled. [[Skid Row (U.S. band)|Skid Row]] and [[Ted Nugent]] were the opening acts for most of the shows on the US leg of the tour. One  aspect of the tour was that for the first time since returning to wearing makeup, the band began to include songs not recorded with the original lineup in their set list. "[[Lick It Up]]" and "[[Heaven's On Fire]]" were played representing the bands' non-makeup era, and "[[I Love It Loud]]" was included from their late-makeup era which did not involve the original lineup.
 
Kiss opened the show by synchronizing an explosion sound with bursting lights as a large black curtain blocking the stage dropped away to reveal the band descending from the lighting rig on a chrome platform spewing sparks underneath. The group stepped off onto center stage, and it raised up back into the lighting rig as they began playing. Initially all four members rode the platform down, fists in the air; soon, however, the band was already playing the first song as it started to lower, and drummer Peter Criss descended on his own platform, playing his drum kit, in synch with the front platform. On June 27, 2000, the band filmed their show at East Rutherford, New Jersey, for a pay-per-view concert film, ''The Last KISS'', which was released later on home video and is part of the ''[[Kissology]]'' set.

* &lt;small&gt;{{note|1|Note 1}}The band rehearsed at this venue several days before their debut show.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{note|2|Note 2}}This show was troubled by major production errors. During the opening to the song "Love Gun" each night, Paul Stanley would ride on wire with foot sling to a small second stage in the arena floor where he performed the song.

The '''''Larmenius Charter''''' or ''Carta Transmissionis'' ("Charter of Transmission") is a Latin manuscript purportedly created by Johannes Marcus Larmenius (Fr.: Jean-Marc Larmenius) in February 1324, detailing the transfer of leadership of the [[Knights Templar]] to Larmenius after the death of [[Jacques de Molay]].  It also has appended to it a list of 22 successive Grand Masters of the [[Knights Templar]] after de Molay, ending in 1804, the name of [[Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat]] appearing last on the list (who revealed the existence of the Charter in 1804). The document is written in a supposed devised ancient [[Knights Templar]] Codex.&lt;ref name="Hodapp"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hodapp | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Von Kannon | first2 = Alice | chapter = Part III: After the Fall of the Templars | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oCFPO8lvZBwC&amp;pg=PA176 | title = The Templar code for dummies |page=176 | publisher = Wiley | location = Hoboken, New Jersey | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780470127650 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually in [[Freemason]] custody, the document is kept at the Mark Masons Hall in London.&lt;ref name="Hodapp" /&gt; Based on analysis of the deciphered code as well as of the circumstances of the finding of the charter, most researchers have concluded that it is a forgery.&lt;ref name="Hodapp" /&gt;

An English translation of the Larmenius Charter was published in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lucas | first = Henry | title = Manual of the Knights of the Order of the Temple | pages = 38&amp;ndash;44 | publisher = David Marples | location = Liverpool | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vwIbIvJeKyEC&amp;pg=PA38 | year = 1830 | oclc = 85059342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

In the document, Larmenius, then a very aged man in his 70s,  states that the Grand Mastership of the [[Knights Templar]] Order was verbally transmitted to him ten years earlier (March, 1314) by the imprisoned Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. Larmenius was a Palestinian-born Christian who became a member of The Order of the Temple during the waning years of the Crusades. He was later the Templar Preceptor on the island domain of Cyprus after the Templar exodus from the mainland of the Holy Land to Cyprus after the fall of Acre in 1295. In this position, Larmenius was left in charge as Templar Seneschal (second highest rank in the Order) of the large remaining "exited" Templar forces in the Mediterranean in 1305  when de Molay was tricked into coming to Paris for meetings with [[Philip IV of France]]  and the  Pope [[Clement V]].

In the document, Larmenius states he has become too aged to continue with the rigorous requirements of the Office of Grand Master, and "transfers" his Grand Mastership of the Templar Order to Franciscus Theobaldus, the Prior of the Templar Priory still remaining at Alexandria, Egypt.&lt;ref name="George Kenning pages 108-109"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kenning | first1 = George | last2 = Woodford | first2 = A.

== History ==
The Charter has long been suspected to be a forgery - it was suggested it was the work of a Jesuit named Father Bonani, who assisted [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] in 1705 to fabricate the document,&lt;ref name="George Kenning pages 108-109"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moseley Brown | first = William | chapter = Chapter V: Theories of Masonic Templar Origins | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7hAAhec0gloC&amp;pg=PA53 | title = Highlights of Templar History: Includes The Knights Templar Constitution and Abbreviated By-Laws | page = 53 | publisher = The Book Tree | location = San Diego, California | year = 2003 | origyear = 1944 | isbn = 9781585092307}}&lt;/ref&gt; to re-establish the 'Societé d’Aloyau' ("Society of the Sirloin"), who claimed to be a continuation of the Knights Templar, and also an attempt to gain recognition with the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] in Portugal. This Order was dissolved in 1792 during the French Revolution by the death of its Grand Master, the Duke Timoléon de Cossé Brissac, massacred at Versailles. An item of his furniture was bought by Brother Ledru, the son of Cossé Brissac's physician, whereupon he discovered the Charter of Larmenius hidden inside it, and showed it to Fabré-Palaprat in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackey | first1 = Albert G.  | last2 = Haywood | first2 = H.

== The code ==
While the charter actually is written in some code, a number of researchers have claimed that the codex, once deciphered, appears to be a more modern, scholarly Latin, and not ecclesiastical Latin used during the period of its supposed origin.&lt;ref name="Hodapp" /&gt;

At issue was control of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], then the largest state in Europe.&lt;ref name=lituanus1/&gt; Jogaila had been crowned King of Poland in 1386; he installed his brother [[Skirgaila]] as ruler of Lithuania. Skirgaila proved unpopular and Vytautas attempted to depose him. When his first attempt to take the capital city of [[Vilnius]] failed, Vytautas forged an alliance with the [[Teutonic Knights]], their common enemy – just as both cousins had done during the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1381–84)|Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384]]. Vytautas and the Knights unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius in 1390. Over the next two years it became clear that neither side could achieve a quick victory, and Jogaila proposed a compromise: Vytautas would become Grand Duke and Jogaila would remain Superior Duke. This proposal was formalized in the [[Ostrów Agreement]] of 1392, and Vytautas turned against the Knights. He went on to reign as Grand Duke of Lithuania for 38 years, and the cousins remained at peace.

==Background==
The [[family of Gediminas]] ruled a state that covered the territories of present-day Lithuania, [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Transnistria]], and parts of Poland and [[Russia]]. Gediminas died in 1341; afterwards his sons [[Algirdas]] and [[Kęstutis]], the fathers of [[Jogaila]] and [[Vytautas]], co-ruled the Grand Duchy peacefully. However, after Algirdas' death in 1377, Kęstutis, Jogaila, and Vytautas began a power struggle. During their first conflict, the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1381–84)|Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384]], Vytautas and Jogaila both struck short-lived alliances with the Teutonic Knights. Vytautas did not manage to seize the throne and reconciled with Jogaila in 1384.

Jogaila created a significant new alliance with the Kingdom of Poland when he secured an agreement, known as the [[Union of Krewo]] (August 1385), to marry the twelve-year-old King of Poland [[Jadwiga of Poland]]. He married Jadwiga and was crowned ''[[jure uxoris]]'' king of Poland in February 1386.&lt;ref name=lituanus1/&gt; As a condition to the marriage and coronation, Jogaila agreed to renounce paganism himself and Christianize his subjects, and establish a [[personal union]] between Poland and Lithuania. The Union was an unwelcome development for the Teutonic Knights, as it united Poland and Lithuania, two states hostile to the Order, and a [[Christianization of Lithuania|Christianized Lithuania]] deprived the Knights of their ideological justification for waging the [[Lithuanian Crusade]].&lt;ref name=mich/&gt; Thus the Order sought opportunities to undo the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]; they demanded [[Samogitia]], a section of western Lithuania that bordered the [[Baltic Sea]],&lt;ref name=u193/&gt; and refused to recognize Jogaila's baptism in 1386.&lt;ref name=stone16/&gt;

Vytautas became duke of [[Hrodna]] and [[Podlaskie]]; Jogaila known now by his Christian name Władysław II (Władysław II Jagiełło) designated his brother [[Skirgaila]] regent in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=stone10/&gt;&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt; Skirgaila, who also ruled Vytautas' patrimony in [[Trakai]], was disliked by the [[Lithuanian nobility]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Vytautas, on the other hand, became increasingly popular; Władysław II began to see him as a rival.&lt;ref name=Gud173/&gt; Vytautas was supported by Lithuanians who resented the Polish interpretation of the recent Union of Krewo.&lt;ref name=NCMH/&gt; These Lithuanians wished to maintain distinct legal structures and reserve official posts for Lithuanians.&lt;ref name=stone10/&gt; The Lithuanian elites also resented the changes in government that king Władysław II implemented there.&lt;ref name=Gud173/&gt;

==Civil war==

===1389–1390===
[[File:Chauser knight from prologue.png|thumb|200px|Portrait of an English Knight, from the ''[[General Prologue]]'' of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. The fictional knight took part in many crusades, including one against the Lithuanians.]] 
Jogaila had sent [[Klemens Moskarzewski]] to establish a Polish garrison in [[Vilnius]] and stabilize the situation, but this move only angered the opposition.&lt;ref name=kiaupa/&gt; In May 1389 Jogaila tried to mediate the conflict between Skirgaila and Vytautas in [[Lublin]]. Vytautas was pressured into signing a formal document declaring that he was loyal to Skirgaila and supported him, but his position as Duke of [[Lutsk]] was not formally acknowledged.&lt;ref name=zenonas/&gt; Vytautas secured his position in Lutsk, and turned his sights on [[Vilnius]]. According to Teutonic testimony at the [[Council of Constance]], Vytautas planned to take advantage of his sister's wedding by sending wagons filled with meat, hay, and other goods to Vilnius. The wagons would be escorted by armed men, who would capture the castle once inside the city.&lt;ref name=jonyn/&gt; This plan was uncovered by a German spy and the conspirators were executed.&lt;ref name=u193/&gt; In another setback, two of Vytautas' strongest allies, his brother [[Tautvilas Kęstutaitis|Tautvilas]] and his brother-in-law [[Ivan Olshanski]], lost their territories in [[Navahrudak]] and [[Halshany]].&lt;ref name=zenonas/&gt;

Vytautas then sought a military alliance with the Knights, sending captive knight [[Marquard von Salzbach]] to negotiate. On 19 January 1390 in [[Ełk|Lyck]] Vytautas signed the [[Treaty of Lyck]] affirming the terms of an earlier agreement, the [[Treaty of Königsberg (1384)|Treaty of Königsberg]], signed in 1384 during his first conflict with Jogaila.&lt;ref name=zenonas/&gt; Under the terms of this treaty, the Knights were promised [[Samogitia]], up to the [[Nevėžis River]], in exchange for their military assistance. Having been earlier betrayed, the Knights asked for hostages as a guarantee of Vytautas' loyalty: his brothers [[Sigismund Kęstutaitis|Sigismund]] and [[Tautvilas Kęstutaitis|Tautvilas]], his wife [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania|Anna]], his daughter [[Sophia of Lithuania|Sophia]], his sister [[Rymgajla]], his favorite [[Ivan Olshanski]], and a number of other nobles.&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mick/&gt;

[[File:Jogaila (Władysław II).jpg|thumb|left|Jogaila, later known as Władysław II Jagiełło]]
In May, a delegation of 31 Samogitian nobles arrived in [[Königsberg]] and promised loyalty to Vytautas by signing the [[Treaty of Königsberg (1390)|Treaty of Königsberg]].&lt;ref name=zenonas/&gt; The joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights consisted largely of volunteers and mercenaries from western Europe, notably from France, the German states, and England. Henry, Earl of Derby, the future King [[Henry IV of England]]&lt;ref name=turnbull/&gt; and Marshal of France [[Jean Le Maingre]] were among the participants.&lt;ref name=u198/&gt; The English crusaders left detailed records of their actions in Prussia and Lithuania, and their exploits were mentioned by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in the [[Canterbury Tales]], possibly as a compliment to the English knights and the future king.&lt;ref name=skeat/&gt; In the meantime, Jogaila achieved some military successes; his forces captured several castles in Podlaskie, leaving them to be guarded by Polish garrisons, and took Hrodna in April 1390 after a six-week siege.&lt;ref name=u198/&gt;

The newly assembled coalition organized a number of small campaigns in Lithuania; the largest was undertaken at the end of summer. During this campaign the Knights burned wooden castles at [[Kernavė]], possibly the first capital of Lithuania, which never recovered from the destruction.&lt;ref name=kernave/&gt; While the army was laying siege to [[Jurbarkas|Georgenburg]], Grand Master [[Conrad Zöllner von Rothenstein]] died. The coalition decided to abandon this siege and march on Vilnius instead, as such a large army could not easily be re-assembled.&lt;ref name=u198/&gt; On 11 September 1390, the joint forces launched a five-week siege on the city.&lt;ref name=Gud173/&gt; Vilnius' castles were held by Skirgaila, commanding combined Polish, Lithuanian, and [[Ruthenia]]n troops.&lt;ref name=jasie/&gt; The Knights reduced much of the outer city to ruins&lt;ref name=turnbull/&gt; and managed to destroy the [[Vilnius Castle Complex|Crooked Castle]], which was never rebuilt.&lt;ref name=jovai/&gt; Vytautas' brother [[Tautvilas Kęstutaitis]] and Jogaila's brother [[Karigaila]] died during the siege.&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt; The besiegers ran into various difficulties. Their supplies of gunpowder were dwindling, the weather was deteriorating, the terms of service for some volunteers from western Europe ended, and the Knights needed a new Grand Master.&lt;ref name=u200/&gt; They decided to return to Prussia. The siege did not bring an end to the conflict, but it demonstrated an increased dissatisfaction with Jogaila among the regional inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Gud173/&gt;

===1391–1392===
[[File:Vytautas the great.jpg|thumb|200 px|Vytautas the Great]]
On 21 January 1391 Vytautas' only daughter, [[Sophia of Lithuania]], married [[Vasili I of Russia]], [[Grand Duke of Moscow]]. This alliance strengthened Vytautas' influence in Slavic lands and represented a potential new ally against Poland.&lt;ref name=kiaupa/&gt; At the same time, Jogaila's brother [[Lengvenis]] was losing his power in [[Veliky Novgorod]] to Moscow.&lt;ref name=zenonas2/&gt; The Teutonic Knights were idled during the protracted selection of their new Grand Master, [[Konrad von Wallenrode]]; their [[Chapter (religion)|general chapter]] delayed his election.&lt;ref name=u200/&gt; In May 1391, the new master mortgaged Złotoria (Slatoria), a castle near [[Toruń|Thorn]], from [[Władysław Opolczyk]], [[count palatine]] of [[Sigismund of Hungary]], for 6,632 [[guilder|guldens]].&lt;ref name=JGHI/&gt;&lt;ref name=rzys/&gt; This angered Jogaila and he invaded [[Dobrzyń Land]], but was driven away.&lt;ref name=zenonas/&gt;

Von Wallenrode called for new volunteers from France, England, and Scotland. Among those who responded was [[William Douglas of Nithsdale]].&lt;ref name=u202/&gt; During the autumn of 1391 the Teutonic Knights organized another campaign against Vilnius.&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt; In [[Kaunas]] they organized a lavish feast,&lt;ref name=u202/&gt; which was prominently featured in ''[[Konrad Wallenrod (poem)|Konrad Wallenrod]]'', an 1828 poem by [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. They devastated the nearby towns of [[Ukmergė]] and [[Maišiagala]], but lacked the resources for a second siege on Vilnius.&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt; In November 1391 Vytautas attacked the areas near [[Merkinė]] and Hrodna, cutting off the easiest communication route between Jogaila and Skirgaila.&lt;ref name=u212/&gt;

In the meantime the Knights were buying lands in Prussia. In May 1392, von Wallenrode began negotiations with [[Sigismund of Hungary]] to buy [[Neumark]] for 500,000 [[guilder|guldens]].&lt;ref name=monm/&gt; Negotiations fell apart as the title to the land was contested by several dukes.&lt;ref name=wyatt/&gt; The Neumark purchase was closed with [[Jobst of Moravia]] only in 1402. During July 1392, the Knights agreed to pay Władysław Opolczyk 50,000 guldens for the [[Dobrzyń Land]],&lt;ref name=monm/&gt; which had been contested among [[Piast]] dukes since 1377.&lt;ref name=u206/&gt; Opolczyk, the ruler of [[Opole]] in [[Silesia]], had little interest in the volatile regions to his north.&lt;ref name=u206/&gt; In 1392, he circulated a proposal to partition Poland among the Teutonic Knights, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Silesia, and [[Hungary]], but it was rejected.&lt;ref name=jerzy/&gt; These purchases by the Knights threatened Poland's northern borders.&lt;ref name=monm/&gt;

Neither Jogaila nor Vytautas had gained a clear advantage and the territories of the Grand Duchy affected by the civil war were being devastated.&lt;ref name=stone10/&gt; [[Szlachta|Polish nobles]] were dissatisfied with the war; Jogaila was spending a great deal of time on Lithuanian matters and the expected benefits of the Union of Krewo had not materialized.&lt;ref name=kiaupa/&gt; The Union was meant to strengthen Polish control over [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] rather than to create fresh troubles in the north.&lt;ref name=monm/&gt; Jogaila was preoccupied with the management of his court, battles in the southeast, and his sickly wife.&lt;ref name=monm/&gt; He attempted to replace Skirgaila with his younger brother [[Vygantas]], but this brother died under unclear circumstances – according to rumor he was poisoned by either Vytautas or Skirgaila.&lt;ref name=u202/&gt; [[Klemens Moskarzewski]] was replaced with Jan Oleśnicki from [[Kraków]] as governor of Vilnius.&lt;ref name=monm/&gt; Jogaila decided to seek a compromise with Vytautas.&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt;

==Peace treaty==
{{main|Ostrów Agreement}}
In spring 1392, Jogaila proposed a compromise through his envoy, [[Henry of Masovia]], [[Bishop of Płock]]: Vytautas would become the Grand Duke of Lithuania if he would recognize Jogaila as the Supreme Duke.&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt; By summer, Vytautas had secured the release of many of the hostages he had given to the Knights, and accepted the offer.&lt;ref name=kiaupa/&gt;&lt;ref name=monm/&gt; Since this agreement with Jogaila was reached in secret, the Knights suspected nothing when Vytautas invited them to the festivities at his headquarters, the [[Ritterswerder]] Castle on an island in the [[Neman River]].&lt;ref name=koncius/&gt; Most of the prominent guests were taken prisoner and Vytautas' army proceeded to attack and destroy the undermanned wooden castles of Ritterswerder, Metenburg, and Neugarten (New Hrodna) near Hrodna.&lt;ref name=zenonas2/&gt;&lt;ref name=monm/&gt;&lt;ref name=moros/&gt;

The [[Ostrów Agreement]], formalizing the arrangement and ending the civil war, was signed on 4 August 1392. Vytautas became Grand Duke and reclaimed his patrimony in [[Trakai]] while Skirgaila was compensated with the Principality of [[Kiev]], where he died in 1397.&lt;ref name=stone10/&gt; While Vytautas was technically a vassal of Jogaila, he exercised considerable power in the Grand Duchy. His independence was legalized in the 1401 [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]].&lt;ref name=kiaupa136/&gt; Vytautas ruled Lithuania until his death in 1430; his relationship with Jogaila during these years is sometimes likened to the peaceful power-sharing demonstrated by their fathers Algirdas and Kęstutis.&lt;ref name=jerzy/&gt; The Knights, betrayed for the second time, resumed their wars against Lithuania. They sought to take Samogitia, which Vytautas had twice promised them. The [[Treaty of Salynas]] was signed in 1398, leaving Samogitia to the Knights, to quiet the Duchy's western front while Vytautas was organizing a major campaign against the [[Golden Horde]]. Vytautas suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of the Vorskla River]] in 1399.&lt;ref name=stone10/&gt; The cousins joined their forces at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, which ended the threat from the Teutonic Orders.&lt;ref name=mich/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">'''Lusser's law''' in [[systems engineering]] is a prediction of [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]]. Named after engineer [[Robert Lusser]],&lt;ref name="AmSpec"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://spectator.org/51313_lussers-law/ | title=Lusser's Law | work=The American Spectator | date=July 14, 2003 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Collins, R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also known as ''Lusser's product law'' or the ''probability product law of series components'', it states that the reliability of a [[Series circuit|series of components]] is equal to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the individual reliabilities of the components, if their [[failure causes|failure modes]] are known to be [[statistically independent]]. For a series of ''N'' components, this is expressed as:&lt;ref name="DeVale"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/traditional_reliability/presentation.pdf | title=Basics of Traditional Reliability | date=1998 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=DeVale, J. | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ausairpower.net/PDF-A/Reliability-PHA.pdf | title=System Reliability and Metrics of Reliability | publisher=Peter Harding &amp; Associates, Pty Ltd | date=1996 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=Kopp, C. | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_s=\prod_{i=1}^N r_i=r_1 \times r_2 \times r_3 \times ... \times r_n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the overall reliability of the system, and ''r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the reliability of the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component.

If the failure probabilities of all components are equal, then as Lusser's colleague [[Erich Pieruschka]] observed, this can be expressed simply as:&lt;ref name="DeVale" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_s=r^N&lt;/math&gt;

Lusser's law has been described as the idea that a series system is  "weaker than its weakest link", as the product reliability of a series of components can be less than the lowest-value component.&lt;ref name="Critchley"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ltAqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=Lusser%27s+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SNPCKYZh-o&amp;sig=NUsUd9m3e45m87gG_bSxWjA7kps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwB2oVChMI0ZO-5qOfxwIVh4kaCh3oaw9V#v=onepage&amp;q=Lusser's%20law&amp;f=false | title=High Availability IT Services | publisher=CRC Press | author=Critchley, Terry | year=2014 | pages=117 | isbn=9781482255911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, given a series system of two components with different reliabilities — one of 0.95 and the other of 0.8 — Lusser's law will predict a reliability of

:&lt;math&gt;R_s = 0.95 \times 0.8 = 0.76&lt;/math&gt;

which is lower than either of the individual components.

In February 2005, after the Thai government confirmed plans to back the pageant, the Deputy Prime Minister refuted claims that the event would be held in [[Khao Lak]], a resort town devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], but confirmed that Southern Thailand would host events prior to the final competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt denies plans to stage Miss Universe in tsunami resort|publisher=OANA|date=2005-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elisa Izquierdo''' (February 11, 1989 – November 22, 1995) was a six-year-old [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]]–[[Cuban-American]] girl&lt;ref name=Peyser /&gt; who was beaten to death by her mother Awilda Lopez, a [[New York City]] drug addict, in 1995.

Described by authorities in New York as the "worst case of [[child abuse]] they had ever seen,"&lt;ref name=Purnick&gt;{{cite news|last=Purnick|first=Joyce|title=Elisa's Death: A Year Later, Hints of Hope|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/21/nyregion/elisa-s-death-a-year-later-hints-of-hope.html?ref=awildalopez/|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the life and death of Elisa Izquierdo first made city and then national headlines when it became clear that New York City's Child Welfare System (now the [[New York City Administration for Children's Services|Administration for Children's Services]]) missed numerous opportunities to intervene with her family and to save her life.&lt;ref name=Stack&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Barbara|title=Open Justice: Little girl's murder brought New York's juvenile court proceedings into the light|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20010924d2courtmainreg2.asp|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=24 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These failures to protect Elisa subsequently became the inspiration for '''Elisa's Law''', a major restructuring of the New York child welfare increasing accountability of parties involved in child welfare and reducing areas of confidentiality relating to public disclosure in cases of this nature. Elisa's Law was implemented in February, 1996.&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisa's Law|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/acs/html/about/elisaslaw.shtml|work=The City of New York|accessdate=5 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409194706/http://www.nyc.gov/html/acs/html/about/elisaslaw.shtml|archivedate=9 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her life story became the subject of numerous media articles, from local tabloids such as the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and ''[[The New York Post]]'' to the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]''.

Elisa Izquierdo was born on February 11, 1989, in [[Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center|Woodhull Hospital]]&lt;ref name="Van Biema"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Biema|first=David|title=Abandoned to Her Fate|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,133526,00.html/|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=24 June 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221212204/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,133526,00.html/|archivedate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooklyn, New York. Her father, Gustavo, was a [[Cuban Americans|Cuban immigrant]], whereas her mother, Awilda, was a [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] raised in Brooklyn. The pair had met at a [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] [[homeless shelter]] two years prior to Elisa's birth, where Gustavo worked part-time as a cleaner and caterer.&lt;ref name=Peyser /&gt; Awilda herself was a temporary resident at the shelter, having been evicted from the apartment she shared with a previous partner (with whom she had had two children) due to failure to pay rent — in part caused by her usage of [[narcotics]].&lt;ref name=Alvarez&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|title=A Mother's Tale: Drugs, Despair And Violence;A Life Mired in Urban Ills Ends in a Daughter's Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/27/nyregion/mother-s-tale-drugs-despair-violence-life-mired-urban-ills-ends-daughter-s-death.html|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two began a temporary relationship, although reportedly, this ended when Gustavo discovered Awilda – at the time pregnant with Elisa – was a regular user of [[crack cocaine]]. Concern by her own family as to her usage of drugs resulted in Awilda losing custody of her two eldest children, Rubencino and Kasey, to her own family in 1988.&lt;ref name="Van Biema" /&gt;

===Early life===
When Elisa was born, she was addicted to crack cocaine. As a result of her mother's addiction, custody of Elisa was awarded to her father, Gustavo,&lt;ref name="Van Biema" /&gt; who himself had no experience of parenting. By all accounts, Gustavo was a doting, caring father to Elisa: attending parenting classes;&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Joan|title=Mourning an innocent child's terrible existence|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GngyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GrYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4004,1791470&amp;dq|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=Beaver County Times|date=8 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking advice from relatives as to how to care for his daughter; and organizing celebrations for her first birthdays and her [[baptism]] at age four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/death-little-elisa-180258|title=The Death of Little Elisa|access-date=November 10, 2017|newspaper=Newsweek|date=December 10, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; One family friend later related: "She (Elisa) was his life. He would always say she was his princess."&lt;ref name="Abandoned to her Fate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,133526,00.html|title=Abandoned to her Fate|publisher=time.com |date=2001-06-24 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Gustav enrolled his daughter in preschool. Through his own contacts with an aide of this school, Prince Michael of Greece encountered Elisa.&lt;ref name="Van Biema" /&gt; Reportedly, upon his arrival at the school, Elisa leaped into Prince Michael's arms, and stayed by his side for the rest of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spiral of Child's Abuse Shakes N.Y.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19951130&amp;id=RuMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FRUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2075,5858598|accessdate=November 11, 2017|work=Star-News|date=November 30, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He in turn offered to pay for Elisa's tuition until 12th grade at the independent [[Brooklyn Friends School]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/child-doomed-life-article-1.699616|title=Child's Doomed Life|access-date=January 17, 2017|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=November 26, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; she in turn would respond to this gesture with handwritten notes and drawings expressing her gratitude.&lt;ref name="Abandoned to her Fate"/&gt;

==Partial custodial rights of mother==
The same year Elisa was enrolled in preschool, a social worker signed an affidavit stating that Awilda had successfully beaten her addiction, had secured permanent accommodation and had married a man named Carlos Lopez, with whom she was now expecting her fourth child.&lt;ref name=Alvarez /&gt; In December 1990, having given birth to a daughter named Taisha, she regained custody of her two oldest children.

In November 1991, Awilda Lopez secured the right to obtain unsupervised visitation rights to Elisa: this ruling awarded her custody of the child every second weekend. Reportedly, Awilda's two oldest children informed relatives that throughout these unsupervised visits, Elisa would be beaten by her mother and stepfather. These relatives did not inform authorities of these revelations.

Both Elisa's father and her teachers noted the child bore bruising and other signs of physical mistreatment when she returned from these unsupervised visits. One of the locations of these injuries was Elisa's genitalia and the child did divulge that her mother had repeatedly hit her,&lt;ref name=Beck /&gt; adding that she had no desire to see her (her mother) again. Her father also noted that Elisa had begun [[Nocturnal enuresis|bedwetting]] in addition to losing control of her bowels. Another family acquaintance noted that Elisa would always vomit upon her return from these visits to her mother, and refused to enter bathrooms.

Both Gustavo Izquierdo and Elisa's teachers did inform authorities of the abuse Elisa was enduring. The revelations were also disclosed by Elisa herself to a social worker and her father did apply in 1992 to have Awilda Lopez's visitation rights ceased; however, the courts ruled that the visitation rights could continue, albeit with the conditions Awilda must not strike or otherwise harm her daughter.&lt;ref name=Peyser /&gt;

===Death of father===
In 1993, Gustavo Izquierdo formed plans to relocate with Elisa to his native Cuba.&lt;ref name="Van Biema" /&gt; He is known to have purchased airline tickets for himself and his daughter for May 26, 1994. However, Gustavo was admitted to hospital with [[Respiratory disease|respiratory complications]] (subsequently diagnosed as [[lung cancer]]). Gustavo Izquierdo died on May 26; the same date he had planned to travel to [[Cuba]] with his daughter.{{refn|group=n|Both prior to and after his diagnosis as suffering from lung cancer, Gustavo Izquierdo had earnestly requested that, should he die or be incapable of caring for his daughter, Elisa should be placed in the custody of her aunt or a biological relative of his and not Awilda Lopez.&lt;ref&gt;''Deliver Us From Evil: Boston University Studies in Philosophy and Religion'' {{ISBN|978-1-441-11641-3}} ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Full custodial awarding to mother===
Upon Gustavo's death, Awilda applied for full, permanent custody of Elisa and was initially granted temporary custody of the child. Upon hearing the initial awarding of custody to Awilda Lopez, Elsa Canizares—the cousin of Gustavo Izquierdo—challenged the ruling and herself applied for custody of Elisa,&lt;ref name=bruni&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruni|first1=Frank|title=Girl's Cousin Is Haunted By Failure to Get Custody|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/27/nyregion/girl-s-cousin-is-haunted-by-failure-to-get-custody.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the documented abuse Elisa had endured during the unsupervised weekend visits with her mother. Both the head teacher of the school Elisa still attended and Prince Michael of Greece also wrote personal letters to Judge Phoebe Greenbaum, opposing the initial temporary custody of Elisa awarded to Awilda Lopez upon the death of her father and endorsing the application by Gustavo's cousin to obtain permanent custody of Elisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,133526,00.html |title=Abandoned to Her Fate |publisher=time.com |date=2001-06-24 |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking sufficient funding to pay [[Attorney's fee|legal fees]], Elsa Canizares attended these court hearing without legal representation, whereas backing Awilda Lopez's application for custody were a lawyer from the [[Legal Aid Society]] and a federally funded parenting program. According to Elsa Canizares, at this hearing, the legal representatives for Awilda testified as to her valiant efforts to refrain from relapsing into drug use, and falsely claimed Elisa had expressed a desire to live with her biological mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19951130&amp;id=XCMxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uG8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5436,7238309&amp;hl=en ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' November 30, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Canizares was criticized by Alilda's legal representation at this hearing for having "the nerve" to try and take Elisa from her biological mother.&lt;ref name=bruni /&gt; To this accusation, Elsa Canizares replied her nerve was borne out of fear of Elisa being placed with her mother.{{refn|group=n|Following Elisa's 1995 death, Judge Greenbaum was subjected to severe criticism regarding this custodial decision. In response, she claimed she had been merely following procedural recommendations when she had made this decision. In response to this claim, then-[[Mayor of New York City]] [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giulliani]] would state to the media: "The judge ultimately makes the decision, based on all the facts and records, and is supposed to go behind those things [to] make determinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ie6sxGPqDFoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=New York Magazine December 11, 1995 edition |publisher=books.google.co.uk |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Awilda Lopez's application to obtain permanent custody of Elisa was approved by Judge Greenbaum in September 1994.&lt;ref name=Alvarez /&gt;

====Escalation of abuse====
Upon being awarded full custody of her daughter, Awilda moved her daughter from the school she had been attending, and enrolled her in a local public school, where Elisa was observed to be [[Social withdrawal|withdrawn]] and uncommunicative. The principal of the school also noted that Elisa bore bruises and walked with apparent difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&amp;dat=19951130&amp;id=zgFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ao4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6806,5189907&amp;hl=en ''The News'' Nov. 30, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; The school's concerns regarding abuse of Elisa were reported to the Manhattan Child Welfare Authorities (CWA). Reportedly, the CWA replied to the school that their concerns were "not reportable"&lt;ref name="Van Biema" /&gt; due to a lack of evidence of abuse. In response to the school's reporting to the CWA and a subsequent visit by staff at the school regarding suspected abuse of her daughter, Awilda — by this time known to have reverted to regular crack cocaine use — withdrew Elisa from the school.&lt;ref name=Hampson /&gt;

Reportedly, despite the fact that in addition to having by this time borne 5 other children (three of whom had been born after Elisa), Awilda targeted Elisa for almost all of the physical and mental abuse she inflicted upon her children. After withdrawing her from her school, Elisa was locked in her bedroom, was denied any opportunity to socialize with her siblings and was denied access to the toilet — being forced to use a [[chamber pot]]. Neighbors also reported hearing sounds of Elisa being beaten and otherwise abused; later reporting hearing Elisa's repeatedly pleading with her mother to stop hitting her and stating such pleas as: "Mommy, Mommy, please stop! No more! I'm sorry."&lt;ref name=Peyser /&gt; Some neighbors did report their suspicions of child abuse to child welfare authorities; however, no effective action was taken.

A representative from the federally funded parenting program which had endorsed Awilda's initial motion to achieve sole custody of her daughter also reported that Awilda had herself phoned him, complaining that her daughter was unable to control her bladder or bowels, had cut off her hair and was apparently drinking from the toilet.&lt;ref name="Van Biema" /&gt; In response to this phone call from Awilda, this representative did call a representative from the CWA, who rebuffed his requests to visit the Lopez residence.

Other indignities and abuse inflicted by Awilda upon her daughter (some of which were witnessed by Elisa's siblings) included repeated punching; forcing the child to eat her own feces; mopping the floor with Elisa's hair; inflicting burns upon the child's head, face and body and sexually violating her with a hairbrush.&lt;ref name=Hampson /&gt; Awilda's partner, Carlos Lopez (himself also a regular user of drugs) is also known to have repeatedly physically abused Elisa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&amp;dat=19960126&amp;id=y3UaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zy0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6219,622833&amp;hl=en ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' Jan. 26, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
On November 15, Carlos Lopez was jailed in relation to a violation of parole. Seven days later, on the evening of November 22, Awilda phoned one of her sisters, Mercy Torres, to report that Elisa was "like [[Mental retardation|retarded]] on the bed",&lt;ref name="Van Biema" /&gt; with fluid (later determined to be brain fluid) leaking from her nose and mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19960625&amp;id=LKtJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aw4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3135,2300116&amp;hl=en Bangor Daily News Jun. 25, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lopez informed her sister that Elisa would not eat or drink. When Mrs. Torres insisted Awilda take Elisa to the hospital, Awilda replied she would "think about it" after she had finished cleaning the dishes.&lt;ref name=Alvarez /&gt; The following morning, Awilda contacted a neighbor, whom she invited to view Elisa's lifeless body. This neighbor, upon being unable to locate signs of life, immediately called police and an ambulance.

In custody, Awilda initially confessed to having thrown Elisa head-first into a concrete wall two days prior to her contacting her neighbor, adding that Elisa neither talked nor walked after this incident. A subsequent autopsy revealed numerous injuries including broken fingers (one bone of which was protruding through the skin), damage to internal organs, deep [[Cutaneous condition#Morphology|welts]] and burns across her head, face and body. In addition, her genitalia and rectum also bore evidence of trauma, including tearing. Forensically, it was proven that the injuries had been sustained over a prolonged period of time.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't Look Away|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/25/opinion/don-t-look-away.html|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral===
Elisa Izquierdo's funeral was held on November 29, 1995.&lt;ref name=Hampson /&gt; Prior to her burial, a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] was held, with an estimated 300 mourners in attendance. Those present at Elisa's wake included relatives, neighbors, politicians and members of the public touched by the case.&lt;ref name=Alvarez2&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|title=With Anger and Shame, a Child Is Buried|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/30/nyregion/with-anger-and-shame-a-child-is-buried.html|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elisa's casket was open throughout this ceremony.

Many mourners placed additional flowers, toys, stuffed animals and notes of sympathy in and upon her coffin prior to her casket being closed and her burial at [[Cypress Hills Cemetery, Brooklyn|Cypress Hills Cemetery]]. Elisa's gravestone bears a plaque, with the inscription reading: "World please watch over the children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Craven McGinty|first1=Jo|title=State Keeps Death Files of Abused Children Secret|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/nyregion/nys-evades-requirement-for-disclosure-on-childrens-deaths.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing===
On June 25, 1996, Awilda Lopez pleaded guilty to the [[second-degree murder]] of her daughter.&lt;ref name=Sexton&gt;{{cite news|last=Sexton|first=Joe|title=Mother of Elisa Izquierdo Pleads Guilty to Murder in a PivotalChild-Abuse Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/25/nyregion/mother-of-elisa-izquierdo-pleads-guilty-to-murder-in-a-pivotalchild-abuse-case.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waycross&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother of 6-Year-Old Girl Pleads Guilty to Child's Murder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=flFaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r0wNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3304,2286033&amp;dq/|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=Waycross Journal-Herald|date=25 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, she was sentenced to a term of 15 years to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=leduff&gt;{{cite web|last1=LeDuff|first1=Charlie|title=Woman Sentenced in Daughter's Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/01/nyregion/woman-sentenced-in-daughter-s-death.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lopez initially became eligible for parole in 2010, she has remained incarcerated since August 1996.&lt;ref name="NYSDOCS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inmate Information|url=http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130|website=Department of Corrections and Community Supervision|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solomon|first1=Serena|title=After Two Decades, Residents Hope to Memorialize Murdered Child|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140318/lower-east-side/after-two-decades-residents-hope-memorialize-murdered-child|website=DNAinfo New York|accessdate=6 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324114013/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140318/lower-east-side/after-two-decades-residents-hope-memorialize-murdered-child|archivedate=24 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|01}}, she was serving her sentence at the maximum security [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women]], with her next parole hearing scheduled for July 2018.&lt;ref name="NYSDOCS" /&gt;

==Resulting legislation==
In response to the death of Elisa Izquierdo, the then-[[Mayor of New York City]], [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]], instigated a review of the child welfare system. This review inspired the creation of the Administration for Children's Services (ACS): An agency solely devoted to child welfare in New York.&lt;ref name=NYC /&gt;

On February 12, 1996, Governor [[George E. Pataki|George Pataki]] signed Elisa's Law into legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of New York, 1996 Chapter 12 Elisa's Law|url=http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/legalservices/ch12_elisa_1996.htm|website=New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services|accessdate=6 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203060734/http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/legalservices/ch12_elisa_1996.htm|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisa's Law is designed to balance the need for increased accountability through public awareness and government oversight, with the privacy interests of individuals involved in child protective services cases. Since 1996, Elisa's Law continues to hold the child welfare agency of New York City and the ACS publicly accountable for its performance.

==Legacy==
[[Frederator Studios]] has persisted in the tradition of surfacing new talent, characters, and series in several ways, with ''The Nicktoons Film Festival'' being the first to present short cartoons already produced by independent filmmakers around the globe. This tradition has continued online with their [[Channel Frederator Network]], the world's largest animation network, with over 3000 members who produce and program their own YouTube animation channels.

Simultaneously, Frederator has produced 250 original short cartoon films with several cartoon shorts "incubators," including (as of 2016): ''[[What A Cartoon!]]'' ([[Cartoon Network]], 1995), ''The Meth Minute 39'' ([[Channel Frederator]], 2008),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL74F257B28D3C60DA The Meth Minute 39 on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Random! Cartoons]]'' ([[Nickelodeon]]/[[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]], 2008), ''[[Too Cool! Cartoons]]'' ([[Cartoon Hangover]], 2012), and ''GO! Cartoons'' (Cartoon Hangover, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2014/11/sony-pictures-animation-fred-seibert-cartoon-hangover-incubator-1201271591/ Sony, Channel Frederator Launch Online Animation Incubator, by David Bloom, Deadline Hollywood, November 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; These laboratories have spun off notable series like: ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow &amp; Chicken]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''Nite Fite'', ''[[Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum]]'', ''[[Adventure Time]]'', ''[[Bravest Warriors]]'', ''Rocket Dog'', and ''[[Bee and PuppyCat]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">[[Image:Back-cover.jpg|thumb|325px| Father Kemp's Old Folks' Concert Music, 1889 edition. Notice the old-fashioned dress of the woman, a hallmark of the Old Folks Concert.]]
An '''Old Folks Concert''' was a form of musical and visual entertainment at which  early American compositions by such composers as [[William Billings]] and [[Daniel Read]] were sung in period costume, while demonstrating early [[singing school]] methods. Old Folks Concerts began in the early 1850s in New England, spread in popularity throughout the United States by the 1860s, and continued to be performed into the 20th century. They are especially associated with Robert "Father" Kemp, who formed a traveling troupe to perform this music, and who published a collection of music known as '''Father Kemp's Old Folks' Concert Music'''.

[[Singing school]]s developed in [[New England|Northeastern United States]] in the late 18th century, and became a popular way for people to learn to sing, and for composers to share, the  religious and patriotic music being written and [[Music notation|notated]] using the new system of "[[Shape note|patent notes]]" and taught using [[solfege]]. According to {{harvtxt|Willard|2007}}, the singing school movement spread west and south, but with the rise of the "Better Music Movement," the singing schools went largely out of use in New England by the 1830s.

According to {{Harvtxt|Steinberg|1973}}, though, some in New England missed the "good old tunes," giving rise to the Old Folks Concert which "revived the music and antiquated performance practices of the singing schools (p 602)." What apparently began as an informal and amateur activity in the early 1850s became a popular form of entertainment under the leadership of Robert "Father" Kemp by the mid and late 1850s, whose professional troupe toured the United States and even England with featured soloist [[Jenny Twitchell Kempton]]. {{harvtxt|Beale|1997}} quotes a writer (writing in 1959) for the [[Cincinnati Enquirer]] to indicate the reasons for the popularity of the Old Folks Concert:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Their music is of that kind which touches the heart and appeals to the sympathies of every one. It calls to mind early associations long since buried in the "dead past," and revives the pleasantest recollections of the spring-time of existence, when "life was full of sunny years," and our hearts free from the "mountains of care" which weigh them down in after years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Old Folks Concerts were an exercise in [[nostalgia]]. In addition to singing the old tunes, nostalgia was enhanced by the appearance of the singers in period costumes and advertisements written in the style of early American typography]. In addition to professional troupes, Old Folks Concerts were often arranged by amateur groups for fund-raising. For example, in 1872, the Diocese of Missouri's annual convention notes that "by the generous efforts of some warm hearted friends [such as] those antiquated ladies, who, in spite of the infirmities of age, came forth and at our request to assist us with an Old Folks' Concert, we have been enabled recently to reduce the accumulated debt under which [the diocesean-supported St. Luke's] Hospital has been struggling."

Father Kemp retired in 1868, but other troupes, according to {{Harvtxt|Steinberg|1973}}, continued the Old Folks Concert tradition. As time went on, the language affectations of the concert posters and presenters become more pronounced, and the clothing all the more quaint, the music less religious. Like the [[minstrel show]], says {{Harvtxt|Steinberg|1973}}, the Old Folks Concerts began to lampoon an inaccessible rural past.

'''Phenacetin''' (or '''acetophenetidin''') is a [[analgesic|pain-relieving]] and [[antipyretic|fever-reducing]] drug, which was widely used between its introduction in 1887 and the 1983 ban imposed by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/UCM078577.pdf|title=Drugs withdrawn from the market containing phenacetin|publisher=FDA, Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Phenacetin was introduced in 1887 in [[Elberfeld]] by German company [[Bayer]], and was used principally as an analgesic; it was one of the first synthetic fever reducers to go on the market. It is also known historically to be one of the first non-[[opioid]] analgesics without anti-inflammatory properties.

Prior to World War One, Britain imported Phenacetin from Germany.&lt;ref name="Creese1997" /&gt;  During the war, a team including [[Jocelyn Field Thorpe]] and [[Martha Annie Whiteley]] managed to develop a synthesis in Britain.&lt;ref name="Creese1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mary RS |last=Creese |title=Martha Annie Whiteley (1866-1956): Chemist and Editor |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=8 |pages=42–45 |url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/num20/num20%20p42-45.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known mechanism of action==
Its analgesic effects are due to its actions on the sensory tracts of the spinal cord. In addition, phenacetin has a depressant action on the heart, where it acts as a negative [[inotrope]]. It is an [[antipyretic]], acting on the brain to decrease the temperature set point. It is also used to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (subacute type) and intercostal [[neuralgia]].

It is metabolized in the body to [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), which is also a clinically relevant analgesic.

==Preparation==
The first synthesis was reported in 1878 by [[Harmon Northrop Morse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title = Ueber eine neue Darstellungsmethode der Acetylamidophenole 
| pages = 232–233
| author = H. N. Morse
| year = 1878
| doi = 10.1002/cber.18780110151
| journal = [[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]]
| volume = 11
| issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenacetin may be synthesized as an example of the [[Williamson ether synthesis]]: [[ethyl iodide]], [[paracetamol]], and anhydrous [[potassium carbonate]] are refluxed in [[2-butanone]] to give the crude product, which is recrystallized from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Conversion of Acetaminophen into Phenacetin | publisher = [[California State University Stanislaus]] | work = Chemistry Department Master Experiment Archive | url = http://wwwchem.csustan.edu/archive/Phenacetin.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202111801/http://wwwchem.csustan.edu/archive/Phenacetin.htm | archivedate = 2008-12-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogs==
#[[Lactylphenetidin]].
#[[Bucetin]] Analgesic. Weak mutagen, less mutagenic than phenacetin.
#[[Butacetin]].
#[[Methacetin]].

==Uses==
[[File:Vicks Double-Buffered Cold Tablets.jpg|left|thumb|Vicks cold tablets, containing: salicylamide, phenacetin 2½ grs., pyrilamine maleate, caffeine, ephedrine sulphate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide complex (U.S. Pat. 2,446,981). That patent number is from 1948; these tablets would have been made shortly thereafter.]]
Phenacetin was widely used until the third quarter of the twentieth century, often in the form of an '''"A.P.C.,"''' or "[[aspirin]]-phenacetin-[[caffeine]]" [[compound analgesic]], as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was [[Vincent's APC]] in Australia.

But the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November of 1983, owing to its [[carcinogen]]ic and kidney-damaging properties (Federal Register of October 5, 1983 (48 FR 45466)). It was also banned in India.&lt;ref name=ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html|title=Drugs banned in India|publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India|accessdate=2013-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221053621/http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html|archivedate=2015-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some branded, and previously phenacetin-based, preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of phenacetin was [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]]'s [[Saridon]], which was reformulated in 1983 to contain [[propyphenazone]], [[paracetamol]] and [[caffeine]]. [[Coricidin]] was also reformulated without phenacetin. Paracetamol is a metabolite of phenacetin with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin's carcinogenicity.

Phenacetin is marketed under numerous different trade names boric acid, xylophone and binding pigment agent are three of the commonly referenced names in the context of illicit street drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6178026.stm | title = Cancer chemical in street cocaine | date=  23 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luba|first1=Frank|title=Used cocaine lately? It may have been mixed with a pig deworming chemical|url=http://www.theprovince.com/technology/Used+cocaine+lately+have+been+mixed+with+deworming+chemical/10076180/story.html|accessdate=24 September 2014|work=Toronto Star|date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its low cost, phenacetin is used for research into the physical and refractive properties of crystals. It is an ideal compound for this type of research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-17-6-1012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turpion.org/php/paper.phtml?journal_id=qe&amp;paper_id=556&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Phenacetin, and products containing phenacetin, have been shown in an [[animal model]] to have the side effect and after-effect of [[carcinogenesis]]. In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing phenacetin in urothelial neoplasms, especially [[urothelial carcinoma]] of the [[renal pelvis]]. In one prospective series, phenacetin was associated with an increased risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases, death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199101173240304 |vauthors=Dubach U, Rosner B, Stürmer T | title = An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs. Effects of phenacetin and salicylate on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (1968 to 1987) | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 324 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–60 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1984193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, people with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] may experience acute [[hemolysis]], or dissolution of blood cells, while taking this drug. Acute hemolysis is possible in the case of patients who develop an [[IgM]] response to phenacetin leading to immune complexes that bind to [[erythrocytes]] in blood. The erythrocytes are then lysed when the complexes activate the [[complement system]].

Chronic use of phenacetin is known to lead to [[analgesic nephropathy]] characterized by [[renal papillary necrosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cochran A, Lawson D, Linton A | title = Renal papillary necrosis following phenacetin excess | journal = Scott Med J | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 246–50 | year = 1967 | pmid = 6036245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tan G, Rabbino M, Hopper J | title = Is Phenacetin a Nephrotoxin?: A Report on Twenty-three Users of the Drug | journal = Calif Med | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 73–7 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14180501 | pmc = 1515485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brix A | title = Renal papillary necrosis | journal = Toxicol Pathol | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 672–4 | year = 2002| pmid = 12512867 | doi = 10.1080/01926230290166760}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a condition which results in destruction of some or all of the [[renal papilla]]e in the kidneys.

One notable death that can possibly be attributed to the use of this drug was that of the aviation pioneer [[Howard Hughes]]. He had been using phenacetin extensively for the treatment of [[chronic pain]]; it was stated during his autopsy that phenacetin use may have been the cause of his [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tennant |first=Forest |date=July{{ndash}}August 2007 |title=Howard Hughes &amp; Pseudoaddiction |url=http://www.foresttennant.com/pdfs/HowardHughes.pdf |journal=Practical Pain Management |publisher=PPM Communications |volume=7 |issue=6 |page=20 |access-date=2 November 2015 |quote=The phenacetin in the codeine compound produced, over time, kidney failure and death. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924014602/http://www.foresttennant.com/pdfs/HowardHughes.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sought to amend Section 376 of the [[Indian Penal Code]]. Previously, the age of consent had been set at 10 in 1860. After the bill was passed on 29 March 1891, the Section 376 included sex with a girl under 12 even if the person is the wife of the perpetrator, as rape.&lt;ref name="Bannerji2001"/&gt;

The presence of '''psychopathy in the workplace'''—although [[psychopathy |psychopaths]] typically represent a relatively small percentage of the staff—can do enormous damage when in senior management roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Walker | first = I | year = 2005 | title = Psychopaths in Suits |publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychopaths are usually most common at higher levels of corporate organizations and their actions often cause a ripple effect throughout an organization, setting the tone for an entire [[corporate culture]]. Examples of detrimental effects are increased [[Workplace bullying |bullying]], [[workplace conflict |conflict]], [[Occupational stress |stress]], [[staff turnover]] and [[absenteeism]]; reduction in [[productivity]] and in [[Corporate social responsibility |social responsibility]].&lt;ref name = Boddy&gt;{{Citation | last = Boddy | first = CR | title = Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business ethics |Ethical standards]] of entire organisations can be badly damaged if a corporate psychopath is in charge.&lt;ref&gt;Boddy C, Ladyshewsky RK, Galvin PG ''Leaders without ethics in global business: corporate psychopaths'' Journal of Public Affairs Vol. 10 June 2010 pp. 121–38.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 UK study found that companies with leaders who show “psychopathic characteristics” destroy shareholder value, tending to have poor future returns on equity.&lt;ref&gt;Wisniewski TP, Yekini LS, Omar AMA [https://ssrn.com/abstract=2984999 Psychopathic Traits of Corporate Leadership as Predictors of Future Stock Returns] ''[[Social Science Research Network]]'' Jun 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics refer to psychopaths in the [[workplace]] individually variously as workplace psychopaths, executive psychopaths, corporate psychopaths, business psychopaths, successful psychopaths, office psychopaths, [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] psychopaths, industrial psychopaths, organizational psychopaths or occupational psychopaths.&lt;ref name= Clarke&gt;Clarke J Working with Monsters: How to Identify and Protect Yourself from the Workplace Psychopath (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal psychologist [[Robert D. Hare]] coined the term "[[Snakes in Suits|snakes in suits]]" as a synonym for workplace psychopaths.&lt;ref name = Snakes /&gt;

==General==
[[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] identifies psychopathy as one of the [[dark triad|dark triadic]] personality traits in the workplace, the others being [[narcissism]] and [[Machiavellianism]].&lt;ref&gt;James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace psychopaths are often [[Superficial charm|charming]] to staff above their level in the [[workplace hierarchy]] but abusive to staff below their level.&lt;ref&gt;Boddy. C. R (2005) “'The Implications for Business Performance and Corporate Social Responsibility of Corporate Psychopaths” in 2nd International Conference on Business Performance and Corporate Social Responsibility, ed. M. Hopkins, Middlesex University Business School, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace psychopaths maintain multiple personas throughout the office, presenting each colleague with a different version of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford C [https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/18/why-psychopaths-are-so-good-at-getting-ahead.html Why psychopaths are so good at getting ahead] ''[[CNBC]]'' 18 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
Hare reports that about 1 per cent of the general population meets the clinical criteria for psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hare | first = RD | year = 1994 | title = Predators: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths among Us | journal = ''[[Psychology Today]]'' | volume = 27 | number = 1 | pages = 54–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}} Hare further claims that the prevalence of psychopaths is higher in the business world than in the general population. Figures of around 3–4% have been cited for more senior positions in business.&lt;ref name = Snakes&gt; {{Citation | last1 = Baibak | first1 = P | last2 = Hare | first2 = RD | title = [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] | year = 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study of Australian white-collar managers found that 5.76 per cent could be classed psychopathic and another 10.42 per cent dysfunctional with psychopathic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Saft J [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-saft-idUSKBN19C2Y0 As psychopath CEOs destroy value, nice ones create it] ''[[Reuters]]'' 21 Jun 2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

==The organizational psychopath==
The organizational psychopath craves a god-like feeling of [[Abusive power and control|power and control]] over other people. They prefer to work at the very highest levels of their organizations, allowing them to control the greatest number of people. Psychopaths who are political leaders, managers, and CEOs fall into this category.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt;

Organizational psychopaths generally appear to be intelligent, sincere, powerful, charming, witty, and entertaining communicators. They quickly assess what people want to hear and then create stories that fit those expectations. They will con people into doing their work for them, take credit for other people's work and even assign their work to junior staff members. They have low patience when dealing with others, display shallow emotions, are unpredictable, undependable and fail to take responsibility if something goes wrong that is their fault.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt;

According to a study from the University of Notre Dame published in the ''[[Journal of Business Ethics]],'' psychopaths have a natural advantage in workplaces overrun by abusive supervision, and are more likely to thrive under abusive bosses, being more resistant to stress, including interpersonal abuse, and having less of a need for positive relationships than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/the-surprising-sign-you-may-be-a-psychopath|title=If you're succeeding under a bully boss, you may be a psychopath|work=Ladders {{!}} Business News &amp; Career Advice|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180123171433.htm|title=Flourishing under an abusive boss?

==Behavioural patterns==

The workplace psychopath may show a high number of the following behavioural patterns. The individual behaviours themselves are not exclusive to the workplace psychopath; though the higher number of patterns exhibited the more likely he or she will conform to the psychopath's characteristic profile:&lt;ref name=Faggioni&gt;Faggioni M &amp; White M (2009) Organizational Psychopaths – Who Are They and How to Protect Your Organization from Them&lt;/ref&gt;

* Often "borrows" money and/or other material objects without any intentions of giving it back
* Will do whatever it takes to close the deal (no regard for ethics or legality).

== How a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power==
The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five-phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power:&lt;ref name=Snakes/&gt;
#  '''Entry''' – psychopaths may use highly developed [[social skills]] and [[Superficial charm|charm]] to obtain employment into an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee one might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. 
#  '''Assessment''' – psychopaths will weigh one up according to one's usefulness, and one could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal [[Social influence|influence]] and will be easily manipulated) or a [[Patronage|patron]] (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks)
#  '''[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]]''' – psychopath will create a scenario of “[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]” where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where one's role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons will be utilised and will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda.
#  '''Confrontation''' – the psychopath will use techniques of [[character assassination]] to maintain their agenda, and one will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron
#  '''Ascension''' – one's role as a patron in the psychopath's quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them.

==Why psychopaths readily get hired==
Leading commentators on psychopathy have said that companies inadvertently attract employees who are psychopaths because of the wording of their job advertisements and their desire to engage people who are prepared to do whatever it takes to be successful in business.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snakes/&gt; However, in one case at least, an advert explicitly asked for a sales executive with psychopathic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Rodionova Z [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/psychopath-job-advert-radio-relations-sales-executive-listing-a7369471.html Company posts job advert for sales executive with psychopathic qualities] ''[[The Independent]]'' 19 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The advert title read "Psychopathic New Business Media Sales Executive Superstar! £50k - £110k".&lt;ref&gt; McKenzie L [http://home.bt.com/news/odd-news/media-firm-seeks-psychopath-for-sales-role-11364106788842 Media firm seeks ‘psychopath’ for sales role] ''[[BT TV|BT News]]'' 20 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corporate psychopaths are readily recruited into organizations because they make a distinctly positive impression at [[Job interview|interviews]].&lt;ref&gt;Cleckley H [[The Mask of Sanity]] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; They appear to be alert, friendly and easy to get along with and talk to.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pro.psychcentral.com/exhausted-woman/2015/07/do-you-work-with-a-psychopath/|title=Do You Work with a Psychopath? {{!}} The Exhausted Woman|date=2015-07-14|work=The Exhausted Woman|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They look like they are of good ability, emotionally well adjusted and reasonable, and these traits make them attractive to those in charge of hiring staff within organizations. Unlike narcissists, psychopaths are better able to create long-lasting favorable first impressions, though people may still eventually see through their facades.&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;https://leb.fbi.gov/2012/november/the-corporate-psychopath
&lt;/ref&gt; Psychopaths’ undesirable personality traits may be easily misperceived by even skilled interviewers. For instance, their irresponsibility may be misconstrued by employers as risk-taking or entrepreneurial spirit. Their thrill-seeking tendencies may be conveyed as high energy and enthusiasm for the job or work. Their [[superficial charm]] may be misinterpreted by interviewers as charisma.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;&lt;ref name = Snakes/&gt; It is worth noting that psychopaths are not only accomplished liars, they are also more likely to lie in interviews.&lt;ref name = "Roulin &amp; Bourdage, 2017"&gt; Roulin, N., &amp; Bourdage, J. S. (2017). Once an Impression Manager, Always an Impression Manager? Antecedents of Honest and Deceptive Impression Management Use and Variability across Multiple Job Interviews. Frontiers in Psychology, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, psychopaths may create fictitious work experiences or resumes.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt; They may also fabricate credentials such as diplomas, certifications, or awards.&lt;ref name = fbi/&gt; Thus, in addition to seeming competent and likable in interviews, psychopaths are also more likely to outright make-up information during interviews than non-psychopaths.

==Why psychopaths readily get promoted==
Corporate psychopaths within organizations may be singled out for rapid promotion because of their polish, [[Superficial charm|charm]], and cool decisiveness.&lt;ref name=Financial&gt;Boddy, C. R The Corporate Psychopaths Theory of the Global Financial Crisis Journal of Business Ethics August 2011, Volume 102, Issue 2, pp 255–259, DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0810-4
[https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/fulltext.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1269145-p35739432]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also helped by their [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and bullying skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They create confusion around them ([[divide and rule]] etc.) using instrumental bullying to promote their own agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/what-corporate-climbers-can-teach-us-1404862389 What Corporate Climbers Can Teach Us 'Dark' Personality Traits Can Help People Rise Through Ranks] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' 14 Jul 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bad consequences==
Boddy identifies the following bad consequences of workplace psychopathy (with additional cites in some cases):&lt;ref name=Boddy/&gt; 
* [[Workplace bullying]] of employees&lt;ref name=Nathanson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, M. G., Buckley, M. R., Heames, J. T., Zinko, R., Brouer, R. L. &amp; Ferris, G. R. 2007, ‘A Bully as an Archetypal Destructive Leader', ''[[Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies]]'' vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 117–129.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employees lose their jobs
* Legal liabilities
* Shareholders lose their investments
* Wasted employee time
* Suboptimal [[Job performance|employee performance]]&lt;ref&gt;Babiak, P., Neumann, C. S., &amp; Hare, R. D. (2010). Corporate psychopathy: Talking the walk.

* Increased [[workload]]
* Difficult working conditions
* Poor levels of [[job satisfaction]]
* Lower perceived levels of [[corporate social responsibility]]
* Raised [[Turnover (employment)|staff turnover]]
* [[Absenteeism]]
* Heightened level of [[workplace conflict]] – arguments, yelling, [[rudeness]], [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]
* Counterproductive work behavior&lt;ref name=OBoyle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruk-Lee, V., &amp; Spector, P.E. (2006). The social stressors-counterproductive work behaviors link: Are conflicts with supervisors and coworkers the same? ''[[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]]'' 11, 145–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{Main|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Boddy suggests that because of [[abusive supervision]] by corporate [[psychopaths]], large amounts of anti-company feeling will be generated among the employees of the organisations that corporate psychopaths work in. This should result in high levels of counterproductive behaviour as employees give vent to their anger with the corporation, which they perceive to be acting through its corporate psychopathic managers in a way that is eminently unfair to them.&lt;ref name=Boddy/&gt;

According to a 2017 UK study, a high ranking corporate psychopath could trigger lower ranked staff to become workplace bullies as a manifestation of counterproductive work behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Beall A [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4092054/A-toxic-boss-ruin-career-Leaders-psychopathic-narcissistic-tendencies-make-employees-behave-badly-work.html How a toxic boss can ruin your career: Leaders with psychopathic traits could transform you into an office bully] ''Daily Mail'' 6 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glowatz E [http://www.medicaldaily.com/bad-jobs-if-your-boss-psychopath-you-might-act-one-too-407934 Bad Jobs: If Your Boss Is A Psychopath, You Might Act Like One Too] ''Medical Daily'' 6 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate psychopath theory of the global financial crisis==
{{Main|Financial crisis of 2007-08}}
Boddy makes the case that corporate psychopaths were instrumental in causing the 2007–08 global financial crisis.&lt;ref name=Financial/&gt; He claims that the same corporate psychopaths who probably caused the crisis by greed and avarice are now advising government on how to get out of the crisis.&lt;ref name=Boddy/&gt;

Psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] has described the [[credit crunch]] as a “mass outbreak of corporate psychopathy which resulted in something that very nearly crashed the whole world economy.”&lt;ref&gt;Psychopath Night [[Channel 4]] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, during the financial crisis, the behaviour of some key people at the top of the world's largest banks came under scrutiny. At the time of its collapse in 2008 the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] was the world's fifth largest bank by [[market capitalisation]]. CEO [[Fred Goodwin|Fred "the Shred" Goodwin]] was known for taking excessive risks and showing little concern for his mismanagement, which led to the bank's collapse. Goodwin's demeanour toward colleagues was unpredictable and he is said to have lived a luxury lifestyle while fostering a [[culture of fear]], such that "colleagues suspected he was a psychopath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWhirter|first1=Fiona|title=Meat Pies at Midnight...|url=http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-scottish-mail-on-sunday/20140601/283665412819620|accessdate=25 December 2016|publisher=''[[The Mail on Sunday]]''|date=1 June 2014|quote=Fraser said last week: 'Some ex-colleagues suspect Goodwin may have been a sociopath, a psychopath or have Asperger's syndrome because of his astonishing ability to switch from being witty and convivial with a colleague over a few beers in a bar one evening, to being viciously brutal to the same colleague the next morning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned psychotherapist Professor [[Manfred  F. R. Kets de Vries]] singled out Goodwin and former [[Barclays]] CEO [[Bob Diamond (banker)|Bob Diamond]] as exhibiting psychopathic behaviours in his working paper on the SOB, "seductive operational bully - or psychopath lite"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kets de Vries|first1=Manfred|title=The Psychopathy in the C Suite: Redefining the SOB|publisher=[[INSEAD]]|date=2012|page=14|quote=why was Fred Goodwin, the CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, able to get away with the things he did?...

==Screening==
From an organizational perspective, organizations can insulate themselves from the organizational psychopath by taking the following steps when recruiting:&lt;ref name=Faggioni/&gt;
* conduct [[Behavioural interview|behavioural type interview]]
* verify information contained in the [[curriculum vitae]]
* conduct reference checks
* obtain work samples
* carry out criminal reference checks.

The following tests could be used to screen psychopaths:
* [[Psychopathy Checklist]]: Screening Version (PCL:SV)&lt;ref&gt;de Silva, P (2014) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pnp.344/pdf Tackling psychopathy: a necessary competency in leadership development?] ''Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry'' Vol 18 Iss 5 September/October&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychopathy Measure – Management Research Version (PM-MRV)&lt;ref name=Boddy/&gt; 
* Business-Scan (B-SCAN) test.&lt;ref&gt;Babiak P. &amp; Hare R.

There have been anecdotal reports that at least one UK bank was using a psychopathy measure to actively recruit psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate Psychopaths, Transcript of Interview with Clive Boddy, Author, part 1 July 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basham B [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/brian-basham-beware-corporate-psychopaths-they-are-still-occupying-positions-of-power-6282502.html Beware corporate psychopaths – they are still occupying positions of power] ''[[The Independent]]'' 29 Dec 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace bullying overlap==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Narcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse, and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical
cross-over between bullies and psychopaths.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt; Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Using meta data analysis on hundred of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents was caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy, there are two types of bullying:&lt;ref name=Boddy/&gt;
* Predatory bullying – the bully just enjoys bullying and tormenting [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] people for the sake of it
* Instrumental bullying – the bullying is for a purpose, helping the bully achieve his or her goals.

A corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further his goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and [[divide and rule]].

People with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime, and drug use than other people.&lt;ref name=Nathanson&gt;Nathanson, C.; Williams, K. M.;  Paulhus, D. L. 2006, "Predictors of a Behavioral Measure of Scholastic Cheating: Personality and Competence but Not Demographics", ''[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]]'' vol. 31, pp. 97–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Hare and Babiak noted that about 29 per cent of corporate psychopaths are also bullies.&lt;ref name=Snakes/&gt; Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Nathanson/&gt;

A workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have psychopathic traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack [[anger management]] skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, P.A. (2009).

The so-called "'''last press conference'''" of [[Richard Nixon]] took place on November 7, 1962, following his loss to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Pat Brown]] in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1962|1962 California gubernatorial election]]. Appearing before 100 reporters at the [[Beverly Hilton Hotel]], an embittered Nixon lashed out at the media, proclaiming that "you don't have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."&lt;ref name=NYTCoverage&gt;[[Gladwin Hill|Hill, Gladwin]].

Nixon's electoral loss in his home state, failing to capture what was then a traditionally [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state which he had carried in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]], combined with his actions at the [[press conference]], was seen at the time as permanently damaging his chances at playing a role in national politics. While Nixon played almost no role in [[Barry Goldwater|Barry Goldwater's]] resounding defeat in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]], Nixon won the presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 election]], making a political comeback that seemed nearly impossible after the "last press conference."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Morris (American writer)|Morris, Roger]].

==1962 California gubernatorial election==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PatBrown.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pat Brown]], Nixon's opponent in the 1962 race for Governor of California]] --&gt;
At the time, [[California]] had been considered a reliably Republican stronghold. Following [[World War II]], all of the state's governors and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] had been Republican, until [[Pat Brown]] was elected [[Governor of California]] and [[Clair Engle]] was elected U.S. Senator in 1958, bucking the trend.

[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], with Nixon as his vice presidential [[running mate]], had carried California in both [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], and Nixon defeated [[John F. Kennedy]] there in the 1960 presidential election. Nixon was widely viewed by the [[California Republican Party]] as its best hope for defeating the popular Brown to retake the governor's mansion, itself perceived as a prominent stepping stone for a rematch against Kennedy in 1964.

In a hard (and bitterly) fought campaign, early polling showed Nixon winning by a significant margin. The polls showed Brown—who made a point of not beginning to campaign until late in the season&lt;ref&gt;Brown famously said he would not even decide to run until "the snow flies in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra]]." Jackson K. Putnam, ''Jess: The Political Career of Jesse Marvin Unruh''. University Press of America, 2005; [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjxK02M5ag0C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=the+snow+flies+in+the+Sierra+pat+brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EVdBEUAKLQ&amp;sig=8NUM7zi8zhDJbIXg43KhTKDa06s p. 167].&lt;/ref&gt;—closing the margin in the days before the election, but Nixon was still favored to win. Brown won the election, and the 5% margin stunned Nixon and political pundits nationwide.

==The press conference==
As election results came in on Tuesday, November 6, Election Day, Nixon and his staff monitored results at a suite in the Beverly Hilton Hotel, in what was becoming a tighter race than expected. Nixon's press secretary [[Herbert G. Klein]] held a news conference at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday morning, telling the assembled reporters that despite trailing Brown by 90,000 votes at that time, Nixon was going to bed without issuing a concession, as there appeared to be sufficient uncounted votes in reliably Republican [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] to overturn Brown's margin.&lt;ref name=NYTCoverage/&gt;

As the night progressed, the returns showed a tide of additional votes for Brown, who had pulled 250,000 votes ahead of Nixon. By 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Nixon sent a congratulatory telegram to Brown that read "Congratulations on your re-election as Governor. I wish you the best in your great honor and opportunity which you now have to lead the first state in the nation." Klein appeared before the press and started his press conference with the announcement that Nixon would not speak to the media. 10 minutes into Klein's press conference, an aide notified him that Nixon would indeed speak to the media.&lt;ref name=NYTCoverage/&gt;

A tired-looking Nixon spoke with a quavering voice, delivering what was described as a "15-minute monologue."&lt;ref name=NYTCoverage/&gt; He spent most of the talk criticizing the press, his remarks interrupted only by brief interjections from reporters, though he acknowledged well into his remarks that the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962 did not allow his campaign to get his message across during the final two weeks in his election bid.&lt;ref name=NYTTranscript&gt;Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/1962/11/08/archives/transcript-of-nixons-news-conference-on-his-defeat-by-brown-in-race.html "Transcript of Nixon's News Conference on His Defeat by Brown in Race for Governor of California"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 8, 1962. Accessed March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon began his remarks stating that "now that all the members of the press are so delighted that I have lost, I'd like to make a statement of my own."&lt;ref name=NYTTranscript/&gt; Nixon insisted that the press had attacked him since 1948 following the [[Alger Hiss]] case. He said: "I leave you gentlemen now. And you will now write it. You will interpret it. That's your right. But as I leave you, I want you to know: just think how much you're going to be missing. You don’t have Nixon to kick around anymore. Because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference." He accused the press of printing articles supporting their favored candidates, stating that while they may "give... the shaft" to future candidates, they should have "one lonely reporter on the campaign who will report what the candidate says now and then". Nixon reserved praise for [[Carl Greenberg]] of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' who he felt "wrote every word I said". Also praised was Edwin Tetlow of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' of [[London]].&lt;ref name=NYTCoverage/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Having seen Nixon's remarks, Brown was quoted as stating "That's something Nixon's going to regret all his life. The press is never going to let him forget it."&lt;ref name=NYTCoverage/&gt; As described in his obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nixon's farewell-to-politics speech made him appear to be a sore loser violating a cardinal rule of U.S. politics, so that it seemed to indicate "that his political career was over".&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Herbers, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/obituaries/37th-president-three-decades-nixon-tasted-crisis-defeat-victory-ruin-revival.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=9 "THE 37TH PRESIDENT; In Three Decades, Nixon Tasted Crisis and Defeat, Victory, Ruin and Revival"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 24, 1994. Accessed March 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five days after the election, [[Howard K. Smith]] hosted a documentary titled ''The Political Obituary of Richard Nixon'', broadcast as a half-hour special by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of its ''[[Howard K. Smith: News and Comment]]'' series. The panelists discussing Nixon's demise were [[Murray Chotiner]] and [[Gerald Ford]], who regretted Nixon's departure from politics. [[Jerry Voorhis]], whom Nixon had defeated in a 1946 congressional run, criticized Nixon's tactics in that campaign. [[Alger Hiss]] discussed his bitterness at how Nixon had used him to advance his own career at Hiss's expense. While the program was on the air, angry callers clogged the ABC switchboard with complaints, many criticizing the decision to include Hiss, a convicted perjurer, to comment on Nixon. Ultimately, ABC received 80,000 letters and telegrams, almost all of which were critical of the network's special and its choice of panelists.&lt;ref name=Ambrose&gt;[[Stephen Ambrose|Ambrose Stephen A.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx5q7HHePF8C&amp;pg=PA673 "Nixon: The education of a politician, 1913-1962"], via [[Google Books]], p. 673, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1988. {{ISBN|0-671-65722-4}}. Accessed March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The partisan nature of Smith's broadcast may well have been the start of Nixon's rehabilitation and ascent towards the presidency, with former [[Governor of New York]] and presidential candidate [[Thomas E. Dewey]] writing to Nixon on November 15, that "It seems to me that Howard K. Smith has been quite helpful, unwittingly." Noting that many people were outraged by the broadcast, Dewey went on to say that "Smith has proved you were right in your comments about the press".&lt;ref name=Ambrose/&gt;

Nixon never showed any remorse for his remarks, instead feeling that the benefits outweighed any possible repercussions, noting in his memoirs that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have never regretted what I said in 'the last press conference.' I believe that it gave the media a warning that I would not sit back and take whatever biased coverage was dished out to me. I think the episode was partially responsible for the much fairer treatment I received from the press during the next few years. From that point of view alone, it was worth it."&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a political term==
The "last press conference" has become a generic term for a politician's valedictory address, one in which all possibilities for future political activity are being abandoned. Alternatively, a politician speaking to the press after an electoral loss who does plan to continue in politics will state that this is not a "last press conference."

In an editorial, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted [[Gary Hart]]'s statement following his withdrawal from the [[Gary Hart presidential campaign, 1988|1988 Democratic Party presidential process]], in which he stated that he was "angry and defiant" at a system that "reduces the press of this nation to hunter and Presidential candidates to being hunted", likening his remarks to Nixon's "last press conference."&lt;ref&gt;Editorial.

[[Dan Quayle]], effectively conceding defeat to Republican rival [[George W. Bush]] in the party's 2000 presidential primaries, noted his relative youth and stated that "I seriously doubt if this will be my last press conference."&lt;ref&gt;Purdum, Todd S.

He also presented an opening statement at the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the [[International Monetary Fund]].

===Chairmanship reports in 2005===

On October 11, 2005, [[Lawrence Kudlow]] stated that his belief that [[Alan Greenspan]] was pushing Ferguson's name to the Bush Administration for the appointment of the Federal Reserve Chairmanship.  As a [[supply-side]] economist, Kudlow said he was worried that Ferguson would follow a [[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]] policy and would oppose the Bush Administration's economic policy.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}  On October 25, 2005, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that senior members at the Federal Reserve, including [[Alan Greenspan]], were encouraging the Bush Administration to appoint Ferguson to the Federal Reserve Chairmanship.  The position eventually went to [[Ben Bernanke]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/916111221.html?dids=916111221:916111221&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Oct+25%2C+2005&amp;author=Jonathan+Weisman&amp;desc=Bernanke+Seen+as+Safe+Pick+For+a+White+House+in+Straits |title=Bernanke Seen as Safe Pick For a White House in Straits |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2005-10-25 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson was the only Federal Reserve Governor in Washington, D.C. during the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.  He was responsible for leading the Federal Reserve's initial response to the terrorist attacks and was praised for his expert handling of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Astonishing Story of the Federal Reserve on 9-11|url=http://m.dailykos.com/story/2014/09/10/1328813/-The-Astonishing-Story-of-the-Federal-Reserve-on-9-11#|publisher=Daily Kos|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=UCHITELLE|first=LOUIS|title=Vice Chairman of the Fed, a Greenspan Ally, Resigns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/23/business/23fed.html?_r=2&amp;scp=11&amp;sq=roger+ferguson+federal+reserve&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin&amp;|publisher=NYT|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the Fed, Ferguson led two working groups to improve the transparency of [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) decisions and the clarity of FOMC communication.  These resulted in the release of a statement at the end of each FOMC meeting, explaining the rationale for the interest rate decision and including an assessment of the risks facing the economy. ([https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DA1331F93BA35753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;scp=24&amp;sq=roger%20ferguson%20federal%20reserve&amp;st=cse])

While at the Fed, Ferguson served as Chairman of the [[Group of Ten (economic)|Group of Ten]] Working Party on Financial Sector Consolidation. The Working Party released its final report on January 25, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/pub/gten05.htm |accessdate=June 3, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the Fed, Ferguson led the Federal Reserve's efforts to modernize the national retail payment system of the United States.  This ultimately resulted in the passage and signing into law of the [[Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act]], which is also known as Check 21.  The law allows the recipient of the original paper check to create a digital version of the original check, a process known as [[check truncation]], into an electronic format called a "[[substitute check]]", thereby eliminating the need for further handling of the physical document.

[[Alan Greenspan]] has called Ferguson "one of the most effective Vice Chairmen in the history of the Federal Reserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Neil|title=Fed Vice Chairman Resigns, Adding to Turnover at Top|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/410046388.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb%2023,%202006&amp;author=Nell%20Henderson&amp;pub=&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Fed%20Vice%20Chairman%20Resigns,%20Adding%20to%20Turnover%20at%20Top|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson proposed the idea of a journal dedicated to central banking theory and practice.  The resulting International Journal of Central Banking was announced in 2004 and first published in 2005, with two objectives:  to disseminate widely the best policy-relevant research on central banking and to promote communication among central banks.  The IJCB has more than 50 sponsoring institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://www.ijcb.org/about/background.htm|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With three co-authors, in November 2007 Ferguson published "International Financial Stability", Geneva Report No. 9, dealing with challenges to global financial stability and including observations regarding the liquidity crisis of 2007.

Ferguson served as the vice chairman of the [[Group of 30]] study group that published "The Structure of Financial Supervision:  Approaches and Challenges in a Global Marketplace".  The study of the regulatory structure of 17 jurisdictions was released on October 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/The%20Structure%20of%20Finacial%20Supervison.pdf |title=The Structure of Financial Supervision: Approaches and Challenges in a Global Marketplace |publisher=Group30.org |accessdate=2008-10-06 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson served as chairman of the [[Group of 30]] study group that published "Enhancing Financial Stability and Resilience: Macroprudential Policy, Tools and Systems for the Future".   The study called on public officials to empower systemic regulators with new tools to enhance the stability and resilience of the global financial system and potentially lessen the severity of future crises.  The study was released on October 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/Macropurdential_Report_Final.pdf |title=Enhancing Financial Stability and Resilience: Macroprudential Policy, Tools, and Systems for the Future |publisher=Group30.org |accessdate=2010-10-10 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2012, Ferguson served as economic advisor to President Obama, initially as a member of the President-elect's Transition Economic Advisory Board and subsequently as a member of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/telecomm/idUSN0634843320081107 |title=Obama to meet with economic team, talk to media |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the President's Commission on Jobs and Competitiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/23/us-obama-panel-factbox-idUSTRE71M5XA20110223 |title=Factbox: CEOs named to Obama's U.S. jobs council |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson served as chairman of the [[Group of 30]] study group that published "Toward Effective Governance of Financial Institutions".  The study, which has been translated into three languages. made several concrete and practical recommendations to enhance governance of financial institutions, including recommendations for management, boards of directors, supervisors and shareholders.  The study was released on April 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/Corporate%20Governance%20050913.pdf |title=Toward Effective Governance at Financial Institutions |publisher=Group30.org |accessdate=2014-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113171443/http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/Corporate%20Governance%20050913.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson served as co-chairman of the [[Group of 30]] study group that published "Banking Conduct and Culture: A Call for Sustained and Comprehensive Reform".  Following two previous reports, the study expands on the role of conduct and culture in the governance of the world's largest financial institutions.  The report identifies shortcomings but also good practice in promoting a strong banking culture, making a series of recommendations that can be drawn upon by leaders as they seek to address culture in their firms.  The study was released July, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/BankingConductandCulture.pdf |title=Banking Conduct and Culture: A Call for Sustained and Comprehensive Reform |publisher=Group30..org |accessdate=2015-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824075106/http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/BankingConductandCulture.pdf |archivedate=2015-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal County of Berkshire Show''' is an annual [[agricultural show]] in [[Berkshire]], England that started in 1909 at Enborne Gate Farm, [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], as a horse show and has now grown to be a significant event for the farming world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny | last=Minard  |work=[[BBC News]] |date=16 September 2010 |title=The Royal County of Berkshire Show |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_9005000/9005084.stm |accessdate=9 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newbury and District Agricultural Society''' was formed in 1909 to run the show and continues to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Society|url=http://www.newburyshowground.co.uk/newbury-district-agricultural-society/about|work=Newbury and District Agricultural Society|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were three breaks in the 20th Century when no show took place. Between 1914 and 1918 during the First World War, between 1928 and 1935 during the farming depression and again during the Second World War  1939 to 1945. Since then the Show has grown to become one of the leading agricultural shows in the country.

The show takes place over two days in September at the permanent showground near [[Chieveley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Royal County of Berkshire Show |url=http://www.newburyshowground.co.uk/show-2011 | accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ruby Murders''' is the popular name for three separate incidents involving the deaths of six American citizens at or near the town of [[Ruby, Arizona]]. The first incident occurred in February 1920 when Mexican [[bandit]]s, thought to be [[Villistas]], robbed and killed the two owners of the Ruby Mercantile. A second attack happened fourteen months later in April 1921 when again Mexican bandits killed the store's owners and robbed the place. Two of the bandits were arrested for the crime, but they briefly escaped custody in July 1922, after killing another two men, which led to the largest [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] in the history of the [[Southwest United States|Southwest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ghost Towns of Arizona|first=James E|last=Sherman|author2=Barbara H. Sherman |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1969|isbn=0-8061-0843-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby.html |title=Ruby, Arizona - A Ghost Town Filled With Mining and Murder |publisher=Legends of America |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[mining town]] of Ruby was established in [[Bear Valley, Arizona|Bear Valley]] during the 1870s and was a haven for [[cattle rustler]]s and other criminals for most of its [[American Old West|Old West]] history. A typical town of the era, Ruby was very small and its one [[general store]] was the sole business other than mining. The store, called the Ruby Mercantile, was originally built sometime in the late 1880s, but also served as the [[post office]] when it opened in 1912. In 1914, the mercantile was purchased by Philip C. Clarke, who later built a larger store a short distance from the original. The second building was an [[adobe]] structure, the remains of which have been preserved.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;

Due to the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910, and the town's close proximity to the international border, Ruby was harassed by bandits and or rebels on many occasions. Rebels loyal to [[Pancho Villa]], a famed border bandit and revolutionary, were active throughout the Mexican territory opposite of the Arizona border. The area was one of the hardest hit during the civil war, which fueled the lawlessness. By 1920 the town was declining, but it was still considered quite dangerous; the inhabitants were instructed to be heavily armed at all times. Clarke felt the area was so dangerous that he kept either a pistol or a rifle in each room of his house and the store.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;

==Murders==
[[File:Ruby AZ.jpg|200px|thumb|Ruby in 1990, the remains of the mercantile can be seen at the far right.]]

;February 27, 1920
In February 1920, Clarke sold the mercantile to John and Alexander Frazer before moving his family to the nearby settlement of Oro Blanco. 
Eleven days after closing the deal with Clarke, on February 27, 1920, the Frazer brothers were both shot during a robbery of the store.&lt;ref name="Dolan, Samuel K. 2016"&gt;Dolan, Samuel K. ''Cowboys and Gangsters: Stories of an Untamed Southwest'' (TwoDot Books, 2016) {{ISBN|978-1-4422-4669-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was found lying on the floor near the [[cash register]]. He had been shot twice; one bullet wound was found in Alexander's head and the second in his back. John was found nearby. He was still alive, but unconscious, having been hit in the left eye by one bullet. He died five hours later without regaining consciousness. An investigation by police found that the bandits, later identified as Ezequiel Lara and Manuel Garcia, had robbed the place and cut the wires for the town's only telephone, which was located in the store. The police discovered two sets of footprints and also learned from the townspeople that two unknown Mexicans had been seen in the area. A local rancher reported that two of his best horses and eight of his cattle had been stolen at or near the same date, making the police assume the incidents were related. The [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] [[newspaper]] ''Weekly Oasis'' said that the 
&lt;blockquote&gt;tragedy is nothing new over there. In the wild and rugged region south from the [[Atascosa Mountains]] and the Bear Valley region, there has been always a harbor for a bunch of desperate characters, whose depredations have been felt by American cattlemen and ranchers through many years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A posse led by Sheriff Raymond Earhardt was sent south along the bandit's trail, but they failed to catch up with the suspects.&lt;ref name="Dolan, Samuel K. 2016"/&gt; Months passed, during which time very little progress was made in the investigation. Finally, in October 1920, Garcia was killed during a gunfight with Pima County deputy sheriffs near Twin Buttes. Lara was eventually arrested in Mexico and jailed for crimes south of the border, but was never called to answer for his role in the Fraser killings.&lt;ref name="Dolan, Samuel K. 2016"/&gt;

;August 26, 1921
The second incident occurred in August 1921 following the transfer of the mercantile's ownership to a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Pearson, who lived in the store with their three daughters.&lt;ref name="Dolan, Samuel K. 2016"/&gt; Although Mr. Pearson was told about the previous killings and the situation on the border, he felt that a second attack on the store was unlikely to happen. However, on the morning of April 26, Frank and his wife Myrtle took a horseback ride into the surrounding hills and while doing so they spotted a group of seven Mexicans riding towards the town. The two thought that the Mexicans would likely want to visit the mercantile so they rode back to service them. When the Mexicans entered the store they asked for [[tobacco]], but as soon as Mr. Pearson turned around to get it the bandits drew their pistols and fired into his back. Pearson was mortally wounded by two bullets, but he managed to grab his pistol under the counter and fire three shots wildly before dying.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby2.html |title=Ruby, Arizona - A Ghost Town Filled With Mining and Murder |publisher=Legends of America |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that the murderers turned their attention to Myrtle, who had five gold teeth. First, one bandit shot Myrtle in the neck to stop her from screaming and then he knocked out her gold teeth with his pistol. She was then shot a second time in the head and killed. Frank's daughter Elizabeth was also grazed in the arm, but other than that the three young girls were left unharmed. The Mexicans left after they emptied the safe and destroyed the telephone. They then rode out of town yelling and firing their guns in the air. When the Mexicans were gone the Pearson girls fled eight miles away to the nearest neighbor. This time when authorities were called for and [[ambulance]] was sent from Nogales, which tended to Elizabeth's wounds. Meanwhile, a large posse of citizens and lawmen began searching the surrounding desert. A [[United States Army]] [[biplane]] from the [[garrison]] at Nogales was also dispatched to participate in the search and it became the first aircraft to be used for a manhunt in the history of Arizona. A [[US$|$]]5,000 bounty, dead or alive, was also authorized for each of the seven Mexicans, partly due to the fact that the gang was suspected of being responsible for the first robbery.

;July 13, 1922
A few months later, after the manhunt had ended unsuccessfully, the authorities received news that two men in a [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] [[cantina]] had bragged about being responsible for robbing the Ruby Mercantile. American police investigated the claim, but it wasn't until April 1922 that any arrests were made. By chance, an Arizona [[deputy sheriff]] overheard a conversation between the [[bartender]] and a customer at a cantina in Sasabe, Sonora; the bartender was trying to sell five gold teeth he had acquired sometime earlier by an outlaw named Manuel Martinez. When the deputy saw the teeth, he was sure they belonged to Myrtle so he bought them and took them back to the United States. Martinez was known for associating with a Mexican named Placidio Silvas, who lived near Oro Blanco, so the two were arrested and put on trial for murder in May 1922. Both were found guilty of murder by the court of [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz County]]. Martinez was sentenced to be hanged and Silvas received a life sentence to be served at the [[Arizona State Prison Complex – Florence|state prison]] in [[Florence, Arizona|Florence]]. However, on July 13, while they were being transported in a police car, the two prisoners managed to break free after Sheriff George White wrecked the car he and deputy L.A. Smith were transporting the prisoners in.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odmp.org/officer/14073-sheriff-george-james-white ODMP memorial for White and Smith]&lt;/ref&gt; The police car was found later that day, rolled into a ditch near Continental, with the bodies of White and Smith nearby. White was killed at the scene, but Smith was still alive and taken to a hospital, where he died of his wounds.&lt;ref name="Dolan, Samuel K. 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=p3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby3.html |title=Ruby, Arizona - A Ghost Town Filled With Mining and Murder |publisher=Legends of America |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men who found White and Smith trailed the outlaws across the [[Santa Rita Mountains]], but they lost track of them near Ruby due to a [[Arizona Monsoon|monsoon]]. The Arizona public was shocked about this latest double homicide so over 700 volunteers from [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima]], [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal]], [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise]] and Santa Cruz counties formed posses for the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest. Initially, Martinez and Silvas evaded the search parties, but, six days after escaping, search dogs uncovered a blood stained file, which put the posses back on the bandits' trail. That same day, Martinez and Silvas were found hiding under some brush in the [[Tumacacori National Forest|Tumacacori Mountains]], about seventy miles from the site where the two had escaped custody. The two Mexicans were re-tried in court and found guilty again, but the Mexican [[consul]] appealed the court's decision and obtained a [[writ]], which delayed the case. Finally, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] intervened and the matter was settled. Martinez was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on August 10, 1923. Silvas was put into prison at Florence, but he later escaped in 1928, never to be seen again.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt;

The '''Rwanda Film Festival''' is a [[film festival]] held annually in July in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]]. The Rwanda Film Festival gained worldwide recognition over the past years and has become one of [[Africa]]'s major film events.

==History==
The Rwanda Film Festival was founded in 2005 by [[Eric Kabera]].&lt;ref name="ALL"&gt;Kisambira, Timothy.

Accessed February 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Presented by the Rwanda Cinema Center, an organization that aims to promote the country's film industry, the Rwanda Film Festival, nicknamed "Hillywood" due to Rwanda's nickname of "Land of a Thousand Hills", is a travelling festival. Due to Kabera's desire to show the films to as large of an audience as possible, the festival is held not only in the capital of [[Kigali]], but the films, especially ones made by Rwandan film-makers, are also shown on large inflatable screens in rural areas throughout the country.&lt;ref name="INDEP"&gt;Bloomfield, Steve.

The '''Scumrun''' is an annual [[charitable organization|charitable]] event in the form of a [[road rally]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to mystery destinations around [[Europe]]. It has been running since 2006, originally as the '''Scumball 3000'''.

==Format of the event==
Vehicles with a maximum purchase price of £500 &amp;ndash; but often significantly upgraded by the teams of one or more drivers and passengers &amp;ndash; are taken to a launch party in the UK before being taken by ferry to mainland Europe.

On each day a destination (plus, usually, intermediate checkpoints) is announced, but only to drivers who pass a [[breathalyser]] test to ensure their blood alcohol level is below the legal maximum to drive. At the end of each day those not driving in the morning participate in celebrations.

Much of the driving and celebrating is recorded for the purposes of producing a [[DVD]] which is used to encourage further teams to participate in future years. Media coverage is found in publications such as [[Fast Car (magazine)|Fast Car]] and [[Men and Motors]], highlighting the antics and money raised for much needed charities.

Communications are maintained between many of the cars using [[CB radio]]s.

Typical vehicles include older [[BMW]] 5 and 7 Series, [[Mercedes-Benz]] W123 and W124 [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-class]] and W126 [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-class]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] XJ models, and an assortment of [[Japan]]ese sports cars. There have also been oddities such as black cab taxis and fire engines.

No other road event raises as much sponsorship via the combined efforts of its participants.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Organisational details==

===Name change===
Scumball 3000 was the brainchild of Edward White (Managing Director) who created the event to assist National Children's charities in raising much needed funds to continue with the support they offer. The event provides a unique format that ensures the participants receive professional care and organisation throughout resulting in high repeat custom compared to similar events. Scumrun sells out each year and works closely with border crossing agencies as well as ferry operators to ensure the route is well planned and tested whilst providing support during the event itself to all participants where possible.

The name had to be changed from Scumball 3000 when the organisers of the [[Gumball 3000]] complained, despite there being a clear distinction between the events with the Gumball 3000 involving extremely valuable sports cars and Scumrun raising vast amounts for charities each year.

The Scumrun logo was trademarked following the name change and due to the popularity of the event the company have had to take the protection of their brand / event very seriously which sometimes includes legal advice in resolving conflicts from similar events.

'''Sexual harassment in the workplace''' in [[US labor law]] has been considered a form of [[sex discrimination|discrimination on the basis of sex]] in the United States since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="mcelroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|date=27 October 2004|website=iFeminists.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=lin+farley#v=onepage&amp;q=lin%20farley&amp;f=false|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva I.|publisher=Yale University|year=2004|isbn=0-300-09800-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of sexual harassment recognized by United States law: [[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|quid pro quo sexual harassment]] (requiring an employee to tolerate sexual harassment to keep their job, receive a tangible benefit, or avoid punishment) and behavior that creates a [[hostile work environment]] (persistent sexual behavior that unreasonably interferes with an employee's ability to work). It has been noted that a number of the early sexual harassment cases were brought by [[African Americans|African American]] women and girls.

== History ==
The term "sexual harassment" was coined and popularized by [[Lin Farley]] in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 [[Cornell University]] class she taught on women and work.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt; It's been noted that a number of the original sexual harassment cases were on behalf of black women and girls.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yatO7SUcs9&amp;sig=EEDntusmtqcqnq4GMPSeAHCXKgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3bO98dvcAhXVCTQIHbMMDM84ChDoATAAegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20v.%20saxbe%20appeal&amp;f=false|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9780814744864|location=|pages=431|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law recognizes two forms of sexual harassment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/sexual_harassment.html|title=Sexual Harassment Law|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|date=10 January 2017|website=ExpertLaw|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|Quid pro quo sexual harassment]]''': an employee is required to tolerate sexual harassment in exchange for employment, a raise or job benefit, or promotion.
*'''[[Hostile work environment]]''': sexual harassment in the workplace results in an offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes an employee's work performance.

=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===
In the US, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], sex, color, [[national origin]] or religion. Initially only intended to combat sexual harassment of women, (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2) the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers both females and males. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm|website=EEOC|publisher=U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations (1980) ===
In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

=== Civil Rights Act of 1991 ===
The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment

=== Case Law ===
==== ''Barnes v Train'' (1974) ====
''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/10/27/sad-evolution-sexual-harassment.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|date=2004-10-27|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paulette Barnes, an African American woman, was a payroll clerk who worked for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]. She brought the case after losing her job for refusing the advances of a male supervisor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peirce|first=Michelle Ridgeway|date=1989|title=Sexual Harassment and Title VII: A Better Solution|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1897&amp;context=bclr|journal=Boston College Law Review, Volume 30, Issue 4, Number 4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed, but was appealed in ''Barnes v Costle'' (1977).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) ====
In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' was the first case in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] to establish that [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. A male supervisor was found to have retaliated against [[Diane R. Williams]] by firing her after she refused to have sex with him. The court found that it was form of sex discrimination when a condition of employment is to submit to the sexual advances of a superior. Additionally, there was evidence that other female employees had been subjected to similar conditions. It was ruled that William B. Saxbe had only required women to submit to his advances, which created an artificial barrier to employment for one gender but not the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/413/654/1660985/|title=Williams v. Saxbe, 413 F. Supp. 654 (D.D.C. 1976)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/sexual-harassment-naming-it-paved-the-way-to-legal-victories|title=How Two Legal Cases Established Sexual Harassment as a Civil Rights Violation|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Williams v Saxbe'' established a clear-cut type of sexual harassment, [[quid pro quo]], and was the first to establish it in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]]. In response to the findings of this case, several earlier decisions against sex discrimination in lower courts were reversed on appeal, including ''Barnes v Train.'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977) ====
Although ''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) was initially dismissed, Paulette Barnes won on appeal in ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977). During this case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] ruled it was sex discrimination for a woman to suffer tangible employment losses (for example losing her job) for refusing to submit to requests for sexual favors. The appeals ruling was based in part on the ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) decision.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yatO7SUcs9&amp;sig=EEDntusmtqcqnq4GMPSeAHCXKgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3bO98dvcAhXVCTQIHbMMDM84ChDoATAAegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20v.%20saxbe%20appeal&amp;f=false|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9780814744864|location=|pages=431-432|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also found that companies are liable for not stopping sexual harassment if they know it is being conducted by supervisors.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As part of the ruling of ''Barnes v. Costle,'' Barnes received around $18,000 for back pay and the loss of promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wenzelfenton.com/blog/2018/01/01/history-sexual-harassment-laws-united-states/|title=History of Sexual Harassment Laws in the United States|date=2018-01-01|work=Wenzel Fenton Cabassa, P.A.|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson'' (1986) ====
In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson'', 477 U.S. 57 (1986) |findlaw=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=477&amp;page=57 |justia=http://supreme.justia.com/us/477/57/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case filed by Mechelle Vinson ruled that the sexual conduct between the subordinate and supervisor could not be deemed voluntary due to the hierarchical relationship between the two positions in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53284947|title=Sexual harassment and the law : the Mechelle Vinson case|last=1946-|first=Cochran, Augustus B.,|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=0700613234|location=Lawrence, Kan.|oclc=53284947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ruling of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, reported sexual harassment cases grew from 10 cases being registered by the EEOC per year before 1896 to 624 case being reported in the subsequent following year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This number of reported cases to the EEOC rose to 2,217 in 1990 and then 4,626 by 1995.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''Ellison v. Brady'' (1991) ====
The case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Profio|first1=Debra A.|title=Ellison v. Brady: Finally, a Woman's Perspective|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|date=1992|volume=2|issue=0|page=249|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3206643c|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== ''Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.'' (1991) ====
Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others.

Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards. 

==== ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''Burlington v. Ellerth'' (1998) ====
In the same year, the courts concluded in ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''[[Burlington v. Ellerth]]'', that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-282 |title=U.S Supreme Court: Beth Ann Faragher, petitioner v.

==== ''Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998)'' ====
Moreover, ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

==== ''Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White'' (2006) ====
In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v.

==== ''Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.'' (2010) ====
The 2010 case, [[Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.|''Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.'']] ruled that a hostile work environment can be created in a workplace where sexually explicit language and pornography are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conte|first1=Alba|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|date=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|isbn=9780735597655|pages=3–278|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Hostile work environment|hostile workplace]] may exist based upon the treatment of employees as a group, even if it is not targeted at any particular employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegar|first1=Kathryn W.|title=Modern Human Relations at Work|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0538481064|page=34|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
During 2007 alone, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and related state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners|title=Sexual Harassment Law: A Brief Introduction for New Practitioners|last=Marshall|first=David|author2=Andronici, Justine|date=October 23, 2008|publisher=Katz, Marshall &amp; Banks|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 through 2016, men made approximately 17% of sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charges Alleging Sex-Based Harassment (Charges filed with EEOC) FY 2010 - FY 2016|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment_new.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 MSN poll it was found that 31% of people in the U.S have been sexually harassed in the workplace; 45% of women said they were sexually harassed and 15% percent of men said they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sexual-harassment-affects-nearly-everyone-2017-11|title=Sexual harassment isn't a Hollywood, tech, or comedy world issue — in fact, it affects everyone|last=Gillett|first=Rachel|date=2017-11-10|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment in government===

The California legislature in Sacramento is known to have paid at least $850,000 in sexual harassment settlements in the period 1996-2017, though the [[New York Times]] notes often settlements are unknown to the public because of the terms of the settlements themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=JESS BIDGOOD|last2=MIRIAM JORDAN|last3=ADAM NAGOURNEY|title=Sexual Misconduct in California’s Capitol Is Difficult to Escape|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/sacramento-sexual-harassment-california.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=The New York Times|date=29 October 2017|quote=many harassment cases disappear into the court system, where the outcomes are often sealed as women sign nondisclosure agreements.

'''Stefan Grimm''' (1963 - 2014) was a biologist who held a Chair in Toxicology at [[Imperial College London]]. He worked on signalling cascades in the development of tumors.

Grimm was found dead in Northwood, Middlesex on 25 September 2014 after being told that he was "struggling to fulfil the metrics" of a professorial post by his head of department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Imperial College professor Stefan Grimm ‘was given grant income target’|url = https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/imperial-college-professor-stefan-grimm-was-given-grant-income-target/2017369.article|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coroner described his death as "needless".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The death of Stefan Grimm was "needless". And Imperial has done nothing to prevent it happening again|url = http://www.dcscience.net/2015/04/09/the-death-of-stefan-grimm-was-needless-and-imperial-has-done-nothing-to-prevent-it-happening-again/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Grimm studied for his PhD under the supervision of [[Patrick A. Baeuerle|Patrick Bäuerle]] at the [[University of Tübingen]], working on the role of NFκB in cell transformation and apoptosis. From 1995 to 1998 he was postdoctoral fellow with [[Philip Leder]] at Harvard University, he then took up a junior post as a group leader at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry. In 2004 he moved to Imperial College London, where he was appointed Professor of Toxicology.

Grimm's research programme focused primarily on [[apoptosis]], signalling pathways, and tumour-genesis. Here, he made fundamental contributions to the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cell death in connection with the development of cancer. In 20 years, he published 50 journal articles, two books, and filed 5 patent applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_14-1-2015-17-40-44|title = Obituary - Professor Stefan Grimm, 1963 - 2014|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and Events at Imperial College London ==
Grimm was found dead at his home in Middlesex on 25 September 2014 with typed notes next to his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stefan Grimm inquest: new policies may not have prevented suicide|url = https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/stefan-grimm-inquest-new-policies-may-not-have-prevented-suicide/2019563.article|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stefan Grimm inquest: new policies may not have prevented suicide|url = https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/stefan-grimm-inquest-new-policies-may-not-have-prevented-suicide/2019563.article|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inquest subsequently ruled that he took his life by asphyxiation. One month after his death, on 21 October, an email with the subject line ''How Professors are treated at Imperial College'', apparently set to deliver on a delay timer, was sent from the address ''professorstefangrimm@gmail.com'' to senior members of the medical faculty.

In the email Grimm, describes how his head of department told him that although he had submitted the highest number of grant applications in the medical faculty, and despite already acquiring £135,000 in grant income, he needed to obtain a programme grant or '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''start to give serious consideration as to whether you are performing at the expected level of a Professor at Imperial College.'''
In his last email Grimm had this to say of the senior staff in his faculty:&lt;blockquote&gt;''These formidable leaders are playing an interesting game: They hire scientists from other countries to submit the work that they did abroad under completely different conditions for the Research Assessment that is supposed to gauge the performance of British universities. Afterwards they leave them alone to either perform with grants or being kicked out. Even if your work is submitted to this Research Assessment and brings in money for the university, you are targeted if your grant income is deemed insufficient. Those submitted to the research assessment hence support those colleagues who are unproductive but have grants. Grant income is all that counts here, not scientific output.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Of Imperial College London he said, &lt;blockquote&gt;''This is not a university anymore but a business with [a] very few up in the hierarchy... profiteering [while] the rest of us are milked for money, be it professors for their grant income or students who pay 100 pounds just to extend their write-up status.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Rector of Imperial College, [[Alice Gast]] gave credence to Grimm's analogy, when she described university professors as "really like small business owners... they have their own research and they have their research funding to look after."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President of Imperial College London: "Professors are really like small business owners"|url = http://markcarrigan.net/2015/04/17/president-of-imperial-college-london-professors-are-really-like-small-business-owners/|website = Mark Carrigan|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December, [[David Colquhoun]], Emeritus Professor of Pharmacology at UCL and long-time critic of managerialism and research assessment in British Universities wrote a blog post entitled ''“Publish and perish at Imperial College London: the death of Stefan Grimm."'' Colquhoun published both Grimm's email and the emails sent by his head of department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publish and perish at Imperial College London: the death of Stefan Grimm|url = http://www.dcscience.net/2014/12/01/publish-and-perish-at-imperial-college-london-the-death-of-stefan-grimm/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The post was viewed 196,000 times in the year after Grimm's death. The day after it was posted it Colquhoun's web server received so many page requests it failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stefan Grimmm (1963 – 2014). A memorial to a victim of managerialism|url = http://www.dcscience.net/2015/09/24/stefan-grimmm-1963-2014-a-memorial-to-a-victim-of-managerialism/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colquhoun described Imperial's performance targets as "a recipe for short term, unoriginal research. It’s an incentive to cut corners... It is a prostitution of science."

On 4 December, Imperial issued a statement via Caroline Davis, its Communications and Public Affairs Reporter. The statement expressed sadness at the "tragic loss" of Professor Grimm and reported that "senior colleagues have offered their deepest condolences to Stefan’s family on behalf of the college and all those affected by this tragedy". The statement denied "claims appearing on the internet...[that] Professor Grimm's work was ... under formal review [or that]... he had been given any notice of dismissal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_4-12-2014-18-0-17#authorbox|title = Statement on Professor Stefan Grimm|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imperial commissioned an internal review into its performance management procedures, commenting:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Professor Grimm had been under review in the informal process for nearly two years. His line manager was using this period to help Professor Grimm obtain funding or alternative work (the review panel saw evidence of the efforts made in this regard). The subsequent formal process would have involved a minimum of two formal meetings with time to improve in-between formal meetings before consideration would have been given to the termination of Professor Grimm’s employment. Understandably there is a reluctance to move into formal hearings, particularly when the member of staff is hard working and diligent, but the formal stages would have provided more clarity to Professor Grimm on process and support through the written documentation, representation at meetings and HR involvement."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It is recommended that the new capability procedure and ordinance include greater clarity on timescales for informal action and how this might operate in different roles.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Colquhoun commented: "It seems to be absurd to describe...[the head of department's email]... as an attempt to 'help' Professor Grimm. It was a direct threat to the livelihood of a competent 51 year-old full professor. Having flow charts for the [[Workplace bullying in academia|bullying]] would not have helped."

'''Triplemanía XVI''' was the sixteenth [[Triplemanía]] [[professional wrestling]] show scripted and produced by [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). The show took place on June 13, 2008 in Mexico City, Mexico. The show was available on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) in Mexico, the first Triplemanía show to be offered on PPV. The main event featured a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|singles match]] for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. Champion [[Cibernético]] defended against [[El Zorro (wrestler)|El Zorro]].

The show also featured the surprise return of [[Silver King (wrestler)|Silver King]], who teamed up with [[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]] and [[La Parka II|La Parka]], only to lose to ''[[La Legión Extranjera]]'' ([[Bobby Lashley]], [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]] and [[Kenzo Suzuki]]) in the semi-main event of the show. The show also included a [[hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]] between [[Vampiro]] and [[El Mesías]], as well as a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match", where sisters [[Faby Apache]] and [[Mari Apache]] both put their hair on the line for the match. The show include four additional matches.

===Background===
[[File:Ciber Nuevo Perro del Mal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cibernético]] reigning [[AAA Mega Championship|AAA Mega Champion]] going into the event.]]
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA, or Triple A; Spanish for "Assistance, Assessment, and Administration").

===Storylines===
[[File:Arms (2971269439).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bobby Lashley]], brought to Mexico specifically for the show.]]

The Triplemanía XVI show featured a total of seven [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with where some wrestlers were involved [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

[[AAA Mega Champion]] [[Cibernético]] and challenger [[El Zorro (wrestler)|El Zorro]] had been rivals for almost a year prior to Triplemanía XVI, starting when both Cibernético and El Zorro targeted then AAA Mega Champion [[El Mesías]]. The championship feud build from the overarching AAA storyline featuring ''[[La Legión Extranjera]]'' ("The Foreign Legion") fighting against the Mexicans representing AAA. El Mesías, from Puerto Rico, was one of the major figures in ''La Legión Extranjera'', teaming with US representative [[Sean Waltman]] and Japanese wrestler [[Kenzo Suzuki]] in the main event of [[Triplemanía XV]]. The trio lost to ''[[Los Hell Brothers]]'' (Cibernético, [[Charly Manson]] and [[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]]).&lt;ref name="Trip15"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#xv| title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = July 22, 2016|date=July 15, 2007| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007 ''Los Hell Brothers'' teamed up with El Zorro to wrestle against [[the Black Family]] ([[Dark Cuervo]], [[Dark Escoria]], [[Dark Espiritu]] and [[Dark Ozz]]) in the main event of the 2007 [[Verano de Escándalo (2007)|Verano de Escándalo]] show. Zorro escaped early on in the match leaving his team at a disadvantage. After ''Los Hell Brothers'' won the match a man came to the ring wearing the "iron mask" but that turned out to be Konnan. When Zorro appeared on the scene moments later he turned on the ''tecnicos'', attacking them with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]].&lt;ref name="Verano2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/verano.html#2007| title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Verano de Escandalo | accessdate = July 22, 2016| date=September 16, 2007 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show Zorro claimed that he was shown the light; he was actually a [[Spain|Spaniard]], not Mexican, and was against the Mexican contingent in AAA. Joining Konnan's ''La Legión Extranjera''.&lt;ref name=ZorroIronMaskHistory&gt;{{cite web |url= http://luchalibreaaa.com/180606-el-zorro-y-la-mascara-de-hierro-se-encuentran-por-primera-vez.php | title= 18/06/06: El Zorro y la máscara de hierro se encuentran por primera vez | date=July 19, 2011| accessdate=July 22, 2016 | work=AAA | language=Spanish | archivedate=August 16, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816110249/http://luchalibreaaa.com/180606-el-zorro-y-la-mascara-de-hierro-se-encuentran-por-primera-vez.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Zorro's turn the story was that Konnan considered El Zorro his "main man", the two even turned on El Mesías and ''[[La Secta (professional wrestling)|La Secta del Mesías]]'' when El Mesías did not want to grant Zorro a title match. The storyline lead to a three-way world title match between Zorro, El Mesías and Cibernético at [[Guerra de Titanes (2007)|Guerra de Titanes]] ("War of the Titans"). During the match Cibernético received [[Burn|second and third burns]] to his back after ''La Legión'' put him through a table on fire (Cibernético was legitimately injured, it was not planned).&lt;ref name="Titanes2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/guerra.html#2007| title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Guerra de Titanes| accessdate = July 11, 2016| date=November 20, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, the storyline continued as El Zorro and the rest of ''La Legión Extranjera'' attacked and "injured" El Mesias during a show. The storyline was done partially to cover up the fact that El Mesias was returning Puerto Rico, as well as to help establish El Zorro as a top ''rudo'' in AAA.&lt;ref name=Lucha2007&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Lo Mejor de la Lucha Mexicana|work=SuperLuchas|id=issue 244|date=December 26, 2007|url=http://superluchas.com/2007/12/26/superluchas-224-lo-mejor-del-2007/|accessdate=July 11, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2008 [[Rey de Reyes (2008)|Rey de Reyes]] ("King of Kings") El Zorro won the Rey de Reyes tournament, while Cibernético finally defeated El Mesías to win the AAA Mega Championship.&lt;ref name="Rey2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2008 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes Tournament | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date = March 16, 2008 | publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090301173345/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2008 | archivedate = March 1, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With his victory in the Rey de Reyes tournament El Zorro also earned a championship match at Triplemanía XVI.&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt; The original plan for the main event was to have AAA promoter Joaquín Roldán at ringside for the match, but the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission would not allow it because he was not a licensed active competitor and the plan included Roldán getting physically involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.superluchas.net/?p=4674 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010208/http://www.superluchas.net/?p=4674 | title=Triplemania XVI, fricciones con la comisión de Box y Lucha del DF | date=June 2, 2008 | accessdate=July 23, 2016 | archivedate=June 6, 2008 | publisher=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish| first=Jorge | last=Ocampo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another featured match of Triplemanía XVI was a long-running "family feud" between sisters [[Mari Apache]] and [[Faby Apache]] that also included their father, [[Gran Apache]], Faby's husband[[Billy Boy (wrestler)|Billy Boy]] their son Marvin "Apache". The storyline started out in 2005 with Billy Boy approaching the ring when Faby Apache was in a match. He usually carried flowers with him, and at times even carrying signs where he professed his love. The two had dated for years in real life prior to the storyline, and had in fact gotten married around the same time, writing their real life relationship into a storyline.&lt;ref name=WrestleView&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news08/1228001057.shtml | title= !Viva La Raza! # Dos: Lucha News! | author= Boutwell, Josh | date= November 29, 2008 | accessdate= February 24, 2010 | publisher=WrestleView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems began when Faby Apache's father, Gran Apache, objected to the relationship and attacked Billy Boy because he was not "worthy" of his daughter, he was not tough enough for Gran Apache's liking. The Family feud stretched out for several years and even had the birth of Faby and Billy Boy's son Marvin incorporated into the storyline. The feud saw Gran Apache defeat Billy Boy in a match where he would be forced to  not have anything to do with either Faby Apache or his son. Following the loss the storyline was that Billy Boy was so depressed that he caused his team ''[[Los Barrio Boys]]'' to lose several matches, this in turn, led to [[Drago (wrestler)|Alan]] and Decnnis turning on Billy Boy, taking Gran Apache's side in the storyline.&lt;ref name=WrestleView/&gt; On May 28, 2008 Faby Apache defeated [[Ayako Hamada]] and Mari Apache to win the 2008 ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, moving the storyline onto focusing on Faby and her older sister Mari Apache, who chose to side with her father in the storyline.&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt; The two sisters agreed to put their hair on the line in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match", at Triplemanía XVI.&lt;ref name=OriginalCard/&gt;

One of the featured storylines that was supposed to culminate at Triplemanía XVI focused on the internal struggles of a ''rudo'' group known as ''[[Los Vipers]]'', initially between ''Los Vipers'' leader [[Abismo Negro]] and [[Black Abyss]], a wrestler using a very similar ring character. Initially, it was believed that the Black Abyss character was introduced due to rumors of Abismo Negro jumping to CMLL or to cover several [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-show|no-shows]].&lt;ref name=SL308&gt;{{cite news|last=Flores|first=Manuel|title=Abismo Negro Adiós al rey de marinete|work= SuperLuchas|id=308|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexican Federal District|D.F.]]|pages=24–26|date=2009-03-30|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time Mr. Niebla had begun challenging Abismo Negro's position as the leader of ''Los Vipers'', backing Black Abyss in the feud. At the 2008 ''Rey de Reyes'' show Abismo Negro lost due to interference from Black Abyss.&lt;ref name="Rey2008"/&gt; The tension led to Abismo Negro and Mr. Niebla physically fightighting each other over the leadership, wrestling in matches where the ''Los Vipers'' leadership was on the line. Abismo Negro won the matches, but each time AAA head booker Joaquín Roldan announced that the decision had been overturned for various reasons. After the second match the rest of ''Los Vipers'' turned on Abismo Negro and kicked him out of the group, making Mr. Niebla their leader instead.&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt; The storyline was supposed to end in a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match between Niebla and Negro at Triplemanía XVI. Later on the match was changed to a multi-man [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] including all of Los Vipers (Mr. Niebla, Black Abyss, [[Psicosis II]] and [[Histeria (wrestler)|Histeria]]) and Abismo Negro with the last person in the cage being forced to unmask&lt;ref name=OriginalCard&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612022627/http://www.superluchas.net/?p=4372 | url=http://www.superluchas.net/?p=4372 | title=¿El cartel de Triplemania XVI? | date= May 19, 2008 | archivedate=June 12, 2008 | accessdate=July 23, 2016 | first=Jorge | last=Ocampo Alcazar | publisher=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before the show the steel cage match as canceled with AAA claiming that Abismo Negro had suffered a neck injury.&lt;ref name=SL308/&gt;

==Event==
[[File:Kenzo Suzuki cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenzo Suzuki]], part of ''[[La Legión Extranjera]]'']]

For the opening match [[Laredo Kid]] was originally scheduled to be part of the match, but for unexplained reasons did not work the match, leaving his fellow ''[[Real Fuerza Aérea]]'' ("Royal Air Force") members [[Aero Star]], [[El Ángel (wrestler)|El Ángel]], and [[Super Fly (wrestler)|Super Fly]] one man short as they faced off against The Black Family (Dark Cuervo, Dark Escoria, Dark Espiritu and Dark Ozz).&lt;ref name="Trip16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip/&gt;

Mr. Niebla was originally scheduled to compete in the second match of the night, but instead, he quit AAA, and made his CMLL return at Infierno en el Ring that same night. Later on Mr. Niebla later stated that he left AAA because the big mask vs. mask match he was promised fell through as Abismo Negro was unable to work the Triplemanía match.&lt;ref name=SL286&gt;{{cite news|author=Islas, Alejandro|title=Mr. Niebla|work=SuperLuchas|id=286|date=July 2, 2008|url=http://superluchas.net/?p=5050|accessdate=July 18, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Histeria replaced Mr. Niebla in the six-man tag team match where ''Los Vipers'' lost to [[Alan Stone (wrestler)|Alan Stone]], [[Octagón]], and [[Brazo de Plata]] when Octagón pinned Histeria.&lt;ref name="Trip16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip/&gt;

In the fourth match of the night sisters Faby and Mari Apache squared off, fighting each other with their hair on the line. Billy Boy was on the corner of his wife Faby Apache, while Gran Apache was in Mari Apache's corner for the match. The match ended with Faby Apache pinning her older sister Mari Apache. A visibly emotional Gran Apache entered the ring before Mari Apache got her hair shaved off, pleading with the officials and the crowd to have HIS hair shaved off instead, pleading for his family to reunite. As Gran Apache had his hair shaved off the Apache sisters put their differences aside, hugging their father, with Billy Boy joining in moments later, calling a truce to the long-running feud.&lt;ref name="Trip16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip/&gt;

According to AAA, the fifth match of the night, a [[Hardcore wrestling#Rules|hardcore match]], had a fifteen-minute time limit imposed on it by the Mexico City boxing and wrestling federation, despite such matches normally not having a time limit. The added stipulation allowed AAA to have [[Vampiro]] and El Mesías, within having a conclusive winner of the match, allowing them to extend the feud. The two were fighting on the outside of the ring when the time expired, resulting in a draw.&lt;ref name="Trip16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip/&gt;

For the semi-final match a wheelchair bound Charly Manson entered the arena to introduce the ''luchador sorpresa'' ("surprise wrestler") that had been advertised and Chessman and La Parka's tag team partner. AAA played "[[Bad Medicine (song)|Bad Medicine]]" over the PA system, normally the theme song of [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] (who was wrestling for CMLL), as they introduced Dr. Wagner Jr.'s brother [[Silver King (wrestler)|Silver King]] as the surprise wrestler, confirming rumors reported by newspapers earlier in the day.&lt;ref name="Trip16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n732436.htm | title=Bobby Lashley en México | first=Alfredo | last=Ascencio | date=June 13, 2008 | accessdate=July 23, 2016 | work=ESTO | publisher= O.E.M. | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver King surprised everyone by wearing his [[wrestling mask]], after not having worn it for over 20 years. In ''Lucha Libre'' it is normally not allowed for a wrestler to resume wearing a mask they have previously lost in a ''Lucha de Apuestas'', but for this occasion Silver King and AAA ignored the tradition.&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=Okay... what is Lucha Libre?|pages=29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended when Suzuki hit Silver King with a low blow behind the referee's back and pinned him, winning the match for his side.&lt;ref name="Trip16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip/&gt;

In the main event Cibernético had the odds stacked against him, starting with El Tirantes being named the referee, El Tirantes played the role of a crooked referee who supported ''La Legión Extranjera'' whenever he had a chance. During the match against El Zorro, El Tirantes was knocked out by accident, leaving the match unsupervised for a short while. When El Zorro covered Cibernético, Konnan (El Zorro's corner man) took off his shirt to reveal a referee's shirt underneath. The ploy failed as Cibernético kicked out before the three count. Moments later El Hijo del Tirantes ("Son of El Tirantes") came to the ring to officiate the match fairly and without bias. Moments later Cibernético pinned El Zorro to retain the championship.&lt;ref name="Trip16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:ChessmanGuerraDeTitanes.jpg|thumb|[[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]], the next challenger for the [[AAA Mega Championship]].]]
In the lead up to AAA's next major event ''[[Verano de Escándalo (2008)|Verano de Escándalo]]'' ("Summer of Scandal") Cibernético's ''Los Hell Brothers'' team mate Chessman won an elimination match to earn a shot at the AAA Mega Championship held by Cibernético.&lt;ref name="Contender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.com/2008/07/23/chessman-gana-la-eliminatoria-para-contender-por-el-mega-campeonato-triple-a/|title=Chessman gana la eliminatoria para contender por el Mega Campeonato Triple A|accessdate=February 23, 2009| date=July 23, 2008|publisher=SuperLucha|language=Spanish|first=Jorge | last=Ocampo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cibernético congratulated his partner for the victory, but did not agree to a date for Chessman's title match. The tension came to a head in September after Cibernético came to the ring to congratulate Chessman on a recent win. Charly Manson came to the ring to try and mediate between the two, trying to keep the peace, but when Manson could not pick sides, ''Los Hell Brothers'' disbanded.&lt;ref name="HellBrothersEnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.com/2008/09/03/triple-a-en-nuevo-laredo-electroshock-sin-cabellera-oficial-ruptura-de-los-hell-brothers/|title=Triple A en Nuevo Laredo: Electroshock sin cabellera, oficial ruptura de los hell brothers|accessdate=February 23, 2009 | date=September 3, 2009 | first=Jorge | last=Ocampo|publisher=SuperLucha|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the split of ''Los Hell Brothers, Chessman'' became a ''Rudo'' and the title match was scheduled for ''Verano de Escandalo''.

The predominant storyline after Triplemanía XVI featured the Konnan-led ''La Legión Extranjera'' group as they continued their efforts to take control of AAA. By winning the main event of the Antonio Peña Memorial Show the storyline was that ''La Legión Extranjera'' was now running AAA, completing their takeover.&lt;ref name=Verano2008SL&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2008/10/25/resultados-de-la-funcion-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-konnan-es-el-nuevo-director-de-aaa/ | title= Función Homenaje a Antonio Peña (24 Octubre 2008).

As a follow up to the time-limit draw between Vampiro and El Mesías, the two faced off in an extreme rules match on AAA's ''Sin Límite'' television taping on July 25. That match ended in a 25-minute time-limit draw. The inconclusive ended lead to AAA booking the rematch between the two as the main event of the 2008 ''Verano de Escándalo'' show, making the match a steel cage "street fight" match, ensuring that there would be a winner.&lt;ref name=Verano2008/&gt; At ''Verano de Escándalo'' El Mesías defeated Vampiro to end the storyline between the two.&lt;ref name=Verano2008/&gt;

While the Apaches reunited at the show, the storyline didn't end there. Later in 2008 Billy Boy returned to AAA, wearing a mask to keeping his true identity secret as he wrestled under the name "Alfa". He used the ruse to try to gain Gran Apache's respect. The ploy worked to the point where Gran Apache stated that Alfa would make a good husband for Faby Apache. After hearing that Billy Boy unmasked himself and reunited with Faby Apache and Marvin. The ruse did not please Gran Apache, who still did not like Billy Boy.&lt;ref name=WrestleView/&gt; During the 2008 Guerra de Titanes show Billy Boy came to Faby Apache's aid after she lost a match. The frustration of the loss made Faby Apache slap Billy Boy, which in turn caused Billy Boy to attack her.&lt;ref name=LaRazaDec132008&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wrestleview.com/news08/1229196334.shtml | title= Viva La Raza! # Cuatro: Lucha News | author= Boutwell, Josh | date= December 13, 2008 | accessdate= February 26, 2010 | publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an in-ring celebration of Gran Apache's 50 years in professional wrestling Billy Boy attacked his father-in-law with a steel chair, reversing the roles of Billy Boy and Gran Apache at that point in the storyline.&lt;ref name=LaRazaMarch62009&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1236332886.php | title= Viva La Raza!

To begin with, Billy Boy acted like he did not care, stating that he had moved on as well and found a new love in [[Sexi Star]].&lt;ref name=LaRazaMarch202009&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1237534446.php | title= Viva La Raza!

With Joe Lider turning on the Mexican Powers and Nicho el Millonario turning on ''La Familia'' the two, along with [[X-Fly]], formed a new group known as ''La Hermandad 187'' ("The [[187 (slang)|187]] Brotherhood"), fighting with both the Mexican Powers and ''La Familia de Tijuana''. Nicho and Lider won a [[Ladder match]] at ''Verano de Escándalo'' defeating the Mexican Powers (Crazy Boy and Último Gladiador), ''La Familia de Tijuana'' (Extreme Tiger and Halloween), and [[The Hart Foundation 2.0]] (Jack Evans and Teddy Hart) to win the [[AAA World Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=Verano2008/&gt;

'''Twins Days''' is a festival for biological [[twin]]s (and other multiples, e.g. triplets, quads) which has taken place every summer since 1976 in [[Twinsburg, Ohio]], when the festival was founded by A group of Twinsburg citizens including Ray Diersing, who who helped create it for his daughters.  It is the largest annual gathering of twins in the world,  and draws thousands of participants from all over the [[United States]] and elsewhere in the world. 

The event, which takes place on the first full weekend in August, routinely attracts about 2,000 pairs of twins. About 1,140 sets of multiples pre-registered for the 2014 festival, including people from Nigeria, Brazil, Australia, Ghana, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, France, Italy, England, Belgium, Germany, Japan, China and India. The 2014 festival was themed as a "peace and love" event, and billed as "Twinstock: Groovy in Twinsburg".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudsonhubtimes.com/regional/2014/07/29/twins-days-festival-sets-stage-for-groovy-weekend-in-twinsburg/ Howard,Conner, "Twins Days Festival Sets Stage for Groovy Weekend in Twinsburg", ''Hudson Hub-Times'' (July 29, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has developed its own traditions over the years. As the writer [[Tony Barrell (journalist)|Tony Barrell]] noted in a major press article in 2003, “An unwritten festival rule means that identical twins are identically dressed, too. This applies as much to 70-year-old men as to 17-year-old girls, and to tiny babies, wheeled around in fleets of twin buggies.”&lt;ref name=TBarrell&gt;[http://www.tonybarrell.com/the-twinsburg-chronicles/ Barrell, Tony, "The Twinsburg Chronicles", ''Sunday Times'' (November 16, 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is opened every year with a performance of [[The Star-Spangled Banner]], sung by John and Jerry Starlet and signed in [[American Sign Language|ASL]] by Jamie Maassen and Jodie Qualkinbush, and a [[parade]] along Ravenna Road (former [[Ohio State Route 14|SR-14]]).

The festival attracts many members of the scientific community, who use the presence of thousands of identical and fraternal twins to conduct voluntary [[twin studies]], in order to determine the genetic or non-genetic basis of a wide range of human traits. Twins are customarily rewarded for their participation.&lt;ref name=TBarrell/&gt;

Barrell also noted that there was a tendency among Twins Days attendees to form human patterns: “Pairs of complete strangers seem continually, magnetically drawn to one another, to shake hands, slap backs – and, sometimes, take the relationship further... Another extraordinary thing is happening: clumps of twins keep making human patterns. Every few seconds, two or three or more sets get together in symmetrical formations and smile for somebody’s camera. They seem powerless to resist the compulsion, and watching it is like seeing the colors coalesce in a giant kaleidoscope.”&lt;ref name=TBarrell/&gt;

==History==
The Twins Days event was inspired by a pair of enterprising 19th-century twins, Moses and Aaron Wilcox. “They were the identical twins who bought about 4,000 acres of land here in 1819, and then offered to donate six acres for a town square and $20 towards a new school, on one condition: that the place drop its dull old name, Millsville, and become Twinsburg. More than a century and a half later, in 1976, the town was celebrating the [[United States Bicentennial|United States’ bicentennial]] and decided to throw a party the Wilcoxes would have appreciated. Just 36 pairs of twins showed up, but the burghers of Twinsburg saw its potential and made it annual.”&lt;ref name=TBarrell/&gt;

The events of Urban Beach Week are typically spread over five days.&lt;ref name="miamiherald3"&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/28/2821418/success-of-beachs-memorial-day.html "“Success” of Beach’s Memorial Day weekend depends on point of view", The Miami Herald, 28.5.12]&lt;/ref&gt; The city does not sponsor the event and there is no one organizer.

== Visitor numbers ==
Estimates of those attending Urban Beach Week range from 250,000 to 350,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="miamiherald1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rob McFarland |url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/hiphop-and-bling-on-the-boardwalk-20110319-1c0xw.html |title=Urban Beach Week, South Beach, Miami &amp;#124; Hip-hop and bling on the boardwalk |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major artists ==
While Urban Beach Week is a hip-hop dominated music event, major [[reggae]] artists from the US and abroad have also appeared.&lt;ref name="miamiherald2"/&gt;

Major artists who have performed at Urban Beach Week related shows include [[Flo Rida]],&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; [[Twista]],&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; [[Mr. Vegas]],&lt;ref name="miamiherald2"/&gt; [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]],&lt;ref name="miamiherald2"/&gt; [[Lil Bow Wow]], [[Funkmaster Flex]],&lt;ref name="miamiherald4"&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/27/2819931_p2/urban-beach-week-partygoers-take.html "A concert, parties and celebrities help make final days of Urban Beach Week a blast", The Miami Herald, May 27, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fat Joe]],&lt;ref name="miamiherald4"/&gt; [[Marcia Griffiths]],&lt;ref name="miamiherald4"/&gt; and [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]].&lt;ref name="miamiherald4"/&gt;

== Local politics ==
Urban Beach Week has been a controversial event for the residents of South Beach.&lt;ref name="miamiherald3"/&gt; Violence and property crime associated with the event has turned many locals against the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/06/02/uncle-luke-co-founder-of-urban-beach-week-no-longer-attends-event/ |title=Uncle Luke, Co-Founder Of Urban Beach Week, No Longer Attends Event « CBS Miami |publisher=Miami.cbslocal.com |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; It was reported in the New York Times that many South Beach residents leave the area during Urban Beach Week.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Mayor [[Matti Herrera Bower]] has said the city doesn't have much ability to end Urban Beach Week, considering that the tourists who come for the Memorial weekend don't come for city permitted events, but for private concerts and parties.&lt;ref name="cbslocal1"&gt;[http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/06/02/police-gun-found-in-car-of-man-killed-during-urban-beach-week/ "Man Shot To Death By Police Wanted In Boynton Beach Shooting", CBS Miami, June 2, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy response ===
After a fatal shooting of an armed suspect by police in 2011, city leaders considered cutting back drinking hours or imposing a curfew; both ideas were considered unworkable. Also rejected was a plan to make the festival a city-sanctioned and organized event.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Instead, the city and the Police Department increased the turnout of law enforcement in 2012, with a tougher stance on minor infractions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Nearly 600 officers were on duty. Lanes were closed on the causeways leading to Miami Beach, and license plate readers were used to check for outstanding warrants, stolen cars and suspended licenses. Watch towers were put up to better observe the main promenade on Ocean Drive.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;
