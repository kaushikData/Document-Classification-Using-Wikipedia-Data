      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6669">'''African Americans''' (also referred to as '''Afro-Americans''' or '''Black Americans''') '''in [[France]]''' are people of [[African Americans|African American]] heritage or black people from the [[United States]] who are or have become residents or citizens of France, as well as students and temporary workers.

==African American migration to France==
African Americans, who are largely descended from Africans of the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial era]], have lived and worked in France since the 1800s. Unofficial figures indicate that up to 50,000 free blacks emigrated to Paris from Louisiana in the decades after Napoleon sold the territory to the United States in 1803.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt; [[Paris]] saw the beginnings of an African-American community in the aftermath of [[World War I]] when about 200,000 were brought over to fight. Ninety per cent of these soldiers were from the [[American South]].&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt; Many black GIs decided to stay in France after having been well received by the French, and others followed them. France was viewed by many African Americans as a welcome change from the widespread [[racism in the United States]]. It was during this time that [[jazz]] was introduced to the French and black culture was born in Paris. African American musicians, artists and [[Harlem Renaissance]] writers found 1920s Paris ready to embrace them with open arms. Montmartre became the center of the small community, with jazz clubs such as Le Grand Duc, Chez Florence and Bricktop's thriving in Paris. World War II brought all the fanfare to an abrupt halt. The German [[Nazi]] invasion of Paris in June 1940 meant suppression of the "corrupt" influence of jazz in the French capital and danger of imprisonment for African Americans choosing to remain in the city. Most Americans, black as well as white, left Paris at this time.

The political upheavals surrounding the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the  [[Vietnam War]] protests in the United States were mirrored by civil unrest in France. African-American journalist [[William Gardner Smith]] who was also a novelist (e.g., [[Last of the Conquerors]]), who worked for the French news service Agence France-Presse, reported the events of the student uprising in [[May 1968 protests in France|May 1968]]. Many blacks supported this movement, which escalated into a virtual shutdown of the entire country of France. Once order was restored however, a notable increase in repressive tendencies was observed in the French police and immigration authorities. In addition, the presence of newly arrived enclaves of blacks from many [[Africa]]n and [[Caribbean]] nations offer African Americans the chance to experience new forms of black culture .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverparis.net/newsletter.html?insight=3162993617777834|title=Newsletter|website=Discover Paris!|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

Tyler Stovall, a history professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many ways, African Americans came to France as a sort of privileged minority, a kind of model minority, if you will—a group that benefited not only from French fascination with blackness, but a French fascination about Americanness.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080123.PARIS23/TPStory/specialTravel&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Albanians}}
The [[Albanians|Albanian]] community in Egypt started by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rulers and military personnel appointed in the Egyptian province. A substantial community would grow up later by soldiers and mercenaries who settled in the second half of the 18th century and made a name for themselves in the Ottoman struggle to expel French troops in 1798–1801. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1769–1849) founded the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Albanian dynasty of Egypt]] which lasted there until 1952. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many other Albanians settled into Egypt for economical and political reasons. With the [[fedayeen]], [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and the culminating [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the Albanian community in Egypt diminished.

==Ottoman Era==
Since 1517, Egypt became an Ottoman province. An Ottoman ruler would be appointed in Cairo. The title ''"[[beylerbey]]"'' refers to the regular governors specifically appointed to the post by the Ottoman sultan, while the title ''"[[kaymakam]]"'', when used in the context of Ottoman Egypt, refers to an acting governor who ruled over the province between the departure of the previous governor and the arrival of the next one. Several of these were of Albanian descent, as well as many within the military and [[Bashi-bazouk|bashiazouk]] units. Between the most known were [[Dukakinzade Mehmed Pasha]],&lt;ref name="Winter35"&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koca Sinan Pasha]],&lt;ref name="Oztuna51"/&gt; [[Abdurrahman Abdi Arnavut Pasha]], and [[Mere Hüseyin Pasha]].&lt;ref name="Oztuna51"&gt;{{harvnb|Öztuna|1979|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;During and after the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]], the Ottomans would deploy many Albanian [[pasha]]s, [[bey]]s, military units, as well as auxiliary personnel. Some of them were [[Tahir Pasha (Egypt)|Tahir Pasha Pojani]] with his brothers Hasan Pasha, Dalip, Isuf, and Abdul Bey, [[Omer Pasha Vrioni]], Muharrem Bey Vrioni, Rustem Aga Shkodrani and so on.&lt;ref name="Asllani"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.albeu.com/opinion/shqiptaret-e-egjiptit-dhe-veprimtaria-atdhetare-e-tyre/1538/| language=Albanian|title=Shqiptarët e egjiptit dhe veprimtaria atdhetare e tyre|trans-title=Albanians of Egypt and their patriotic activity|author=Uran Asllani|publisher=Gazeta Metropol| date=2006-06-05| quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarechesme Halil Agha, commanding the [[Kavala]] Volunteer Contingent, would bring along his cousin, Muhammad (Mehmed) Ali, a young second rank commander.

==Muhammad Ali Era==
{{main article|Muhammad Ali dynasty}}

===Introduction===
[[File:Egypt under Muhammad Ali Dynasty map en.png|thumb|left|Egypt under Muhammad Ali Dynasty]]
Muhammad Ali was a commander in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army that was sent to drive [[Napoleon]]'s forces out of Egypt, but upon the [[France|French]] withdrawal, [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|seized power]] himself and forced the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] to recognize him as [[Wāli]], or Governor of Egypt in 1805. He traced his ancestry back to Ibrahim Aga, from [[Korca]], Albania, who had moved to [[Kavala]]. Demonstrating his grander ambitions, he took the title of [[Khedive]]; however, this was not sanctioned by the [[Sublime Porte]].

Muhammad Ali transformed [[Egypt]] into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying [[Ottoman Empire]]. He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing  various similarities to the Soviet strategies (without communism) conducted in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=217|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muhammad Ali summed up his vision for Egypt in this way:

{{quote|I am well aware that the [Ottoman] Empire is heading by the day toward destruction. ... On her ruins I will build a vast kingdom ... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.|Georges Douin, ed., ''Une Mission militaire française auprès de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Généraux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: Société Royale de Géographie d'Égypte, 1923), p.50}}
[[File:Muhammad Ali Dynasty portrait.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Portrait of Muhammad Ali Pasha in the [[Cairo Citadel]] museum]]

At the height of his power, Muhammad Ali and his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s military strength did indeed threaten the very existence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as he sought to supplant the [[Ottoman dynasty|Osman Dynasty]] with his own. Ultimately, the intervention of the [[Great Powers]] prevented Egyptian forces from marching on [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and henceforth, his dynasty's rule would be limited to [[Africa]], and [[Sinai]]. Muhammad Ali had conquered [[Sudan]] in the first half of his reign and Egyptian control would be consolidated and expanded under his successors, most notably Ibrahim Pasha's son [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma'il I]].

===Khedivate and British occupation===
{{further|Khedivate of Egypt}}
Though Muhammad Ali and his descendants used the title of [[Khedive]] (Viceroy) in preference to the lesser [[Wāli]], this was not recognized by the Porte until 1867 when [[Abdülâziz|Sultan Abdul-Aziz]] officially sanctioned its use by [[Isma'il Pasha]] and his successors. In contrast to his grandfather's policy of war against the Porte, Isma'il sought to strengthen the position of Egypt and Sudan and his dynasty using less confrontational means, and through a mixture of flattery and bribery, Isma'il secured official Ottoman recognition of Egypt and Sudan's virtual independence. This freedom was severely undermined in 1879 when the Sultan colluded with the Great Powers to depose Isma'il in favor of his son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tewfik]]. Three years later, Egypt and Sudan's freedom became little more than symbolic when the [[United Kingdom]] invaded and occupied the country, ostensibly to support Khedive Tewfik against his opponents in [[Ahmed Orabi]]'s nationalist government. While the Khedive would continue to rule over Egypt and Sudan in name, in reality, ultimate power resided with the British High Commissioner.

[[File:Ismail Pacha.JPG|thumb|right|Khedive Isma'il]]
In defiance of the Egyptians, the British proclaimed Sudan to be an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian Condominium]], a territory under joint British and Egyptian rule rather than an integral part of Egypt. This was continually rejected by [[Egyptians]], both in government and in the public at large, who insisted on the "unity of the Nile Valley", and would remain an issue of controversy and enmity between Egypt and Britain until Sudan's independence in 1956.

===Sultanate and Kingdom===
{{further|Sultanate of Egypt|Kingdom of Egypt}}
In 1914, Khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] sided with the Ottoman Empire which had joined the [[Central Powers]] in the [[World War I]], and was promptly deposed by the British in favor of his uncle [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]]. The legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty over Egypt and Sudan, which had for all intents and purposes ended in 1805, was officially terminated, Hussein Kamel was declared [[Sultan of Egypt|Sultan of Egypt and Sudan]], and the country became a British Protectorate. With nationalist sentiment rising, as evidenced by the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|revolution of 1919]], Britain [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|formally recognized]] Egyptian independence in 1922, and Hussein Kamel's successor, [[Fuad I of Egypt|Sultan Fuad I]], substituted the title of King for Sultan. However, British occupation and interference in Egyptian and Sudanese affairs persisted. Of particular concern to Egypt was Britain's continual efforts to divest Egypt of all control in Sudan. To both the King and the nationalist movement, this was intolerable, and the Egyptian Government made a point of stressing that Fuad and his son [[Farouk I of Egypt|King Farouk I]] were "King of Egypt '''and''' Sudan".

===Dissolution===
The reign of Farouk was characterized by ever increasing nationalist discontent over the British occupation, royal corruption and incompetence, and the disastrous [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. All these factors served to terminally undermine Farouk's position and paved the way for the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]]. Farouk was forced to abdicate in favor of his infant son Ahmed-Fuad who became [[Fuad II of Egypt|King Fuad II]], while administration of the country passed to the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] under [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. The infant king's reign lasted less than a year and on June 18, 1953, the revolutionaries abolished the monarchy and declared Egypt a [[republic]], ending a century and a half of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule.Emerging victorious from a war-triangle (Ottomans, [[Mamluks]], and his loyal troops), Mehmed Ali made good use of Albanian irregulars services as mercenaries and troops to bolster his reign. Albanian mercenaries, or [[Arnauts]], presented the backbone of Ali's army and were known as elite and undisciplined soldiers of the [[Ottoman Empire]] armies.&lt;ref name="Norris209210"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser92"&gt;{{harvnb|Fraser|2014|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carstens753"&gt;{{harvnb|Carstens|2014|p=753}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Wisconsin130"&gt;{{harvnb|University of Wisconsin|2002|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of Muhammad Ali in power, many of them would settle in Egypt and serve there. By 1815, the number of Albanian military was over 7000.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt; Albanian troops partook in the [[Wahhabi War|war against the Wahhabi movement]] in Arabia (1811-18) and in  the [[Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820–24|conquest of the Sudan]] (1820–24).&lt;ref name="FahmyPasha89"&gt;{{harvnb|Fahmy|2002|p=[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ID7-26p9G78C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=All+the+Pasha%27s+men:+Mehmed+Ali,+his+army+and+the+making+of+modern+Egypt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL6MSYstnXAhWCw7wKHeqGDmMQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=fame%20and%20prestige&amp;f=false 40],  [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ID7-26p9G78C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=All+the+Pasha%27s+men:+Mehmed+Ali,+his+army+and+the+making+of+modern+Egypt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL6MSYstnXAhWCw7wKHeqGDmMQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=dysentery&amp;f=false 89]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FahmyRuler30"&gt;{{harvnb|Fahmy|2012|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Albanian troops would diminish in 1823, when [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], Ali's son, would join the Ottoman armies in the [[Greek War of Independence]] along with circa 17,000 men, many of them Albanians.&lt;ref name="Cummins60"&gt;{{harvnb|Cummins|2009|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's dynasty would continue to rule Egypt until 1952.

==Albanian National Awakening and early 20th century==
Albanian immigration to Egypt continued throughout the 19th century, and indeed into the first three decades of the 20th century. By that time Egypt experienced a massive economic development and prosperity, French and British investments (i.e. the [[Suez Canal]]), modernization, and opportunity for entrepreneurship. The economical prosperity attracted many emigrants from the Albanian lands, mainly from [[Korçë]] and [[Kolonjë]] regions. With some exceptions, most of the figures were educated members of the [[Orthodoxy in Albania|Orthodox]] community from south Albania who stationed in the vicinity of the Greek communities. Some of them published articles in the Greek community newspapers as well, frequently polemizing regarding Albanian identity.&lt;ref name="Skoulidas15222528"&gt;{{harvnb|Skoulidas|2013}}. para. 15, 22, 25, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian community in Egypt, with their patriotic societies and publishing activities, played an important role in the Albanian national awakening at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Elsie125126"/&gt; The first Albanian society of Egypt was founded in 1875. It was named "Vëllazëria e Parë" (First Brotherhood) and was led by [[Thimi Mitko]].&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt;
[[File:Arnaut-in-Cairo.jpg|240px|thumb|An [[Albanians|Albanian]] in [[Cairo]]]]

Nationalist figures and writers such as Thimi Mitko, [[Spiro Dine]], [[Filip Shiroka]], [[Jani Vruho]], Nikolla Naço, Anastas Avramidhi, Thoma Kreini, [[Thoma Avrami]], Thanas Tashko, Stefan Zurani, [[Andon Zako Çajupi]], [[Mihal Zallari]], [[Milo Duçi]], [[Loni Logori]], [[Fan Noli]], [[Aleksander Xhuvani]], [[George Adamidi bey Frashëri|George Adamidis Frashëri]] and many others were all active in Egypt at some point in their careers. Some of them used it as temporary solution before moving to US or elsewhere, while some other settled permanently. Spiro Dine founded in 1881 the local branch of [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings]] in [[Shibin Al Kawm, Al Minufiyah|Shibin Al Kawm]], a precursor and lobbyist for the Albanian education which started with the Albanian School of Korçë.&lt;ref name="Elsie111"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2010|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers and collections would come out, including the successful ''Shkopi'' ("The stick"), ''Rrufeja'' ("The lightning"), ''Belietta Sskiypetare'' ("The Albanian Bee") and so on.&lt;ref name="Norris209210"/&gt; Many others would come out for a shorter time: Milo Duçi would publish the magazines ''Toska'' (The [[Tosks|Tosk]]) during 1901-02, ''Besa-Besë'' (Pledge for a pledge) during 1904-05 together with [[Thoma Avrami]], ''Besa'' ([[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]]) of 1905 which lasted for 6 issues and was printed by Al-Tawfik in Cairo,&lt;ref name="Blumi131132"/&gt; and newspapers ''Shqipëria'' (Albania) from October 1906 to February 1907, a daily of Cairo with the last two issues coming out in [[Maghagha]],&lt;ref name="Blumi131132"&gt;{{harvnb|Blumi|2012|pp=131–132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the weekly ''Bisedimet'' (The discussions) of 1925-26 with 60 issues in total, which would be the last Albanian-language newspaper in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt; Aleksander Xhuvani published the newspaper ''Shkreptima'' (The lightning) in 1912 in Cairo. In 1922, Duçi established also the [[publishing company]] ''Shtëpia botonjëse shqiptare/Société Albanaise d'édition'' (Albanian Publishing House).&lt;ref name="Blumi205"&gt;{{harvnb|Blumi|2011|p=205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Albanian organizations were: "Vëllazëria Shqiptare" (Albanian Fraternity) founded on 1 My 1894 in [[Beni-Suef]], and "Bashkimi" (The union) which was found everywhere in Albanian populated areas and diaspora. It was an Albanian high official in Egypt, who sponsored the [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Aida]]'' in [[Khedivial Opera House]] in 1871.&lt;ref name="Trix107"&gt;{{harvnb|Trix|2009|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, with the initiative of Mihal Turtulli, Jani Vruho, and Thanas Tashko, the Albanian community send a promemorium to the [[Peace congress#Second Hague Conference|Second Hague Conference for Peace]], demanding support for the civic rights of the Albanian population under the oppression of [[Abdul Hamid II]]. Thanas Tashko would represent the community in the [[Congress of Manastir]] of 1908,&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt; while Loni Logori in the [[Congress of Elbasan]] of 1909. Another prominent Albanian, [[Fan Noli]], would settle shortly in Egypt. Vruho and Tashko convinced him to move to [[US]], and supported him financially. Another memorandum was signed with the initiative of Andon Zako and was sent to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]]. In 1924, a regrouping of the Albanian clubs and societies was done in Cario, under a unique society named "Lidhja e Shqiptarve te Egjiptit" (The League of the Albanians of Egypt), with Jani Vruho as chairman.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt; More societies would follow; "Shoqerija Mireberse" (Benefactor Society) of Hipokrat Goda from Korçë established in 1926, and "Shoqeria e Miqeve" (Friends' Club) of Andon Zako in 1927. Thoma Kreini founded the "Tomorri" society, hoping to publish a newspaper with the same name but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt; An Albanian school operated during 1934-1939, initially supported by the "Shpresa" (Hope) society founded by Stathi Ikonomi, and later by the exiled [[King Zog I]].&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt; Evangjel Avramushi established in 1940 the first [[Film studio|cinematographic studio]] in Egypt, named "AHRAM". The Albanian [[Bektashi order|Bektashi]] community had its own ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]'' in Egypt,&lt;ref name="Norris209210"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|pp=209–210}}. "This was an age when Albanians and Bosnians were posted to garrisons within the Nile regions, and furthermore the bulk of the Albanian troops were uncultured, exceedingly unruly, and often hated. Yet the dynasty that Muhammad ‘Alī established, the affection it had for Albanians and received from them, and the haven it afforded to them as exiles from Ottoman control, victimisation by Greek neighbours, or the sheer misery of Balkan poverty, meant that in time Alexandria, Cairo, Beni Suef and other Egyptian towns would harbour Albanians who organised associations, published newspapers and above all wrote works in verse and prose that include significant masterpieces of modern Albanian literature. Within al-Azhar and the two ''Baktāshi tekkes'' in Cairo, Qaṣr al-’Aynī and Kajgusez Abdullah Megavriu, Albanians and Balkan contemporaries were to find inspiration for a mystical quest, and artistic and literary stimulus, that sent ripples, as on a pond, throughout Albanian and Egyptian circles in Cairo and distantly and remotely in towns of Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia. Some of the outstanding literary figures of modern Albanian literature — for example, Thimi Mitko (d. 1890), the author of collections of Albanian folksongs, folk-tales and sayings, in his ''The Albanian Bee'' (''Bleta Shqypëtare''), Spiro Dine (d. 1922) in his ''Waves of the Sea'' (''Valët e detit'') and Andon Zako Çajupi (1866-1930) in his ''Baba Tomorri'' (Cairo, 1902) and his Skanderbeg drama — although they lived in Egypt for much of their lives, were essentially nationalists and not much influenced by the Islamic way of life that they saw around them. If anything, the rural arid peasant life in Egypt acted as a spur to their absorption in popular traditions which, in their view, enshrined the soul of their people. The Albanians in Egypt were, without a doubt, influenced by the Egyptian theatre — but specifically by those elements not overtly infused with Islamic sentiments. Later writers became prominent figures among the Albanian community in Cairo. Milo Duçi (Duqi) (d. 1933) did so because of his office as president of the national ‘Brethren’ league (''Villazëria/Ikhwa''), and by his Albanian newspapers (''al-‘Ahd'', 1900, known in Egypt as ''al-Aḥādīth'', 1925). He also wrote plays, especially ‘The Saying’ (''E Thëna'', 1922) and ‘The Bey's Son’ (1923), and a novel ''Midis dy grash'' (Between two women, 1923). More recently still, it has been secular and Arab nationalist causes such as Palestine and Algeria that have inspired Albanian Egyptian writers."&lt;/ref&gt; the famed "Magauri tekke" on the outskirts of Cairo, which was headed by Baba Ahmet Sirri Glina of [[Përmet]].&lt;ref name="Elsie125126"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2010|pp=125–126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tekke would be visited frequently by [[King Faruk]]. [[Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein]], Princess Zeynepe, daughter of [[Isma'il Pasha]], Princess Myzejen Zogolli, sister of King Zog I were some of the notables who were buried there.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt;

==Discrimination==
Immediately afterwards - with the seizure of power by [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]] and the subsequent nationalist [[Arabization]] policy in [[Egypt]].
Many [[Albanians]] left [[Egypt]] for [[Albania]] and the [[United States]]. Many [[Albanians|Albanian]] families who decided to stay in [[Egypt]] were partly assimilated and partly killed from the Army of [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]].

A few Albanian kept coming to Egypt throughout [[World War II]] and afterwards, most of them doing so to escape the [[Communism in Albania|Communist regime in Albania]] established on November 1944. Names would include [[Baba Rexheb]], a Bektashi monk, former minister [[Mirash Ivanaj]], [[Branko Merxhani]], and even the former King [[Ahmet Zogu]] with his family. After King Zog and the Albanian royal family were forced out of Albania during the war, they took up residence in Egypt from 1946 to 1955 and were received by [[King Farouk]] who reigned during 1936–1952, himself a descendant of Mehmed Ali Pasha.  The presence of this Albanian community lasted in Egypt until [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] came to power. 
With the advent of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Arab nationalization of Egypt, not only the royal family but also the entire Albanian community of around 4,000 families became the targets of hostility. They were forced to leave the country, thus closing the Albanian chapter in Egypt. Most of the Bektashi community moved to [[United States|U.S.]] or [[Canada]]. Baba Rexheb established the first Albanian-American Bektashi monastery in the [[Detroit]] suburb of Taylor.&lt;ref name="Curtis83"&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2010|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise in power of [[Anwar Sadat]], the stance toward Albanians changed, but just a few from the exiled families returned to Egypt.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt; In recent times the number of people estimated to be of Albanian heritage in Egypt is 18,000.&lt;ref name="Saunders98"&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2011|p=98}}. "Egypt also lays claim to some 18,000 Albanians, supposedly lingering remnants of Mohammad Ali's army."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Koral''' (1897 – 1968) was an American member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) who headed a network of spies for [[NKVD|Soviet intelligence]] during [[World War II]] called the "Art" or "Berg" group.  Koral's wife, [[Helen Koral]], also was involved with the group.

==Background==

Koral was born in London on April 18, 1897.&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;

==Career==

Koral began to work for New York City's Board of Education in 1926 as an engineer.  By 1948, he was assistant engineer of construction.&lt;ref name=hearing /&gt;

=== FBI surveillance ===
The [[FBI]] first detected Koral in 1941 while surveiling [[Gaik Ovakimian]], whom the FBI did not realize at the time was the head of [[KGB]] operations in the United States. The FBI noted Ovakimian meeting several times with Koral, though no espionage could be proved.

After the War, in 1947, Koral confessed, when confronted by the FBI, that he was a courier for the KGB from 1939 to 1945.  Koral told the FBI he was paid two thousand dollars to travel to different cities to pick up and deliver small packages and envelopes to different persons, including [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]] and [[Helen Silvermaster]]. In December 1945, Koral had been sent to tell Silvermaster “no more visits would be made to him”, at the time of [[Elizabeth Bentley]]'s defection and the Soviet networks were being compromised.  Koral identified [[Semyon Semenov]] as one of his contacts in Soviet intelligence to whom he had delivered materials.&lt;ref name=hearing /&gt;

Koral was also a contact of [[Michael Whitney Straight|Michael Straight]].  Koral's code name in the Soviet intelligence, and as deciphered in the venona decrypts is "Berg".&lt;ref name=hearing /&gt;

===Public exposure===

On August 8, 1948, the ''Washington Post'' reported:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The curtain will rise again Monday morning [April 9, 1948] on Washington's current spy thriller when the House Committee on Un-American Activities calls upon two key witnesses to tell the public what they know of Communist espionage here...  One witness will be [[Victor Perlo]]...  The other will be Alexander Koral, described by Chairman [[Karl Mundt]] (R., S. Dak.) as a former "contact" man between New York and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;

On August 10, 1948, the ''Washington Post'' reported:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Two ashen-faced men stood up in the crowded caucus room of the Old House Office Building and were confronted by Miss [[Elizabeth Bentley|Elizabeth T. Bentley]], confessed courier for Communist underground...  Both men, on the advice of counsel, refused to say whether or not they knew Ms. Bentely on the ground that an answer might tend to incriminate them...  One was [[Victor Perlo]]...  The other was Alexander Koral, a 51-year-old maintenance man employed by the New York City Board of Education, who was reminded when he was on the stand that he had already signed a confession to Government authorities of his part in a Washington-New York spy circuit.  Koral refused to affirm or deny that he had made such a confession, and he refused to say on grounds of self-incrimination whether or not he is now or ever had been a Communist...  Investigator Louis J. Russell, former FBI agent, took the stand... "Koral... had a sone who was ill and had a large amount of hospital and medical bills."  Koral was linked by Russell to [[Nathan Silvermaster|Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Bakumpai''' or '''Baraki''' are indigenous people of [[Borneo]] and are considered as a sub-ethnic group of the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] [[Ngaju people]] group&lt;ref name="Tjilik Riwut &amp; Nila Riwut 2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tjilik Riwut &amp; Nila Riwut|title=Kalimantan Membangun, Alam, Dan Kebudayaan|year=2007|publisher=NR Pub|isbn=979-23-9952-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Islamic background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fridolin Ukur|title=Tuaiannya Sungguh Banyak: Sejarah Gereja Kalimantan Evangelis Sejak Tahun 1835|year=2000|publisher=BPK Gunung Mulia|isbn=979-9290-58-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bakumpai people first occupy along the [[Barito River|Barito]] riverbanks in [[South Kalimantan]] and [[Central Kalimantan]], from Marabahan to Puruk Cahu, [[Murung Raya Regency]]. The Bakumpai people first appeared as a newly recognized people group in census 2000 and were made up of 7.51% of [[Central Kalimantan]] population, which before this the Bakumpai people were considered as part of the [[Dayak people]] in a 1930 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Riwanto Tirtosudarmo|title=Mencari Indonesia: Demografi-Politik Pasca-Soeharto|year=2007|publisher=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|isbn=979-799-083-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakumpai people originate from the upstream region of the former Bakumpai district, while the settlement of the Barangas people (Baraki) are in the downstream region. On the northern side of the upstream region from the former Bakumpai district is the Mangkatib (Mengkatib) district, which makes the settlement of the Dayak Bara Dia people or Dayak Mengkatib people. The Bakumpai people as well as the Mengkatib people are descendants of the [[Ngaju people]] from Tanahdayak.

==Etymology==
The name "Bakumpai" is a nickname for [[Dayak people]] who live along the [[Barito River]]banks. In the [[Banjar language]], Bakumpai comes from the word ''ba'' which means "own" and ''kumpai'' which means "grass". From this nickname, it is understood that this people dwell in the grassland region.

===Mythology===
According to legend, the origins of the Bakumpai Dayaks came from [[Ngaju people]] who settled on the current land which is called Marabahan. In the beginning, they practice [[Kaharingan]], the religion of their ancestors, which can be seen as well in the cultures of other [[Dayak people]]. Later, they came across a charismatic man in that land, whom could cause the ground that he stood on to grow grass. That man is none other than Nabiyullah Khidir. In the story, they followed him and converted to [[Islam]], and multiplied into a group of people. When they studied religion in a particular region together with their teacher, Nabiyullah Khidir, grass would begin to grow from the ground and thus they are referred to as Bakumpai people.

The Bakumpai people once had a kingdom that is much older than the kingdoms of the [[Banjar people|Banjar]] region, but because of supernatural abilities the kingdom had to be relocated to the [[Barito River]] and its king is known with the name ''Datuk Barito''. From Marabahan, they spread to the streams of [[Barito River]]. According to local folklore, there is an area in [[Murung Raya Regency]] called Muara Untu where in the beginning it was a jungle controlled by a race of [[jinn]] named ''Untu''. Later there was a Bakumpai man named, Raghuy who traveled and lived there. Until today if observed from the lineage of the Muara Untu people, they would trace their ancestors to Raghuy.

==Culture==
The Bakumpai people have been greatly influenced by the language, culture, customary laws and architecture of the [[Banjar people]]. Hence the Bakumpai people in terms of culture and customary laws are classified as part of [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] culture, but in linguistic terms the Bakumpai are closely related to the [[Ngaju people]]. They speak [[Bakumpai language]].

Almost all Bakumpai people practices [[Islam]] and [[Kaharingan]], the traditional belief of the [[Dayak people]] is relatively unseen compared to other [[Dayak people]] groups. Customary ceremonies that are related to old beliefs are such as ''Badewa'' and ''Manyanggar Lebu'' rituals.

==Lineage==
Bakumpai people are considered as a sub-ethnic of the [[Ngaju people]]. The [[Ngaju people]] are one of the four people group from a bigger familial group also called as the Dayak Ngaju or [[Ot Danum people]]. This people group is also known as [[Ot Danum people|Dayak Ot Danum]], as the [[Ngaju people]] are the descendants of the Dayak [[Ot Danum people]] that came from the upstream rivers that are found in the region but may have undergone changes in their language. Therefore, the Dayak [[Ot Danum people]] is considered as the parent tribe, but the [[Ngaju people]] is still the dominant ethnic in the region.&lt;ref name="Tjilik Riwut &amp; Nila Riwut 2007"/&gt;

The tribal genealogy of the Bakumpai people:-
* [[Dayak people]] (the originator) divided into primary ethnics:
** Sea Dayaks or [[Iban people]]
** [[Bidayuh|Land Dayaks]]
** [[Apo Kayan people|Dayak Apo Kayan]] or [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]]-[[Bahau people]]
** [[Murut people]]
** Ngaju people or Dayak [[Ot Danum people]], divides into four sub-ethnic groups:
*** [[Ma'anyan people]]
*** [[Lawangan people]]
*** [[Dusun people]]
*** [[Ngaju people]], divides into smaller sub-ethnics:
**** Bakumpai people
**** [[Meratus Dayak|Meratus people]]
**** and many more.

The relationship comparison of the Bakumpai people and the [[Ngaju people]] is liken to the relationship of the [[Tenggerese people]] and the [[Javanese people]], where the [[Ngaju people]] is the parent ethnic of the Bakumpai people.

==Population==
The population of the Bakumpai people in [[Indonesia]] is 171,000. In a 2000 census, the population of the Bakumpai people in [[South Kalimantan]] is 20,609. In [[South Kalimantan]], they mostly found in [[Barito Kuala Regency]] with a population of 18,892.&lt;ref name="BPS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">The '''British Juggling Convention''' (also known as The BJC) is an annual [[Juggling convention]] held in a different town or city in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] every year. The event usually takes place in the [[Easter]] school holiday, usually lasting from the Wednesday to Sunday. The event is for all forms of [[juggling]] and object manipulation, plus many other [[circus]] skills. The BJC usually features many [[Workshop (juggling)|workshops]], talks and shows during the day, [[renegade show]]s at night, and a public show on the Saturday.

The next British Juggling Convention will be held on 10th - 14th April, 2019, in Nottingham.

'''Cambodians in France''' consist of ethnic [[Khmer people|Khmer]] people who were born in or immigrated to [[France]]. The population as of 2011 was estimated to be about 10,000, making the community one of the largest in the Cambodian diaspora.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;[http://www.international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/sites/international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/IMG/pdf/cambodge_fiche_pays.pdf Cambodge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181204/http://www.international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/sites/international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/IMG/pdf/cambodge_fiche_pays.pdf# |date=2014-04-16 }}, Chambre de Commerce Franco-Cambogiene (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambodian population in France is the most established outside Southeast Asia, with a presence dating to well before the [[Vietnam War]] and subsequent [[Indochina refugee crisis]].

==History==
Cambodian immigration to France began in the latter half of the 19th century, when Cambodia became a [[French protectorate of Cambodia|French protectorate]]. The first wave of migrants largely consisted of students and workers belonging to the country's elite class, including members of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Montagnon]], ''La France coloniale'', tome 1, Pygmalion-Gérard Watelet, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], soldiers and civilians in the [[French colonial empire]] were recruited to help with the war effort in [[Metropolitan France]]. About 2,000 Cambodians arrived in France during the conflict period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most Cambodians arrived in France as refugees as a result of their country's heavy turmoil during the latter half of the 20th century. Following the [[Khmer Rouge]] takeover in 1976, a small number of Cambodians were able to flee their country and arrive in France with the French government's assistance.&lt;ref name="specter"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective|first=Robert|last=Gellately|first2=Ben|last2=Kiernan|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A much larger influx of refugees arrived in France during the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]] that resulted in the collapse of the Khmer Rouge and end of the [[Cambodian Genocide]] in the 1980s.

Roughly 50,000 Cambodian refugees arrived in France by 1989. France was an ideal destination for Cambodians who were educated or already had [[family reunification|family present in the country]], while poorer and uneducated refugees tended to immigrate to the [[United States]] and [[Australia]]. The final wave of refugees arrived in the late 1990s, when the last refugee camps closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Cambodia-Diaspora-Role-2007-French.pdf Le rôle de la diaspora dans la justice transitionnelle : L'exemple du Cambodge] Mey, Elyda, International Center for Transparent Justice, July 2007 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Vietnamese people in France|Vietnamese]], [[Laotians in France|Laotian]] and [[Chinese diaspora in France|ethnic Chinese]] populations in France, Cambodian refugees from conflicts in [[Indochina]] arrived relatively later compared to their peers, and had a harder time finding government assistance.&lt;ref name="refugees"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and demographics==
The Cambodian French population is concentrated in [[Paris]] and the surrounding [[Île-de-France]] region, as well as in [[Lyon]] and the [[Rhône-Alpes]] region.&lt;ref name="refugees"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Cambodian communities in the [[Cambodian American|United States]], [[Cambodian Canadian|Canada]] and [[Cambodian Australian|Australia]], the Cambodian population in France is on average, more educated, older and has a much higher average income.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Drinking during pregnancy: Practices of Cambodian refugees in France and the United States|last=D'Avanzo|first=Carolyn E.|first2=Sasha A. |last2=Barab|journal=Health Care for Women International|volume=21|issue=4|publisher=Routledge|pages=319–334(16)|date=June 2000|doi=10.1080/073993300245177}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the community is still attached to its country of origin in some cultural spheres, Cambodians in France have largely integrated into French society.  Although Cambodia lost over 3.8 million educated citizens in its civil war, the remaining Cambodians managed to achieve a [[model minority]] image; and despite having income and education levels higher than other Cambodian diaspora communities, the average &lt;sup&gt;[the average what?]&lt;/sup&gt; for the community is lower than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gavroche-thailande.com/actualites/cambodge/1784-quand-les-khmers-de-france-ne-font-plus-rever-le-cambodge Quand les Khmers de France ne font plus rêver le Cambodge] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism plays an important role in the community and is seen as a marker of ethnic identity; in contrast, the ability to speak the [[Khmer language]] is less emphasized. Though immigrant parents set up language schools for their children soon after migration, many children discontinued their language studies due to the difficulty of learning [[Khmer grammar]] and the Sanskrit-based [[Khmer alphabet]].&lt;ref name="Simon2004"/&gt;

Numerically, the Khmer are the dominant group among Cambodians in France, but [[Chinese Cambodian|Cambodians of Chinese descent]] can also be found among the population; though interethnic marriages between Chinese and Khmers were common in Cambodia and remain so in France, the Chinese they have tended to organise themselves around the [[varieties of Chinese|varieties they speak]] and remain somewhat separate from other Cambodians in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Christiansen|first=Flemming|chapter=Southeast Asia to France|title=Chinatown, Europe: An Exploration of Overseas Chinese Identity in the 1990s|publisher=Routledge|pages=56–59|year=2003|isbn=0-7007-1072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of Cambodians in France consist of the wives and mixed-race children of French colonisers who repatriated to France between 1955 and 1965; regardless of their ethnicity, many of those used Khmer rather than French as their [[home language]].&lt;ref name="Simon2003"&gt;{{citation|chapter=Assimilation and ethnic diversity in France|editor-first=D.|editor-last=Juteau|editor2-first=C.|editor2-last=Hartzig|title=The Social Construction of Diversity: Recasting the Social Narrative of Industrial Nations|location=New York/Oxford|publisher=Berghan Books|pages=15–39|last=Simon-Barouh|first=Ida|year=2003|isbn=1571813756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age of marriage laws ==
{{main|Age of marriage in the United States}}

In the United States, the laws on [[marriageable age]] are largely left up to the various [[U.S. state|state]] governments, [[territories of the United States|territory]] governments, and the federal [[District of Columbia]].

===In the 50 states===
The general age of marriage is 18 in every state, with the exception of [[Nebraska]] (19) and [[Mississippi]] (21).

However, every state except [[Delaware]] and [[New Jersey]] allows exceptions to their general age of marriage in one or more of the following cases:

* Consent of a court clerk or judge (sometimes the consent of a superior court judge, rather than a local judge, is required)
* Consent of the parents or legal guardians of the minor
* If one of the parties is pregnant
* If the minor has given birth to a child
* If the minor is [[emancipated minor|emancipated]]

So, given one or more of these exceptions, as of October 2018:

* '''18 states''' have no minimum age of marriage in some cases.
* '''2 states''' have a minimum age of 14.
* '''5 states''' have a minimum age of 15.
* '''19 states''' have a minimum age of 16.
* '''6 states''' have a minimum age of 17.

===Comparison with other countries===
Critics have pointed out that laws regarding child marriage in the United States compare unfavorably to laws regarding child marriage in other countries. For instance, in 2017, [[Human Rights Watch]] pointed out that [[Afghanistan]] has a tougher law on child marriage than parts of the United States: in Afghanistan the minimum marriage is 15, and that only with permission from their father or a judge; otherwise it is 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/20/afghanistan-has-tougher-law-child-marriage-florida|title=Afghanistan Has a Tougher Law on Child Marriage than Florida|date=20 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of that date, in 25 US states there was no minimum marriage age at all if one or more of the grounds for exception existed; this number has now decreased to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/united-states/|title=United States - Child Marriage Around The World.

== Causes and consequences of child marriage ==
{{Main|Child marriage#Causes of child marriage|Child marriage#Consequences of child marriage}}

===Forced marriage and sex trafficking===
{{Main|Sex trafficking in the United States#Forced marriages}}
In some cases, child marriage may happen (either legally or informally) and constitute a [[forced marriage]], often in the context of [[sex trafficking]].

== Legal status of a married minor ==
In many states, minors automatically achieve [[emancipated minor|emancipated status]] once they get married
&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/automatic-emancipation-of-minors.html|title=Automatic Emancipation of Minors - FindLaw|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore are theoretically  considered adults, so that they can file for a restraining order, get a divorce, and benefit from social services.&lt;ref&gt;[[California Codes|Family Code]] § [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;sectionNum=7002. 7002], also known as the Emancipation of Minors Law, enacted by [[California Statutes|Stats.]] [http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1992/92Vol1_Statutes.PDF#page=464 1992, Ch. 162], § 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice such minors may still encounter difficulties, as many institutions do not deal with youth under 18, or require [[parental consent]].

If minors are not emancipated, they may find themselves locked into the marriages, unable to leave or divorce an abusive spouse.&lt;ref name=Worse-than-Weinstein&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-viewpoint-florida-child-marriage-20171024-story.html|title=Worse than Weinstein is the exploitation of Florida girls|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|author=Amanda Parker|date=October 24, 2017|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=masslegal&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; About 80 percent of teenage marriages end in divorce, but many minors locked in a marriage contract must wait years before they are old enough to be able to legally end the marriage.&lt;ref name=Worse-than-Weinstein/&gt; Massachusetts is one such state where minors are not automatically emancipated upon getting married.&lt;ref name=masslegal&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underage marriage and sexual consent ==
{{main|Age of consent in the United States}}

In the United States, the [[age of sexual consent]] ranges from 16 to 18 depending on state, territory/district or federal law.

In some states, it is possible for a minor to legally marry even if they are below the age of sexual consent in that state. Between 2000 and 2015, at least 200,000 minors were legally married in the US. 86% of these marriages were to an adult. About 5% of the minors were aged 15 and under meaning they would be under the age of sexual consent anywhere in the USA.&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; State laws on age of sexual consent and age of marriage are very inconsistent. In some cases, judges who approve underage marriages are approving a marriage between a rapist and their victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/child-marriage-state-laws_us_59a5e70ee4b00795c2a27e19|date=August 31, 2017|access-date=November 23, 2018|publisher=''The Huffington Post''|title=Grown Men Are Exploiting Loopholes In State Laws To Marry Children|website=www.huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
===National statistics===
Statistics released by the [[Pew Research Center]] show that nearly 5 in every 1,000 15–17 year olds in the United States are married - a rate of 1 in 200.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/01/child-marriage-is-rare-in-the-u-s-though-this-varies-by-state/|title=Child marriage is rare in the U.S., though this varies by state|date=2016-11-01|newspaper=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unchained At Last]], an organization dedicated to ending forced and child marriage in the United States, found that more than 167,000 children were married between 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/10/why-does-the-united-states-still-let-12-year-old-girls-get-married/|title=Perspective {{!}} Why can 12-year-olds still get married in the United States?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the correlation between population and incidence of child marriage, they estimated that nearly 248,000 children were married in the US during that time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Please note that incidence refers to the total amount, while rate refers to the amount per capita (adjusted for population).

===State statistics===
Child marriage is generally more common in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Pew Research Center, the highest incidence of child marriages is in [[West Virginia]], [[Texas]], [[Nevada]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Arkansas]], [[California]], Tennessee, and [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]] and Unchained At Last, the states with the highest rates (not incidence) of child marriage in 2010 were: [[Idaho]], [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], Texas, [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Kentucky]], West Virginia and [[Missouri]]. Meanwhile the states with the lowest rates were Delaware, New Jersey, [[Montana]], [[Indiana]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and Massachusetts. However, data was not available for 10 states including [[California]], North Carolina, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Florida]], 16,400 children, some as young as 13, were married from 2000-2017, which is the second highest incidence of child marriage after Texas.&lt;ref name="Worse-than-Weinstein" /&gt;
* In Texas from 2000 to 2014, almost 40,000 children were married.&lt;ref name=refinerytexaschildmarriage&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alstats8600&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/child_marriage_is_still_legal.html|title=Child marriage is still legal in Alabama, but on the decline|date=9 August 2017 |website=al.com|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the state of New York, more than 3,800 children were married between 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-legislation-ending-child-marriage-new-york|title=Governor Cuomo Signs Legislation Ending Child Marriage in New York|date=2017-06-20|publisher=''[[Governor of New York]]''|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Virginia (state)|Virginia]] between 2004 and 2013, nearly 4,500 children were married according to the Tahirh Justice Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tahirih.org/news/child-marriage-happens-in-the-u-s-too/|title=Child Marriage in America: Current Laws Are Failing to Protect Vulnerable Children and Teens «  Tahirih Justice Center|website=www.tahirih.org|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Alabama there was over 8,600 child marriages from 2000 to 2015, the fourth highest amount of any state. However, child marriage in Alabama showed a large decline in that time. In 2000, almost 1,200 children married, but by 2014 it dropped to 190.&lt;ref name=alstats8600&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of participants===
Unchained At Last found that only 14% of the child marriages conducted from 2000 to 2010 were between two children marrying each other&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baynes|first1=Chris|title=More than 200,000 children married in US over the last 15 years|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/200000-children-married-us-15-years-child-marriage-child-brides-new-jersey-chris-christie-a7830266.html|accessdate=24 October 2017|publisher=''The Independent''|date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In most cases, child marriages are to adults aged 18-21, however at least 31% were to an adult 21 or older.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

In over 400 cases, the adult was aged over 40. And in 31 cases, they were over 60. In 2010 in [[Idaho]], a 65-year-old man married a 17-year-old girl. In [[Alabama]], a 74-year-old man married a 14-year-old girl, though the state has since raised their minimum age to 16.&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frontline, who looked at almost 200,000 cases of child marriage from 2000-2015:

* 67% of the children were aged 17.
* 29% of the children were aged 16.
* 4% of the children were aged 15.
* &lt;1% of the children were aged 14 and under.
* Overall there were 51 cases of 13-year-olds getting married, and 6 cases of 12-year-olds getting married.&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Unchained At Last, the youngest girls to marry in 2000-2010 were three [[Tennessee]] 10-year-old girls who married men aged 24, 25 and 31 in 2001. The youngest boy was an 11-year-old who married a 27-year-old woman in the same state in 2006.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

===Poverty and rural areas===
Child marriage researcher Nicholas Syrett was quoted in a Frontline article: ''“Almost all the evidence indicates that girls in cities don’t get married young, that girls from middle class or wealthy families, don’t get married young,” Syrett said. “This is a [[Rural_areas_in_the_United_States|rural]] phenomenon and it is a phenomenon of [[Poverty_in_the_United_States|poverty]].”''&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and gender===
U.S.-born [[African Americans|black]] girls are about 1.5 times more likely to marry underage than U.S-born [[white Americans|white]] girls.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/child-marriage-is-still-legal-in-the-us-88846|title=Child marriage is still legal in the US|last=Syrett|first=Nicholas|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young females are more likely to be married than young males.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; According to statistics released by the Pew Research Center (based upon the [[American Community Survey]]) 55% of those married at ages of 15–17 are female;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to a Frontline article, 87% of the minors who got married in 2000-2015 were girls.&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country of birth===
U.S.-born white children of U.S.-born parents, are more likely to marry underage than [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the U.S.]] or the children of immigrants. This was true even in the 1920s at the height of immigration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This shows that child marriage is not a recent phenomenon, and it is not something that has only been introduced by recent immigrants.

== Recent changes to laws==
===Federal law===
In 2013, the [[Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013|Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act]] mandated that the [[US Secretary of State]] must "establish and implement a multi-year, multi-sectoral strategy to end child marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/united-states/|title=United States - Child Marriage Around The World. Girls Not Brides|last=Brides|first=Girls Not|newspaper=Girls Not Brides|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. territories===
;American Samoa
In 2018, girls' age of marriage was raised to 18, putting it in line with that of boys.
In September 2018, governor Lolo Moliga signed into law a bill changing the marriage age for girls from 14 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/366260/governor-moliga-signs-into-law-bill-to-increase-marriage-age-for-girls|title=Governor Moliga signs into law bill to increase marriage age for girls|date=2018-09-12|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. States===
;Alabama
In 2003, Alabama raised the minimum age for marriage (ie: with exceptions) from 14 to 16. A similar bill had previously failed to pass in 2001.&lt;ref name=alstats8600&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

;Arizona
In April 2018, [[Arizona]] passed a law which raised the minimum age to 16, and stipulated the following conditions: must be approved by a superior court, must have either parental consent or an emancipated minor, the older party must not be more than 3 years older than the younger party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/stateline/arizona-sets-minimum-age-marriage-minors|title=Arizona Sets Minimum Age for Marriage of Minors|publisher=''Chronicle of Social Change''|date=August 13, 2018|access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;California
In California, in 2017, a bill to that would have ended child marriage (by raising the minimum age to 18) ran into opposition from legislators, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Effort-to-bar-juvenile-marriages-in-California-11268497.php|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|title=Effort to bar child marriage in California runs into opposition|date=July 6, 2017|author=Jill Tucker|access-date=13 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, a law was passed (effective 1 Jan 2019) which requires the parents and partners of minors wishing to marry, to meet with court official separately to determine if there is any coercion. Additionally, minors will now have to wait 30 days to get married, unless they are 17 and have completed high school, or one of the partners is pregnant. However, there is still no minimum age for children to marry, if these conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/22/underage-marriages-get-new-restrictions-in-california/|title=Underage marriages get new restrictions in California|publisher=''The Mercury News''|date=September 22, 2018|access-date=13 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Connecticut
On 1 October 2017, [[Connecticut]] passed a law raising the minimum marriage age to 16, as well as requiring both parental and judicial consent for minors to marry.

;Delaware
In May 2018, [[Delaware]] became the first state to completely ban child marriage. The marriage age in Delaware is now 18, with no exceptions. Prior to this, Delaware had no minimum age for marriage with parental consent and a judge's approval.&lt;ref name=CNNDelaware&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

;Florida
In early 2018, [[Florida]] passed and signed a law to amend its marriage laws,&lt;ref name="flsenate.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2018/00140|title=Senate Bill 140 (2018) - The Florida Senate|website=www.flsenate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; after having received intense media attention for its lax child marriage law and the high toleration of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/opinion/sunday/it-was-forced-on-me-child-marriage-in-the-us.html|title=11 Years Old, a Mom, and Pushed to Marry Her Rapist in Florida|date=26 May 2017|publisher=''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 1, 2018, the minimum marriage age is 17, and 17-year-olds need both parental and judicial approval and may not marry anyone more than 2 years older.&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The new law was passed after sustained lobbying from a former victim of child marriage, [[Sherry Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/child-marriage-banned-florida-minimum-age-17-campaign-rape-victim-a8249341.html|title=Florida to finally ban child marriage|date=10 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Kentucky
In March 2018, [[Kentucky]] amended its marriage laws. After several failed attempts at restricting child marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yetter|first1=Deborah|title=Kentucky's 'child bride' bill stalls as groups fight to let 13-year-olds wed|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/03/kentuckys-child-bride-bill-stalls-groups-fight-let-13-year-olds-wed/391697002/|accessdate=3 March 2018|publisher=''USA Today''|date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a redrafted bill was introduced, passed all stages of the [[Kentucky Legislature]], and was signed by the [[Governor of Kentucky]] in March 2018. The new law sets a minimum age of 17, with judicial approval.

;Missouri
In July 2018 [[Missouri]] raised the minimum age for marriage from 15 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MO SB655 2018 Regular Session|url=https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/SB655/2018|website=legiscan.com|access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;New Jersey
Since June 2018, the [[New Jersey]] child marriage ban bill was signed into law by the [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Phil Murphy]] and went into effect immediately to implement a clear minimum age of 18 with no exceptions.&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://6abc.com/politics/new-jersey-governor-signs-law-banning-underage-marriage/3637983/|title=New Jersey governor signs law banning underage marriage|date=22 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes New Jersey the second state to completely ban child marriage, after Delaware.

In May 2017, a similar bill was vetoed by Governor [[Chris Christie]] due to "religious concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trafficking-childmarriage/u-s-governor-rejects-measure-to-ban-child-marriage-idUSKBN1872VB|title=U.S. governor rejects measure to ban child marriage|last=|first=|date=2017-05-11|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[New York state]] raised its marriage age to 18, allowing marriage at 17 in special circumstances with parental and court consent.&lt;ref name="cbslocal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/06/20/new-york-state-child-marriage/|title=Cuomo Signs Bill Doing Away With Child Marriage In New York State|date=20 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this law, the state allowed marriage in certain cases from 14.&lt;ref name="cbslocal.com" /&gt;

;Tennessee
In [[Tennessee]], until 2018, there was no minimum marriage age with judicial consent. In 2001, courts allowed three 10-year-old girls to marry.

In 2017 [[Texas]] raised their marriage age to 18, though they kept an exception allowing emancipated minors aged 16-17 to marry.&lt;ref name=refinerytexaschildmarriage&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/2017/06/159679/texas-child-marriage-ban|title=Texas Just Made It Illegal For Anyone Under 18 To Get Married|last=|first=|date=2017-06-19|access-date=2018-09-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siedlung eisenheim.jpg|thumb|280px|The town of Siedlung Eisenheim in [[Oberhausen]], Germany]] 
A '''company town''' is a place where practically all stores and housing are owned by the one company that is also the main employer. Company towns are often planned with a suite of amenities such as stores, churches, schools, markets and recreation facilities. They are usually bigger than a [[model village]] ("model" in the sense of an ideal to be emulated).

The best examples of company towns have had high ideals; but many have been regarded as controlling or exploitative.  Others developed more or less in unplanned fashion, such as [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], United States, one of the oldest, which began as a [[LC&amp;N Co.]] mining camp and mine site nine miles (14.5 km) from the nearest outside road.

==Overview==

Traditional settings for company towns were where [[Resource extraction|extractive industries]] — [[History of coal miners|coal]], metal mines, [[lumberjacks|lumber]] — had established a monopoly franchise. [[Dam]] sites and war-industry camps founded other company towns. Since company stores often had a monopoly in company towns, it was possible to pay in [[scrip]] through a [[truck system]]. In the Soviet Union there were several cities of nuclear scientists (''atomics'') known as [[atomgrad]]; particularly in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] those were [[Pripyat]], [[Varash]], [[Yuzhnoukrainsk]] among others.

Typically, a company town is isolated from neighbors and centered on a large production factory, such as a lumber or steel mill or an automobile plant; and the citizens of the town either work in the factory, work in one of the smaller businesses, or is a family member of someone who does. The company may also donate a church building to a local congregation, operate parks, host cultural events such as concerts, and so on. If the owning company cuts back or goes out of business, the [[economics|economic]] effect on the company town is devastating, as people move to jobs elsewhere.

Company towns often become regular public cities and towns as they grow and attract other settlement, business enterprises, and public transportation and services infrastructure. Other times, a town may not officially be a company town, but it may be a town where the majority of citizens are employed by a single company, thus creating a similar situation to a company town (especially in regard to the town's economy). Further, such dependencies extend to neighborhoods and [[urban area|regions of larger cities]]. In each case, if the primary company falls on lean times, fails outright or the industry fades in importance (as with steam locomotive support rail yards and [[anthracite]] mining industries which depended on [[steam locomotive]]s spurring demands) the communities contract and lose [[property value]] and then [[declining population|population]] as people move to find work elsewhere, and the youth of the community bears the children of their generation in another demographic region.

==History==

===Paternalism===
[[File:Bayreuthburg01.JPG|thumb|280px|Company town ''[[Burg (Bayreuth)|Burg]]'' in [[Bayreuth]], Germany]]
{{main article|Welfare capitalism}}
[[Paternalism]], a subtle form of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], refers to the control of workers by their employers who sought to force middle-class ideals upon their working-class employees. Paternalism was considered by many nineteenth-century businessmen as a moral responsibility, or often a religious obligation, which would advance society whilst furthering their own business interests. Accordingly, the company town offered a unique opportunity to achieve such ends.

Although many prominent examples of company towns portray their founders as "capitalists with a conscience", for example, [[George Cadbury]]'s [[Bournville]], if viewed cynically, the company town was often an economically viable ploy to attract and retain workers. Additionally, for-profit shops within company towns were usually owned by the company, which were unavoidable to its isolated workers, thus resulting in a monopoly for the owners.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;Crawford&lt;/ref&gt;

Although economically successful, company towns sometimes failed politically due to a lack of elected officials and municipally owned services.&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;Garner, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, workers often had no say in local affairs and therefore, felt dictated to. Ultimately, this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in many residents eventually losing long-term affection for their towns; such was the case at Pullman.

===Pullman lesson===
Although many small company towns existed in mining areas of [[Pennsylvania]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], one of the largest, and most substantial early company towns in the United States was [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]], developed in the 1880s just outside the [[Chicago]] city limits. The town, entirely company-owned, provided housing, markets, a library, churches and entertainment for the 6,000 company employees and an equal number of dependents. Employees were required to live in Pullman, although cheaper rentals could be found in nearby communities.

The town operated successfully until the economic [[panic of 1893]], when demand for the company's products declined, and employee wages had to be lowered accordingly. Despite this, the company refused to lower rents in the town or the price of goods at its shops, thus resulting in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894. A national commission formed to investigate the causes of the strikes found that Pullman's paternalism was partly to blame and labelled it "un-American".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Buder, ''Pullman: An Experiment in Industrial Order and Community Planning, 1880–1930''&lt;/ref&gt; The report condemned Pullman for refusing to negotiate and for the economic hardships he created for workers in the town of Pullman. "The aesthetic features are admired by visitors, but have little money value to employees, especially when they lack bread." The State of Illinois filed suit, and in 1898 the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] forced the Pullman Company to divest ownership in the town, which was annexed to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/p_pullman.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arthur Melville Pearson |date=January–February 2009|title=Utopia Derailed|journal=Archaeology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=46–49|issn=0003-8113 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0901/abstracts/pullman.html|accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, government observers maintained that Pullman's principles were accurate, in that he provided his employees with a [[quality of life]] otherwise unattainable to them, but recognised that his excessive paternalism was inappropriate for a large-scale corporate economy and thus caused the town's downfall. Accordingly, government observers and social reformers alike saw the need for a balance between control and well-designed towns, concluding that a model company town would only succeed if independent professionals, acting as a buffer between employers and employees, took a role in conception, planning, and management of these towns.&lt;ref&gt;Fogelsong, R. 1986. ‘Planning the Capitalist City’. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691077053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Linda Carlson argues that the managers of corporate towns in the early 20th century believed they could avoid the mistakes made by George Pullman in the 1880s. She says they:
:wanted to create a better life for their employees: decent housing, good schools, and a "morally uplifting" society.  In return, they expected stable, hard-working employees who would eschew the evils of drink and, most important, not fall prey to the blandishments of union organizers.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Carlson, ''Company towns of the Pacific Northwest'' (U. of Washington Press, 2014)  p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Pullman Strike did not kill the concept of a company town but rather initiated a new chapter in their existence. Over the next thirty years, the old model of paternalism was abandoned in favour of new professionally designed company towns with architects, landscape architects, and planners translating "new concepts of industrial relations and social welfare into new physical forms". This suited capitalists of the day who were obviously keen to avoid the experiences of Pullman. The first real example of this occurred at [[Indian Hill-North Village, Massachusetts]], in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of American company towns===

By the 1920s, the need for company towns had declined significantly due to increased national affluence. Despite income inequalities and a relatively low standard of living conditions amongst factory laborers, the prosperity of the 1920s saw workers’ material well-being improve significantly. A strong post-war American economy meant installment buying was accessible to low-wage earners who could now purchase previously unattainable goods like automobiles and radios. Moreover, workers were no longer dependent on employers for healthcare and education.

By the 1920s the widespread nature of the automobile meant workers no longer needed to live near their work places and now had access to more employment opportunities. A combination of the freedom that came with private transport and the mass communication of radio saw the isolation of company towns lessen and the social basis of the company town become less necessary.

Furthermore, the accessibility of the working class to private transport also marked a step of equality as they had previously only been accessible to the wealthy. As access to surrounding municipalities increased, residents of company towns gained access to an increasing amount of government-funded public resources such as schools, libraries, and parks. Accordingly, there was no longer a need for the amenities of company towns which, prior to [[welfare capitalism]], had previously been unattainable to the working class.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

This new found freedom saw a change in the mindset of workers who began to look on welfare capitalism as demeaning rather than an incentive. Accordingly, many employees began to request additional pay in lieu of welfare programs. This was well received by some employers as the idea of ‘laissez-faire’ individualism, which promoted entrepreneurial virtues of hard-work being rewarded rather than direct charity, began to shape new-age paternalism.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

Modernization and the increase in material well-being had also lessened the perceived need for paternalism and moral reform. Consequently, the economic downturn of the early 1930s saw some businesses do away with employee welfare schemes to reduce costs. However, the Roosevelt Administration’s [[New Deal]] dealt the final blow to end American company towns by raising minimum wages, encouraging industrial self-governance, and pushing for the owners of company towns to “consider the question of plans for eventual employee ownership of homes”.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; To a lesser extent the New Deal also reduced the need for employee housing by transforming housing finance to a lower-interest, lower-deposit system making home ownership more accessible to the working class.

==Model company towns==
[[File:Port Sunlight.jpg|thumb|An example of houses at [[Port Sunlight]]]]
{{see also|Model village}}
During the late nineteenth century, model company towns materialised, as enlightened industrialists recognised that many poor workers were living in appalling conditions.&lt;ref name=parsons/&gt; These industrialists wished to combat the unsanitary and congested conditions common to working class districts in order to create better living conditions for workers.&lt;ref name="Garner_b"&gt;Garner, 1982, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; Model company towns such as [[Port Sunlight]] (1888) and [[Bournville]] (1895) were influential in regards to their building and planning innovation. The ideas generated from these model towns are regarded as having a significant influence on the [[Garden city movement|Garden City movement]].&lt;ref name="Garner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson&lt;/ref&gt;

The model company town is concerned with creating a productive and prosperous company. Enlightened industrialists believed this could be achieved by providing a healthier residential environment for their employees. Planning a model company town involved the fusion of new notions of house design and layout.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; The paternalism of the enlightened industrialist was exhibited in his desire to provide an environment for his employees that was aesthetically appealing and which included well-designed residences, parks, schools, libraries and meeting halls.&lt;ref name="Garner_a"&gt;Garner, 1992, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The industrialist also wished to contribute to his workers' well-being by providing social programs such as sporting events and functions.&lt;ref name="Garner_a" /&gt; This, however, highlights the power and immense control possessed by the company owner, who could shape the lifestyle and activities of his employees to serve his own interests and those of the company.&lt;ref name="Garner_b" /&gt;

Model villages for agricultural workers were founded in the early 19th century in the United Kingdom. The creation of model company towns was particularly evident in Britain during the latter half of the nineteenth century with the creation of [[Saltaire]] (1851), [[Bournville]], [[Port Sunlight]], [[Creswell, Derbyshire|Creswell]] and [[New Earswick]] (1901) and coincided with the housing-reform movement, which emphasized the improvement of housing for the working class.&lt;ref name=parsons/&gt; These model towns contrasted with the overcrowded conditions in British working-class districts, which were often characterized by congested housing, unsanitary conditions, and poor provision of open space and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell&lt;/ref&gt; Model company towns promoted the idea of orderly, planned town development as well as the notion of planning for the needs of the community in order to provide healthier living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model company towns in Britain===
Model company towns around the mid-nineteenth century, such as Copley (1849), near Halifax, and Saltaire (1853), close to Bradford, were differentiated by improved dwellings for workers which contrasted with working-class housing in other industrial villages and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, 1982, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; These model company towns prompted the creation of others, such as Port Sunlight, Bournville and Creswell, within an environment of reform.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Port Sunlight]] (1888) in Cheshire was established by William Hesketh Lever (later Lord Leverhulme) of Lever Brothers – a soap and tallow manufacturer. The earlier layout of this model company town was planned to suit the undulating topography of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Port Sunlight catered for the Lever Brothers employees through the provision of improved housing (cottages of varying designs and materials) and gardens, as well as social and community facilities, including an auditorium, a school, tennis courts and bowling greens.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;Cherry, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Port Sunlight combined the use of formal and informal planning elements, such as straight streets close to the town centre and curved streets in the residential areas. This combination of the formal and informal represented a new feature of British town planning.&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bournville]] (1895), near Birmingham, was established by the Cadbury brothers, George and Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim&lt;/ref&gt; George and Richard Cadbury chose to transfer the Cadbury factory to this new site in order to provide their employees with improved living conditions and a country environment that they could enjoy – a far cry from the busy, smoky city centre of Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The firm provided education in the form of a compulsory academic course, and workers were given the opportunity to complete commercial or technical training.&lt;ref name="Dellheim"&gt;Dellheim, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The Cadburys also encouraged their workers to get involved in the social life of Bournville through the provision of sports facilities and athletic and cultural clubs, as well as social events such as summer parties.&lt;ref name="Dellheim" /&gt; [[George Cadbury]], a Quaker, preached Christian values, such as respectability, thrift and sobriety, and sought to unify the Bournville community through rituals such as gift giving between employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also established work councils, such as the Women's Works Council, and supported trades unions.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Bournville represented the union of industry and nature as the company town boasted the attractiveness of the countryside and low-density development defined by well-built and visually appealing dwellings.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Port Sunlight, Bournville catered for a mixed community, where residences were not restricted to the workforce only.&lt;ref name="Jackson_a"&gt;Jackson, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Bournville illustrated how, towards the end of the nineteenth century, low-density development was being punctuated along with the provision of open air, space and sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Bournville's gardens, parks, tree-lined streets, sense of spaciousness and country setting enhanced its aesthetic appeal and demonstrated George Cadbury's endeavour to provide workers with a healthy, beautiful and well-ventilated environment.&lt;ref name="Jackson_a" /&gt;

The Bolsover Company developed two exemplary mining communities in Derbyshire during the late nineteenth century, [[Bolsover]] (1891) and [[Creswell, Derbyshire|Creswell]] (1896). The Bolsover Company aimed to provide improved living conditions for the miners and their families in these model industrial villages. The houses at Creswell were built in concentric circles, and within these circles was a large open parkland and a bandstand.&lt;ref name="Gaskell"&gt;Gaskell, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the Bolsover Company aim to provide better housing, but they also wished to improve workers' moral fibre, believing that the provision of facilities and the promotion of workers' welfare would discourage drunkenness, gambling and bad language. The Bolsover Company provided facilities deemed beneficial for employees at both villages including clubhouses, bowling greens, cooperative society stores, cricket pitches and schools.&lt;ref name="Gaskell" /&gt; During the early years of these model industrial villages, the Bolsover Company organized various events intended to enhance community life, such as flower shows, lectures, sporting events, concerts, teas and dances.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial colonies in Catalonia, Spain==
[[File:Colònia Pons.jpg|thumb|Cal Pons, a textile company town, or ''industrial colony'', in [[Puig-reig]]]]
[[Catalonia]], a region located in North-Eastern Spain, has a high density of company towns, known locally as industrial colonies. They are especially concentrated in river basins along the [[Ter River|Ter]] and [[Llobregat]]. In [[Berguedà]], for example, within 20&amp;nbsp;km there are 14 colonies. The total number in Catalonia is around a hundred. These were small towns created around a factory, built in a rural area and, therefore, separate from any other population. They housed between 100 and 500 inhabitants, and in some cases around 1000 people.&lt;ref name="Serra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serra|first1=Rosa|title=Industrial colonies in Catalonia|journal=Catalan Historical Review|date=2011|volume=4|pages=101–120|doi=10.2436/20.1000.01.53|url=http://revistes.iec.cat/index.php/CHR/article/viewFile/54342/pdf_159|accessdate=27 April 2016|issn=2013-407X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These industrial colonies were a typical aspect of industrialization in Catalonia, specifically the second industrialization, which resulted in certain areas that were once purely rural becoming industrial. They were first created in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially from the 1870s onwards. The last colonies were created in the early years of the twentieth century. Thus, company towns in Catalonia have a history going back some 150 years, although in almost all cases the company that operated the colony has now shut down. The most common industry in these colonies was textiles. There are more than 75 textile colonies recorded; although there were also mining, metallurgy and agricultural colonies.&lt;ref name="Serra" /&gt;

Mostly these colonies (particularly the textile related ones) were constructed close to a river. This was because they used hydraulic power (waterwheels) to run the factory. One reason for this was that Catalonia was poor in coal and importing it was expensive. In addition, the Catalan rivers (with little volume but a very steep sloping run) provided free and almost inexhaustible energy, that was lacking only in times of drought.&lt;ref name="clua"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clua i Mercadal|first1=Jordi|title=Les colònies industrials al Berguedà: estudi d'una transformació econòmica i urbana|journal=Treballs de la Societat Catalana de Geografia|date=1992|volume=VII|pages=145–170|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/treballsscgeografia/article/viewFile/239840/322295|accessdate=3 May 2016|language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial colonies system began to collapse in the 1960s. The colonies gradually emptied of people even before the definitive industrial crisis, which worsened in 1978. In the 1980s and 1990s almost all the factories in these industrial colonies closed. From that moment on, many colonies became towns that were now independent of the company, others were abandoned and remain without inhabitants. Other factories were leased to smaller industries or now lie empty.&lt;ref name="Serra" /&gt;

Some of the more interesting colonies include: [[Colònia Güell]], in [[Santa Coloma de Cervelló]], which contains several modernist buildings, such as the crypt church built by [[Antoni Gaudí]]; [[L'Ametlla de Merola]], [[Puig-reig]], where centenary traditional cultural activities are held, such as the representation of [[Els Pastorets]]; the three colonies of [[Castellbell i el Vilar]]: [[La Bauma]], [[El Borràs]], [[El Burés]], with buildings of architectural interest; [[Cal Rosal]], between [[Berga]], [[Avià]] and [[Olvan]], which, in 1858, was the first colony in the era of building large colonies in the Llobregat; [[Cal Vidal]], Puig-reig, which houses the Museum of the Vidal Colony, an ideal visit for anyone wishing to learn what life was like in one of these industrial experiments.

[[Kuusankoski]] in Finland, formerly also known as "the paper capital of Finland", is a prime example of the decline many company towns have had to deal with when the company itself struggles. The town relied on three paper mills owned by [[Kymmene Corporation]] from the 1870s until 2005 when two mills, Voikkaa and Kuusaa, were shut down, leaving only the Kymi mill operating. An estimated 5% of the local population had been employed by the two closed mills and Kymmene's decision left the town in socioeconomic chaos. Kuusankoski's independent status ended in 2009 when the town was consolidated into the regional capital, Kouvola.

The border town [[Oranjemund|Oranjemund, Namibia]] is a company town owned by [[De Beers|Namibian DeBeers (Namdeb).]] The town has a diamond mine that was established over 25 years ago and is still ongoing till this day. Residents of [[Oranjemund]] either work in the mine or for the company in offices based in the town. To enter the town, all people above 18 need permission to pass its gates and need to provide a residential, and reason for visiting. Due to this the town has no homeless people at all and can regulate people coming in and out of the town. A municipality has recently been introduced in Oranjemund and will start to fully operate in late 2016 meaning residents will soon start paying for Water and Electricity which has been a benefit to them. The town is staged and is busy readying itself to becoming open to the public.

At their peak there were more than 2,500 company towns, housing 3% of the US population. The companies that ran the towns were primarily labor companies such as coal, steel, lumber and various war industries. Most of the people living in these towns were immigrants new to the country.

In the present-day United States, it is relatively rare for any place in which a single company owns all the property to be granted status as an [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] [[municipality]]. Rather, companies will normally prefer their wholly owned communities to remain unincorporated, as this permits administration of the community to be carried out by appointed company officers rather than elected officials. However, there are incorporated municipalities that are heavily dependent upon a single industry or organization and may be loosely considered a "company town", even though the company does not technically own the town.

The '''Creative Problem Solving Institute''' (CPSI) is an annual creativity conference, sponsored by the [[Creative Education Foundation]]. CPSI is the oldest and longest-running creativity conference in the world. It was the brain child of [[Alex Osborn]], the inventor of [[brainstorming]] and [[Creative Problem Solving]], the founder of Creative Education Foundation, and more commonly known as the co-founder of advertising firm [[BBDO]]. The first conference was held in 1954 in Buffalo, New York, the city that continues to host CPSI.

The conference positions itself as "The HOW TO Create, Innovate and Lead Change conference".

{{Culture of Kenya}} 
The '''demography of Kenya''' is monitored by the Kenyan National Bureau of Statistics. [[Kenya]] is a [[multi-ethnic state]] in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of [[East Africa]]. It is inhabited primarily by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nilotic]] populations, with some [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]-speaking ethnic minorities in the north. Its total population was estimated at 47 million as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/kenya-population/|title=Kenya Population (2017, 2018)|website=Worldometers.info|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national census was conducted in 1999, although the results were never released. A new census was undertaken in 2009, but turned out to be controversial, as the questions about ethnic affiliation seemed inappropriate after the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis|ethnic violence]] of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8217637.stm Kenya begins contentious census] BBC News, 24 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary results of the census were published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11143914 Kenya defends tribal census figures] BBC News, 31 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kenya's population was reported as 38.6 million during the 2009 census compared to 28.7 million inhabitants in 1999, 21.4 million in 1989, and 15.3 million in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Kenya.html |title=Kenya: Provinces, Counties, Cities, Towns, Urban Centers – Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=Citypopulation.de|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase of 2.5 percent over 30 years, or an average growth rate of more than 3 percent per year. The population growth rate has been reported as reduced during the 2000s, and was estimated at 2.7 percent (as of 2010), resulting in an estimate of 46.5 million in 2016.&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html|title=CIA World  Fact Book – Kenya | publisher= CIA – The World Fact Book|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic groups==

[[File:Kenyan man 2.jpg|thumb|A [[Maasai people|Maasai]] man.]]
Kenya has a very diverse population that includes most major ethnic, racial and linguistic groups found in Africa. [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Asongu, J. J.|author2=Marr, Marvee|title=Doing Business Abroad: A Handbook for Expatriates|year=2007|publisher=Greenview Publishing Co.|isbn=0-9797976-3-2|pages=12 &amp; 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya's largest ethnic group is the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]]. They make up less than a fifth of the population. Since Kenyan independence in 1963, Kenyan politics have been characterized by [[ethnic tensions]] and rivalry between the larger groups. This devolved into [[Ethnic conflicts in Kenya|ethnic violence]] in the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]].

In Kenya's last colonial census of 1962, population groups residing in the territory included European, African and Asian individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya Population Census 1962, Appendix 1|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/117476/Kenya-1962-en.pdf|publisher=Government of Kenya|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Kenya National Bureau of Statistics]], Kenya had a population of 38,610,097 by 2009. The largest native ethnic groups were the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] (6,622,576), [[Luhya people|Luhya]] (5,338,666), [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] (4,967,328), [[Luo people|Luo]] (4,044,440), [[Kamba people|Kamba]] (3,893,157), [[Kisii people]] (2,205,669), [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda]] (1,960,574), [[Meru people|Meru]] (1,658,108), [[Turkana people|Turkana]] (988,592), and [[Maasai people|Maasai]] (841,622). Foreign-rooted populations included [[Somalis]] (2,385,572), [[Indians in Kenya|Asians]] (81,791), [[White people in Kenya|Europeans]] (67,000), and Kenyan Arabs (40,760).&lt;!--the latter populations are designated with a ''Kenyan'' prefix in latest 2009 census; this is a holdover from the last colonial census of 1962, when the population groups residing in the territory included European, Arab, Somali, African and Asian individuals ("European, Arab, Somali or African, etc. Asians must write Indian or Pakistan" [http://www.waikato.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/117476/Kenya-1962-en.pdf]) --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knbs.or.ke/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;download=585:volume-2-population-and-household-distribution-by-socio-economic-characteristics&amp;id=109:population-and-housing-census-2009&amp;Itemid=599|title=The 2009 Kenya Population and Housing Census Volume II – Population and Household Distribution by Social Economic Characteristics p. 397-398.|publisher=Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabs===
[[Arab]]s form a small but historically important minority ethnic group in Kenya. They are principally concentrated along the coast in cities such as [[Mombasa]]. A Muslim community, they primarily came from [[Oman]] and [[Hadhramaut]] in [[Yemen]], and are engaged in trade. Arabs are locally referred to as ''Washihiri'' or, less commonly, as simply ''Shihiri'' in the Bantu [[Swahili language]], Kenya's [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name="Godfrey"/&gt; According to the 2009 Census, Kenyan Arabs number 40,760 people.&lt;ref name="Pahcea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population and Housing Census – Ethnic Affiliation |url=http://www.knbs.or.ke/censusethnic.php |publisher=Kenya National Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=16 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121153548/http://www.knbs.or.ke/censusethnic.php |archivedate=21 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asians===
{{main|Indians in Kenya}}
Kenyan Asians are descended from [[South Asia]]n migrants. Significant Asian migration to Kenya began between 1896 and 1901 when some 32,000 indentured labourers were recruited from [[British India]] to build the [[Kenya-Uganda Railway]].&lt;ref name="Kahod"&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Ruth|title=Kenya's Asian heritage on display|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/762515.stm|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=24 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Kenyan Asians hail from the [[Gujarat]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;The community grew significantly during the colonial period, and in the 1962 census Asians made up a third of the population of Nairobi and consisted of 176,613 people across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since [[History of Kenya|Kenyan independence]] large numbers have emigrated due to race-related tensions with the Bantu and Nilotic majority. Those that remain are principally concentrated in the business sector, and Asians continue to form one of the more prosperous communities in the region.&lt;ref name="Godfrey"/&gt; According to the 2009 Census, Kenyan Asians number 46,782 people, while Asians without Kenyan citizenship number 35,009 individuals.&lt;ref name="Pahcea"/&gt; In 2017, they were officially recognised at the 44th tribe of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Hindu-officially-becomes-Kenya-s-44th-tribe/1056-4027242-12m5ygj/index.html|title=Kenya's-44th-tribe|website=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bantu peoples===
{{main|Bantu peoples}}
Bantus are the single largest population division in Kenya. The term ''Bantu'' denotes widely dispersed but related peoples that speak south-central [[Niger–Congo languages]]. Originally from [[West Africa|West]]-[[Central Africa]], Bantus began a millennium-long series of migrations referred to as the [[Bantu expansion]] that first brought them to southeast Africa about 2,000 years ago.

Most Bantu are farmers. Some of the prominent Bantu groups in Kenya include the Kikuyu, the Kamba, the Luhya, the Kisii, the Meru, and the Mijikenda. The [[Swahili people]] are descended from Mijikenda Bantu peoples that intermarried with Arab and [[Persian people|Persian]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="Okothndaloh"&gt;A. Okoth &amp; A. Ndaloh, ''Peak Revision K.C.P.E. Social Studies'', (East African Publishers), p.60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSTD"&gt;S. Wandibba et al, Social Studies STD 6, (East African Publishers), p.45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cushitic peoples===
[[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] peoples form a small minority of Kenya's population. They speak languages belonging to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family and originally came from [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]] in northeastern Africa. Most are herdsmen and [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Wandi"/&gt; Cushites are concentrated in the northernmost [[North Eastern Province, Kenya|North Eastern Province]], which borders Somalia.&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Kenya: identity of a nation'', (Godfrey Mwakikagile: 2007), p.99-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cushitic peoples are divided into two groups: the Southern Cushites and the Eastern Cushites.

*The Southern Cushites were the second-earliest inhabitants of Kenya after the indigenous hunter-gatherer groups,&lt;ref name="Ayot"&gt;H. Okello Ayot, ''Topics in East African history, 1000–1970'' ([[East African Literature Bureau]]: 1976), p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first of the Cushitic-speaking peoples to migrate from their homeland in the [[Horn of Africa]] about 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Wandi"/&gt; They were progressively displaced in a southerly direction or absorbed, or both, by the incoming Nilotic and Bantu groups until they wound up in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="Wandi"/&gt; There are no longer any Southern Cushites left in Kenya. (The [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] were originally pre-Cushitic peoples who adopted the language of their dominant Southern Cushitic neighbors sometime toward the last millennium BC.&lt;ref name="HCCCTIEAC"&gt;Randall L. Pouwels, ''Horn and Crescent: Cultural Change and Traditional Islam on the East African Coast, 800–1900'', Volume 53 of ''African Studies'', (Cambridge University Press: 2002), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*The Eastern Cushites include the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and the [[Somalis in Kenya|Somali]]. Of these, the Somali are the most recent arrivals to Kenya, having first come from Somalia a few centuries ago.&lt;ref name="Wandi"/&gt; After the Northern Frontier District (North Eastern Province) was handed over to Kenyan nationalists at the end of British colonial rule in Kenya, Somalis in the region fought the [[Shifta War]] against Kenyan troops to join their kin in the Somali Republic to the north. Although the war ended in a cease-fire, [[Somali people|Somalis]] in the region still identify and maintain close ties with their kin in Somalia and see themselves as one people.&lt;ref&gt;Mwakikagile, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; An entrepreneurial community, they established themselves in the business sector, particularly in [[Eastleigh, Nairobi|Eastleigh]], Nairobi.&lt;ref name="SomEast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrika.no/Detailed/16696.html|title=Kenya/Somalia: Somalia community doing booming business in country|website=Afrika.no|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europeans===
{{main|White people in Kenya}}
Europeans in Kenya are primarily the descendants of [[British people|British]] migrants during the colonial period. Many are of [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] descent and still continue to wield significant influence, especially over Kenya's political elite. Since the [[History of Kenya|Independence of Kenya]], Britons and other Europeans in Kenya also continue to dominate the local business community.&lt;ref name="Godfrey"/&gt; According to the 2009 Census, Kenyan Europeans number 35,000 people, while Europeans without Kenyan citizenship number 32,000 individuals.

===Nilotic peoples===
{{main|Nilotic peoples}}
Nilotes are the second-largest group of peoples in Kenya. They speak [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] and came to Southeast Africa by way of [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Okothndaloh"/&gt; Most Nilotes in Kenya are [[Pastoralism|herdsmen]], and they have a fearsome reputation as warriors and cattle-rustlers. The most prominent of these groups include the Luo, the Maasai, the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the Turkana, and the Kalenjin.&lt;ref name="Okothndaloh"/&gt; As with the Bantu, some of the Nilotes have adopted many customs and practices from the Cushitic groups, including the [[age set]] system of social organization, [[circumcision]], and vocabulary terms.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;Robert O. Collins, ''The southern Sudan in historical perspective'', (Transaction Publishers: 2006), p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wandi"&gt;S. Wandibba et al, p.19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
{{main article|Languages of Kenya}}
[[File:Swahili-pn.jpg|thumb|[[Lord's Prayer]] in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language that alongside [[English language|English]] serves as a [[lingua franca]] for many in Kenya.]]
Kenya's various ethnic groups typically speak their [[mother tongue]]s within their own communities.The two [[official language]]s, [[English language|English]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], serve as the main [[lingua franca]] between the various ethnic groups. English is widely spoken in commerce, schooling and government.&lt;ref name="Cugrwed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Proquest Info &amp; Learning (COR)|title=Culturegrams: World Edition|year=2009|publisher=Proquest/Csa Journal Div|isbn=0977809161|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peri-urban and rural dwellers are less multilingual, with many in rural areas speaking only their native languages.&lt;ref name="Broassim"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brown, E. K. |author2=Asher, R. E. |author3=Simpson, J. M. Y. |title=Encyclopedia of language &amp; linguistics, Volume 1, Edition 2|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0080442994|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are a total of 69 languages spoken in Kenya. Most belong to two broad language families: [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] ([[Bantu languages|Bantu branch]]) and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] ([[Nilotic languages|Nilotic branch]]), which are spoken by the country's Bantu and Nilotic populations, respectively. The Cushitic and Arab ethnic minorities speak languages belonging to the separate [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family, with the Indian and European residents speaking languages from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family.&lt;ref name="Ethnken"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=KE|title=Kenya|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
According to {{UN_Population|source}}, the total population was {{UN_Population|Kenya}} in {{UN_Population|Year}} compared to 6,077,000 in 1950, and around 1,700,000 in 1900. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 42.5%, 54.9% between the ages of 15 and 65, and 2.7% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldometers estimates the total population at 48,466,928 inhabitants, a 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; global rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/kenya-population/|title=Kenya Population (2017, 2018) – Worldometers|website=Worldometers.info|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Further information|Health in Kenya}}
Like the [[demographics of Africa]] in general, Kenya is plagued by high infant mortality, low life expectancy, malnourishment (32%of population) and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV/AIDS]].
While these concerns remain grave, a trend towards improvement is reported in the period of 2006 to 2010: [[Infant mortality]] was at estimated at 59.26 deaths/1,000 live births as of 2006, decreasing to 54.7 deaths/1,000 live births as of 2010.
[[Life expectancy]] was estimated at 48.9 years as of 2006, and has risen to 64 years in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Kenyas-life-expectancy-jumps-to-64-years/-/1056/1623470/-/qpo3o5/-/index.html|title=Kenya's life expectancy jumps to 64 years|website=Nation.co.ke|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2008–09 Kenyan government survey, total fertility was 4.6, contraception usage among married women was 46 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statistics.knbs.or.ke/nada/index.php/catalog/23|title=Kenya – Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2008–09|website=Statistics.knbs.or.ke|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Total fertility rate has decreased 4.91 children per woman (2006 estimate), to 4.38 (2010 estimate).
Literacy (age 7 and over) was estimated at 85.1% in 2003 (male: 90.6%, female: 79.7%).

'''European cuisine''', or alternatively '''Western cuisine''', is a generalised term collectively referring to the [[cuisine]]s of [[Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Culinary Cultures of Europe: Identity, Diversity and Dialogue|publisher=Council of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Western world|Western countries]],&lt;ref name="europeword"&gt;[http://www.europeword.com/blog/europe/european-cuisine/  "European Cuisine."] [http://www.europeword.com Europeword.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; including (depending on the definition) that of [[Russia]],&lt;ref name="europeword"/&gt; as well as non-[[Indigenous people|indigenous]] cuisines of [[Australasia]], the [[Americas]], [[Southern Africa]], and [[Oceania]], which derive substantial influence from European settlers in those regions. The term is used by [[East Asia]]ns to contrast with Asian styles of cooking.&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;Leung Man-tao (12 February 2007), "Eating and Cultural Stereotypes", ''Eat and Travel Weekly'', no. 312, p. 76. Hong Kong|publisher=Next Media Limited&lt;/ref&gt; (This is analogous to Westerners' referring collectively to the cuisines of East Asian countries as [[Asian cuisine]].) When used by Westerners, the term may sometimes refer more specifically to cuisine ''in'' Europe; in this context, a synonym is '''[[Continental Europe|Continental]] cuisine''', especially in [[British English]].

[[Image:Rump steak.jpg|thumb|Grilled [[steak]]]]
[[File:Bratkartoffeln-in-pfanne.jpg|thumb|[[Home fries|Home fried potatoes]]]]
The cuisines of Western countries are diverse by themselves, although there are common characteristics that distinguish Western cooking from cuisines of Asian countries&lt;ref name="Kwan 1988"&gt;Kwan Shuk-yan (1988). ''Selected Occidental Cookeries and Delicacies'', p. 23. Hong Kong: Food Paradise Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Compared with traditional cooking of Asian countries, for example, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving-size.&lt;ref name="Lin 1977"&gt;Lin Ch'ing (1977). ''First Steps to European Cooking'', p. 5. Hong Kong: Wan Li Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steak]] and [[cutlet]] in particular are common dishes across the West. Western cuisines also put substantial emphasis on [[grape wine]] and on sauces as condiments, seasonings, or accompaniments (in part due to the difficulty of seasonings penetrating the often larger pieces of meat used in Western cooking). Many dairy products are utilised in the cooking process, except in [[nouvelle cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Kwan Shuk-yan, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheese]]s are produced in hundreds of different varieties, and [[fermented milk products]] are also available in a wide selection. [[Wheat]]-flour bread has long been the most common source of [[starch]] in this cuisine, along with [[pasta]], [[dumpling]]s and [[Pastry|pastries]], although the [[potato]] has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the [[European colonisation of the Americas]], particularly in Northern Europe. [[Maize]] is much less common in most European diets than it is in the [[Americas]]; however corn meal ([[polenta]] or [[mămăligă]]), is a major part of the cuisine of [[Italy]] and the [[Balkans]]. Although flatbreads (especially with toppings such as [[pizza]] or [[tarte flambée]]), and rice are eaten in Europe, they do not constitute an ever-present staple.  [[Salad]]s (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables with sauce) are an integral part of European cuisine.

Formal European dinners are served in distinct courses. European presentation evolved from [[service à la française]], or bringing multiple dishes to the table at once, into [[service à la russe]], where dishes are presented sequentially. Usually, cold, hot and savoury, and sweet dishes are served strictly separately in this order, as [[hors d'oeuvre]] (appetizer) or soup, as [[entrée]] and [[main course]], and as [[dessert]]. Dishes that are both sweet and savoury were common earlier in ancient Roman cuisine, but are today uncommon, with sweet dishes being served only as dessert. A service where the guests are free to take food by themselves is termed a [[buffet]], and is usually restricted to parties or holidays. Nevertheless, guests are expected to follow the same pattern.

Historically, European cuisine has been developed in the European royal and noble courts. European nobility was usually arms-bearing and lived in separate manors in the countryside. The knife was the primary eating implement ([[cutlery]]), and eating steaks and other foods that require cutting followed. In contrast in the Sinosphere, the ruling class were the court officials, who had their food cut ready to eat in the kitchen, to be eaten with chopsticks. The knife was supplanted by the [[spoon]] for soups, while the [[fork]] was introduced later in the [[early modern period]], ca. 16th century. Today, most dishes are intended to be eaten with cutlery and only a few [[finger food]]s can be eaten with the hands in polite company.

Germany for their world-famous wursts, Hungary for their goulash. Slovakia is famous for their gnocchi-like Halusky pasta. Slovenia for their German and Italian influenced cuisine, Poland for their world-famous Pierogis which are a cross between a Ravioli and an Empanada. Liechtenstein and German speaking Switzerland are famous for their Rösti and French speaking Switzerland for their Raclettes.

'''Gorontaloan''' or '''Hulandalo''' people are the native people of the northern part of [[Sulawesi]]. They are the most populous ethnicity in the [[Minahasa Peninsula]]. The Gorontaloans are predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Aveling &amp; Damien Kingsbury|title=Autonomy and Disintegration in Indonesia|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-1364-9809-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their native language is [[Gorontalo language|Gorontaloan]]. The Gorontaloans have traditionally been concentrated in the provinces of [[Gorontalo (province)|Gorontalo]], [[North Sulawesi]], and the northern part of [[Central Sulawesi]].

==Etymology==
The name Gorontalo probably derives from much terms, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=BPS Provinsi Gorontalo; BAPPEDA Provinsi Gorontalo|title=Gorontalo Dalam Angka 2012: Gorontalo in Figures 2012|year=2012|publisher=Pemerintah Provinsi Gorontalo|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Hulontalangio'', the name of a tribe who lives in an area
* ''Hua Lolontalango'', means a cave used for two-way travel
* ''Hulutalangi'', means noble
* ''Huluo lo Tola'', means a place where [[Channa striata|snakehead]] fish reproduces
* ''Pongolatalo'' or ''Pohulatalo'', means a waiting place
* ''Gunung Telu'', means the third mountain
* ''Hunto'', means a place always flowed with water

Gorontaloans sometime refer themselves as ''Hulandalo'' or ''Hulantalo'', a well-known term in Gorontalo and North Sulawesi, which usually refer to the region of Gorontalo or the native people from Gorontalo.

The Gorontaloan people also have a family kinship system called ''Pohala'a''. This system is a heritage of the kingdoms that had previously established in [[Gorontalo]]. There are five ''pohala'a'' in [[Gorontalo]], namely Gorontalo, Limboto, Suwawa, Bualemo and Atinggola; where the Gorontalo ''pohala'a'' is the most prominent among the ''pohala'a''s.&lt;ref name="HBI"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna Fauziah Diponegoro|title=Harta bumi Indonesia: biografi J.A. Katili|year=2007|publisher=Grasindo|isbn=97-975-9815-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fachrudin Zain Olilingo|title=Potensi Investasi di Provinsi Gorontalo|year=2017|publisher=Deepublish|isbn=60-245-3547-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een groep mannen uit Gorontalo in een prauw TMnr 60037661.jpg|thumb|A group of men from [[Gorontalo]] in a [[boat|prahu]], circa 1895-1905.]]

===Origins===
The origins of the Gorontaloan people is uncertain. Based on the physical attributes of the Gorontaloan people, the Gorontaloan people are categorized as part of the [[Mongoloid]] race, with the possibility of mixing with other ethnic groups several centuries ago. As a result the Gorontaloan people currently has diverse physical postures, and different shades of skin color from yellow to dark brown. Variety of hair types also exist among them from straight to wavy and curly hair. There are two Southeast Asian migration theories, with the first theory states that the population of Southeast Asian originally came from the east, and then inhabited in [[Sulawesi]]. While the second theory explains that the human migration began from [[Taiwan]] and arrived in [[Sulawesi]] through the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Parmentier|title=The Sacred Remains: Myth, History, and Polity in Belau|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=02-266-4695-5|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, Gorontaloan people share the same origins with other Austronesian people of the [[Philippine Islands]] and [[North Sulawesi]] islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/gorontalic |title=Gorontalic |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Gorontaloan legend that tells a story that they are the descendants of ''Hulontalangi'', or the people that came from the skies and reside on Mount Tilongkabila, [[Bone Bolango Regency]]. The name Hulontalangi then became Hulontalo and Gorontalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Zulyani Hidayah|title=Ensiklopedi Suku Bangsa di Indonesia|year=2015|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=97-946-1929-9|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-historic period===
According to legend, the first Gorontaloan kingdom emerged at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. [[Gorontalo]] is believed to have inhabited by humans since prehistoric times. The Oluhuta site in [[Bone Bolango Regency]] is an archaeology site which provides information about the tombs of previous communities that were estimated to have lived around 2000–4000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Soejono (R. P.), Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, International Center for Prehistoric and Austronesian Studies (Indonesia)|title=Archaeology: Indonesian Perspective : R.P. Soejono's Festschrift|year=2006|publisher=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|isbn=97-926-2499-6|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/382552/balai-cagar-budaya-pamerkan-replika-kerangka-oluhuta

===Gorontaloan kingdoms===
The establishment of the [[Gorontalo]] region have been estimated to formed 400 years ago. Gorontalo is one of the places that are recognized for the spreading of [[Islam]] in [[East Indonesia]] besides [[Ternate]] and [[Bone state]]. By 1525, when the Portuguese arrived at [[North Sulawesi]], [[Islam]] had already been widely spread among them during the rule of King Amay; with the Gorontaloan lands divided between the Muslim states of Gorontalo, Limboto, Suwawa, Boalemo and Atinggola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indonesia.travel/en/discover-indonesia/region-detail/43/gorontalo |title=Gorontalo |publisher=Indonesia's Official Tourism Website |accessdate=2018-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815201617/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/discover-indonesia/region-detail/43/gorontalo |archivedate=15 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorontalo then developed to become the center of education and trade in [[North Sulawesi]]. The city of the Gorontalo Kingdom first began in Hulawa village beside the Bolango River. Before the arrival of the Europeans, the kingdoms in Gorontalo have already adhered to a family bonding system called ''pohala'a'', which is still found today.&lt;ref name="HBI"/&gt;

===Dutch East India Company period===
Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, the Gorontalo kingdoms were under the influence of the [[Ternate Sultanate]]. Gorontalo came under the administrative region of the [[Dutch East India Company]] with the formation of [[Gorontalo Regency]] as a result of a treaty between Governor Ternate Robertus Patbrugge and the Gorontalo king.&lt;ref name="HBI"/&gt;

During the [[Dutch East Indies]] period, Gorontaloan people began to emigrate out of Gorontalo region in the 18th century; to other regions such as [[Ternate]], [[Ambon Island]], [[Buol Island]], [[Banggai Island]] and [[Minahasa Regency]], in order to avoid the forced labor system that was enforced by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government in Gorontalo at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Henley|title=Fertility, Food and Fever: Population, Economy and Environment in North and Central Sulawesi, 1600-1930|year=2005|publisher=KITLV Press|isbn=90-671-8209-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were military-political alliance, which by the end of the 19th century they were fully colonized by the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In 1950 [[Gorontalo]] as a part of [[State of East Indonesia]] rejoined [[Indonesia]].

===Formation of Gorontalo province===
Before Gorontalo became a province of its own, the Gorontalo region was part of the [[North Sulawesi]] Province with a regency status. However on 5 December 2000, in accordance to Article 38 Year 2000, Gorontalo Regency became a separate province with the name Gorontalo Province. The [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] at that time, Soerjadi Soedirdja officiate the Gorontalo Province and appointed Tursandi Alwi as the governor. A year later, [[Fadel Muhammad]] was elected as the first governor of Gorontalo Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wartakota.tribunnews.com/2013/12/09/gorontalo-di-balik-semangat-memisahkan-diri |title=Gorontalo: Di Balik Semangat Memisahkan Diri |editor=Andy Pribadi |publisher=Wartakota |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
[[Gorontalo language]] is a member of the [[Austronesian languages]]. Apart from [[Gorontalo language]], there are several languages that are similar which are considered by linguists as Gorontaloan dialects include [[Suwawa language]], [[Atinggola language]], [[Limboto language]], [[Kwandang language]], [[Tilamuta language]] and [[Sumawata language]].&lt;ref name="MBG"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yus Badudu|title=Morfologi bahasa Gorontalo|year=1982|publisher=Djambatan|oclc=8550245}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gorontalo language]] is widely used due to the influence of the Gorontalo Kingdom that was once established in the region. [[Atinggola language]] is used by the Atinggola community situated on the northern coast of Gorontalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manadotopnews.com/2014/12/mengenal-asal-usul-suku-atinggola.html |title=Mengenal Asal Usul "Suku Atinggola" Gorontalo |publisher=Manado Top News |date=2 December 2014 |accessdate=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Gorontalo language]] itself have gone through assimilation with [[Manado Malay]], which is also widely spoken by Gorontaloan people. In terms of linguistic, [[Gorontalo language]] are related to languages from [[North Sulawesi]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="MBG"/&gt; [[Gorontalo language]] along with [[Mongondow language]] are part of the [[Gorontalo–Mongondow languages]], which is part of the [[Philippine languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3623084?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |title=The Greater Central Philippines Hypothesis |author=Robert Blust |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press, Oceanic Linguistics Vol. 30, No. 2 |pages=73–129 |doi=10.2307/3623084 |year=1991 |accessdate=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine languages]] that are linguistically close to the [[Gorontalo language]] are such as [[Tagalog language]], [[Cebu language]], [[Hiligaynon language]], [[Bikol language]] and [[Waray-waray language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul A Geraghty; Lois Carrington; Stephen Adolphe Wurm|title=FOCAL II: Papers from the Fourth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics|year=1986|publisher=Pacific linguistics. Series C, 94|isbn=08-588-3345-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Alexander Adelaar &amp; Nikolaus Himmelmann|title=The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=07-007-1286-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In present times, Gorontaloans used [[Latin alphabet]] for writing. However, the usage of Gorontaloan is limited to everyday living. In schools for education, the media, and official documents, the [[Indonesian language]] used as the national language.

==Religion==
Most of Gorontaloan people are loyal adherents of the [[Islamic]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khee Giap Tan; Mulya Amri; Linda Low; Kong Yam Tan|title=Competitiveness Analysis and Development Strategies for 33 Indonesian Provinces|year=2013|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=98-145-0486-6|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Aveling &amp; Damien Kingsbury|title=Autonomy and Disintegration in Indonesia|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=11-364-9809-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous traditional customs of the Gorontaloan people that contained Islamic influences. Only a small minority of Gorontaloan people that practices other religion apart from [[Islam]] such as [[Protestantism]] [[Christianity]] and [[Catholicism]] [[Christianity]].

Customs are regarded as an honor, norms and even as a guideline to implementing governance for the Gorontaloan community. This is attributed to the expression of "''Adat Bersendi Sara''" and "''Sara Bersendi Kitabullah''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Aveling &amp; Damien Kingsbury|title=Profil hak asasi manusia Indonesia|year=2006|publisher=Direktorat Sistem Informasi Hak Asasi Manusia, Direktorat Jenderal Perlindungan Hak Asasi Manusia, Departemen Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia|oclc=271789253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of these sayings is that customs (''adat'') are implemented based on rules (''sara''), while these rules must be based on the Islamic holy book, the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="HBI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Profil kependudukan [nama propinsi] tahun 2000: Gorontalo|year=2002|publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik|isbn=97-959-8980-4|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it is understood that the lives of the Gorontaloan people are full of religious values and noble values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alim S.

Gorontaloan people have a philosophy of life, namely, ''batanga pomaya, nyawa podungalo, harata potom bulu'' meaning, "the body is to defend the homeland, faithful to the end, wealth brings social problems" and ''lo iya lo ta uwa, ta uwa loloiya, boodila polucia hi lawo'' which means, "a leader is full of authority, but it's not arbitrary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbsulut/2015/05/17/didikan-moral-dalam-tujai-gorontalo/ |title=Didikan Moral Dalam Tuja’i Gorontalo |publisher=Kementerian Pendidikan Dan Kebudayaan |date=17 May 2015 |accessdate=2018-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210811/https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbsulut/2015/05/17/didikan-moral-dalam-tujai-gorontalo/ |archivedate=18 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

===Socio-economics===
The main traditional occupation of the Gorontaloan people has long been agriculture. Gorontaloans plays an important part in forestry, agriculture and fishery industries. Crafting and livestock farms are secondary means of income.

In the past, there were large extensions of extended family who could carry out joint agricultural farming in mountainous region that requires a lot of soil cultivating work. The elderly father and mother are regarded as the main hosts, which is reflected in the [[Gorontalo language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiste.org/Journals/index.php/RHSS/article/view/8363/8493 |title=Appellation in Gorontalese: An Antropolinguistics Approach towards Language and Culture in Gorontalo, Indonesia |author=Karmin Baruadi |publisher=International Knowledge Sharing Platform, Research on Humanities and Social Sciences Vol.3, No.16 |date=2013 |issn=2222-1719 |accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has not adopted a variety of intimate forms of addressing to parents and older relatives.

===Architecture===
The main type of Gorontaloan settlement are the villages. The traditional house is called Dulohupa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.voi.co.id/voi-features/7065-dulohupa-gorontalo-traditional-house |title=Dulohupa, Gorontalo Traditional House |publisher= |accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a frame structure built on stilts. It is built with choice timber and its roofing is made of straws. The house is then divided into several rooms. By the entrance are two staircases. In the past, Dulohupa is usually used to carry out discussions by the royal rulers. Traditional Dulohupa house can still be found in several sub-districts in [[Gorontalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpsmpsangiran/2017/10/19/mengenal-rumah-adat-dulohupa-di-gorontalo-sulawesi-utara/ |title=Mengenal Rumah Adat Dulohupa di Gorontalo, Sulawesi Utara |author=Wiwit Hermanto |publisher=Kementerian Pendidikan Dan Kebudayaan |date=19 October 2017 |accessdate=2018-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210606/https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpsmpsangiran/2017/10/19/mengenal-rumah-adat-dulohupa-di-gorontalo-sulawesi-utara/ |archivedate=18 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2016/01/21/02080741/Pemangku.Adat.Gorontalo.Satukan.Persepsi.Pemberian.Gelar.Adat |title=Pemangku Adat Gorontalo Satukan Persepsi Pemberian Gelar Adat |author=Kontributor Gorontalo &amp; Rosyid A Azhar |publisher=Kompas |date=21 January 2016 |accessdate=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Dulohupa, there is another traditional Gorontalo house called, Bandayo Poboide. However the existence of the Bandayo Poboide is almost extinct throughout the entire region of [[Gorontalo]]. One of the very few remaining Bandayo Poboide is situated in front of the Gorontalo Regent's office at Jenderal Sudirman Road, [[Limboto, Gorontalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Syamsidar|title=Arsitektur tradisional daerah Sulawesi Utara|year=1991|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan, Direktorat Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional, Proyek Inventarisasi dan Pembinaan Nilai-Nilai Budaya|oclc=25008655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kamerabudaya.com/2017/09/rumah-dolohupa-dan-bandayo-pomboide-rumah-adat-gorontalo.html |title=Rumah Dolohupa dan Bandayo Pomboide, Rumah Adat Gorontalo |author= |publisher=Kamera Budaya |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several traditional customs from the Gorontaloan community, among them:-
* Momonto and Modutu wedding customs. In the traditional wedding customs of the Gorontaloan people, there are few regulations and procedures that must be carried out by both of the bride and bridegroom. Gorontaloan people still hold onto the generational traditions as part of their customs and culture. The wedding ceremony is carried out alternately in both of the house of the bride and bridegroom. The wedding ceremony can last for more than two days. Relatives will work collectively in preparing the wedding ceremony for a few days prior to the wedding day. Both of the bride and bridegroom will dress in the traditional attire, Bili’u. The bridal bedroom is used during the wedding reception in accordance to the Gorontaloan customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farha Daulima|title=Tata cara adat perkawinan: pada masyarakat adat suku Gorontalo|year=2006|publisher=Forum Suara Perempuan, LSM Mbu'i Bungale|oclc=271863151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samin Radjik Nur|title=Perkawinan adat Gorontalo|year=1965|publisher=Jajasan Penerbitan Universitas Hasanuddin|oclc=23553967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMDMRAPG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mahligai-indonesia.com/pernikahan-nusantara/prosesi-adat/upacara-momondho-dan-modutu-ritual-adat-pernikahan-gorontalo-5552 |title=Upacara Momondho dan Modutu : Prosesi Pra Pernikahan Adat Gorontalo |publisher=Mahligai |date=7 November 2017 |accessdate=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Molontalo or Tontalo (Seventh Month Ceremony), is a customary ceremony as an expression of gratitude once a pregnancy period reaches the seventh month. In holding this customary event, both of the unborn child's parents must put on traditional Gorontaloan attire. A little girl will be carried by the prospective father, circling the house and finally enters the house into the room to meet his pregnant wife. After the prospective father and the little girl meets the pregnant wife, a string made of coconut leaf that was tied around the pregnant wife previously will be severed.

'''Green Up Day''', observed on the first Saturday of May, is a statewide effort in the US state of [[Vermont]] to clean up [[litter|roadside trash]].  

== History ==
The first Green Up Day was April 18, 1970 and was started by Governor [[Deane C. Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reformer.com/stories/letter-keep-green-up-day-alive,506544|title=Letter: Keep Green Up Day alive|last=Hill|first=Will|date=2017-05-05|work=The Brattleboro Reformer|access-date=2018-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenupvermont.org/?page_id=1137|title=History {{!}} Green Up Vermont|website=www.greenupvermont.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Green Up Vermont became a [[non-profit organization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A small portion of the funding for the event comes from a state appropriation, with Green Up Vermont making up the remainder through individual donations and corporate sponsors. Vermont is the only state without an [[Adopt-a-Highway|Adopt-A-Highway]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/get-involved/volunteer/adopt-a-highway/faq.html|title=Adopt-a-Highway - FAQ|last=State of Texas|first=Texas Department of Transportation|date=|website=www.txdot.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead continues the grassroots tradition of Green Up Day, in which people of all ages can take part.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/vermont/articles/2017-05-04/vermonters-green-up-their-state-each-spring|title=Green up Day a Nearly 50-Year-Old Tradition in Vermont|last=Rathke|first=Lisa|date=2017-05-04|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|access-date=2018-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Vermont|State of Vermont]] cleans up the State Highways, and Green Up Day volunteers clean up all the town roads.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Process==
Green trash bags are distributed throughout the state which are then used by volunteers to clean up the roads in their area.  Citizens can pick up bags at the local [[town hall]] or other community location. The volunteers are often asked to pick a location that they will be responsible for which is often the road on which they live. The bags are often left on the road side for pick up by town road crews or volunteers will be asked to bring bags to a specific location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stowetoday.com/news_and_citizen/news/local_news/green-up-vermont-this-saturday/article_da9dcfda-30e1-11e7-97ee-2bdda472dfad.html|title=Green Up Vermont this Saturday|last=Cross|first=Caleigh|date=2017-05-04|work=Stowe Today|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Martin|first2=Andrew|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; All towns have a coordinator who can be contacted with questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenupvermont.org/?page_id=41|title=Get Involved {{!}} Green Up Vermont|website=www.greenupvermont.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.subaruvt.com/community/green-up-day-vermont.htm|title=Green Up Day|last=Subaru|first=Burlington|date=|website=www.subaruvt.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haitian Cubans''' ({{lang-es|Haitiano-Cubano}}; {{lang-fr|Haïtien Cubain}}; {{lang-ht|Ayisyen Kiben}}) are [[Cubans|Cuban]] citizens of full or partial [[Haitians|Haitian]] ancestry.

==Origins==
Haitian culture and [[French language|French]] and [[Haitian Creole]] languages, first entered [[Cuba]] with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791-1804 [[Haitian Revolution]] brought a wave of French settlers fleeing with their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially [[Guantanamo]], where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. 

By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in [[Baracoa]] and [[Maisí]], the furthest eastern municipalities of the province.

==Haitian immigrant workers (1912-1939)==
Due to the [[United States occupation of Haiti]], many Haitians left to find work as laborers in neighboring countries like Cuba.  These immigrants lived a fine line trying to maintain their Haitian culture and assimilating enough to be able to work and live in a foreign society.  In 1937, over 25,000 Haitians were forcibly removed from Cuba and shipped back to Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Marc C. McLeod, "Undesirable Aliens: Race, Ethnicity, and Nationalism in the Comparison of Haitian and British West Indian Workers in Cuba, 1912-1939." Journal of Social History (1998): 599-614., 599&lt;/ref&gt; This different treatment of migrant laborers is due to several factors. Cuban racists beliefs combined with economic concerns were a direct catalyst for this drastic Haitian exodus.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, 603&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution===
Cubans feared a reply of the Haitian Revolution, which was not quelled by the current guerrilla warfare in Haiti by the [[Cacos (military group)|caco]] forces against the Americans. Similarly, black Haitians were stereotyped as being violent and rife with crime,&lt;ref name="McLeod, 601"&gt;McLeod, 601&lt;/ref&gt; as the subject of stereotypes wasn't uncommon in Cuba, as black Cubans are often stereotyped the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/a-lesson-from-cuba-on-race/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |title=A Lesson From Cuba on Race |accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Haitian practice of vodou, was often mistaken for  "witchcraft." &lt;ref&gt;McLeod, 602&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The vast majority of Haitians spoke Haitian Creole, which created a language barrier forcing Haitians to remain in agricultural labor.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, 607&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing practices===
Haitians lived in small communities near the sugar cane plantations, very rural and removed from populous cities.&lt;ref name="McLeod, 609"&gt;McLeod, 609&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Economic restraints amongst Haitians kept education informal and contained in their small communities, as such, very few of these Haitians had anything above a basic level of Creole literacy. This enabled Haitians to keep control over the cultural values their children received.&lt;ref name="McLeod, 609"/&gt;

===Haitian religion===
Majority of Haitians are Catholic but vodou is also present behind the scenes. Vodou is decentralized and flexible. The rituals involved in vodou strengthen community ties and help the oppressed Haitians deal with their suffering.&lt;ref name="McLeod, 610"&gt;McLeod, 610&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent years==
Haitians have continued to come to Cuba to work as [[Bracero program|braceros]] (hand workers, from the Spanish word brazo, meaning "arm") in the fields cutting cane. Their living and working conditions were not much better than slavery. Although they planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba. For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify themselves as such or speak Creole. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians continued to suffer discrimination. But according to the [[Fidel Castro]] regime, since 1959, when he took over, this discrimination has stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrocubaweb.com/haiticuba.htm "Haiti in Cuba", ''AfroCubanWeb'']&lt;/ref&gt; After Spanish, [[Haitian Creole]] is the second most-spoken language in Cuba where over 300,000 recent [[Afro-Cuban#Haitian Creole among Afro-Cubans|Haitian immigrants]] speak it. It is recognized as a language in Cuba and a considerable number of Cubans speak it fluently. Most of these speakers have never been to Haiti and do not possess Haitian ancestry, but merely learned it in their communities. In addition to the eastern provinces, there are also communities in [[Ciego de Ávila]] and [[Camagüey]] provinces where the population still maintains Creole, their mother tongue. Classes in Creole are offered in Guantanamo, [[Matanzas]] and the City of [[Havana]]. There is a Creole-language radio program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrocubaweb.com/haiticuba.htm Haiti in Cuba]&lt;/ref&gt;. Haitian immigration to Cuba has increased since a re-establishment of [[Cuba-Haiti relations|diplomatic relations]] in 1997.

'''Japanese Chileans''' ({{lang-es|Japonés Chileno}} or ''Nipo-chileno'', {{lang-ja|日系チリ人}} ''Nikkei Chiri-jin'') are [[Chileans]] with ethnic origin from [[Japan]]. The first Japanese in Chile were 126 immigrants hired to work in the mining industry in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson, Daniel M. and Sayaka Funada-Classen. (2004), ''[[The Japanese in Latin America: The Asian American Experience]],'' p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}}, Japan's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] estimated there to be a total of roughly 2,600 Japanese people living in Chile. Among them were 1,108 temporary residents, 504 permanent residents, and approximately a thousand born locally.&lt;ref name="MOFA"/&gt;

==History==
The number of Japanese settlers in Chile never exceeded 900 between 1910 and 1940. Among those who entered the nation, there was a wide diversity of occupations ranging from professionals and businessmen to laborers re-migrating from neighboring countries, especially [[Peru]] which has the second largest Japanese population in Latin America and the sixth largest in world. They mostly settled in the [[nitrate]]-rich north and to the southern regions of Valparaíso and Santiago. They found employment in a variety of jobs as salaried workers and in small business interests, especially as barbers. The early Nikkei community was largely male. The majority of Issei men married Chilean women.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Their children, the Nisei, were raised with the belief of "If they are going to live in Chile, let them be Chilean".{{clarify|date=June 2012}}
[[File:チリ日系移住写真展.jpg|thumb|Photo Exposition of the Japanese Immigration to Chile by the [http://nikkeivalparaiso.hana.bi Corporación Nikkei Región de Valparaíso]]]
However, [[World War II]] incited anti-Japanese sentiments and interrupted the Nikkei’s process of integration into Chilean society. Starting in early 1943, several dozen Japanese Chileans were forced to move from strategically sensitive areas (such as [[copper]] mines) to the interior of the country. Meanwhile, the Japanese community became more united, offering mutual support in the face of wartime oppositions. These ties would later be formalized after the war with the organization of the Japanese Beneficence Society (''Sociedad Japonesa de Beneficencia'').

By the 1990s, Chilean Nikkei enjoyed middle-class status, a high educational level, and employment in white-collar jobs. Contrary to trends in other [[Latin America]]n countries with a Nikkei population, less than 5% of the ethnic Japanese population has gone to Japan to work as ''[[dekasegi]]s''. The small size of the Japanese community, its lack of unity, and the increase of mixed marriages call into question the future of the Chilean Nikkei. There are an estimated 3,800 Japanese and people of Japanese descent in Chile.

Today, the new generations are maintaining some of their traditions, such as the japanese language and cultural events such as Hanami, and the Valparaíso Japan Festival (&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nikkeivalparaiso.hana.bi/2016/02/japonvalpo/ |title=Festival Japón Valparaíso |website=Festival Japón Valparaíso }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) through organizations such as the Valparaíso Región Nikkei Corporation (Corporación Nikkei Región de Valparaíso&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nikkeivalparaiso.hana.bi|title=Corporación Nikkei Región de Valparaíso {{!}} バルパライソ日系人協会|website=nikkeivalparaiso.hana.bi|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Language==
Most Japanese Chileans only speak Spanish. Only a select few can speak Japanese, while those with higher education speak [[English language|English]]. There are even a number of Japanese Chilean schools that offer English-language teaching to recent Japanese residents.

==Religion==
The majority of Japanese Chileans are Roman Catholic Christians, while the rest are Buddhists and Shintoists.

[[File:Quadrille.jpg|right|thumb|Fontanne in ''[[Quadrille (play)|Quadrille]]'' in 1952]]

'''Lynn Fontanne''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|æ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fontanne | title=Fontanne | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=14 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 December 1887 – 30 July 1983) was a British-born American-based actress for over 40 years. She teamed with her husband, [[Alfred Lunt]]. Lunt and Fontanne were given special [[Tony Awards]] in  1970. They both won [[Emmy Award]]s in 1965, and Broadway's [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]] was named for them. Fontanne is regarded as one of the American theater's great leading ladies of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatrewashington.org/content/helen-hayes-remembrance Helen Hayes Remembrance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Lillie Louise Fontanne in [[Woodford, London]], of French and Irish descent, her parents were Jules Fontanne and Frances Ellen Thornley. She had two sisters, one of whom later lived in England; the other lived in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Stars of the American Stage'' Profile ''#94'' c.1954 2nd. Edition by Daniel Blum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She drew acclaim in 1921 playing the title role in the [[George S. Kaufman]]-[[Marc Connelly]] farce, ''Dulcy''. [[Dorothy Parker]] memorialized her performance in verse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Dulcy'', take our gratitude,
All your words are gold ones.
Mistress of the platitude,
Queen of all the old ones.
You, at last, are something new
'Neath the theatre's dome. I'd
Mention to the cosmos, you
Swing a wicked bromide. ...&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Parker|Parker, Dorothy]]. "Lynn Fontanne." [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']]. 24 November 1921. p. 3; {{cite book|last=Silverstein|first=Stuart Y., ed.|title=Not Much Fun: The Lost Poems of Dorothy Parker|publisher=Scribner|date=1996 |origyear=paperback 2001|location=New York|page=100|isbn=0-7432-1148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She soon became celebrated for her skill as an actress in high comedy, excelling in witty roles written for her by [[Noël Coward]], [[S.N. Behrman]], and [[Robert E. Sherwood|Robert Sherwood]]. However, she enjoyed one of the greatest critical successes of her career as Nina Leeds, the desperate heroine of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s controversial nine-act drama ''[[Strange Interlude]]''. From the late 1920s on, Fontanne acted exclusively in vehicles also starring her husband. Among their greatest theater triumphs were ''[[Design for Living]]'' (1933), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1935–36), ''[[Idiot's Delight (play)|Idiot's Delight]]'' (1936), ''[[There Shall Be No Night]]'' (1940), and ''[[Quadrille (play)|Quadrille]]'' (1952). ''Design for Living'', which Coward wrote expressly for himself and the Lunts, was so [[Sexually suggestive|risqué]], with its theme of [[bisexual]]ity and a [[ménage à trois]], that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing it would not survive the censor in London. The duo remained active onstage until retiring from stage performances in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1351472/Lunt-and-Fontanne|title="Lunt and Fontanne," Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fontanne was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play|Tony Award]] for one of her last stage roles, in ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grange|first=William|title=Historical Dictionary of Postwar German Literature|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0810867710|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UigRl8uBBycC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fontanne and Lunt worked together in 27 productions.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Of her acting style with Lunt, British broadcasting personality [[Arthur Marshall (broadcaster)|Arthur Marshall]] - having seen her in ''Caprice'' [[St James's Theatre]] (1929) - observed: "In the plays of the period, actors waited to speak until somebody else had finished; the Lunts turned all that upside down. They threw away lines, they trod on each others words, they gabbled, they spoke at the same time. They spoke, in fact, as people do in ordinary life."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Arthur.
''Life's Rich Pageant'', BBC Radio Collection, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fontanne made only four films but nevertheless was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1931 for ''[[The Guardsman]]'', losing to [[Helen Hayes]]. She also appeared in the [[silent films]] ''[[Second Youth (1924 film)|Second Youth]]'' (1924) and ''The Man Who Found Himself'' (1925). She and husband Alfred also were in ''[[Hollywood Canteen (1944 film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944) in which they had cameos as themselves. The Lunts starred in four television productions in the 1950s and 1960s with both Lunt and Fontanne winning [[Emmy Award]]s in 1965 for ''[[The Magnificent Yankee (1965 film)|The Magnificent Yankee]]'',&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; {{cnspan|becoming the first married couple to win the award for playing a married couple.|date=November 2016}} Fontanne narrated the 1960 television production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'' starring [[Mary Martin]] and received a second Emmy nomination for playing [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Grand Duchess Marie]] in the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] telecast of ''Anastasia'' in 1967, two of the few productions in which she appeared without her husband. The Lunts also starred in several radio dramas in the 1940s, notably on the [[Theatre Guild]] programme. Many of these broadcasts still survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0285007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 1958, the former Globe Theatre, at Broadway and 46th Street, originally opened in 1910 and later turned into a motion picture venue after the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]], was reopened after a massive gut renovation and renamed the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]]. On that day the Lunts opened their new house with, ''The Visit'', by [[Dürrenmatt]]. After 189 performances, ''The Visit'' would be their last appearance on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lunt-Fontanne Theater|url=http://www.playbill.com/reference/theatre_info/2174.html|publisher=Playbill.com|accessdate=28 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429075823/http://www.playbill.com/reference/theatre_info/2174.html|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years later, on 5 May 1978, Lynn Fontanne, aged ninety, was honored at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, during a revival performance of [[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]], by its star [[Carol Channing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klemesrud|first1=Judy|title=Lynn Fontanne, at 90, Talks of Love|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|date=24 April 1978|url=http://nyti.ms/1CbzKE1|page=C17}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reminiscence of that evening, "An Evening with Lynn Fontanne", was published on-line by [[Martha Rofheart]], a former [[protégée]] of Fontanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rofheart|first1=Martha|title=An Evening With Lynn Fontanne|url=http://www.chorusgypsy.com/stars.html|website=Chorus Gypsy|publisher=Hodes|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuhn|first1=Eric|title=M Rofheart Obituary|url=https://archive.org/details/MarthaObitEHStar|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=The East Hampton Star|publisher=The East Hampton Star|date=June 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Lunt and Fontanne were presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by then-President [[Lyndon Johnson]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Like Lunt, Fontanne was a member of the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterhalloffame.org/members.html#F|title=Theater Hall of Fame members}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fontanne was also a [[Kennedy Center]] honoree in 1980.

Some of her costumes are curated in the [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, [[Mount Mary University]] (formerly known as Mount Mary College) Historic Costume Collection.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HHxQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7xIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3402,2929838&amp;dq=mount-mary-college+historic+costume+collection Lynn Fontanne 'look' lives on]." ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]''. 10 October 1983. Retrieved 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were married for 55 years and were inseparable both on and off the stage. [[File:Alfred Lunt Lynn Fontanne 1950.JPG|thumb|left|Lunt and Fontanne in 1950.]]
Fontanne went to great lengths to avoid divulging her true age.

==Pronunciation of surname==
Asked once how to pronounce her surname, she told the ''[[Literary Digest]]'' she preferred the French way, but "If the French is too difficult for American consumption, both syllables should be equally accented, and the ''a'' should be more or less broad": ''fon-tahn''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]].

'''Maria Susan Rye''', (31 March 1829 – 12 November 1903), was a social reformer and a promoter of emigration from England, especially of young women living in Liverpool [[workhouse]]s, to the colonies of the [[British Empire]], especially Canada.

==Early life==
She was born at 2 Lower James Street, [[Golden Square]], in [[central London]], on 31 March 1829. She was the eldest of the nine children of [[Edward Rye]], solicitor and bibliophile, and Maria Tuppen. Edward Rye of [[Baconsthorpe]], Norfolk, was her grandfather. Of her brothers, [[Edward Caldwell Rye]] was an entomologist, and [[Walter Rye]], solicitor, antiquary, and athlete, published works on [[History of Norfolk|Norfolk history]] and topography and was [[List of Lord Mayors of Norwich|mayor of Norwich]] in 1908–9.{{sfn|Owen|1912}}

Maria Rye received her education at home and read for herself in the large library of her father. Coming under the influence of [[Charles Kingsley]]'s father, then vicar of [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea|St Luke's Church]], she devoted herself at the age of sixteen to parochial work [[Chelsea, London|in Chelsea]]. She was impressed by the lack of opportunity of employment for women outside the teaching profession. In succession to [[Mary Howitt]], she soon became secretary of the association for promoting the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|Married Women's Property bill]], which was brought forward by Sir [[Thomas Erskine Perry]] in 1856 but was not fully passed [[Married Women's Property Act 1882|till 1882]].

She joined the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] on its foundation, but, disapproving of the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's franchise movement]] which the leading members supported, soon left it. In 1859, she undertook a private law-stationer's business at 12 Portugal Street, [[Lincoln's Inn]], in order to give employment to middle class girls. At the same time, she helped to establish the [[Victoria Press]] in association with her business in 1860 (under the charge of [[Emily Faithfull]]), and the [[employment bureau]] and telegraph school in Great Coram Street, with [[Isa Knox (writer)|Isa Craig]] as secretary. The telegraph school anticipated the employment of girls as telegraph clerks.{{sfn|Owen|1912}}

The law-stationer's business prospered, but the applications for employment were far in excess of the demands of the concern. With [[Jane Lewin]], she consequently raised a fund for assisting middle class girls to emigrate, and to the question of emigration she devoted the rest of her life.

==Emigration==
She founded, in 1861, the [[Female Middle class Emigration Society]] (absorbed since 1884 in the [[United British Women's Emigration Association]]). Between 1860 and 1868, she was instrumental in sending girls of the middle class and domestic servants to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and she visited these colonies to form committees for the protection of the emigrants.{{sfn|Owen|1912}}

From 1868, when she handed over her law business to Lewin, Rye devoted herself exclusively to the emigration of pauper children, or, in a phrase which she herself coined, 'gutter children.' After visiting in New York the [[Little Wanderers' Home]] for the training of derelict children for emigrant life which Mr. Van Meter, a Baptist minister from Ohio, had founded, she resolved to give the system a trial in London. Encouraged by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]] and ''The Times'' newspaper and with the financial support of [[William Rathbone VI]], M.P., in 1869 she purchased Avenue House, High Street, Peckham, and with her two younger sisters, in spite of public opposition and prejudice, took there from the streets or the workhouses waifs and strays from the ages of three to sixteen. Fifty girls from Kirkdale [[industrial school]], Liverpool, were soon put under her care ; they were trained in [[domestic economy]] and went through courses of general and religious instruction.

At [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara]], [[Canada]], Miss Rye also acquired a building which she called 'Our Western Home.' It was opened on 1 December 1869. To this house Miss Rye drafted the children from [[Peckham]], and after further training they were distributed in Canada as domestic servants among respectable families. The first party left England in October 1869. She received a [[civil list pension]] of £10 in 1871.

[[Poor law]] children were subsequently received at Peckham from [[St. George's, Hanover Square]], Wolverhampton, Bristol, Reading, and other towns. By 1891 Rye had found homes in Canada for some five hundred children. She accompanied each batch of emigrants, and visited the children already settled there. The work was continued with great success for over a quarter of a century, and did much to diminish the vicious habits and the stigma of pauperism. Lord Shaftesbury remained a consistent supporter, and in 1884 [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne]], then [[governor-general of Canada]], warmly commended the results of her pioneer system, which [[Thomas John Barnardo]] and others subsequently adopted and extended.{{sfn|Owen|1912}}

==Later life==
In 1895, owing to the continuous strain, Miss Rye transferred the two institutions in Peckham and Niagara with their funds to the Church of England Waifs and Strays Society (now [[The Children's Society]]). In her farewell report of 1895 she stated that 4000 English and Scottish children then in Canada had been sent out from her home in England.{{sfn|Owen|1912}}

She retired with her sister Elizabeth to 'Baconsthorpe,' [[Hemel Hempstead]], where she spent the remainder of her life. There she died, after four years' suffering, of intestinal cancer on 12 November 1903, and was buried in the churchyard. {{sfn|Owen|1912}}

[[File:NAIA Terminal 3 2009 MC.jpg|thumb|NAIA facade where the bullet-planting incident took place]]
In September 2015, reports of passengers at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] (NAIA) in [[Manila]] being accosted and fined for possessing bullet ammunition began to receive attention from the public and later both the local and international press. These incidents were alleged to be part of a '''"[[Planting evidence|bullet planting]]" scheme''' (locally known as '''laglag-bala''' [drop bullet] or '''tanim bala''' [plant bullet]) done by airport security personnel as a means of [[extortion]].&lt;ref name="asian journal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Constante|first1=Agnes|title=US-bound Filipino latest victim in alleged bullet planting scheme at NAIA|url=http://asianjournal.com/news/us-bound-filipino-latest-victim-in-alleged-bullet-planting-scheme-at-naia/|accessdate=5 November 2015|publisher=Asian Journal|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Medenilla|first1=Samuel|last2=Postrado|first2=Leonard|last3=Fernandez|first3=Ariel|title=‘Tanim-bala’ sowing fear among tourists|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/tanim-bala-sowing-fear-among-tourists/|accessdate=5 November 2015|publisher=Manila Bulletin|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diebelius|first1=Georgia|title=Airport under investigation after security guards are accused of extorting passengers for hundreds of pounds by planting BULLETS in luggage|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3300065/Ninoy-Aquino-International-airport-investigation-security-guards-accused-extorting-passengers-HUNDREDS-pounds-planting-bullets-luggage.html|accessdate=5 November 2015|work=Mail Online|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 5 November, at least thirty cases of the scheme were recorded in 2015, according to the [[Philippine National Police Aviation Security Group]] (PNP-AVSEGROUP), with the [[Manila International Airport Authority]] (MIAA) recording only five such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/111805-mar-roxas-laglag-bala-syndicate|title = Roxas on laglag-bala scheme: 'Syndicates must pay'|last = Cupin|first = Bea|date = 5 November 2015|work = [[Rappler]]|access-date = 8 November 2015|via = Rappler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In early November 2015, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] ordered the [[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] to conduct an investigation of the alleged scheme. The [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) later confirmed that an extortion syndicate is behind the bullet planting scheme, based on their initial findings. According to the NBI's investigation, some porters are involved in identifying potential victims of the bullet planting scam. Allegedly, airport officials in the security and immigration services present in the four terminals of the airport pursue target victims after their identification by porters. Usual victims were found to be the elderly and "[[Overseas Filipino Workers|overseas Filipino workers]]" (OFWs).&lt;ref name=tourism&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carvajal|first1=Nancy|title=Naia syndicate confirmed|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/737013/naia-syndicate-confirmed|accessdate=5 November 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Politicians===
On 31 October, Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] filed a resolution at the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] calling for the creation of a task force to tackle the issue. On the same day, Senator [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] called for the resignation of airport officials if they will not determine and catch the ones responsible behind the bullet planting incidents within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="calls for probe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Santiago, Cayetano call for probe of reported 'tanim bala' scam|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/10/31/Santiago-Cayetano-probe-tanim-bala-scam.html|accessdate=5 November 2015|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Davao City]] mayor [[Rodrigo Duterte]], a presumptive presidential candidate in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 Philippine presidential election]], further alleged that a syndicate is behind the series of incidents. Duterte said the operation had been going on for more than two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/11/01/Davao-Mayor-Rodrigo-Rody-Duterte-tanim-bala-laglag-bala-airport-extortion-modus.html|title = Duterte says syndicate is behind 'tanim bala' extortion scheme|last = Tesiorna|first = Ben O.|date = 3 November 2015|work = CNN Philippines|access-date = 3 November 2015|via = cnnphilippines.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 4 November, former [[Secretary of the Interior and Local Government (Philippines)|Interior and Local Government Secretary]] and ruling-party presidential candidate for the 2016 elections [[Mar Roxas]] defended the [[Presidency of Benigno Aquino III#Administration and cabinet|administration]] over the controversy, stating that bullet carriers have to take responsibility, saying: "If you enter the airport with contraband, then how does that become the government's problem?" He further stated that government data showed these cases mostly involved tourists coming from shooting ranges and had bullets for souvenir, telling reporters it is inconsistent with the administration's ''Daang Matuwid'' (Straight Path) slogan to extort money from people. During a press briefing at the NAIA earlier that day, transportation officials said 6,000 cases have been recorded since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/111722-mar-roxas-laglag-bala-carrier-responsibility|title = Roxas on laglag-bala: Bullet carrier has to take responsibility|last = Dullana|first = Raymon|date = 4 November 2015|work = [[Rappler]]|access-date = 6 November 2015|via = rappler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government and critics ===
On 6 November, [[Secretary of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment Secretary]] [[Rosalinda Baldoz]] announced the creation of an inter-agency team tasked to monitor and assist OFW victims of the bullet planting scam. The inter-agency team was to be composed of representatives from the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]], the [[Philippine Overseas Employment Administration]], and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, among others; the team would coordinate with the MIAA, the PNP-AVSEGROUP, the [[Office for Transportation Security]], the NBI, and the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DOLE creates inter-agency team to aid OFW 'tanim-bala' victims|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/11/07/15/dole-creates-inter-agency-team-to-aid-ofw-tanim-bala-victims|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=[[ABS-CBNnews.com]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]]|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November, during a coffee meeting with reporters at the sidelines of the [[ASEAN Summit]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], President Aquino said that the statistics presented to him do not necessarily add up to the possibility that an extortion racket exists inside NAIA. He said that the controversy on the supposed "laglag bala" extortion racket in airports had been "sensationalized" and used by certain groups to put his administration in a bad light. He expressed sympathy toward "innocent airport employees" who have been affected by the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545479/news/pinoyabroad/laglag-bala-issue-sensationalized-to-be-used-vs-admin-pnoy|title = Laglag-bala issue sensationalized to be used vs. admin –PNoy|last = Alvarez|first = Kathrina Charmaine|date = 23 November 2015|work = [[GMA News Online]]|access-date = 25 November 2015|via = gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in another [[GMA News Online]] report posted the following day and culled from an exclusive report by Jun Veneracion on [[GMA News Live|GMA News]]' early evening newscast ''[[24 Oras]]'', a memo from the [[Office for Transportation Security]] (OTS) dated show of 3 June 2015 that the OTS has a cash reward policy for finding contraband items such as weapons and explosives at security checkpoints, providing for rewards of up to ₱1,000 for explosives, weapons, "stunning devices" and dangerous drugs found by OTS personnel or Security Screening Officers (SSOs). Transport Security Risk Management Bureau assistant administrative director Roberto Almadin confirmed the existence of the memo, but he said only two to three people have been given rewards. He also asked the public to disassociate the memo from the "laglag-bala" extortion scheme. The memo, signed by OTS administrator Roland Recomono, also stated that the rewards were instituted "to boost the welfare and morale of OTS personnel". A later memo dated 8 July had a revision of the category list, indicating that OTS personnel could claim rewards for a single piece of explosive and for every five pieces of ammunition found per month. Spocky Farolan, the legal counsel of an overseas Filipino worker who almost lost her job due to the alleged scheme, said the memo's lack of publicity could make the public more suspicious of the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545675/news/nation/ots-provides-cash-rewards-for-finding-contraband-official-memo|title = OTS provides cash rewards for finding contraband — official memo|last = Takumi|first = Rie|date = 24 November 2015|work = GMA News Online|access-date = 25 November 2015|via = gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, 25 November, [[GMA Network]]'s ''[[Unang Hirit|Unang Balita]]'' reported that another overseas Filipino worker on his way to Macau for a vacation was prevented from boarding his flight on 23 November when he was caught with a bullet in his bag at the NAIA. The bullet was allegedly found in passenger Gerard Ubarde's bag containing medicines. Ubarde said it was impossible for a bullet to be in his bag since he knew it was against the law to carry one. He was immediately released after the case was dismissed. Meanwhile, the MIAA installed disposal booths at NAIA to give passengers a chance to rid their bags of banned items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545731/news/pinoyabroad/ofw-on-the-way-to-macau-caught-with-bullet-at-naia|title = OFW on the way to Macau caught with bullet at NAIA|last = KG|first = |date = 25 November 2015|work = GMA News Online|access-date = 25 November 2015|via = gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, also on 25 November, the camp of American national Michael Lane White expressed disappointment in the Philippines' justice system, which they perceived to be slow in resolving their "laglag-bala" case. White's camp expected the court to junk the case that day; a counter-motion from former Office for Transportation Security screeners prevented this. "Every time we come in here were expecting it to be dismissed and it just keeps getting kicked down the road so I don't know. We have hope in the Lord but our hope in the court system here is fading fast," White's father, Ryan, was quoted as saying in a report from ''24 Oras''. White said his son was already feeling ill due to the stress he was facing from repeatedly having to attend court hearings. He also said they were not pleased with President Aquino's recent statement on the incidence of "lagla-bala" at the NAIA. "If this is just a few random bandits running around and extorting people, this would have been squashed long ago. But the fact that it is still going on means that the entire airport is corrupt," he said. Ryan White was alleged to have had a bullet in his luggage when he checked through NAIA last September, possession of which is a crime in Philippine law. White's camp was reported to be holding out hope that their case would be resolved the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545812/news/nation/camp-of-american-with-laglag-bala-case-laments-slow-pace-of-phl-justice|title = Camp of American with 'laglag-bala' case laments slow pace of PHL justice|last = Medina|first = Andrei|date = 25 November 2015|work = GMA News Online|access-date = 25 November 2015|via = gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] has ordered new Aviation Security Group chief Mao Aplasca to its personnel that no arrests will be made nor conviction on airport passengers caught with bullets in their luggages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/07/16/duterte-orders-end-to-tanim-bala|title=Duterte orders end to 'tanim-bala'|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|last=Esperas|first=Raoul|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media and applications===
There was public outcry among Filipinos in the social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isang bala ka lang: Netizens decry 'laglag-bala' incident|url=http://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/110965-laglag-bala-naia-netizens-reaction|accessdate=5 November 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition decrying the incident was started with about 12,000 people signing the petition as of 31 October 2015.&lt;ref name="calls for probe"/&gt; [[Internet meme]]s also spread on [[Facebook]] against the government and Roxas for their downplaying, and/or denying, the "laglag bala" scheme as a problem. One meme also pointed out the MIAA chairman's (retired major general Jose Angel Honrado's) being a cousin of President Aquino and the [[Secretary of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communication secretary]]'s ([[Joseph Emilio Abaya|Jun Abaya]]'s) being a great-grandchild of turn-of-the-20th-century revolutionary [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] (recently depicted in the popular movie ''[[Heneral Luna]]'' as a possible traitor).

Mobile game applications launched by Kulit Games and Mesocyclone Studios, entitled ''Tanim Bala'', were inspired by the NAIA bullet planting scheme. They can be downloaded via the [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)]] store, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.inquirer.net/45191/look-tanim-bala-game-available-on-google-play|title=LOOK: ‘Tanim-bala’ game available on Google Play|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=5 November 2015|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
A Japanese TV show satirically re-enacted the scandal, showing the theory of how the NAIA personnel may have supposedly planted bullets in travelers' bags. The host explained that the personnel would plant the bullets in the travelers' bags at [[airport security]]. Upon finding the bullets through the [[X-ray generator#Security|baggage x-ray machine]], the personnel would open the bag to retrieve the bullets and offer the victim a fine to skip questioning and detention. It then showed footage of bags being wrapped in plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japanese TV show reenacts laglag bala in PHL airports|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/543344/news/nation/japanese-tv-show-reenacts-laglag-bala-in-phl-airports|accessdate=5 November 2015|publisher=GMA News Online|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hong Kong]] news sites [[Hong Kong Free Press]] and ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'' published their own reports over the "laglag-bala" scheme. On 4 November, Thursday, [[Fox News]] anchor [[Greta Van Susteren]] on her program ''[[On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren|On the Record]]'' called out Filipino airport authorities allegedly involved in the extortion scheme. She also said in a Facebook post, "The Philippines may get mad at me, but this airport bullet planting scam deserves to be called out!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Takumi|first1=Rie|title=From AlDub’s record-breaking love team, PHL now draws world attention to laglag bala|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/543317/news/nation/from-aldub-s-record-breaking-love-team-phl-now-draws-world-attention-to-laglag-bala|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=[[GMA News Online]]|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complaint against airport employees==
On 10 December, the Philippines' [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) pressed charges in their behalf against of the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| style="width:29em" | '''Position'''
!  Names
|-
| [[Office for Transportation Security]] (OTS)&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt;
| Maria Elena Cena&lt;br&gt;Marvin Garcia

| [[Corporal|SPO2]] Rolando A. Clarin,&lt;br&gt;Police Chief Inspector (P/CINSP) Adriano Junio&lt;br&gt;SPO4 Ramon Bernardo&lt;br&gt;SPO2 Romy Navarro
|}

These accused allegedly tried to extort money from Lane Michael White—an American missionary who allegedly fell victim to the 'tanim-bala' scam at the airport on 17 September. The money allegedly asked amounted to [[Philippine peso|₱]]30,000.&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt; Clarin, Junio, Bernardino, and Navarro face charges for Violations of Article V, Section 38 (Liability for Planting Evidence) of Republic Act (RA) No. 10591 (the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act); robbery/extortion; and violations of RA No. 7438 and RA No. 3019.&lt;ref name="notable"&gt;{{cite news|title=US missionary welcomes raps vs 'tanim-bala' culprits|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/12/11/15/us-missionary-welcomes-raps-vs-tanim-bala-culprits|accessdate=12 December 2015|work=ABS-CBN News|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On late June 2016, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] dismissed criminal complaints against the above-mentioned employees filed by White due to insufficient proof of evidence of being planted by bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/571022/news/nation/doj-junks-crime-raps-vs-naia-staff-cops-over-laglag-bala-racket|title=DOJ junks crime raps vs. NAIA staff, cops over ‘laglag bala’ racket|work=GMA News|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Islamic religion==
Noted linguist [[Richard Strand]], an authority on Hindu Kush languages, observed the following about pre-Islamic Nuristani religion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Before their conversion to Islâm the Nuristânis practiced a form of ancient Hinduism, infused with accretions developed locally".&lt;ref name="nuristan.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Nuristanis1.html|title=Richard Strand's Nuristân Site: Peoples and Languages of Nuristan|author=Richard F. Strand|date=31 December 2005|work=nuristan.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They acknowledged a number of human-like deities who lived in the unseen Deity World (Kâmviri d'e lu; cf. Sanskrit deva lok'a-).&lt;ref name="nuristan.info"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Certain deities were revered only in one community or tribe, but one was universally revered as the creator: the Hindu god [[Yama]] Râja called imr'o in Kâmviri.&lt;ref name="nuristan.info"/&gt; There is a creator god, appearing under various names, as lord of the nether world and of heaven: [[Yama]] Rājan, or [[Māra]] ('death', Nuristani),&lt;ref name="people.fas.harvard.edu"&gt;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/KalashaReligion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Dezau'' (ḍezáw) whose name is derived from Indo-European *dheig'h i.e. "to form" (Kati Nuristani dez "to create", CDIAL 14621); Dezauhe is also called by the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] term [[Khuda|''Khodai'']]. There are a number of other deities, semi-gods and spirits. The Kalash pantheon is thus one of the few living representatives of Indo-European religion.

The Kafirs believed in many deities, whose names resembled those of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and old [[Vedic]] sources. There was a supreme deity named Mara or [[Imra]], plus a multitude of lesser gods and goddesses known locally as Mandi or Moni, Wushum or Shomde, Gish or Giwish, Bagisht, Indr, Züzum, Disani, Kshumai or Kime etc.

Each village and each clan had its guardian deity, with [[shamans]] advising the help-seekers and priests presiding at religious services. The cult centered on the sacrifice of animals, mostly goats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klimburg|first1=M|title=Nuristan|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nuristan|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|righr|thumb|350px|Map of Alexander's empire and his military route, showing modern-day areas of [[Kalash Valley]], [[Nuristan]], [[Hunza Valley]], and [[Gilgit Valley]] were occupied by Alexander]]
Like certain other groups in the region, they sometimes exhibit physical characteristics of light hair, eyes, and skin. Most of these people are from the Kata Family and Janaderi Branch. However, there are other Nuristani tribes as well, some of the Kata of Janaderi people live in Ozhor (now [[Karimabad (formerly Ozhor)|Karimabad]]), Gobor, Buburat, Ayun, Broze and [[Mastuj]]. There is a very popular rock associated with this tribe located in Karimabad (Juwara) called ''kata bont'' (Kata is the name of the tribe; ''bont'' meaning "stone" in the [[Chitrali language]]).

The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as "Peristan", a vast area containing host of "Kafir" cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period. Earlier, it was surrounded by [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhist states and societies]] which temporarily extended literacy and state rule to the region. The journey to the region was perilious according to reports of Chinese pilgrims [[Fa-hsien]] and [[Sung Yun]]. The decline of Buddhism resulted in the region becoming heavy isolated. The Islamization of the nearby [[Badakhshan]] began in 8th century and Peristan was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century. The [[Kalasha people]] of lower [[Chitral]] are the last surviving heirs of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archivio Per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia

In 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] encountered them and reduced them after a stubborn and prolonged fight, describing them as being distinct culturally and religiously from other peoples of the region.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/47.htm|title=Afghanistan - Nuristani|work=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1014 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] attacked them:

{{quote|Another crusade against idolatry was at length resolved on; and Mahmud led the seventh one against Nardain, the then boundary of India, or the eastern part of the Hindu Kush; separating as Firishta says, the countries of Hindustan and Turkistan and remarkable for its excellent fruit. The country into which the army of Ghazni marched appears to have been the same as that now called Kafirstan, where the inhabitants were and still are, idolaters and are named the Siah-Posh, or black-vested by the Muslims of later times. In Nardain there was a temple, which the army of Ghazni destroyed; and brought from thence a stone covered with certain inscriptions, which were according to the Hindus, of great antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;ʻAlī Muḥammad Khān, James Bird. ''The political and statistical history of Gujarát'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nuristanis were formerly classified into "Siah-Posh (''black-robed'') Kafirs"  and "Safed-Posh (''white-robed'')/Lall-Posh (''Red-Robed'') Kafirs".&lt;ref&gt;Holdich, Sir Thomas Hungerford. ''The Gates of India'' p 270&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timur]] fought with and was humbled by the Siah-Posh Kafirs.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, Dr Ramesh Chandra; Pusalker, Achut Dattatraya; Majumdar, Asoke Kumar. "Tuzak-i-Timuri", in ''The History and Culture of the Indian People, Vol VI''. 1977. p 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Babur]] advised not to tangle with them. [[Genghis Khan]] passed by them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In the 19th century, it was typical of the Kafirs to  boast about having killed the sons of [[Ali]].&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt; Albinia, Alice. ''Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River'' W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is called "Kafiristan" because while the surrounding populations were converted to [[Islam]], the people in this region retained their traditional religion, and were thus known as "Kafirs" to the Muslims. The Arabic word ''"Kufr"'' means not only to disbelieve, but also to blaspheme, and therefore, its derivative ''"Kafir"'' means one who commits blasphemy against [[Allah]] in the Islamic tradition. Thus "Kafir" here is used to refer to their being non-Muslims; the province was therefore known as [[Kafiristan]]. The majority were converted to Islam during [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]'s rule around 1895. The province is now known as Nuristani, and the people as Nuristanis. However, among the rural population many old customs and beliefs like occasional production of wine and the avoidance of veils have continued and the people of these regions adhere to a [[syncretic]] form of Islam which is considered impure by the Wahhabist belief system of the Taliban who rule some areas of [[Nuristan Province]] today, and so is disappearing or being pushed underground in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1790347|title = A Journey in Nuristan|journal = The Geographical Journal|volume = 123|issue = 4|pages = 457|last1 = Thesiger|first1 = Wilfred|doi = 10.2307/1790347|year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/afs/pdf/a1396.pdf|title=Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture|work=nanzan-u.ac.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Kafir]]" has also been traced to ''Kapiś'' (= ''Kapish''), the ancient [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name of the region that included historic Kafiristan; which is also given as "Ki-pin" (or ''Ke-pin, Ka-pin, Chi-pin'') in old [[Chinese language|Chinese]] chronicles. That name, unrelated to the Arabic word, is believed to have mutated at some point into the word ''Kapir''. ''Kapiś'', the name of the people of Kapiś/Kapiśa, is believed{{Who|date=March 2011}} to have changed to Kapir and then Kafir,&lt;ref name=Chandra&gt;Moti Chandra, ''Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva'', 1945, p 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Census of India, 1961, p 26, published by India Office of the Registrar General.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Surya Kanta, ''Kāṭhakasaṅkalanam: Saṃskr̥tagranthebhyaḥ saṅgr̥hītāni Kāṭhakabrāhmaṇa, Kāṭhakaśrautasūtra'', 1981, p xii. Also  A. Strahan (etc), in ''The Contemporary Review'', Vol LXXII, July–Dec, 1897, p 869, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Levi states that "Chinese Kipin is a rendering of an Indian word Kapir." (See quote in Chandra, p 26. See also: Radhakumud Mookerji, ''Bhārata-kaumudī; Studies in Indology in Honour of Dr. Radha Kumud Mookerji'', 1945, p 916).&lt;/ref&gt; because of the lack of 'p' in Arabic. This is similar to how [[Persian language|Parsi]] changed to Farsi.
	
===Soviet–Afghan War===
General [[Issa Nuristani]] was second in command following the King during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. Before his assassination, General Issa called the Nuristani people in a "Jihad" against the Soviet Army. The Nuristani people were among the first in Afghanistan to rise against the Soviet invasion. They played an important role in the conquering of some provinces, including [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nangarhar]], [[Badakhshan]], and [[Panshir Valley|Panshir]]. Following the withdrawal of the Soviet troops, the Mawlavy Ghulam Rabani was declared as governor of the Kunar Province.

Most of the former [[Hindu Kush]] [[Kafiristan|Kafir people]] are considered the ancestors of the Nuristanis. Led by the [[Kom people (Afghanistan)|Koms]] tribe, the Nuristani were the first citizens of [[Afghanistan]] to revolt against the [[Communism|Communist]] takeover in 1978. Thereafter, Nuristan remained a scene of some of the bloodiest guerrilla fighting with the Soviet forces from 1979 through 1989. The Nuristanis inspired others to fight and contributed to the demise of the Afghan Communist regime in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.sedona.net/~strand/ |title=Richard Strand's Nuristan Site OLD LOCATION |publisher=Users.sedona.net |date= |accessdate=2016-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050822145437/http://users.sedona.net/~strand/ |archivedate=2005-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribes==
[[File:AfghanistanNurestan.png|thumb|Nuristan, in light green]]
The Nuristani do not have a formal tribal structure as the [[Pashtuns]] do, however they do designate themselves by the names of the local regions they are from.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt; In total, there are 35 such designations: five from the north-south valleys and 30 from the east-west valley.

Some of these tribes include:&lt;!-- Please respect alphabtical order --&gt;

*[[Kata (people)|Kata]]
*[[Kom people (Afghanistan)|Kom]]
*Kshto

==In popular culture==
Nuristanis were depicted as their pre-Islamic past the Kafiristanis, as one of peoples inhabiting [[Kafiristan]] in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s story called ''[[The Man Who Would Be King]]'' which was then made into a [[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|film]].  The story was published in 1888, eight years before Nuristan was conquered and converted to Islam by Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]].

Many later migrated to other parts of [[Eastern Anatolia]], to the former Russian province of [[Kars Oblast]] in the [[Transcaucasus]], and to [[Greeks in Georgia|Georgia]] in various waves between the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1461 and the second [[Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828-1829. Those from southern [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]], [[Greeks in Ukraine|Ukraine]], and [[Crimea]] are often referred to as "Northern Pontic [Greeks]", in contrast to those from "South Pontus", which strictly speaking is Pontus proper. Those from Georgia, northeastern Anatolia, and the former Russian Caucasus are in contemporary Greek academic circles often referred to as "Eastern Pontic [Greeks]" or as [[Caucasian Greeks]], but also include the Turkic-speaking [[Urums]].

Pontic Greeks have [[Greeks|Greek]] ancestry and speak the [[Pontic Greek]] dialect, a distinct form of the standard [[Greek language]] which, due to the remoteness of Pontus, has undergone [[Evolutionary linguistics|linguistic evolution]] distinct from that of the rest of the Greek world. The Pontic Greeks had a continuous presence in the region of Pontus (modern-day northeastern Turkey), Georgia, and [[Eastern Anatolia]] from at least 700 BC until 1922.&lt;ref name=" Wood, Michael 2005 109 "&gt;

|quote= THE PONTIC GREEKS In the valleys running down to the Black Sea shore around Trebizond, the Greek presence lasted from 700 BC until our own time. Only after the catastrophe of 1922, when the Greeks were expelled from Turkey, did most of them migrate to Greece, or into Georgia where many had started to go before the First World War when the first signs of burning were in the air. The Turks had entered central Anatolia (the Greek word for ‘the east’) in the eleventh century, and by 1400 it was entirely in their hands, though the jewel in the crown, Constantinople itself, wasn’t taken till 1453. By then the Greek-speaking Christian population was in a minority, and even their church services were conducted partly in Greek, partly in Turkish. In Pontus, on the Black Sea coast, it was a different story. Here the Greeks were a very strong presence right up into modern times. Although they had been conquered in 1486, they were still the majority in the seventeenth century and many converted to Islam still spoke Greek. Even in the late twentieth century the authorities in Trebizond had to use interpreters to work with the Muslim Pontic-Greek speakers in the law courts, as the language was still spoken as their mother tongue. This region had a thriving oral culture into the last century and a thriving oral culture into the last century and a whole genre of ballads comes down from the Ancient Greeks…
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
Nowadays, due to extensive intermarriage (also with non-Pontic Greeks), the exact number of Greeks from the Pontus, or people with Greek ancestry still living there, is unknown. After 1988, Pontian Greeks in the [[Soviet Union]] started to migrate to Greece settling in and around [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]], and especially [[Greek Macedonia]]. The largest communities of Pontian Greeks (or people of Pontian Greek descent) around the world are:&lt;ref&gt;Pontian Diaspora, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
[[File:Grave stele 03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Funerary stele]] of two Greek warriors found on the Black Sea coast, [[Taman peninsula]], 4th century BC]]

In [[Greek mythology]] the Black Sea region is the region where [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] sailed to find the [[Golden Fleece]]. The [[Amazons]], female warriors in [[Greek Mythology]] lived in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] and minority lived in [[Taurica]], also known as [[Crimea]] which is also the minor unique settlement of Pontic Greeks. The warlike characteristics of Pontic Greeks had once said to have been derived of Amazons of Pontus.

=== Antiquity ===

[[File:Greek colonies of the Euxine Sea.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Greek colonies of the [[Euxine Sea]], 8th to 3rd century BC]]

{{further|Colonies in antiquity|Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Roman Crimea}}
The first recorded [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]], established on the northern shores of ancient Anatolia, was [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] on the Black Sea, circa 800 BC. The settlers of Sinop were merchants from the Ionian Greek city state of [[Miletus]]. After the colonization of the shores of the Black Sea, known until then to the Greek world as ''Pontos Axeinos'' (Inhospitable Sea), the name changed to ''Pontos Euxeinos'' (Hospitable Sea). In time, as the numbers of Greeks settling in the region grew significantly, more colonies were established along the whole Black Sea coastline of what is now [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Romania]].

The region of Trapezus (later called Trebizond, now [[Trabzon]]) was mentioned by [[Xenophon]] in his famous work  ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', describing how he and other [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|10,000 Greek mercenaries]] fought their way to the [[Euxine Sea]] after the failure of the rebellion of [[Cyrus the Younger]] whom they fought for, against his older brother [[Artaxerxes&amp;nbsp;II of Persia]]. Xenophon mentions that when at the sight of sea they shouted "[[Thalatta! Thalatta!]]" – "The sea! The sea!", the local people understood them. They were Greeks too and, according to Xenophon, they had been there for over 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/folk/pontian_net/News/who.html Who are the Pontians?]. Angelfire.com. Retrieved on 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A whole range of trade flourished among the various Greek colonies, but also with the indigenous tribes who inhabited the Pontus inland. Soon Trebizond established a leading stature among the other colonies and the region nearby become the heart of the Pontian Greek culture and civilization. A notable inhabitant of the region was [[Philetaerus]] (c.&amp;nbsp;343 BC–263 BC) who was born to a Greek father&lt;ref name=" Renée Dreyfus, Ellen Schraudolph 1996 24"/&gt; in the small town of Tieion which was situated on the Black Sea coast of the [[Pontus Euxinus]], he founded the [[Attalid dynasty]] and the Anatolian city of [[Pergamon]] in the second century BC.&lt;ref name=" Renée Dreyfus, Ellen Schraudolph 1996 24"/&gt;

This region was organized circa 281&amp;nbsp;BC as a kingdom by [[Mithridates&amp;nbsp;I of Pontus]], whose ancestry line dated back to [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes I]], a [[Achaemenid Persia|Persian]] ruler of the Greek town of [[Cius]]. The most prominent descendant of Mithridates&amp;nbsp;I was [[Mithridates&amp;nbsp;VI of Pontus]], who between 90 and 65&amp;nbsp;BC fought the [[Mithridatic Wars]], three bitter wars against the [[Roman Republic]], before eventually being defeated. Mithridates&amp;nbsp;VI the Great, as he was left in memory, claiming to be the protector of the Greek world against the barbarian Romans, expanded his kingdom to [[Bithynia]], [[Crimea]] and [[Propontis]] (in present-day Ukraine and Turkey) before his downfall after the [[Third Mithridatic War]].

Nevertheless, the kingdom survived as a Roman [[vassal]] state, now named [[Bosporan Kingdom]] and based in Crimea, until the 4th century AD, when it succumbed to the [[Huns]]. The rest of the Pontus became part of the Roman Empire, while the mountainous interior ([[Chaldia]]) was fully incorporated into the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] during the 6th&amp;nbsp;century.

===Middle Ages===

Pontus was the birthplace of the [[Komnenos|Komnenos dynasty]], which ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1082 to 1185, a time in which [[Komnenian restoration|the empire resurged]] to recover much of Anatolia from the [[Seljuk Turks]]. In the aftermath of the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, the [[Empire of Trebizond]] was established by [[Alexios I of Trebizond]], a descendant of [[Alexios I Komnenos]], the patriarch of the [[Komnenos|Komnenos dynasty]]. The Empire was ruled by this new branch of the Komenos dynasty which bore the name [[Megas Komnenos Axouch]] (or Axouchos or Afouxechos) as early rulers intermarried with the family of Axouch, a Byzantine noble house of Turkic origin which included famed politicians such as [[John Axouch]]

This empire lasted for more than 250 years until it eventually fell at the hands of [[Mehmed II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1461. However it took the Ottomans 18 more years to finally defeat the Greek resistance in Pontus. During this long period of resistance many Pontic Greeks nobles and aristocrats married foreign emperors and dynasties, most notably of [[Medieval Russia]], [[Medieval Georgia]], or the [[Safavid Dynasty|Safavid]] Persian dynasty, and to a lesser extent the [[Kara Koyunlu]] rulers, in order to gain their protection and aid against the Ottoman threat. Many of the landowning and lower-class families of Pontus "turned-Turk", adopting the Turkish language and Turkish Islam but often remaining crypto-Christian before reverting to their Greek Orthodoxy in the early 19th century. Between 1461 and the second [[Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828-29, other Pontic Greeks from northeastern Anatolia migrated as refugees or economic migrants (especially miners and livestock breeders) into nearby Armenia or Georgia, where they came to form a nucleus of Pontic Greeks which increased in size with the addition of each wave of refugees and migrants until these eastern Pontic Greek communities of the South Caucasus region came to define themselves as [[Caucasian Greeks]].

During the Ottoman period a number of Pontian Greeks converted to [[Islam]] and adopted the Turkish language. This could be willingly, for example so to avoid paying the higher rate of taxation imposed on Orthodox Christians or in order to make themselves more eligible for higher level government and regular military employment opportunities within the empire (at least in the later period following the abolition of the infamous Greek and Balkan Christian child levy or '[[devshirme]]', on which the elite Janissary corps had in the early Ottoman period depended for its recruits). But conversion could also occur in response to pressures from central government and local Muslim militia (e.g.) following any one of the Russo-Turkish wars in which ethnic Greeks from the Ottoman Empire's northern border regions were known to have collaborated, fought alongside, and sometimes even led invading Russian forces, such as was the case in the Greek governed, semi-autonomous Romanian Principalities, Trebizond, and the area that was briefly to become part of the Russian Caucasus in the far northeast.

In fact, the second half of the nineteenth century saw large numbers of such pro-Russian Pontic Greeks from the Pontic Alps and Erzerum province resettle in the area around [[Kars]] (which together with southern Georgia already had a nucleus of [[Caucasian Greeks]]). The mountainous vilayet (province) of Kars was ceded to the Russian Empire following the Russo-Turkish war that culminated in the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano. They had declined the expedient of conversion to Islam, abandoned their lands, and sought refuge in territory now controlled by their Christian Orthodox "protector", which used Pontic Greeks, Georgians, and southern Russians, and even non-Orthodox Armenians, Germans, and Estonians to "Christianize" this recently conquered southern Caucasus region, which it then administered as the newly created [[Kars Oblast]] (Kars Province).
On the eve of World War&amp;nbsp;I, the [[Young Turks|Young Turk]] administration exerted a policy of assimilation and [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Orthodox Christians in the Empire, which affected Pontian Greeks, as well as [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Maronites]]. In 1916 Trabzon itself fell to the forces of the [[Russian Empire]], fomenting the idea of an independent Pontic state. As the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power with the [[October Revolution]] (7 November 1917), Russian forces withdrew from the region to take part in the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1923).

In 1917–1922, there existed an unrecognized state by the name [[Republic of Pontus]], led by [[Archbishop Chrysanthus of Athens|Chrysanthus]], Metropolitan of Trebizond. In 1917 [[Greece]] and the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers considered the creation of a [[Greeks|Hellenic]] autonomous state in Pontus, most likely as part of a Ponto-Armenian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;A Short History of Modern Greece, 1821-1940, Edward Seymour Forster, 1941, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 on the fringes of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] Chrysanthos proposed the establishment of a fully independent Republic of Pontus, but neither Greece nor the other delegations supported it.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, ''Propagande et pressions en politique internationale, 1919-1920 (Paris, 1963) pp. 417-422.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ethnicturkey1911.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Greek population in [[Anatolia]] and [[Asia Minor]] in blue color, 1911]]

Once the Russians had evacuated Pontus, Greeks and Armenians in the region became the targets of irregular Turkish and Kurdish militia, as did the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of south east Anatolia. Seeing the [[Armenian Genocide|fate of Armenians]] and [[Assyrian Genocide]] unfold, Pontian Greeks were themselves forced to take up armed resistance, leading to what became known as the Pontus resistance (αντάρτικο του Πόντου in Greek), which lasted until 1923,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} when the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] was agreed under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. While most Christian Pontians were forced to leave for Greece – avoiding nearby Russia, which in the decade post-1917 was plunged into the chaos of revolution and civil war – those who had converted to Islam (and in accordance with historical precedent were considered to have "turned Turk") remained in Turkey and were assimilated into the Muslim population of the north and northeast, where their bi-lingual Greek- and Turkish-speaking descendents can still be found.

''Rumca'', as the Pontian Greek language is known in Turkey, survives today, mostly among older speakers. After the exchange most Pontian Greeks settled in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Attica]]. Pontian Greeks inside the Soviet Union were predominantly settled in the regions bordering the [[Georgian&amp;nbsp;SSR]] and [[Armenian&amp;nbsp;SSR]]. They also had notable presence in [[Black Sea]] ports like [[Odessa]] and [[Sukhumi]]. About 100,000 Pontian Greeks, including 37,000 in the Caucasus area alone, were deported to Central Asia in 1949 during [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Stalin's post-war deportations]]. Big indigenous communities exist today in former [[USSR]] states, while through immigration large numbers can be found in Germany, Australia, and the United States.

Like [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], and other [[Greek genocide|Ottoman subjects]], the Greeks of Trebizond and the short-lived Russian Caucasus province of Kars (which, in 1918, fell back under Ottoman control) suffered widespread massacres and what is now usually termed [[ethnic cleansing]] at the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, first by the [[Young Turks]], and later by Kemalist forces.  In both cases, the pretext was again that the Pontic Greeks and Armenians had collaborated or fought with the forces of their Russian co-religionists and "protectors" before the termination of hostilities between the two empires that followed the October Revolution.  Death marches&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0312262116/ Library Journal Review of ''Not Even My Name'' by Thea Halo.]&lt;/ref&gt; through Turkey's mountainous terrain, forced labour in the infamous "[[Amele Taburu]]" in [[Anatolia]], and slaughter by the irregular bands of [[Topal Osman]] resulted in tens of thousands of Pontic Greeks perishing during the period from 1915 to 1922.  In 1923, after hundreds of years, those remaining were expelled from Turkey to Greece as part of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] defined by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].  In his book ''[[Black Sea (1995 book)|Black Sea]]'', author [[Neal Ascherson]] writes:

{{cquote|The Turkish guide-books on sale in the Taksim Meydane offer this account of the 1923 ''Katastrofĕ'': 'After the proclamation of the Republic, the Greeks who lived in the region returned to their own country […].' Their own country? Returned? They had lived in the Pontos for nearly three thousand years. Their Pontian dialect was not understandable to twentieth-century Athenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Black Sea |isbn=978-0-8090-1593-1 |year=1996|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The suffering of the Pontian Greeks did not end upon their violent and forceful departure from the lands of their ancestors.  Many Pontian Greek refugees perished during the voyage from [[Asia Minor]] to Greece.  Notable accounts of these voyages have been included in Steve Papadopoulos’ work on Pontian culture and history.  Pontian Greek immigrants to the United States from that era were quoted as saying:

{{cquote|Many children and elderly died during the voyage to Greece. When the crew realized they were dead, they were thrown overboard. Soon the mothers of dead children started pretending that they were still alive. After witnessing what was done to the deceased, they would hold on to them and comfort them as if they were still alive. They did this to give them a proper burial in Greece.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}}}

According to the 1928 census of Greece, there were in total 240,695 Pontic Greek refugees in Greece.  From Russia 11,435, from the Caucasus 47,091,&lt;ref name="Language Standards page 52"/&gt; and, from the Pontus region of Anatolia, 182,169.

== Eastern Anatolia Greeks ==
Ethnic Greeks indigenous to the high plateau of [[Eastern Anatolia]] to the immediate south of the boundaries of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] - essentially the northern portion of the former Ottoman [[Vilayet of Erzurum]] between [[Erzinjan]] and [[Kars]] province, that is the western half of the [[Armenian Highlands]] - are sometimes differentiated from both Pontic Greeks proper and [[Caucasian Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;Topalidis, Sam, 'A Pontic Greek History' (2006), introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; These Greeks pre-date the refugees and migrants who left their homelands in the [[Pontic Alps]] and moved onto the Eastern Anatolian plateau after the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461. They were mainly the descendants of Greek farmers, soldiers, state officials and traders, who settled in Erzurum province in the late Roman and [[Byzantine Empire]] period.

Unlike the thoroughly Hellenized areas of the western and central Black Sea coast and the Pontic Alps, the Erzinjan and Erzerum regions were primarily Turkish- and Armenian-speaking, with Greeks forming only a small minority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Koromela, Marianna and Evert, Lisa,'Pontos-Anatolia : northern Asia Minor and the Anatolian plateau east of the upper Euphrates : images of a Journey', (1989), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks of this region were consequently more exposed to Turkish and Armenian cultural influences than those of Pontus proper, and also more likely to have a strong command of the Turkish language, particular since the areas they inhabited had also been part of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] and other pre-Ottoman Turkish powers in Central and Eastern Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Topalidis, Sam, 'A Pontic Greek History' (2006), pp. 39-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Many are also known to have "turned Turk" in both the Seljuk and Ottoman periods, and consequently to have assimilated into Turkish society or reverted to Christian Orthodoxy in the 19th century. Erzurum province was invaded and occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] several times in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and large numbers of Eastern Anatolia Greeks are known to have collaborated with the Russians in these campaigns, particularly that of the 1828-9 [[Russo-Turkish War]], alongside Pontic Greeks inhabiting areas to the immediate north of Erzinjan and Erzurum.

As with Pontic Greeks proper, those Eastern Anatolia Greeks who migrated eastwards into Kars province, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]] and [[Southern Russia]] between the early Ottoman period and 1829 generally assimilated into the branch of Pontic Greeks usually called Caucasian Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, Artemis, 'The Diaspora of the Greeks of the Pontos: Historical Background', Journal of Refugee Studies, 4, (1991), pp. 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who remained and retained their Greek identity into the early 20th century were either deported to the [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] as part of the [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923-4 or massacred in the [[Greek Genocide]] that occurred after the larger [[Armenian Genocide]] in the same part of Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Topalidis, Sam, 'A Pontic Greek History' (2006), pp. 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pontic Greek Culture ==
[[File:Sumela From Across Valley.JPG|thumb|450px|Close-up view of [[Sümela Monastery]]]]

The culture of Pontus has been strongly influenced by the topography of its different regions. In commercial cities like [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], [[Samsun]]da, Kerasounda, and Sinopi upper level education and arts flourished under the protection of a cosmopolitan middle class. In the inland cities such as [[Gümüşhane|Argyroupolis]], the economy was based upon [[agriculture]] and [[mining]], thus creating an economic and cultural gap between the developed urban ports and the rural centers which lay upon the valleys and plains extending from the base of the Pontic alps.

===Pontic Greek Language===
{{Main article|Pontic Greek}}
[[File:Phrontisterion of Trapezous.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The ''[[Phrontisterion of Trapezous]]'', early 20th century]]

Pontic's linguistic lineage stems from [[Ionic Greek]] via [[Koine Greek|Koine]] and [[Byzantine Greek]] with many archaisms and contains [[loanword]]s from Turkish and to a lesser extent, [[Persian language|Persian]] and various [[Caucasian languages]].

===Education===
[[File:Pontus Rum 1903.JPG|thumb|300px|Pontian Greek students and teachers of the Alumni Tuition 1902–1903 in Trebizond]]

The rich cultural activity of Pontian Greeks is witnessed by the number of educational institutions, churches, and [[Monastery|monasteries]] in the region. These include the [[Phrontisterion of Trapezous]] that operated from 1682/3 to 1921 and provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Özdalga|first=Elisabeth | title= Late Ottoman society: the intellectual legacy | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sRtTyyGIgXsC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=frontistirion%2Bottoman&amp;hl=el&amp;ei=VWq3TLrQF4OD4AacounwCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201683%2C%20a%20teachers%27%20college%20(Frontistirio)%20was%20opened%20in%20Trabzon%2C%20which%20provided%20a%20major%20impetus%20for%20the%20development%20of%20the%20so-called%20%27Pontus%20Renaissance%27%2C%20ie%2C%20the%20rapid%20expansion%20of%20Greek%20education%20throughout%20the%20region.&amp;f=false | isbn= 978-0-415-34164-6| page =259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of this institution still remains the most impressive Pontic Greek monument in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Bryer |first1=Anthony  |last2=Winfield|first2=David | title= The post-Byzantine monuments of Pontos | publisher=Ashgate | year=2006 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?ei=l6qwTP_PJpDG4gaDjYClBg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=gmfqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Trebizond%2Bgreek%2Bphrontisterion&amp;q=phrontisterion#search_anchor | isbn= 978-0-86078-864-5| page =xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well known institution was the Argyroupolis, built in 1682 and 1722 respectively, 38&amp;nbsp;highschools in the Sinopi region, 39 highschools in the Kerasounda region, a plethora of churches and monasteries, most notable of which are the St.&amp;nbsp;Eugenios and [[Hagia Sophia, Trabzon|Hagia Sophia]] churches of Trapezeus, the monasteries of St.&amp;nbsp;George and St.&amp;nbsp;Ioannes Vazelonos, and arguably the most famous and highly regarded of all, the monastery of [[Sümela Monastery|Panagia Soumela]].

During the 19th century hundreds of schools were constructed by Pontic Greek communities in the [[Trebizond Vilayet]], giving the region one of the highest literacy rates in the Ottoman Empire. The Greeks of Of and Caykara, who according to Ottoman tax records converted to Islam during the 17th century, were also recognized for their educational facilities. Teachers from the Of-valley provided education for thousands of Anatolian Sunni and Sufi students in home schools and small madrassas. Some of these schools taught Pontic Greek alongside Arabic (and to a lesser extent Persian or Ottoman Turkish as well). Although Atatürk banned these madrassas during the early republican period, some of them remained functioning until the second half of the 20th century because of their remote location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/eBooks/MidEast/BOOKS/A%20Nation%20of%20Empire%20Meeker.pdf A Nation of Empire - Ottoman Legacy Turkish Modernity] Michael E.

===Pontic Greek Music===
[[File:Matzouka macukali.jpg|thumb|300px|Traditional Pontian musical instruments: [[Kemençe of the Black Sea|kemençe]], [[davul]], [[zurna]]. Photo from 1950s in [[Maçka|Matzouka]], [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]], [[Turkey]].]]

Pontian music retains elements of the musical traditions of [[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]], [[Byzantine music|Byzantium]], and the Caucasus (especially from the region of [[Kars]]). Possibly there is an underlying influence from the native peoples who lived in the area before the [[Greeks]] as well, but this is not clearly established.

Musical styles, like language patterns and other cultural traits, were influenced by the topography of [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]]. The mountains and rivers of the area impeded communication between Pontian Greek communities and caused them to develop in different ways. Also significant in the shaping of Pontian music was the proximity of various non-Greek peoples on the fringes of the Pontic area. For this reason we see that musical style of the east Pontos has significant differences from that of the west or southwest Pontos. The Pontian music of Kars, for example, shows a clear influence from the music of the Caucasus and elements from other parts of [[Anatolia]]. The music and dances of Turks from Black Sea region are very similar to Greek Pontic and some songs and melodies are common. Except for certain [[lament]]s and [[ballad]]s, this music is played primarily to be danced to.

An important part of Pontic music is the [[Acritic songs]], heroic or [[epic poetry]] set to music that emerged in the Byzantine Empire, probably in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century. These songs celebrated the exploits of the [[Akrites|Akritai]], the frontier guards defending the eastern borders of the Byzantine Empire.

The most popular instrument in the Pontian musical collection is the [[Kemençe of the Black Sea|kemenche or lyra]], which is related closely with other bowed musical instruments of the medieval West, like the [[Kit violin]] and [[Rebec]]. Also important are other instruments such as the [[Dankiyo|Angion]] or [[Tulum (bagpipe)|Tulum]] (a type of [[Bagpipe]]), the [[davul]], a type of drum, the [[Aulos|Shiliavrin]], and the Kaval or Ghaval (a flute-like pipe).

The [[zurna]] existed in several versions which varied from region to region, with the style from Bafra sounding differently due to its bigger size. The Violin was very popular in the Bafra region and all throughout west Pontos. The [[Kemane]], an instrument closely related to the one of Cappadocia, was highly popular in southwest Pontos and with the Pontian Greeks who lived in [[Cappadocia]]. Finally worth mentioning are the Defi (a type of [[tambourine]]), [[Oud|Outi]] and in the region of Kars, the [[clarinet]].

===Pontic Greek Dance===
[[File:Verbreitungskarte der türkischen Volkstänze.png|thumb|300px|Folk dances in Turkey. [[Horon (dance)|Horon]] in blue.]]

[[Horon (dance)|Pontian dance]] retains aspects of [[Culture of Iran|Persian]] and [[Greek culture|Greek]] dance styles. The dances called Horoi/Choroi ({{lang-el|Χοροί}}), singular [[Horos]]/Choros (Chorus) ({{lang-el|Χορός}}), meaning literally "Dance" in both Ancient Pontian and Modern Greek languages, are circular in nature and each is characterized by distinct short steps. A unique aspect of Pontian dance is the tremoulo ({{lang-el|Τρέμουλο}}), which is a fast shaking of the upper torso by a turning of the back on its axis. Like other Greek dances, they are danced in a line and the dancers form a circle. Pontian dances also resemble Persian and Middle Eastern dances because they are not led by a single dancer. The most renowned Pontian dances are [[Tik (dance)]], [[Serra (dance)|Serra]], [[Maheria]] or [[Pyrecheios]], [[Kotsari]] and [[Omal]].

An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect, Journal of Cognitive Systems Research, 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upal labeled a counterintuitive concept as postdictable if the [[postdiction]] process is successful making sense of the concept i.e., the reader is successfully able to construct a justification given the reader's background knowledge, level of motivation and interest, and the cognitive resources (including time) available to the reader.  According to the [[Context-based model of minimal counterintuiveness]], postdictable counterintuitive concepts are minimally counterintuitive and are remembered well.  Those counterintuitive concepts that are not postdictable in a given context are considered to be maximally counterintuitive and are not remembered well by people. Thus the concept of a flying elephant is postdictable (and thus minimally counterintuitive) when set up in the context of [[Operation Dumbo Drop]] because it can be justified in that context.  The concept of a "square triangle that only exists on Wednesdays and eats cats" however does not make any sense and is therefore not postdictable.

The '''S'gaw''',({{Lang-ksw|စှီၤ}} or {{my|ပှၤကညီဖိ}}) also known as Skaw, S'gaw, S'gau, '''White Karen''',&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt; '''Paganyaw''', Pgaz Cgauz and Pakayo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www9.ocn.ne.jp/~aslan/pgazpape.pdf Land Use and Sustainability in the Highlands of Northern Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929062123/http://www9.ocn.ne.jp/~aslan/pgazpape.pdf |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2016}} are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiangmai.prdnorth.in.th/detail_1476_eng.php Hilltribes in Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[S'gaw Karen language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ksw Ethnologue - Karen, S’gaw]&lt;/ref&gt;

The S'gaw are a subgroup of the [[Karen people]]. They are also referred to by the [[exonym]] "White Karen", a term dating from colonial times and used in contrast to the [[Red Karen|Karenni]] (or "Red Karen") and the [[Pa'O people|Pa'O]] (or "Black Karen"), even though the latter often rejected the term "Karen" to refer to themselves.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;[[James George Scott|Sir George Scott]]. ''Among the Hill Tribes of Burma – An Ethnological Thicket.'' National Geographic Magazine, 1922, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

The S'gaw live primarily in eastern Burma ([[Kayin State|Karen State]], [[Mon state]], [[Kayah State|Karenni state]]). Many of them migrate to Thai-Burmese border and live there as a refugees for many decades due to conflict in Karen state. S'gaw people are the founder of the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU).

==Origins==
[[File:Omens in the Sun.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of the mid-nineteenth century, possibly of Sgaw Karen origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/world/heavens.html|title=The Heavens - World Treasures: Beginnings - Exhibitions - Library of Congress|publisher=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Karen ([[S'gaw]] and [[Pwo Karen|Pwo]]) legend refer to a 'river of running sand' ({{Lang-ksw|ထံဆဲမဲးယွါ}}) which they believe '''Pu Taw Meh Pa''' led the Karen people across the river of the running sand. Many Karen think this refers to the [[Gobi Desert]], although they have lived in Burma for centuries. The legend made the Karen people believe that they're from [[Mongolia]].

'''Sybil Bailey Stockdale''' (November 25, 1924 – October 10, 2015) was the wife of an American [[Vietnam War]] Navy pilot who became a prisoner of war.

Stockdale is credited with helping to better publicize the mistreatment of US prisoners by North Vietnam and for helping to improve American policies concerning the treatment and handling of POW families.&lt;ref name="Stockdale 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt; Stockdale is the recipient of the [[Navy Distinguished Public Service Award]], the highest award given by the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] to a citizen not employed by the Department.&lt;ref name="achievement.org"&gt;"An Indomitable Spirit", James Stockdale Biography, Museum of Living History, Academy of Achievement, Washington D.C.,

Stockdale was also the co-author, along with her husband, of the book "In Love and War: the Story of a Family's Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam War".&lt;ref name="Stockdale 1990"/&gt;

Her husband, [[James Bond Stockdale]], was a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] for bravery in war, and after his release at the end of the war, was eventually promoted to [[James Bond Stockdale|Vice Admiral]] and by the time of his death in 2005 was one of the [[United States]]' most honored and decorated military veterans in the post-[[World War II|WWII]] era. He was present at the August 4, 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]], spent 7-1/2 years under torture as a [[POW]] in [[North Vietnam]], later became President of [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], and eventually ran for [[Vice-President of the United States]] with [[Ross Perot]] heading the ticket.

==The Vietnam War years==

===Husband's Capture in Vietnam / Pentagon "Keep quiet" Policy===

When Sybil Stockdale's husband James was shot down in 1965 over North Vietnam, the US government had a "keep-quiet" policy, asking relatives of POWs to not raise a fuss about mistreatment of prisoners.&lt;ref name="Stockdale 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;  The official reason was not that the prisoners were not being tortured, but bad publicity might result in worse treatment.&lt;ref name="Stockdale 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;

===Founding of the National League of Families===

After a year of abiding by the government "keep-quiet" policy, Sybil found herself more and more disenchanted with the pretense that prisoners like her husband were treated fairly; James had been tortured, had inflicted serious wounds on himself to convince his captors they could not break or use him, and had spent years in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;

In the summer of 1966, Sybil along with other members of a [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] [[prisoner of war|POW]] / [[missing in action|MIA]] support group decided to go national, and formed the [[National League of Families|National League of Families of American Prisoners Missing in Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;  Sybil was the first national coordinator.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt; Other support groups from east coast military communities later became part of the National League.

Within a year she was sitting in the office of the Secretary Of Defense [[Melvin Laird]] discussing policy.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;  The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] Administration had ended the "keep quiet" policy and allegations of torture of US prisoners became fully public, with Sybil a forceful spokeswoman.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;

==Memoir co-authored with husband James==
Sybil Stockdale co-wrote a memoir with her husband James (who also wrote a number of books on his own).  ''In Love and War: the Story of a Family's Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam War''&lt;ref name="Stockdale 1990"/&gt; was the most popular book written by either of the Stockdales.

In the book James and Sybil Stockdale wrote alternating chapters describing their experiences of the Vietnam war, James wrote of his experiences as a [[POW]], and Sybil wrote of her experiences as the wife of a POW, dealing with the stress and waiting at home and her journey cutting through Washington red tape and publicizing the plight of American POWs in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Stockdale 1990"/&gt;

[[File:Huttner.hitler.melbourne.jpg|thumb|right| Installation view of poster project “Young Dictators” (Hitler as child), by Per Hüttner at public location in Melbourne, September 2009.]]
'''The Invisible Generation''' was a contemporary art project conceived by artist [[Per Hüttner]] and Curator [[Daniele Balit]] and organized by [[Vision Forum (art organisation)|Vision Forum]] and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in  [[Melbourne]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Beijing]] and [[Kiev]] in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation"&gt;The Invisible Generation, ed. Gerrie van Noord, design Marie Proyard, Published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most projects were realized in contexts where the audience does not necessarily expect to find artwork. In the metro (Dinu Li, Per Hüttner), in a newspaper office (Yan Jun), on a public square (Natasha Rosling) or even contained as a story in the mind of a person in a shop (Good TV). In other instances the project played with the perceived immutability of the artwork. The audience was asked to actively create or re-create artwork (The Anti-Hospital), remove or destroy drawings (Jean-François Robardet), bring books to be changed (Private Contractors) or in some cases it was disguised as an informative poster, graffity or political propaganda (Huang Xiaopeng, Per Hüttner).

The inspiration and title is taken from a text by [[William S. Burroughs]] where he describes a series of situation where a tape recorder is used to create new forms of meeting between people and new forms of engagement with the media.

==Melbourne, September 2009==
The first part of The Invisible Generation opened to the public in Australia in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1252072574&amp;day=1253138400&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation was co-curated by Hüttner and Balit. It was introduced at the [[Margaret Lawrence Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vca.unimelb.edu.au/gallarchive09/#cs_3602&lt;/ref&gt; which was also the starting point for a number of interventions in the public space of the city. In the gallery were two major installations presented: Do Not Go Gentle Court by Per Hüttner and Polka Dot by French artist Mark Geffriaud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fracidf-leplateau.com/en/index.html  The work is in the collection of FRAC Île de France]&lt;/ref&gt; The two works redefine the gallery experience through reflections on the fabric of space and time. Being situated at the boundaries between installation and performance, they delineated a space that was the starting point for the Anti-Hospital, an open-ended and evolving platform which formed the core of the project. The Anti-Hospital was designed by Melbourne-based collective Greatest Hits&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatesthitswebsite.com/the-invisible-generation.html&lt;/ref&gt; and focused around a collection of artistic documents providing instructions that were formulated as possible actions, performances, temporary artworks, objects and social situations, scores and sonic interventions proposed by absent artists and realized by local artists, non-artists and visitors to the gallery. Greatest Hits created a dozen videos that enacted, played with and read out the instructions and together created a sort of manual to aid and inspire the visitor to relate to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://tig-melbourne.blogspot.com/2009/12/greatest-hits-video-excerpt-montage.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructions were interpreted, primarily by local artists while the exhibition was open to the public.

For the period of the exhibition the Anti-Hospital also coordinated a series of events, performances, actions, workshops and ways of disseminating the instructions through the media and the urban space of Melbourne including, local artists, students and a program on the screen and LEDs at Federation Square. This included the controversial project “Young Dictators” conceived and realized by Per Hüttner with two local students. The three put up 2000 copies of A4 sized posters around the city showing images of dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] as children with the text “Have you seen this child? Please contact 0432 027 925” (Hüttner’s mobile number).

==Shenzhen October 2009==
Where the presentation in Melbourne focused on the relationship between suspended instructions in the gallery and interventions in the public space, the project in Shenzhen consisted mostly of unannounced performances in the public space and hosted by the contemporary art museum OCAT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocat.com.cn Official OCAT website]&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in political, economical, social and architectural context also meant the dynamics of the project changed greatly and made the participation of the local audience more difficult to achieve, but all the more successful on the occasions where it happened. Presentations included carnivalesque costumes appearing in public space as temporary and wearable architectural elements by Natasha Rosling. Yang Zhifei carried a giant white pillow through the streets of the city and she let an army of people sleep in public spaces, each with a normally sized pillow under their head. She also organized a dream workshop to compare the dreams of the Chinese with those of the Dutch. [[Dinu Li]] created a choreography of corruption and guilt on the Shenzhen underground provoking fear in the audience and laying bare how deep inside the psyches of its citizens a [[totalitarian]] government can reach. Neno Belchev designed a portable zebra crossings to facilitate [[jaywalking]], a passion shared by the Chinese and [[Bulgarians]].&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

[[File:Yzf1low.jpg|thumb|left| Yang Zhifei's performance in Beijing that was part of The Invisible Generation, October 2009.]]

==Beijing July 2009 – July 2010==
The events in Beijing took place over a whole year and culminated in a large presentation at [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]] in June 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucca.org.cn/portal/activitie/view.798?id=520&amp;lang=en&amp;menuId=28&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations kicked off with summer 2009 with Jon Phillips and [[Matt Hope|Matt Hope’s]] speaker event "Laoban Sound System" in conjunction with [[Ai Weiwei|Ai Weiwei’s]] day without internet. The two has since launched a range of events in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;http://laoban-soundsystem.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Other events included Yan Jun’s sonic material slipped into the desk drawers at Beijing Youth Weekly editorial office and interviews from the same newspaper that were replayed and perverted over 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birdcagespace.com/index.php?/next-episode/yan-jun/&lt;/ref&gt; Good TV collected memories of images that had been lost for different reasons. collection of lost images retold by storytellers in their everyday life in the Wudaoying Hutong (五道营胡同). The Beijing context and the proximity to the centre of political power allowed “This Image Is No More” to develop another layer of interpretation which had been lacking in its realization in Europe. Both Natasha Rosling and Yang Zhifei created versions of their projects from Shenzhen in Beijing. Especially the giant white pillow carried through the streets the Chinese capital to mirrored its grandiose buildings in ways that also inspired interesting reactions among the unassuming audience.

==Kiev, November 2009 and July 2010==
In November Yulia Usova and PAI organised a series of talks in Kiev that approached issues such as [[Cultural heritage management|curation]] and art in public spaces and included speakers such as [[Olesya Turkina]], [[Olav Westphalen]] and Karen MacDonald. In conjunction with this a group of students from [[Kungliga Konsthögskolan]] in [[Stockholm]] made a series of improvised performances at [[Les Kurbas’ Theater Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kurbas.org.ua/en/les_kurbas.html Les Kurbas presentation in English]&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the project took place during the [[swine flu]] epidemic in Ukraine  all public theatre events were stopped and schools closed giving the whole event a very special flavour.

The actual project was scheduled to be realized in April 2010, but had to be cancelled due to the volcanic ash cloud that prevented air travel in Europe at the given time and only web-performances were undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1271946267&amp;day=1271973600&lt;/ref&gt; The project was realized 19 June and 2–4 July 2010 and was co-curated by Per Hüttner and Yulia Usova.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.si.se/Creative-Force/Start/Creative-Force/News/Nyheter/Invisible-generation/&lt;/ref&gt; The project saw a meeting between artists from China, Western Europe and Ukraine. Rumours claim that artists met with great problems with local authorities including arrests, theft by undercover policemen and that the artists had to bribe officials to be able to leave the country.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

==Documentation and talks==
Since most of the events in The Invisible Generation only had an unexpecting audience, the organizers present the documentation of the project in various art institutions around the world, including UCCA in Beijing and Norrköpings Konstmuseum in Sweden. Vision Forum has also published an extensive catalogue about The Invisible Generation in 2011. It was edited by Gerrie van Noord and includes all the original instructions presented in Melbourne. The publication also contains texts by Daniele Balit, Per Hüttner, Olav Westphalen and incidentally contains a reproduction of this page. The book is framed by three texts by the editor, Gerrie van Noord where she reflects on the difficulty and necessity of mediating projects ephemeral projects like The Invisible Generation.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

[[File:Tramp smoking cigar with cane over arm - restoration.jpg|thumb|A romanticized tramp depicted in an 1899 U.S. poster]]

A '''tramp''' is a long-term [[homeless person]] who travels from place to place as a [[vagrant]], traditionally walking all year round. The word ''tramp'' became a common way to refer to such people in 19th-century Britain and America.

==Etymology==
Tramp is derived from a [[Middle English]] verb meaning to "walk with heavy footsteps" (''cf.'' modern English ''trample'') and to go hiking.

In Britain the term was widely used to refer to vagrants in the early Victorian period. The social reporter [[Henry Mayhew]] refers to it in his writings of the 1840s and 1850s. By 1850 the word was well established. In that year Mayhew described "the different kinds of vagrants or tramps" to be found in Britain, along with the "different trampers' houses in London or the country". He distinguished several types of tramps, ranging from young people fleeing from abusive families, through to people who made their living as wandering beggars and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/mayhew/mayhew30.htm|title=Victorian London - Publications - Social Investigation/Journalism - The Morning Chronicle : Labour and the Poor, 1849-50; Henry Mayhew - Letter XXX|work=victorianlondon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the United States, the word became frequently used during the [[American Civil War]], to describe the widely shared experience of undertaking long marches, often with heavy packs. Use of the word as a noun is thought to have begun shortly after the war. A few veterans had developed a liking for the "call of the road". Others may have been too traumatised by war time experience to return to settled life.&lt;ref name = "Citizen"&gt;{{cite book

==History==
{{main|Vagrancy}}
[[File:A Tramp's Nest in Ludlow Street.jpeg|thumb|"A Tramp's Nest in [[Ludlow Street (Manhattan)|Ludlow Street]]", ''[[:s:How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York (1890)|How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York (1890)]]'', by [[Jacob Riis]]]]

Wanderers have existed since ancient times. The modern concept of the "tramp" emerges with the expansion of industrial towns in the early nineteenth century, with the consequent increase in migrant labor and pressure on housing. The common lodging house or "doss house" developed to accommodate transients. Urbanisation also led to an increase in forms of highly marginalized casual labor. Mahew identifies the problem of "tramping" as a particular product of the economic crisis of the 1840s known as the [[Hungry Forties]]. [[John Burnett (historian)|John Burnett]] argues that in earlier periods of economic stability "tramping" involved a wandering existence, moving from job to job which was a cheap way of experiencing adventures beyond the "boredom and bondage of village life".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnett (historian)|Burnett, J.]], ''Idle Hands: The Experience of Unemployment, 1790-1990'', Routledge, 2002, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
The number of transient homeless people increased markedly in the U.S. after the industrial recession of the early 1870s. Initially, the term "tramp" had a broad meaning, and was often used to refer to migrant workers who were looking for permanent work and lodgings. Later the term acquired a narrower meaning, to refer only to those who prefer the transient way of life.&lt;ref name = "Citizen"/&gt; Writing in 1877 [[Allan Pinkerton]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The tramp has always existed in some form or other, and he will continue on his wanderings until the end of time; but there is no question that he has come into public notice, particularly in America, to a greater extent during the present decade than ever before."&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Pinkerton|Pinkerton, Allan]] (1877). ''Strikers, Communists, Tramps and Detectives'', New York: G.W. Carleton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Author [[Bart Kennedy]], a self-described tramp of 1900 America, once said "I listen to the tramp, tramp of my feet, and wonder where I was going, and why I was going."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/manadriftbeingle00kennrich#page/160/mode/2up |title=A man adrift: being leaves from a nomad's portfolio |first=Bart |last=Kennedy |authorlink=Bart Kennedy |page=161 |location=Chicago |publisher=H.S. Stone|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sutherland/&gt; [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] (1989) said that Kennedy "is one of the early advocates of 'tramping', as the source of literary inspiration."&lt;ref name=sutherland&gt;[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]]. "Kennedy, Bart" in ''Companion to Victorian Literature''. Stanford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tramp became a character [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in [[vaudeville]] performance in the late 19th century in the United States. [[Lew Bloom]] claimed he was "the first stage tramp in the business".&lt;ref&gt;DePastino, Todd. ''Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

While tramps may do odd jobs from time to time, unlike other temporarily homeless people they do not seek out regular work and support themselves by other means such as [[begging]] or scavenging (see [[Waste picker]]). This is in contrast to:
*bum, a stationary homeless person who does not work, and who begs for a living in one place.
*[[hobo]], a homeless person who travels from place to place looking for work, often by "[[freighthopping]]" (illegally catching rides on freight trains)
*[[Schnorrer]], a [[Yiddish]] term for a person who travels from city to city begging.

Both terms, "tramp" and "hobo" (and the distinction between them), were in common use between the 1880s and the 1940s. Their populations and the usage of the terms increased during the [[Great Depression]]. Like "hobo" and "bum," the word "tramp" is considered vulgar in [[American English]] usage, having been subsumed in more polite contexts by words such as "homeless person" or "vagrant." At one time, tramps were known [[euphemism|euphemistically]] in [[England and Wales]] as "gentlemen of the road."

==Tramp as promiscuous woman==
Perhaps because female tramps were often regarded as prostitutes, the term tramp came to be used to refer to a promiscuous woman. This  is largely an [[American English|Americanism]] and not in global usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/tramp|title=tramp definition, meaning - what is tramp in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online|work=cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Australian linguist [[Kate Burridge]], the term shifted towards this meaning in the 1920s, having previously predominantly referred to men, it followed the path of other similar gender neutral words (such as "[[slut|slag]]") to having specific reference to female sexual laxity.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Burridge, ''Blooming English: Observations on the Roots, Cultivation and Hybrids of the English Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is also used, with ambiguous irony, in the classic 1937 [[Rodgers and Hart]] song ''[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]'', which is about a wealthy member of New York [[Upper class|high society]] who chooses a vagabond life in "hobohemia".&lt;ref&gt;Gary Marmorstein, ''A Ship Without A Sail: The Life of Lorenz Hart'', Simon and Schuster, 2013, p.298&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs with implicit or explicit reference to this usage include ''[[The Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp]]'' and ''[[Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves]]''. The use of the word with the explicitly sexual meaning is especially common in [[hip hop]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, M &amp; Neal, M.A., ''That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader'', Psychology Press, 2004, p.279.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vezo''' is the term the semi-[[nomad]]ic coastal people of southern [[Madagascar]] use to refer to people that have become accustomed to live from sea fishing.  The Vezo speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]], spoken in southern [[Borneo]].  They currently populate most of the littoral zone along Madagascar’s west coast between [[Toliara]] and [[Mahajanga]].

"Vezo" literally means the people who fish, but also has been known to mean 'to struggle with the sea'.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;Kaufmann&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic identity==
[[File:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups. The Vezo are classified with the [[Sakalava people]].]]
Vezo do not identify with a particular [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|Malagasy ethnic group]] but instead with their way of life.&lt;ref name="Rita Astuti"&gt;Rita Astuti&lt;/ref&gt; They currently populate most of the littoral zone along Madagascar’s west coast between [[Toliara]] and [[Mahajanga]].&lt;ref&gt;Chelonia Mydas&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other Madagascan ethnic groups, their origins can directly be traced to Asia. They have been known to state emphatically that they need have no common origin or shared essence with one another. Their identity is contextual and achieved by doing, embodied in learned skills such as fishing or swimming and the callouses they produce, rather than in blood, genes, or skin color.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=People of the Sea: Identity and Descent among the Vezo of Madagascar|journal=American Anthropologist|first=Michael|last=Lambek|date=1 March 1998|publisher=|volume=100|issue=1|pages=203–204|doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.1.203.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their semi-nomadic marine migrations, their population is difficult to determine and has been estimated by counting the dugout canoes called [[pirogue]]s (''lakanas'' in [[Malagasy language]]) around Madagascar.

==History==
There are two parts to this history which are relevant to the Vezo view of the environment – how and why the original clans of [[Andavadoaka]] left their former village and how they came to choose the site that is now Andavadoaka.
The three clans that established Andavadoaka relocated to avoid the regular invasion by bandits. [[Banditry|Marauders]] from inland tribes regularly attacked the old village a few kilometres north. As pacifists, the Vezo rarely defend their property and are often attacked by others. The villagers wanted an end to these attacks so used their knowledge of local fish to catch poisonous lionfish and gobies, which they cooked and scattered around the village just before the expected attack. After preparing the poison trap, the villagers sailed in their pirogues to the outlying islands to hide from the bandits. Expecting an empty village, knowing the Vezo always flee from attacks, the unsuspecting bandits arrived and ate the food that had been left behind. Many of the bandits died. On returning the villagers saw the corpses of the poisoned bandits and referred to them as those who had died from eating lionfish (moroy), and from then on referred to the village as the ‘dead of moroy’ or ‘Tratna amy moroy.’ The name of the village to this day is Antsatsamoroy.

Attacks by bandits continue today. In December 2003 to January 2004, March and October 2005 and March to May 2006, cattle rustlers, [[dahalo]] or [[malaso]], threatened villagers and stole cattle at pastures in the spiny forest, inland from the village. There have been incidents involving local villagers – one was fatally wounded by shooting after pursuing the armed malaso in the aftermath of a village raid. On each occasion, many of the Vezo villagers put their valuables in their pirogues and send women and children to the outlying islands for safety (in particular, Nosy Hao and Nosy Ve) – sometimes almost completely depopulating the village.

The second part of Andavadoaka’s history – how the clans came to choose Andavadoaka – relates to the local landscape. Tired with attacks, the villagers sought a location hidden from both land and sea, where it would be harder for marauders to encounter the village by chance. Their chosen site was a depression in-between surrounding [[limestone]] outcrops, on the flattened sand dunes of a sheltered bay. The description given to the location of the village was the depression (lavaka) between the hills. To the east of the village there is a hill riddled with tunnels. The question, ‘lavaka aiza?’ (where is the hole?), and the answer, ‘lavaka loaka’ (the hole is in the rock), provided the name for the village – ‘Andavadoaka’.&lt;ref name="travelroots.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelroots.com/downloads/bv-research-report-2006-langley-tek.pdf|title=travelroots.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
[[File:Madagascar - Traditional fishing pirogue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Traditional fishing ''[[lakana]]'' with a [[crab claw sail]] from [[Madagascar]]]]
Vezo-ness is this process of transformation. It is an identity that unfolds through time, rather than being fixed in time.
The Vezo are a fishing people who inhabit a coastal belt extending from Intampolo in the south to Morondava in the north of southwest Madagascar. Andavadoaka is a village whose population are of the Vezo tribe. It has a population of 1,200, with over 50% under 15 years of age. Household income is mainly from fishing. Fishermen make use of [[mangroves]] for timber, wood, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Radhika Dave&lt;/ref&gt; The fishers participate in an artisanal fishery reliant on pirogues (canoes, made by hollowing out a large log) powered by sail and paddle, and most fishing occurs 5&amp;nbsp;km or less from shore. Men predominantly fish with line, nets, and spears. Women glean the reef flats for invertebrates including octopus and sea cucumbers. Fish sales, processing and trade supplement local income, as does tourism and local commerce.

The Vezo traditionally traded with the neighbouring agro-foresters, the Masikoro. The Vezo also trade with the [[Mikea]], exchanging fish for honey and [[tubers]].&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt; However, increased trade has changed the economy from barter to cash-based. Furthermore, growth in fish export from Madagascar has encouraged fish processing and export companies to the region, such as Murex and Copefrito (now operating in the southwest). Their purchases of marine products have increased fish demand and strengthened the cash economy.
Besides gleaning the reef flats, women are the ones who sell the catches that men bring them. With what they earn, women buy rice, the staple food, other essential foodstuff and a variety of luxury items.&lt;ref name="Rita Astuti"/&gt;
Children go to school in the one village school building, where there are two designated teachers. However, due to the deterioration
of public administration in Madagascar, the building and the teachers are hardly ever occupied. Whenever children are in the building, and if the teacher has not run out of chalk, the teaching largely consists in copying letters, numbers, and short sentences from the blackboard onto the child's own A5 size blackboard. Understandably, the many children who do not own a blackboard are allowed to play in the burning heat outside.&lt;ref name="Rita Astuti"/&gt;

Family ties are extremely important among the Vezo and elders are greatly respected in the community. Families often provide for each other with younger members building boats for the elderly to use. Maintaining family ties is important to ensure that one is looked after in old age, or after an accident or ill health. Family relationships are particularly important to Vezo fishers because they determine access to marine resources and fishing gear.&lt;ref&gt;Velondriake&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family affiliation===
The Hazomanga is an elder in a family or clan who acts as the intermediary between the ancestors and his family member. His responsibilities include overseeing ceremonies and consulting the ancestors for advice when needed. The most senior village Hazomanga in Andavadoaka is also the village historian and is a member of one of the three founding clans of Andavadoaka. He attends village events when the community considers them to require the permission or consideration of the ancestors. The Hazomanga douses the ground in rum during each consultation with the ancestors. If an occasion is particularly important, local cattle, zebu, may be sacrificed.&lt;ref name="travelroots.com"/&gt;

&lt;!--===Class affiliation===
===Religious affiliation===
''Soro'' is giving thanks for good fortune, or making a request for a cure or recovery from illness or accident. The person who wants soro offers a sacrifice of zebu or goat to the ancestors. The Hazomanga (wise elder) asks benediction or gives thanks to the ancestors on behalf of the beneficiary. The family of the person who is ill, injured or wishes to give thanks also attends the ceremony. An example of a soro is ''soronanaka'', which is the introduction of a wife to the ancestors, and is often performed before a woman becomes pregnant, during pregnancy or after birth. The time chosen depends on the money available within the family.

The ''hazomanga'', with elders from other clans, conducted a ''fomba'' (ceremony) on Nosy Fasy when the area was closed to octopus fishing for seven months, from the first spring tide of November 2004. At the reopening of this site a fomba was again conducted. The ceremonies involved all the villagers coming together in silence while the hazomanga faced east (inland) and spoke to the ancestors, ending the ceremony by opening a new bottle of dark rum and pouring it into the sea. The ancestors were consulted to be informed of the changes occurring.

In Andavadoaka and Nosy Hao, shrines called ''fomba'' are erected, to give thanks for catching shark and turtle. Nosy Hao has two turtle fomba and one shark fomba. The turtle fomba is where all turtles are killed. The carapaces are used to cook the turtle meat and retain the blood, as it is strictly taboo to spill the turtle’s blood on the sand. The carapaces are kept at the shrine and the spears used to catch the turtles are also kept, with the head of the turtle speared through the mouth. The heads are raised on spears surrounding the fomba amid the carapaces of former kills kept in the centre of the shrine.

''Takasy (ranja)'' is a request to the ancestors for continued success in obtaining something. For example, a ''takasy fano'' involves giving thanks for a recently caught turtle and requesting that the ancestors allow more turtles to be caught in future. The ceremony involves giving thanks and hoping for more luck in catching rare species such as shark, whale and dolphin. The Vezo build a shrine on a site that is considered favourable, then each time an animal is caught, the ceremony can be performed shortly after the catch.

''Bilo'' means several things. It is an evil spirit that possesses an individual and can kill them. When a bilo possesses a person, the possessed is also called ''bilo''. An individual realises that he or she is possessed due to illness or nightmares, and to exorcise the spirit they must perform a ceremony called ''manjotso bilo'', which can be performed for several bilo at the same time. To conduct the ceremony, the bilo invites his fellow villagers and family members, who may come from afar. During the ceremony, the bilo requests benediction and improved health from their ancestors, and the rest of the participants dance and sing. The ceremony can last up to five days, and during it the individual becomes very sick. Afterwards, the former bilo manifests supernatural powers, and can heal people for the rest of their life. They become a respected member of the community as a healer.

''Tromba'' or ''doany'' (“outside power") is a ceremony conducted when a person or group of people feel that they are being negatively affected by a displaced spirit. The family of the possessed person(s) invites relatives and friends from the surrounding community to be the audience to the ceremony. Men and women are separated on either side of the site of the ceremony. An awning made from the sail of a pirogue (a traditional dugout canoe) covers part of the ground that is the dancing area for the possessed to dance. Traditional musicians play at regular intervals for two days while the possessed person, in a trance, tries to dance out the spirits. As the spirits come from other regions, a table with model boats (in particular the ''botry'' traditional sailing boats), representing the method of transport for the spirit to leave, is placed in front of a shrine to the ancestors, with offerings of food and drink.--&gt;

==Culture==
The Vezo have official cultural ceremonies called Fomba. These include Bilo, Tromba, Savatse, Takasy and Soro. All these ceremonies, except Takasy, are practiced (with some variations) by the neighbouring inland Masikoro people.&lt;ref name="Rita Astuti"/&gt;

The circumcision ceremony typically lasts from 4&amp;nbsp;am until 9&amp;nbsp;am. The parents ask a wise elder to suggest the best date and time for the ceremony, and identify a nurse or doctor who knows how to perform the circumcision. Family members are invited to attend the ceremony, and one of the uncles holds the child during the ceremony. After the physical cut, there is drinking of alcohol. After the ceremony the child is called savatse.

===Fady===
The community life of the Vezo, as elsewhere in Madagascar, is guided by numerous ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboos).  During the course of the life of a Vezo man, he is exposed to the danger of catching [[hanimboky]], a very unpleasant disease that only affects men. The sickness literally means swollen/full with food, which makes it considered thus a male pregnancy. A man sick with hanimboky is unable to go the bathroom and this causes his stomach to swell up until it resembles the belly of a pregnant woman. The illness is caused by food that the male kin of a sexually active woman accepted and ate from her. The food is said to be dirty, for it is assumed that the woman had acquired it with 'tangy', the presents her lover gives her for having sex with him.  When a man accepts food from one of his female kin, it is therefore as if he were receiving food from the woman's lover; if a man accepted such food, he would be put in a very inferior position. In essence, they are treated as if they were women by their daughter's or sister's lover.&lt;ref name="Rita Astuti"/&gt;

It is also ''fady'' to spill the turtle’s blood on the sand.

===Funeral rites===
Vezo cemeteries lie in the forest, far away from the villages and are so well hidden by the vegetation that they are considered "invisible to the eye". The cemeteries must be hidden in this way because the sight of tombs makes the people sad and unhappy. Cemeteries are not places the Vezo like to visit very often. One does not simply go for a stroll near the cemetery. The living only approach a cemetery when they bear a corpse or when they have to "work" for the dead, such as digging graves and building tombs.&lt;ref name="Invisible Objects"&gt;Invisible Objects&lt;/ref&gt;

In western Madagascar, [[Sakalava]] and Vezo funerary sculpture is renowned internationally for its erotic wooden figures, often depicted during copulation and showing oversized phalluses and breasts. It is unknown as to why the sculptures have this sort of eroticism, but it may have to do with meeting growing tourist demand.&lt;ref name="Invisible Objects"/&gt;

Even after their ancestors have passed, the Vezo keep them involved in many different affairs. Many events in the productive, reproductive and social life of any Vezo family require that the dead be promptly informed, for example if one intends to move to a temporary fishing location, if one is moving into a newly built house or is launching a new canoe, if one is having a difficult birth or if a newborn is brought out of the house for the first time, if one is about to sit a school exam, if difficult words have been spoken which make people’s heart heavy with anger, if the visiting anthropologist arrives or leaves, and so on. It is the responsibility of the senior head of the family to call the dead and talk to them, asking for their protection or their forgiveness, and ensuring that they are kept well informed of life’s events – for whenever the dead have reasons to be “surprised," they will want to ask questions, thereby causing trouble for the living.&lt;ref name="Rita Astuti"/&gt;

The dead communicate with their living descendants through the dreams that they induce in them. This is because when a person dies, the breathing stops, the body becomes stiff, cold and soon begins to stink and to decompose. But when a person dies, the ‘spirit’ – known as fanahy up to the moment of death – permanently departs from the body. In its new disembodied, ghostly form, the spirit – now known as angatse – is invisible, and moves around like wind. To be seen by living people, it enters their dreams, where it appears together with its original uncorrupted body, just as it was when the person was alive.

&lt;!--===Dance and music===--&gt;

==Language==
The Vezo speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]], spoken in southern [[Borneo]].&lt;ref name="Bradt"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bradt |first1=Hilary |last2= Austin |first2=Daniel |title=Madagascar |edition=9th |publisher=The Globe Pequot Press Inc. |year=2007 |location=Guilford, CT |pages=113–115 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vyNVb2q0RisC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=madagascar+ethnic+group#v=onepage&amp;q=madagascar%20ethnic%20group&amp;f=false |isbn=1-84162-197-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Off the coast of Madagascar, overfishing has become a major issue. The Vezo rely entirely on fishing, who for the past 2,000 years have been navigating the stretch of the [[Indian Ocean]] that separates Madagascar from the African continent in hand-carved pirogues. Increasingly, commercial boats, mostly from Asia and Europe, are fishing those same waters. Thus, it is difficult for the traditional fishermen to compete in the market. In response, many Vezo have resorted to fishing hundreds of miles offshore, spending six to nine months a year in rough and dangerous waters in search of sharks and sea cucumbers, both in high demand in Asian seafood markets. Some bring their families and all their possessions and set up camp on sandbars far from civilization.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/218568529&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishermen believe that the current fishing practices have to change by keeping successful skills, removing destructive fishing practices and adopting new fishing technologies. The lack of a system allowing local users to have a shared assessment of the fishing conditions and to define a common vision is the main problem for Vezo traditional fishers. They are so good at tracking the changes in fish catches over time and have a better understanding of the multiple uses of the available habitats but when it comes to pooling their knowledge into one system, they just can not make it by themselves. This shows that traditional ways of solving problems have failed to make its way to modern days. Traditional leaders used to play an important role in preserving wealth of the community by providing guidance to resource users according to the best available judgment. This role has been weakened by several factors including his social status.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Challenging Vezo Traditional Fisheries&lt;/ref&gt;

Even worse, there is no significant improvement of household revenue in short term by setting up a marine reserve, it is hoped that the approach is likely to bring a much bigger impact on targeted fisheries in a mid and long term exploitation. From a biological point of view, a larger female octopus for example tends to lay many more eggs than young ones. By providing a few more months to grow in a closed fishing ground, it allows octopus individuals to get to bigger sizes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Vezo have a long history of subsistence turtle exploitation and associated cultural traditions. By local law, turtles are protected under Decree 24 passed in 1923, but this law has seldom been enforced. The low reproductive potential and delayed sexual maturity of turtles make all species unsuitable for intensive harvest. Even as far back as the early twentieth century, it has been reported that turtles play an important role to Malagasy fisheries. There has been a decline in numbers of the hawksbill turtle and the disappearance of nesting populations. The raiding of the turtle nests and hunting for the meat and carapaces are believed to be the fundamental causes of decline for four of the five species in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://ajol.info/index.php/wiojms/article/viewFile/28491/5169&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of interventions are being undertaken to restore fish stocks and sustain the Vezo way of life. [[ReefDoctor]] is a key NGO in this effort and has an ongoing programme that aims to enhance fish biodiversity and biomass by the introduction of artificial habitats.&lt;ref&gt;ReefDoctor&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilbur Underhill Jr.''' (March 16, 1901 – January 6, 1934), often called "Mad Dog" or the "Tri-State Terror", was an American criminal, burglar, bank robber and Depression-era outlaw. He was one of the most wanted bandits in [[Oklahoma]] during the 1920s and 1930s and co-led a gang with [[Harvey Bailey]] that included many fellow [[Cookson Hills]] outlaws including [[Jim Clark (criminal)|Jim Clark]], [[Ed Davis (criminal)|Ed Davis]] and [[Robert Brady (criminal)|Robert "Big Bob" Brady]].

==Biography==

===Early life and criminal career===
Wilbur Underhill Jr. was born [[Joplin, Missouri]] on March 16, 1901, one of seven children. His three older brothers Earl, George and Ernest all became career criminals, though none gained the notoriety of Wilbur, while his three sisters led law-abiding lives. When Underhill was 12 years old, his brother George killed a local [[peanut|peanut vendor]] and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Underhill began to show a wild streak soon afterwards though his mother claimed it was the result of a childhood accident that "[didn't leave] him quite right". He also changed the spelling of his given name from Wilber to Wilbur believing it sounded more manly.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton, Michael. ''The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers''. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 303-304) {{ISBN|0-8160-4488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underhill committed his first criminal offense by stealing [[silver]]ware from a neighbor's home. When questioned by police, he attempted to convince them that a stranger had given it to him. In 1918, he was convicted of burglary and spent four years in prison. A year after his release, Underhill became locally known as the "Lovers Lane Bandit". When his identity became known, after being caught by a [[police sting|police decoy]], he was sent to the [[Missouri State Penitentiary]] for five years.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Crime spree with Ike "Skeet" Akins and the murder of George Fee===
Underhill was released on parole in late 1926, and on [[Christmas Day]] he and Ike "Skeet" Akins robbed a [[drug store]] on [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]]. In the course of the robbery, 19-year-old customer George Fee was killed. They were eventually arrested on January 7, 1927, and charged with murder and armed robbery. Underhill and Akins were still awaiting trial when they decided to escape from the Okmulgee jailhouse on January 30 with fellow inmates Red Gann and Duff Kennedy using smuggled [[hacksaws]]. While Underhill successfully eluded authorities, his partner was captured at [[Lamar, Missouri]] on February 9. Three days later, while being brought back to Okmulgee, Akins attempted another escape and was killed by Sheriff John Russell.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

A day after Akins' death, Underhill robbed a [[movie theater]] for $52 in [[Picher, Oklahoma]]. Confronted by Constable George Fuller, he grabbed Fuller's pistol and killed a deputized civilian, Earl O'Neal, before escaping. Underhill was finally caught in [[Panama, Oklahoma|Panama]] on March 20 and taken to Okmulgee where he was convicted of the Fee murder and sentenced to life imprisonment on June 3, 1927.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Escape and Frank Underhill===
Underhill made several attempts to escape from the [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]] and finally succeeded on July 14, 1931. Twelve days later, Underhill purchased a car in [[Cherryvale, Kansas]] under the name Ralph Carraway and robbed a local theater of $300 that same day. The following month he recruited his young nephew, Frank Underhill, to join him on a new crime spree. On August 12, they robbed a [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] gas station but got only $14.68. While leaving the scene of the robbery, Underhill crashed into another car and had to have it towed to a nearby garage and checked into a hotel.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

The next day, Patrolman Merle Colver arrived at the hotel. He had been assigned to check Wichita hotels for suspicious guests and went to their room to question them. When he knocked on the door, Wilbur Underhill shot him 3 times in the head killing him instantly&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odmp.org/officer/3299-detective-merle-rankin-colver Merle Colver at ODMP]&lt;/ref&gt; Fleeing on foot, Underhill became involved in a running gunfight with police. A 2-year-old boy was killed in the crossfire when police fired at Underhill. He was eventually stopped by a lucky shot to the neck. Wilbur Underhill was convicted with murder, earning him another life sentence, and was imprisoned in [[Lansing Correctional Facility|Lansing state prison]] on September 4, 1931. Frank Underhill was not charged and, apparently "scared straight" from his experience, never committed another criminal offense for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Bailey-Underhill Gang===
By the early 1930s, Underhill had become one of the most notorious bandits in Oklahoma. While an inmate in Lansing, he participated in a mass escape with 10 other inmates using pistols smuggled in by [[Frank Nash|Frank "Jelly" Nash]] and headed for [[Cookson Hills]]. Among those included in the jailbreak included fellow outlaws [[Harvey Bailey]], [[Jim Clark (criminal)|Jim Clark]], [[Frank Sawyer (criminal)|Frank Sawyer]], [[Ed Davis (criminal)|Ed Davis]] and [[Robert Brady (criminal)|Robert "Big Bob" Brady]] on May 30, 1933. Many of these men later became members of the gang headed by himself and Bailey as they set off on a crime spree lasting a little over six months.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Almost two weeks after their escape, on June 16, he and Bailey led a robbery with several other men robbed a bank in [[Black Rock, Arkansas]]. The next day, Underhill and Bailey were among several fugitives wrongly named as participants in the [[Kansas City Massacre]], a failed attempt to free Frank Nash from police custody, resulting in the deaths of Nash and the four lawmen guarding him. The gang continued its activities and robbed $11,000 from a bank in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]]. Two days later, Underhill apparently acted alone in a bank robbery in [[Canton, Kansas]] but rejoined the gang by the time the Bailey-Underhill Gang struck a bank in [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]] on August 9, 1933.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Return to the Cookson Hills===
Three days after the Kingfisher robbery, Bailey was visiting Robert Shannon, father-in-law of [[Machine Gun Kelly]], at his Texas ranch and safehouse when police and federal agents raided the property. Bailey had been passed ransom money from Kelly's kidnapping of oil tycoon Charles Urschel and wrongly convicted in the plot two months later.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

With Bailey serving a life sentence, Underhill took charge of the gang. On October 6, he and several unidentified men robbed $3,000 from a bank in [[Baxter Springs, Kansas]]. These were followed by bank raids in [[Galena, Kansas]] and [[Stuttgart, Arkansas]]. On November 9, he and [[Ford Bradshaw]] raided an Okmulgee bank with a few other men and escaped with $13,000.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Underhill was now attracting national media attention. He had been called "Mad Dog" or the "Tri-State Terror" by several newspapers, one even dubbing him The Southwest Executioner, while authorities made efforts to go after them almost immediately following the Okmulgee heist. A special task force was formed, and included [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]]s, and searching through Cookson Hills looking for him. On November 18, while the task force was still in Cookson Hills, Underhill presented himself at the courthouse in nearby [[Coalgate, Oklahoma|Coalgate]] and applied for a [[marriage license]] under his own name. His fiancée, Hazel Jarrett Hudson, was a sister of the outlaw Jarrett brothers. As part of a wedding present for Hazel, Underhill and several others robbed a bank in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Pursuit by the FBI===
FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], reportedly frustrated with the lack of progress from Oklahoma authorities, assigned agent R.H. Colvin to the Underhill case. Colvin soon discovered that Underhill had given his wife's address in [[Oklahoma City]] to the minister who married them in order to receive their marriage certificate. Federal agents staked out the home and spotted the Underhills a week later. Agents at the scene called for reinforcements but, by the time they arrived, the newlyweds had left to celebrate their [[honeymoon]]. A few days later, police raided a farm near [[Konawa, Oklahoma|Konawa]] where they knew Underhill was staying. However, Underhill had passed them earlier on the highway and was able to escape before police realized their mistake.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Underhill and his gang continued to remain active in the area. Underhill, Jack Lloyd and [[Ralph Roe]] attempted to burglarize a bank in [[Harrah, Oklahoma]] on December 11, 1933, and robbed another bank in Coalgate two days later.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Shawnee ambush and death===
On December 26, 1933, Wilbur and Hazel Underhill were celebrating their honeymoon with Ralph Roe and his girlfriend Eva May Nichols at a rented cottage in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]]. Four days later, a 24-man strike force including federal agents, state troopers and local police surrounded the house. The group was led by R.H. Colvin and Frank Smith, the latter a survivor of the Kansas City Massacre. When called on to surrender, Underhill began firing resulting in the task force returning fire.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Eva Nichols, an innocent woman, was killed in the gunfight and Underhill, barefoot and still in his underwear, ran from the house attempting to escape. He was hit five times before leaving the yard but ran for another 16 blocks before breaking into a furniture store and collapsing on one of the beds. Ralph Roe, also wounded, was taken into custody with Hazel Underhill. Underhill was taken to McAlester where he remained, handcuffed in his bed, at the prison hospital until his death on January 6, 1934. His last words were "Tell the boys I'm coming home".&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Underhill's gang, led by Ford Bradshaw, led a raid into the small town of [[Vian, Oklahoma|Vian]] and shot up the town in revenge for Underhill's capture. This accomplished little, especially with Underhill's death a week later, and the incident was used by newspapers to turn public opinion against the gang and within months Bradshaw and the others had been killed or apprehended.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Mongolian women''' had a higher [[social status]] than women in many other [[Asia]]n societies, but were considered unable to herd cattle and possibly not horses. Only one woman, Toregene, became supreme ruler in between maturity of the elected chosen Khan following Genghis Khan's introduction of heredity possibly claimed by the Tatars he was last with, and four Khatuns shared governorship and regional powers with Khublai Khan.

Many were herdswomen and mothers, but during the Middle Ages, some were women horse-archers and swordswomen, and Hun descendant sawkele impassioned women fighters were accepted but the Yassa while not prohibiting recommends them to commerce probably of their dairy produce or means them to kill rather than fight or as members of the [[Khuriltai]], a Mongol governmental council.

Genghis Khan's daughters were made army combat generals by him, including Altanqalan who made her husband separate from all his female friends respectively divorce all his wives. Some women were Mongol city commanders and khatuns and bekis in war for the rank of command in battle this gave, but khatuns were married to prolong the race.

== Traditional status of Mongolian women ==

Mongolian women have historically enjoyed a somewhat higher status than women from other [[East Asia]]n cultures. Women in Mongolia played vital roles in the family and economic life. Some more elite women had more opportunities than poor women, yet the demanding lifestyle required all women to work. Each household member had responsibilities, yet those of women tended to be much greater loads.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/education/women-modern-mongolia|title=Women in Modern Mongolia|last=Rossabi|first=Morris|date=|website=Asia Society|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cultures, women were expected to run the domestic duties in a household, yet women in Mongolia also managed out of the home work such as taking care of animals, manufacturing dairy products, shearing wool, and tanning hides.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Through their household work, women in elite ranks of society were able to further their roles in order to gain substantial amounts of power. Those less fortunate were unable to benefit from their domestic work. When the Mongol empire collapsed, poor women in society were unable to get any sort of proper health care or any opportunity for education and leisure.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Nomadic women in Mongolia have typically been those responsible for collecting buckets of water, cooking meals for the family, keeping livestock healthy, collecting wood for fires, nursing and raising children, making clothing, and generally keeping all domestic affairs in order.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

History has proved that the perception of Mongolian women today has revealed many contradictions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46cadabb0.pdf|title=Women in Mongolia|last=Burn|first=Nalini|date=2001|website=RefWorld|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures that surround the Mongolian women are seen as subordinate to men; yet for Mongolian women today, they are dominated by noble womanhood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is said that Mongolian women have traditionally had a higher degree of social positions and autonomy than women in the Islamic societies of Asia, China and Korea.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For those women who were widowed or left because of husbands in the military, taking over their jobs was often a common compromise. Although this did take place in many Mongol societies, women were still considered subordinate to men. Women were also domestically restricted in what they were and were not allowed to take part in when their husbands were around. Firm actions of this subordination were taken place in daily activities such as women were only allowed to tend to sheep, yet men were responsible for horses- a lamb versus a stallion in generic historical terms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Mongolian People's Republic ==
[[Mongolian People's Republic]] is the period of [[Mongolia]]n history which existed between 1924 and 1992 as a unitary sovereign [[socialist state]] in [[East Asia]]. It was ruled by the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] and maintained close links with the [[Soviet Union]] throughout its history.&lt;ref name="Cotton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton|first=James|title=Asian Frontier Nationalism: Owen Lattimore and the American Policy Debates|year=1989|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-2585-3|pages=130|editor=D. K. Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, women in Mongolia obtained ''de jure'' [[gender equality|equal rights]].
They had universal participation in all levels of education. In 1985, 63% of students in higher educational establishments were women along with 58% of the students in secondary schools.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/central-asia/Mongolia/sub8_2c/entry-4579.html#chapter-3|title=WOMEN, FAMILIES AND GENDER ROLES IN MONGOLIA {{!}} Facts and Details|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time frame, there were 51% women workers and 49% male.

Educated women began teaching and taking charge in the medicine department in 1979. These were both generally thought as the more female fields, and more than 60% of all doctors were female. Teaching was also predominantly a women’s job with 67% of all teachers in general schools and 33% of teachers in higher educational schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Despite having formal legal equality, as in other socialist states, ''de facto'' women remained subordinated to men.

== Marriage ==
[[File:Mère_et_fils.jpg|thumb|left|Mongolian woman with her child]]
Weddings in Mongolia are one of the most influential days of a man and woman's life together. Weddings are celebrated events that at times are even more important and births or deaths. In the past, history explains that Mongolian women were often married as young women of ages about 13 to 14.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/central-asia/Mongolia/sub8_2c/entry-4578.html|title=MARRIAGE AND WEDDINGS IN MONGOLIA {{!}} Facts and Details|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys were often married a bit older than women. In modern day, those with less money normally marry in their earlier 20s, while those more urban marry later in their 20s and 30s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mongolians normally had arranged marriages and once a man is married he is not allowed to marry thereafter. Monogamy is practiced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dating is not as common for those with less money such as herders, yet sex prior to marriage is practiced. When a woman gets married, normally she is expected to go and live with the grooms family. However, today nuclear families are becoming more common. When a womans husband passes away, it was not uncommon for her to marry her husband's brother.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is an old Mongolian tradition that is rarely practiced today. Marriage for Mongolians is normally a contract; an arrangement to meet the requirements of both families rather than religious events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many marriages in Mongolia are between friends or coworkers, that way women were married into their own social status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reproduction rights ==
Terms changed in 1921 when women were considered more of a value into economic growth for the population. A revolution began that year with determinations to bring women more into the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This was the first step in the states effort to promote population growth; a strong emphasis on women’s reproductive capacities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Women were pressured into having multiple children as part of their civic duties to the state.

== Politics ==

=== History of Women's Political Affiliation ===
The political alignment in Mongolia for women is the belief that women are discriminated against because they are women. Women also believe that they have little legitimacy when discussing political affairs with men.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the most traditional sense, in nomadic society, women were not allowed to partake in the formal political sphere as their decisions were limited to the household.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The subordination from a man to a women in Mongolia came to an end in 1921. This granted women citizen rights.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The new constitution also gave equal rights to all citizens of Mongolia without focus of origin, sex, gender, or beliefs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1924, Mongolian women were able to vote and potentially be elected as President. The Women's Federation was also founded which was funded by the state itself allowing more women to become more active participants in the political system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although many actions were taken, there is still much to be said for women in the political system and desire for the equality they would eventually like to have and deserve.

Active warfare throughout history has mainly been a matter for men, but women have also played a role, often a leading one. While women rulers conducting warfare was common, women who participated in active warfare were rare. The following list of prominent women in war and their exploits from about 1500 AD up to about 1700 AD.

Only women active in direct warfare, such as warriors, spies, and women who actively led armies are included in this list.

For '''women in warfare''' in what is now the United States during this time period, see [[Timeline of women in war in the United States, Pre-1945]].
&lt;!--Please respect the fact that this list is relevant only if it is a list of exceptions, which is to women who actually participated in active warfare, such as female warriors. Female monarchs who declared war are not exceptions in any way and their presence endangers this list to be deleted for not being relevant. The text MUST actually therefore be about female warriors, otherwise all female monarchs can be included, which would make this list pointless and liable to deletion --&gt;

'''Yahya III ibn al-Qasim''' ({{lang-ar|يحيى الثالث بن القاسم}}) was the eighth [[Idrisid]] ruler and [[Sultan|sultan]] of [[Morocco]]. He took over after the death of [[Ali ibn Umar|Ali II]] in 880.

He was nicknamed '''al-Kettani''' or the one related to linen, "Kettan" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This nickname was a result of him ordering his troops in [[Tlemcen]] to use linen made tents.

[[File:YamsatBrixtonMarket.jpg|thumb|Yams at a retail market]]
'''Yam''' is the common name for some plant species in the genus ''[[Dioscorea]]'' (family [[Dioscoreaceae]]) that form edible [[tuber]]s.&lt;ref name="cabi"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Dioscorea alata'' (white yam)|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/19293|publisher=Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI)|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yams are [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous]] [[vine]]s cultivated for the consumption of their [[starch]]y tubers in many [[temperate climate|temperate]] and [[tropics|tropical]] world regions.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; The tubers themselves are also called "yams", having numerous [[cultivar]]s and related species.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

In parts of the United States and Canada, "yam" is sometimes used to refer to varieties of the unrelated [[sweet potato]] (''[[Ipomoea batatas]]'').

== Etymology ==
The name, yam, appears to derive from Portuguese ''inhame'' or Canarian (Spain) ''ñame'', which derived from West African languages during trade.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yam|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/yam|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main derivations borrow from verbs meaning "to eat".&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

Yam has various common names across multiple world regions.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

== Description ==

 | caption2 = Yam
 }}
A [[Monocotyledon|monocot]] related to lilies and grasses, yams are vigorous [[herbaceous]] [[vine]]s, providing an edible [[tuber]].&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; They are native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Some yams are also [[invasive plant]]s, often considered a "[[noxious weed]]", outside cultivated areas.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; Yam tubers vary in size from that of a small potato to over {{convert|60|kg|abbr=on}}. Some 870 species of yams are known,&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; and 95% of these crops are grown in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everyday Mysteries: Yam |publisher=Library of Congress, United States of America |year=2011 |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/sweetpotato.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yam tubers can grow up to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|7.6|to|15.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; The tuber may grow into the soil up to {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; The plant disperses by seed.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

The edible tuber has a rough skin difficult to peel, but softens after heating. The skins vary in color from dark brown to light pink. The majority of the vegetable is composed of a much softer substance known as the "meat". This substance ranges in color from white or yellow to purple or pink in mature yams.

==Cultivation==
Yam crop begins when whole seed tubers or tuber portions are planted into mounds or ridges, at the beginning of the rainy season. The crop yield depends on how and where the [[sett]]s are planted, sizes of mounds, interplant spacing, provision of stakes for the resultant plants, yam species, and tuber sizes desired at harvest. Small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa often intercrop yams with cereals and vegetables. The seed yams are perishable and bulky to transport. Farmers who do not buy new seed yams usually set aside up to 30% of their harvest for planting the next year. Yam crops face pressure from a range of insect pests and fungal and viral diseases, as well as [[nematode]]. Their growth and dormant phases correspond respectively to the wet season and the dry season. For maximum yield, the yams require a humid tropical environment, with an annual rainfall  over 1500&amp;nbsp;mm distributed uniformly throughout the growing season. White, yellow, and water yams typically produce a single large tuber per year, generally weighing {{convert|5|to|10|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=stofao1 /&gt;

Despite the high labor requirements and production costs, consumer demand for yam is high in certain subregions of Africa,&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; making yam cultivation quite profitable to certain farmers.

=== Major cultivars ===
[[File:Kaachil cut.jpg|thumb|Purple yam freshly harvested and sliced for cross-sectional view]]
Many cultivars of yams are found throughout the humid tropics.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; The most economically important are discussed below.&lt;ref name=stofao1&gt;{{cite web|title=Storage and Processing of Roots and Tubers in the Tropics|publisher=Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations|author=Calverly|year=1998|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5415E/x5415e00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''D. rotundata'' and ''D. cayenensis'' ====
''[[Dioscorea rotundata]]'', the white yam, and ''[[Dioscorea cayenensis|D. cayenensis]]'', the yellow yam, are native to Africa. They are the most important cultivated yams. In the past, they were considered as two separate species, but most taxonomists now regard them as the same species. Over 200 varieties between them are cultivated.

White yam tuber is roughly cylindrical in shape, the skin is smooth and brown, and the flesh is usually white and firm. Yellow yam has yellow flesh, caused by the presence of carotenoids. It looks similar to the white yam in outer appearance; its tuber skin is usually a bit firmer and less extensively grooved. The yellow yam has a longer period of vegetation and a shorter dormancy than white yam.

The [[Kokoro (vegetable)|'Kokoro']] variety is important in making dried yam chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dumont |first1=R. |last2=Vernier |first2=P. |year=2000 |doi=10.5367/000000000101293149 |title=Domestication of yams (''Dioscorea cayenensis-rotundata'') within the Bariba ethnic group in Benin |journal=Outlook on Agriculture |volume=29 |issue=2 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are large plants; the vines can be as long as {{convert|10|to|12|m|abbr=on}}. The tubers most often weigh about {{convert|2.5|to|5|kg|abbr=on}} each, but can weigh as much as {{convert|25|kg|abbr=on}}. After 7 to 12&amp;nbsp;months' growth, the tubers are harvested. In Africa, most are pounded into a paste to make the traditional dish of "pounded yam," known as [[Iyan]].&lt;ref name="kay" &gt;{{cite web |author=Kay, D.E. |year=1987 |url=http://www.appropedia.org/Original:Root_Crops_37 |title=Root Crops |publisher=Tropical Development and Research Institute |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''D. alata'' ====
[[File:Yam with numerous protruding fibers.jpg|thumb|right|Water yam (''D. alata'')]]

''[[Dioscorea alata|D. alata]]'', called "white yam",&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; winged yam, water yam, and purple yam (not to be confused with the Okinawan purple "yam", which is a [[sweet potato]]), was first cultivated in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; Although not grown in the same quantities as the African yams, it has the largest distribution worldwide of any cultivated yam, being grown in Asia, the Pacific islands, Africa, and the West Indies.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mignouna, H.D. |author2=Abang, M.M. |author3=Asiedu, R. |year=2003 |title=Harnessing modern biotechnology for tropical tubercrop improvement: Yam (Dioscorea spp.) molecular breeding |url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?jb03096}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in Africa, the popularity of water yam is second only to white yam. The tuber shape is generally cylindrical, but can vary. Tuber flesh is white and watery in texture.

''Uhi'' was brought to Hawaii by the early Polynesian settlers and became a major crop in the 19th century when the tubers were sold to visiting ships as an easily stored food supply for their voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=White, L.D. |year=2003 |url=http://www.canoeplants.com/uhi.html |series=Canoe Plants of Ancient Hawai'i |title=Uhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''D. polystachya'' ====
[[File:Dioscorea polystachya (batatas).jpg|thumb|Segment of a [[Chinese yam]]]]

''[[Dioscorea polystachya|D. polystachya]]'', Chinese yam, is native to China. The Chinese yam plant is somewhat smaller than the African, with the vines about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. It is tolerant to frost and can be grown in much cooler conditions than other yams. It is also grown in Korea and Japan.

It was introduced to Europe in the 19th century, when the [[potato]] crop there was falling victim to disease, and is still grown in France for the Asian food market.

The tubers are harvested after about 6 months of growth. Some are eaten right after harvesting and some are used as ingredients for other dishes, including noodles, and for traditional medicines.&lt;ref name="kay" /&gt;

==== ''D. bulbifera'' ====
[[File:Starr 030807-0054 Dioscorea bulbifera.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Air potato]]
[[File:MS 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Wild yams]]

''[[Dioscorea bulbifera|D. bulbifera]]'', the air potato, is found in both Africa and Asia, with slight differences between those found in each place. It is a large vine, {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} or more in length. It produces tubers, but the [[bulb]]ils which grow at the base of its leaves are the more important food product. They are about the size of potatoes (hence the name "air potato"), weighing from {{convert|0.5|to|2.0|kg|abbr=on}}.

Some varieties can be eaten raw, while some require soaking or boiling for detoxification before eating. It is not grown much commercially since the flavor of other yams is preferred by most people. However, it is popular in home vegetable gardens because it produces a crop after only four months of growth and continues producing for the life of the vine, as long as two years. Also, the bulbils are easy to harvest and cook.&lt;ref name="kay" /&gt;

In 1905, the air potato was introduced to Florida and has since become an [[invasive species]] in much of the state. Its rapid growth crowds out native vegetation and is very difficult to remove since it can grow back from the tubers, and new vines can grow from the bulbils even after being cut down or burned.&lt;ref name="schultz" &gt;{{cite web |author=Schultz, G.E. |year=1993 |title=Element Stewardship Abstract for ''Dioscorea bulbifera'', Air potato |url=http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/documnts/diosbul.html |publisher=Nature Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''D. esculenta'' ====
[[File:Dioscorea Bild1162.jpg|thumb|Wild bitter yam vines]]
''[[Dioscorea esculenta|D. esculenta]]'', the lesser yam, was one of the first yam species cultivated. It is native to Southeast Asia and is the third-most commonly cultivated species there, although it is cultivated very little in other parts of the world. Its vines seldom reach more than {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and the tubers are fairly small in most varieties.

The tubers are eaten baked, boiled, or fried much like potatoes. Because of the small size of the tubers, mechanical cultivation is possible, which along with its easy preparation and good flavor, could help the lesser yam to become more popular in the future.&lt;ref name="kay" /&gt;

==== ''D. dumetorum'' ====
''[[Dioscorea dumetorum|D. dumetorum]]'', the bitter yam, is popular as a vegetable in parts of West Africa, in part because their cultivation requires less labor than other yams. The wild forms are very toxic and are sometimes used to poison animals when mixed with bait. It is said that they have also been used for criminal purposes.&lt;ref name="kay" /&gt;

==== ''D. trifida'' ====
''[[Dioscorea trifida|D. trifida]]'', the cush-cush yam, is native to the [[Guyana]] region of South America and is the most important cultivated New World yam. Since they originated in tropical [[rainforest]] conditions, their growth cycle is less related to seasonal changes than other yams. Because of their relative ease of cultivation and their good flavor, they are considered to have a great potential for increased production.&lt;ref name="kay" /&gt;

== Harvesting ==
Yams in west Africa are typically harvested by hand using sticks, spades, or diggers.&lt;ref name=opara /&gt; Wood-based tools are preferred to metallic tools as they are less likely to damage the fragile tubers; however, wood tools need frequent replacement. Yam harvesting is labor-intensive and physically demanding. Tuber harvesting involves standing, bending, [[Squatting position|squatting]], and sometimes sitting on the ground depending on the size of mound, size of tuber, or depth of tuber penetration. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the tuber, because damaged tubers do not store well and spoil rapidly. Some farmers use staking and mixed cropping, a practice that complicates harvesting in some cases.

In forested areas, tubers grow in areas where other tree roots are present. Harvesting the tuber then involves the additional step of freeing them from other roots. This often causes tuber damage.

Aerial tubers or bulbils are harvested by manual plucking from the vine.

Yields may improve and cost of yam production be lower if mechanization were to be developed and adopted. However, current crop production practices and species used pose considerable hurdles to successful mechanization of yam production, particularly for small-scale rural farmers. Extensive changes in traditional cultivation practices, such as mixed cropping, may be required. Modification of current tuber harvesting equipment is necessary given yam tuber architecture and its different physical properties.&lt;ref name=opara&gt;{{cite web |title=YAMS: Post-Harvest Operation |author=Linus Opara |year=2003 |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/inpho/docs/Post_Harvest_Compendium_-_Yams.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yamoutput.png|thumb|300px|right|Worldwide yam production]]

In 2014, worldwide production of yams was 68.1 million [[tonne]]s, led by [[Nigeria]] with 66% of the global total (table). Nigeria farmed yams on 5.4 million [[hectares]], 70% of the world land area of 7.8 million hectares devoted to yam farming.&lt;ref name=faostat14/&gt; 

The world average annual yield of yams was 8.8 tonnes per hectare in 2014, with [[Ethiopia]] having the most productive farms of 29.7 tonnes per hectare.&lt;ref name=faostat14/&gt;

== Storage ==

Roots and tubers such as yam are living organisms. When stored, they continue to respire, which results in the oxidation of the starch (a polymer of glucose) contained in the cells of the tuber, which converts it into water, carbon dioxide, and heat energy. During this transformation of the starch, the dry matter of the tuber is reduced.

Amongst the major roots and tubers, properly stored yam is considered to be the least perishable. Successful storage of yams requires:&lt;ref name=fao1990a /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Roots, Tubers, and Plantains in Food Security: In Sub-Saharan Africa, in Latin America and the Caribbean, in the Pacific |year=1989 |publisher=FAO |isbn=978-92-5-102782-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* initial selection of sound and healthy yams
* proper curing, if possible combined with fungicide treatment
* adequate ventilation to remove the heat generated by respiration of the tubers
* regular inspection during storage and removal of rotting tubers and any sprouts that develop
* protection from direct sunlight and rain

Storing yam at low temperature reduces the respiration rates. However, temperatures below {{convert|12|C}} cause damage through chilling, causing a breakdown of internal tissues, increasing water loss and yam's susceptibility to decay. The symptoms of chilling injury are not always obvious when the tubers are still in cold storage. The injury becomes noticeable as soon as the tubers are restored to ambient temperatures.

The best temperature to store yams is between {{convert|14|and|16|C}}, with high-technology-controlled humidity and climatic conditions, after a process of curing. Most countries that grow yams as a staple food are too poor to afford high-technology storage systems.

Sprouting rapidly increases a tuber's respiration rates, and accelerates the rate at which its food value decreases.&lt;ref name=fao1990a /&gt;

Certain cultivars of yams store better than others. The easier to store yams are those adapted to arid climate, where they tend to stay in a dormant low-respiration stage much longer than yam breeds adapted to humid tropical lands, where they do not need dormancy. Yellow yam and cush-cush yam, by nature, have much shorter dormancy periods than water yam, white yam, or lesser yam.

Storage losses for yams are very high in Africa, with insects alone causing over 25% harvest loss within 4 months.

Raw yam has only moderate nutrient density, with appreciable content (10% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) limited to [[potassium]], [[vitamin B6]], [[manganese]], [[thiamin]], [[dietary fiber]], and [[vitamin C]] (table).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Postharvest technology and commodity marketing: Proceedings of a postharvest conference |year=1998 |isbn=978-978-131-111-6 |page=172 |author=Uwaegbute, Osho and Obatolu|publisher=International Institute of Tropical Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yam supplies 118 [[Calories]] per 100&amp;nbsp;grams. Yam generally has a lower [[glycemic index]], about 54% of [[glucose]] per 150&amp;nbsp;gram serving, compared to potato products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm |title=Glycemic index and glycemic load for 100+ foods |series=Harvard Health Publications |publisher=Harvard Medical School |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protein content and quality of roots and tubers is lower than other food staples, with the content of yam and potato  being around 2% on a fresh-weight basis. Yams, with [[cassava]], provide a much greater proportion of the protein intake in Africa, ranging from 6% in East and South Africa to about 16% in humid West Africa.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

As a relatively low-protein food, yam is not a good source of [[essential amino acids]]. Experts emphasize the need to supplement a yam-dominant diet with more protein-rich foods to support healthy growth in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kwashiorkor (Protein-Calorie Malnutrition) |publisher=Tropical Medicine Central Resource |year=2006 |url=http://tmcr.usuhs.mil/tmcr/chapter16/Kwashiorkor.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Undernutrition |publisher=The Merck Manual: The Home Health Handbook |year=2010 |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders_of_nutrition/undernutrition/undernutrition.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yam is an important dietary element for Nigerian and West African people. It contributes more than 200 calories per person per day for more than 150 million people in West Africa, and is an important source of income. Yam is an attractive crop in poor farms with limited resources. It is rich in starch, and can be prepared in many ways. It is available all year round, unlike other, unreliable, seasonal crops. These characteristics make yam a preferred food and a culturally important food security crop in some sub-Saharan African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Determinants of yam production and profitability in Edo State, Nigeria |author=Izekor and Olumese |journal=African Journal of General Agriculture |volume=6 |number=4 |date=December 2010 |url=http://www.asopah.org/journals/ajga/ajga6/ajga640310091.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phytochemicals ==
The tubers of certain wild yam, a variant of kokoro yam and other species of ''Dioscorea'', such as ''[[Dioscorea nipponica]]'', are a source for the extraction of [[diosgenin]], a [[steroid]] [[sapogenin]].&lt;ref name="jesus"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=5225340 |year=2016 |last1=Jesus |first1=M. |last2=Martins |first2=A.

== Comparison to other staple foods ==
The following table shows the nutrient content of yam and major staple foods in a raw harvested form. Raw forms, however, are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked for human consumption. In sprouted or cooked form, the relative nutritional and antinutritional contents of each of these staples is remarkably different from that of raw form of these staples.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Consumption ==
[[File:Kiekie yams.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tonga]]n farmer showing off his prize yams]]
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}

Yams are consumed in a variety of preparations, such as flour or whole vegetable pieces across their range of distribution in Asia, Africa, North America, [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], South America, and [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

=== Africa ===
[[File:Fufuprep.jpg|thumb|upright|Young women preparing [[fufu]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]]]

Yams of African species must be cooked to be safely eaten, because various natural substances in yams can cause illness if consumed raw. The most common cooking methods in [[West Africa|Western]] and [[Central Africa]] are by boiling, frying or roasting.&lt;ref name="bmgf"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nweke, Felix |author2=Aidoo, Robert |author3=Okoye, Benjamin |title=Yam Consumption Patterns in West Africa |url=https://agriknowledge.org/downloads/6969z081q |publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation |accessdate=5 December 2017 |date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Akan of Ghana, boiled yam can be mashed with palm oil into ''eto'' in a similar manner to the plantain dish ''[[matoke]]'', and is served with eggs. The boiled yam can also be pounded with a traditional mortar and pestle to create a thick, starchy paste known as ''[[iyan]]'' (pounded yam) or ''[[fufu]]'' which is eaten with traditional sauces such as ''[[egusi]]'' and [[Oil palm|palm nut]] soup.

Another method of consumption is to leave the raw yam pieces to [[Drying (food)|dry in the sun]]. When dry, the pieces turn a dark brown color. These are then milled to create a brown powder known in Nigeria as ''elubo''. The powder can be mixed with boiling water to create a thick starchy paste, a kind of pudding known as [[amala (food)|''amala'']], which is then eaten with local soups and sauces.

Yams are a primary agricultural and culturally important [[commodity]] in [[West Africa]],&lt;ref name=bmgf/&gt; where over 95% of the world's yam crop is harvested. Yams are still important for survival in these regions. Some varieties of these tubers can be stored up to six months without refrigeration, which makes them a valuable resource for the yearly period of food scarcity at the beginning of the [[rainy season|wet season]]. Yam cultivars are also cultivated in other humid tropical countries.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

Yam is the main staple crop of the [[Igbo people|Igbos]] in south eastern Nigeria where for centuries it played a dominant role in both their agricultural and cultural life. It is celebrated with annual [[New Yam Festival of the Igbo|yam festivals]]

Taro paste, a traditional Chaoshan cuisine, which originated from the [[Chaoshan]] region in the eastern part of China's [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] is a dessert made primarily from taro. The taro is steamed and then mashed into a thick paste, which forms the base of the dessert. Pumpkin is also added for sweetness and to create a smoother consistency. Lard or fried onion oil is then added for fragrance. The dessert is traditionally sweetened with water chestnut syrup, and served with ginkgo nuts. Modern versions of the dessert include the addition of coconut cream and sweet corn. The dessert is commonly served at traditional Teochew wedding banquet dinners as the last course, marking the end of the banquet.

In the Philippines, the purple ''ube'' species of yam (''[[Dioscorea alata]]''), is eaten as a sweetened dessert called ''ube halaya'', and is also used as an ingredient in another Filipino dessert, ''[[halo-halo]]''. It is also used as a popular ingredient for ice cream.

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, the same purple yam is used for preparing a special type of soup ''canh khoai mỡ'' or fatty yam soup. This involves mashing the yam and cooking it until very well done.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, the same purple yam is used for preparing desserts. This involves mashing the yam and mixing it with coconut milk and sugar. White- and off-white-fleshed yams are cut in cubes, cooked, lightly fermented, and eaten as afternoon snacks.

=== Japan ===
[[File:Yamakake.JPG|thumb|right|''Yamakake'' is a yam-based Japanese dish prepared from [[Dioscorea polystachya|''tororo'']] and ''[[maguro]]''.]] An exception to the cooking rule is the mountain yam (''[[Dioscorea polystachya]]''), known as ''nagaimo'' and can be further classified into ''ichōimo'' (lit. 'ginkgo-leaf yam'; kanji: 銀杏芋), or ''yamatoimo'' (lit. Yamato yam; kanji: [[wikt:大和芋|大和芋]]), depending on the root shape.

''Nagaimo'' is eaten raw and grated, after only a relatively minimal preparation: the whole tubers are briefly soaked in a vinegar-water solution to neutralize irritant [[oxalate]] crystals found in their skin. The raw vegetable is starchy and bland, [[mucilaginous]] when grated, and may be eaten plain as a side dish, or added to noodles.

Another variety of yam, ''jinenjo'', is used in Japan as an ingredient in soba noodles. In Okinawa, purple yams (''[[Dioscorea alata]]'') are grown. This is known locally as'' daijo '' or ''beniimo''. This purple yam is popular as lightly deep-fried tempura, as well as being grilled or boiled. Additionally, the purple yam is a common ingredient of yam ice cream with the signature purple color. Purple yam is also used in other types of traditional ''[[wagashi]]'' sweets, cakes, and candy.

=== India ===
In central parts of India, the yam (''khamalu'', ''suran'', or ''chupri alu'') is prepared by being finely sliced, seasoned with spices, and deep fried. In southern parts of India, known as ''karunai kizhangu'' in Tamil, the vegetable is a popular accompaniment to rice dishes and fish curry. Also eaten in India, ''D. alata'', a purple-pigmented species, is known as ''ratalu'' or violet yam.

In the southern part, especially in Kerala, both purple and white colored yams are locally known as ''kaachil'' or ''kavuttu''.

In Karnataka, it is known as ''suvarna gadde'' in [[Kannada]] language. In central India, it is also called ''garadu".
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as ''ganisi gadda''.

=== Nepal ===
''Dioscorea root ''is traditionally eaten on ''Māgh Sankrānti'' (a midwinter festival) in Nepal. In Nepali, it is called ''tarul'' and in Newari ''hī''. It is usually steamed and then cooked with spices.

=== Fiji Islands ===
Yam, known locally in Fiji as "uvi",&lt;ref name="uvi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=303378 |title=Million dollar aim |author=Naleba, Mere |publisher=The Fiji Times Online |date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; may replace [[cassava]] or [[taro]] as a staple, and is consumed boiled, roasted in a [[Earth oven|lovo]], or steamed with fish or meat in [[curry]] sauce or [[coconut milk]] and served with rice. The cost of yam is higher due to the difficulty in farming and relatively low volume of production on Fiji.&lt;ref name=uvi/&gt;

=== The West ===
Yam powder is available in the West from grocers specializing in African products, and may be used in a similar manner to instant mashed potato powder, although preparation is a little more difficult because of the tendency to form lumps. The yam powder is sprinkled onto a pan containing a small amount of boiling water, and stirred vigorously. The resulting mixture is served with a heated sauce, such as tomato and chili, poured onto it.

Because of their abundance and importance to survival, yams were highly regarded in Jamaican ceremonies and constitute part of many traditional West African ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cooking, cuisine and class: A study in comparative sociology |author=Goody, Jack |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-28696-1 |pages=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toxicity ==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2017}}

Unlike [[cassava]], most varieties of edible, mature, cultivated yam do not contain toxic compounds. However, there are exceptions. Bitter compounds tend to accumulate in immature tuber tissues of white and yellow yams. These may be polyphenols or [[tannin]]-like compounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Wild forms of bitter yams do contain some toxins that taste bitter, hence are referred to as bitter yam. Bitter yams are not normally eaten except at times of desperation in poor countries and in times of local food scarcity. They are usually detoxified by soaking in a vessel of salt water, in cold or hot fresh water or in a stream. The bitter compounds in these yams are water-soluble alkaloids which, on ingestion, produce severe and distressing symptoms. Severe cases of alkaloid intoxication may prove fatal.

Aerial or potato yams have antinutritional factors. In Asia, detoxification methods, involving water extraction, fermentation, and roasting of the grated tuber, are used for bitter cultivars of this yam. The bitter compounds in yams also known locally as air potato include diosbulbin and possibly [[saponin]]s, such as [[diosgenin]].&lt;ref name=jesus/&gt; In Indonesia, an extract of air potato is used in the preparation of arrow poison.&lt;ref name=fao1990a&gt;{{cite book |title=Roots, tubers, plantains and bananas in human nutrition |publisher=FAO |year=1990 |author1=Oke, O.L. |editor1=Redhead, J. |editor2=Hussain, M.A. |isbn=978-92-5-102862-9 |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/T0207E/T0207E08.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashanti Yam Ceremony 1817.jpg|thumb|right|Ashanti yam ceremony in Ghana has been part of the local history, shown in this 1817 painting of a yam ceremony]]

== Cultural aspects ==
=== Nigeria and Ghana ===
A yam festival is usually held in the beginning of August at the end of the rainy season. People offer yams to gods and ancestors first, before distributing them to the villagers. This is their way of giving thanks to the spirits above them.

==== New Yam Festival ====

The New Yam Festival celebrates the main agricultural crop of the [[Igbo people|Igbos]], Idomas, and Tivs. The New Yam Festival, known as ''Orureshi'' in Owukpa in Idoma west and ''Ima-Ji'', ''Iri-Ji'' or ''Iwa Ji'' in Igbo land, is a celebration depicting the prominence of yam in social and cultural life. The festival is prominent among southeastern states and major tribes in [[Benue State]], mainly around August.

=== Other ===
Historical records in West Africa and of African yams in Europe date back to the 16th&amp;nbsp;century. Yams were taken to the Americas through precolonial Portuguese and Spanish on the borders of Brazil and Guyana, followed by a dispersion through the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0207e/T0207E01.htm |title=Roots, tubers, plantains and bananas in human nutrition |at=Acknowledgments, preface, introduction, origins, and distribution |work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yams are used in Papua New Guinea, where they are called ''kaukau''. Their cultivation and harvesting is accompanied by complex rituals and taboos. The coming of the yams (one of the numerous versions from [[Maré]]) is described in Pene Nengone ([[Loyalty Islands]] of [[New Caledonia]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">The '''Years of Lead''' were a political phenomenon related to the [[Cold War]] that was characterized by [[left-wing terrorism|left-]] and [[right-wing terrorism]] and the putative [[strategy of tension]], beginning in Italy and later spreading to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3372239.stm Italy's history of terror]&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy terrorist groups include the [[Red Brigades]] and [[Ordine Nuovo]], in Germany there was the [[Red Army Faction]] and in France there was  ''[[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]]''. In Belgium, the ''années de plomb'' or "Bloody Eighties", refers to the [[Brabant killers|Brabant massacres]] which resulted in 28 deaths. The far-right movement [[Westland New Post]] (WNP) has been suspected in this campaign. Attacks by the [[Communist Combatant Cells]], a short-lived group, killed two. Many of the right-wing groups involved have been linked to [[Operation Gladio]]. The liberation of [[James L.
