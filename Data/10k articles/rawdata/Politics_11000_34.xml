The '''Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions''',&lt;ref name=vrbm137&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0FIOAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Van%20Rensselaers%20in%20Holland%20and%20in%20America&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts], pp. 137&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as the '''Charter of Privileges and Exemptions''',&lt;ref name=chamber26&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3MTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false New Netherland Chamber of Commerce in America], pp. 26&lt;/ref&gt; is a document written by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in an effort to settle its [[colony]] of [[New Netherland]] in [[North America]] through the establishment of feudal [[patroonship]]s purchased and supplied by members of the West India Company. Its 31 articles establish ground rules and expectations of the patroons and inhabitants of the new colonies. It was ratified by the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] on June 7, 1629.&lt;ref name = vrbm137/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/vanrensselaerfam21spoo#page/8/mode/1up Spooner], pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{New Netherland}}

The economic situation of the colony of New Netherland in the late 1620s could be considered a fairly good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness.&lt;ref name = chamber26/&gt; The first settlement was built in 1613, strictly out of necessity, but soon after, forts were built. At the time of the charter, the oldest settlement was only 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Welling| first = George M.| title = The United States of America and the Netherlands: The First Dutch Settlers| work = From Revolution to Reconstruction| accessdate =| date = 24 November 2004| url = http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/E/newnetherlands/nl2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. The principal objective of this organization was to go after the spoils of war, which promised rich harvests in the captured fleets of the [[Spain|Spanish]], with colonization being only a secondary consideration. Noting that the capture of the [[Spanish treasure fleet|silver fleet]] in 1628 left the company proceeds of $115,000,000, and that the next year sundry privateers brought in a bounty of over $18,000,000, it was hardly surprising that so little attention was paid to the settlements in the [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River Valley]]. Those were "get rich quick" days for large corporations, and the slow and tedious procedure of colonizing and cultivating new countries found little favor in the eyes of the men at the helm.&lt;ref name = chamber26/&gt;

==The Charter==
The realization that greater inducements had to be offered to increase the development of the colony led the West India Company to the creation of the so-called "[[patroon|patroon system]]". In 1629, the West India Company issued its charter of "Freedoms and Exemptions" by which it was declared that any member of the Company who could bring to and settle 50 persons over the age of 15 in New Netherland, should receive a liberal grant of land to hold as ''patroon'', or lord, with the exception, per [[:wikisource:Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions#Article III|Article III]], of the island of [[Manhattan]]. This land could have a frontage of {{convert|16|mi|km}} if on one side of a river, or {{convert|8|mi|km}} if situated on both sides. The patroon would be chief [[magistrate]] on his land, but disputes of more than 50 [[guilder]]s could be appealed to the [[Director of New Netherland|Director]] and his Council in [[New Amsterdam]].

The tenants would be free from all taxation for 10 years, but during this period they would not be allowed to change from one estate to another nor to move from the country to the town. At least one quarter of the 50 inhabitants would have to be settled within the first year of the land grant, with the rest being settled within three years following that. The patroons would have full liberty to purchase goods in New Netherland, [[New England]], and [[New France]], with the exception of furs. But the trader would have to pay an export tax of five per cent in New Amsterdam before goods could be shipped to [[Europe]]. The [[Fur trade#North American fur trade|fur trade]] remained a monopoly of the Company, being the most profitable investment at the time. The weaving of cloth was also prohibited in order to supply the looms in Holland with their needed raw supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3MTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Netherland Chamber of Commerce in America], pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

The patroon would be responsible for the expenses in erecting barns and other structures and preparing land for farming in addition to supplying the initial farming tools, vehicles, and livestock. However, each tenant would be due to pay a stipulated rent in addition to a percentage of that which they produced. Additionally, no farmer could sell any good without first offering it to patroon. The patroon also bore responsibility of hiring a minister and schoolmaster, as well as financing the respective structures when they became needed. Once the patroonship became a profitable enterprise, the patroon was expected to share net profits with the tenants.&lt;ref name=colton45&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgpsNImMvP8C&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=aPiBwEpTyX&amp;dq=%22charter%20of%20freedoms%20and%20exemptions%22&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Colton], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some notable aspects of the charter, which, while aiming to make the West India Company wealthy and successful, offered great incentives to the patroons and respect to the indigenous peoples. For example, [[:wikisource:Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions#Article XXVI|Article XXVI]] states that the patroon "must satisfy the Indians of that place for the land", essentially implying that the land must be bought (or [[barter]]ed) from the local Indians, and not just taken. [[:wikisource:Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions#Article VI|Article VI]] states that the patroon "shall forever own and possess and hold from the Company as a perpetual fief of inheritance, all the land lying within the aforesaid limits", which made the patroonship a [[fiefdom]]. It shall be seen later that one patroonship would last well into the 19th century. Additionally, the Company agreed to protect the patroonships from attack ([[:wikisource:Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions#Article XXV|Article XXV]]), and even supply the patroonship—for free—"with as many [[African slave trade|blacks]] as it possibly can&amp;nbsp;... for [no] longer [a] time than it shall see fit" ([[:wikisource:Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions#Article XXX|Article XXX]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource|title=Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions|author=Dutch West India Company|year=1629|others=Trans. Arnold Johan Ferdinand Van Laer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resulting patroonships==

The earliest venture to explore New Netherland for future colonization by a potential patroon was upon notification to the Directors on January 13, 1629 that [[Samuel Godyn]], [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Dutch merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]], and [[Samuel Blommaert]] had sent Gillis Houset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper to determine satisfactory locations for settlement. This took place before the Charter was ratified, but was done in agreement with a draft of the Charter from March 28, 1628.&lt;ref name = vrbm154&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0FIOAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Van%20Rensselaers%20in%20Holland%20and%20in%20America&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts], pp. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon ratification of the charter on June 7, 1629, [[Michael Reyniersz Pauw|Michael Pauw]] informed the Directors of his intention to settle along the "Sickenames River", a stream east of the [[Connecticut River]].&lt;ref name=vrbm154155&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0FIOAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Van%20Rensselaers%20in%20Holland%20and%20in%20America&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscript], pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, Samuel Godyn declared his intention to settle "the bay of the South River", the current day [[Delaware Bay]], naming the settlement [[Zwaanendael]].&lt;ref name=vrbm155&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0FIOAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Van%20Rensselaers%20in%20Holland%20and%20in%20America&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Van Rensselaer Bower Manuscripts], pp. 155&lt;/ref&gt; After the settlement had been in existence for only a short while, the colonists—32 in number—were murdered by the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]].&lt;ref name=chamber27&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3MTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Netherland Chamber of Commerce in America], pp. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Godyn sold his holdings back to the West India Company.&lt;ref name = vrbm164/&gt;

Patroonships were not limited to the area of the [[northeastern United States]].

The '''Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) – The Farmer-Labor Party of Ontario''', or more commonly known as '''the Ontario CCF''', was a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] political party that existed from 1932 to 1961. It was the provincial wing of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|national CCF]]. The party had no leader in the beginning, and was governed by a provincial council and executive. The party's first Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was elected by voters in the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 Ontario general election]]. In the [[Ontario general election, 1937|1937 general election]], no CCF members were elected to the Ontario Legislature. In 1942, the party elected Toronto lawyer [[Ted Jolliffe]] as its first leader. He led the party to within a few seats of forming the government in the [[Ontario general election, 1943|1943 general election]]; instead, it formed the [[Leader of the Opposition (Ontario)|Official Opposition]]. In that election, the first two women were elected to the Ontario Legislature as CCFers: [[Agnes Macphail]] and [[Rae Luckock]]. The [[Ontario general election, 1945|1945 election]] was a setback, as the party lost most of its seats in the Legislature, including Jolliffe's seat. The party again became the Official Opposition after the [[Ontario general election, 1948|1948 general election]], and defeated the Conservative premier [[George A. Drew|George Drew]] in his seat, when [[William Horace Temple|Bill Temple]] unexpectedly won in the [[High Park (electoral district)|High Park]] constituency. The middle and late 1940s were the peak years for the Ontario CCF. After that time, its electoral performances were dismal, as it was reduced to a rump of two seats in the [[Ontario general election, 1951|1951 election]], three seats in the [[Ontario general election, 1955|1955 election]], and five seats in the [[Ontario general election, 1959|1959 election]]. Jolliffe stepped down as leader in 1953, and was replaced by [[Donald C. MacDonald]].

The period between the 1951 defeat and the founding of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] was one of much internal strife, but MacDonald managed to keep the party together, despite the constant electoral defeats. In October 1961, the party dissolved itself and became part of the New Democratic Party.

==Origins==
The Ontario CCF was indirectly the successor to the 1919–23 [[United Farmers of Ontario]]–[[Labour Party of Canada|Labour]] [[coalition government|coalition]] that formed the government in Ontario under [[Ernest C. Drury]].&lt;ref name=UFO&gt;{{cite web|last=MacPherson|first=Ian|title=The United Farmers of Ontario|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/united-farmers-of-canada/|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=The Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=2011-08-16|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60zJ4VQS6?url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008229|archivedate=2011-08-16|location=Toronto|year=2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While United Farmer [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) joined the [[Ontario Liberal Party]], the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO), as an organization, participated in the formation of the Ontario CCF, and was briefly affiliated with the party.&lt;ref name=UFO/&gt;

After a meeting in Ottawa on May 26, 1932, that brought together all the Members of Parliament that belonged to the Ginger Group, and some members of the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] (LSR), the CCF was formed, making [[J. S. Woodsworth]] the de facto leader, and giving responsibility for organizing Ontario to [[Agnes Macphail]] of the UFO.&lt;ref name="McNaught p.259"&gt;McNaught (1959), pp.259, 262&lt;/ref&gt; Macphail, as president of the Ontario Provincial Council, persuaded her fellow delegates at the December 1932 UFO convention to affiliate with the CCF provincial council.&lt;ref name="McNaught p.259"/&gt; After the 1933 Regina convention, the name of the party was introduced as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) – The Farmer-Labor Party, though the shorter Ontario CCF was the most commonly used name.&lt;ref name="Whats that name"&gt;Szmigielski (1977), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Macphail served as the first chairman of the Ontario CCF from 1932 until 1934.&lt;ref name="Stewart&amp;Shackeltonp171-2"&gt;Stewart &amp; Shackelton (1959), pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt; As a UFO Member of Parliament (MP) in the Canadian House of Commons, she was forced to resign from the CCF after the UFO withdrew from the party after alleging communist influence in it.&lt;ref name=phil/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart&amp;Shackeltonp178"&gt;Stewart &amp; Shackelton (1959), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the UFO's two candidates in the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 provincial election]], including longtime MLA [[Farquhar Oliver]], ran under the UFO banner rather than with the CCF. Oliver was elected and later joined the Liberals. Macphail later served in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] as the CCF [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]] (MPP)&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;In 1938, Members of the Ontario Legislative Assembly (MLAs) passed a motion to adopt the title "Members of Provincial Parliament" (MPP).&lt;/ref&gt; for [[York East]] from 1943 to 1945 and again from 1948 to 1951.&lt;ref name="Historica election dates"&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=Naomi|title=Macphail, Agnes Campbell|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/agnes-macphail/|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=The Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=2011-08-16|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60zge6Is7?url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005013|archivedate=2011-08-17|location=Toronto|year=2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Lawrence]], an Independent Labour Party member of Hamilton City Council, was elected to the Ontario legislature as a CCF MPP in the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 provincial election]], the first Ontario election contested by the CCF.&lt;ref name="Horn p64"/&gt; The party received 7.1 percent of the vote and, with Lawrence's election in [[Hamilton East (provincial electoral district)|Hamilton East]], won its first seat in the Ontario Legislature.&lt;ref name="Horn p64"/&gt; The Ontario CCF failed to win any seats in the [[Ontario general election, 1937|1937 election]]. He was elected Ontario CCF president in 1941.&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite news|title=SAM LAWRENCE NAMED BY C.C.F.: Unanimously Selected to Head Ontario Group|work=The Globe and Mail|date=14 April 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as Mayor of Hamilton from 1944 to 1949 leading a CCF slate in that city.

Alderman John Mitchell of Hamilton was elected the first Ontario CCF president in 1934 as part of a reorganization of the party after its provincial council had been suspended by federal leader [[J. S. Woodsworth]] for suspected communist infiltration. The reorganization created a new provincial council and central party executive and centralized what had been a loose structure of affiliate organizations and riding clubs. It was accompanied by a purge of party clubs and affiliates suspected of having been infiltrated by [[Communist Party of Canada|Communists]] and the removal of suspected Communists from senior party positions. The reorganization was prompted by complaints of Communist infiltration, due to the party's previously loose structure. In reaction to alleged Communist involvement, the United Farmers of Ontario disaffiliated from the CCF. Mitchell unofficially led the Ontario CCF during the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934]] and conducted a province-wide tour ding the [[Ontario general election, 1937|1937 election campaign]] but failed to win a seat in the Legislature. He continued as party president until 1941.&lt;ref name=mitch&gt;{{cite news|title=CCF Ousts Communists Welcomes Agnes MacPhail - Woodsworth Charge Government Spies Within Ranks At Housecleaning - Mitchell New Head|work=Toronto Daily Star|date=16 April 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Total of 266 Candidates Nominated for Oct. 6 Ontario Election: 86 Liberals in Fight And 89 Conservatives; Others of Varied Hue Nominees in Four Ridings Not Being Contested by Party in Power Regarded as Friendly TWO WOMEN RUNNING|work=The Globe and Mail|date=30 September 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader of CCF in Ontario raps Hepburn and Rowe|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19370917&amp;id=pfMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5dsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5926,5291071&amp;hl=en|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=17 September 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=C.C.F.

[[Graham Spry]], a publisher and broadcaster who was also a member of the LSR, served as the Ontario CCF's vice-president of its provincial council from 1934 to 1936.&lt;ref name="Horn p64"&gt;Horn, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first federal CCF candidate in Ontario, running  in the September 24, 1934 by-election in [[Toronto East]].&lt;ref name="Horn p64"&gt;Horn, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members were [[Elmore Philpott]], a former [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]].

&lt;/ref&gt; Two candidates came forward: Toronto lawyer and Ontario CCF vice-president [[Ted Jolliffe]], and union activist and former Ontario CCF Youth Movement organizer [[Murray Cotterill]].&lt;ref name=Phoenix19420404/&gt; On April 4, 1942, Jolliffe won the election, but the voting results were not  announced.&lt;ref name=Phoenix19420404/&gt; The newly created Leader position's role was political and legislative, while internal CCF affairs and administration would remain the president's domain.&lt;ref name=Phoenix19420404/&gt;

The party achieved a major breakthrough under Jolliffe, in the [[Ontario general election, 1943|1943 general election]], when it formed the [[Leader of the Opposition (Ontario)|Official Opposition]] with 32 percent of the vote and 34 seats. The CCF was just four seats short of [[George A. Drew|George Drew]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives]] ("Tories"), who formed a [[minority government]] that was the beginning of what became a 42-year political dynasty.

==1945 "Gestapo" campaign==
In the [[Ontario general election, 1945|1945 election]], Premier Drew ran an [[anti-Semitic]], union bashing, [[Red-baiting]] campaign.{{sfnp|MacDonald|1998| pp = 291–297}} The previous two years of anti-socialist attacks by the Conservatives and their supporters, like Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, were devastatingly effective against the previously popular CCF.{{sfnp|Caplan|1973| p=157}} Much of the source material for the anti-CCF campaign  came from the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] (OPP)'s Special Investigation Branch's agent D-208: Captain William J. Osbourne-Dempster.&lt;ref name=WindsorStar19450707&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; His office was supposed to be investigating war-time [[5th column]] saboteurs. Instead, starting in November 1943, he was investigating, almost exclusively, Ontario opposition MPPs, mainly focusing on the CCF [[caucus]].{{sfnp|Caplan | 1973 | pp = 182-184,187}}  The fact that Jolliffe knew about these 'secret' investigations as early as February 1944 led to one of the most infamous incidents in 20th-century Canadian politics.{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | p=168}}

===May 24, 1945 radio speech===
The 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech – written with the assistance of [[Lister Sinclair]] –{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | p=179}} that accused Drew of running a political [[Gestapo]] in Ontario.{{sfnp|MacDonald|1998| pp = 291–297}} In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.{{sfnp|MacDonald|1998| p = 292}}

{{cquote|It is my duty to tell you that Colonel Drew is maintaining in Ontario, at this very minute, a secret political police, a paid government spy organization, a Gestapo to try and keep himself in power.  And Col[onel] Drew maintains his secret political police at the expense of the taxpayers of Ontario – paid out of the Public Funds....{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | p=168}}}}

Jolliffe's inflammatory speech became the main issue of the campaign, and dominated coverage in the media for the rest of the election.{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | p = 170}} Drew, and his [[Attorney-General of Ontario|Attorney-General]] [[Leslie Blackwell]] vehemently denied Jolliffe's accusations, but the public outcry was too much for them to abate. On May 26, 1945, during his own radio speech, Drew announced that he would be appointing a Royal Commission to investigate these charges.&lt;ref name=Globe19450528p8&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Jolliffe's CCF and [[Mitchell Hepburn]]'s Ontario Liberal Party wanted the election suspended until the commission tabled its report. Hepburn sent Drew a personal telegram stating he would stop campaigning if the commission were held immediately.&lt;ref name="Hepburn telegram"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Drew ignored these requests and continued to hold the election on its original date, despite it being many months before the commission's findings would be made available.{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | pp = 170-171}}

===Election Day, June 4, 1945===
Jolliffe's CCF went from 34 seats to 8, but almost garnered the same number of votes cast, though their percentage of the popular vote dropped from 32 to 22 percent.{{sfnp| Caplan | 1973 | p = 191}} A Gallup poll done a month earlier showed the CCF at essentially the same percentage, making it questionable whether or not the "Gestapo" speech had an effect on the campaign.{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | p = 171}} Drew, with his attack campaign, successfully drove the voter turn-out up, thereby driving the CCF's percentage and seat totals down.

1945 was one of Ontario's  most important elections in the 20th century according to Caplan and [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]].{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | p = 191}} It shaped the province for the next 40 years, as the Conservatives won a massive majority in the Legislature, and would remain in government for the next 40 consecutive years–most of that time with majority governments until the mid-1970s.

For Jolliffe, another election consequence was his tenure as the MPP from York South ended, at least for the time-being.  He lost the election but did better than any other CCF candidate in Toronto or in the outlying Yorks.{{sfnp| Caplan | 1973 | p = 191}}

===LeBel Royal Commission===
On May 28, Drew appointed Justice A.M. LeBel as the [[Royal Commissioner]], thereby forming what has become known as the [[LeBel Royal Commission]]. His terms of reference were restricted to the question of whether Drew was personally responsible for the establishment of "a secret political police organization, for the purpose of collecting, by secret spying, material to be used in attempt to keep him in power."{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | pp = 171-172}} Wider questions like why the OPP, Ontario civil servants, were keeping files on MPPs were not allowed.

Jolliffe acted as his own counsel throughout the commission, but was assisted by fellow CCF lawyer, [[Andrew Brewin]].&lt;ref name=Globe19450621&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  He and Brewin were able to establish, from several eyewitnesses, that agent D-208, Dempster, was spying on the CCF.  What they could not prove, because they did not have access to the information in 1945,{{sfnp | Lewis | 1981 | p = 276}} were the letters that Drew wrote to his supporter M.A. (Bugsy) Sanderson suggesting that he would finance any lawsuits or other charges stemming from the information provided by Dempster in his advertisements.{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 |  p = 173}} Sanderson was, in late 1943 to 1945, along with Gladstone Murray, leading the libellous advertisement campaigns against the CCF in newspapers and billboards, with information gleaned from Dempster's briefings.{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | pp = 172-188}} Jolliffe presented several witnesses that claimed to have seen these documents. But Jolliffe could not produce the letter, and Drew denied ever writing it.{{sfnp | Caplan | 1973 | pp = 172-188}}

On October 11, 1945, Justice LeBel issued his report that essentially exonerated Drew and Blackwell.&lt;ref name = Citizen19451012&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Because Jolliffe presented only circumstantial evidence that linked Drew to Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though LeBel believed Dempster's interaction with Sanderson and Murray was inappropriate.{{sfn | Caplan | 1973 |pp = 181-188}}

Jolliffe's motives regarding his accusations, and his choice of words, were questioned for many years afterwards. In the late 1970s, when [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]] was doing research for his ''Memoirs'', he came across archival evidence proving the charge.&lt;ref name=Gazette19811203&gt;

As Lewis pointed out in his memoirs, "We found that Premier Drew and Gladstone Murray did not disclose all information to the Lebel Commission; indeed, they deliberately prevaricated throughout. The head of the [[Politics of Ontario|Government of Ontario]] had given false witness under testimony.... The perpetrator of Ontario's [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] got away with it."{{sfnp | Lewis | 1981 | pp = 276, 287}}

==1945 election aftermath==
After the LeBel Report was published, the Ontario CCF still had to go on with the business of running the party, and hold its annual convention.&lt;ref name="Young117118"&gt;Young (1969), pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; It had been over 18 months since the previous provincial convention was held.&lt;ref name=Torstar19451120&gt;{{cite news|title=Jolliffe is standing for C.C.F. leadership|newspaper=The Toronto Daily Star|date=1945-11-20|author=Star Staff|location=Toronto|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention was held from Thursday, November 22, to Saturday, November 24 at the Toronto Labor Lyceum on Spadina Avenue.&lt;ref name=Torstar19451120/&gt; Jolliffe made it publicly known before the convention that he intended to continue as leader.&lt;ref name=Torstar19451120/&gt; He ran despite the elements within the party that blamed him for the election defeat.&lt;ref name="Young117118"/&gt; His critics charged that the CCF did not stress policy enough during the election; that the party's platform was too vague, too leader-based, and was too reliant on slogans.&lt;ref name="Young117118"/&gt; Jolliffe was attacked for how he handled the last weeks of the campaign, especially over the "Gestapo" speech.&lt;ref name="Young117118"/&gt; These critics also blamed labour's involvement in dumbing-down the campaign, which was seen as the trade unions doing anything to achieve power.&lt;ref name="Young117118"/&gt; It got so bad, that a motion to expel Jolliffe, and David Lewis over these perceived grievances made it on to the convention floor.&lt;ref name="Young117118"/&gt; The motion read, "the campaign tactics of the 1945 election had been decided by Mr. Jolliffe with the advice of Mr. Lewis and the democratic processes within the CCF had been ignored."&lt;ref name="Young117118"/&gt; It was defeated, but it also demonstrated that the party's establishment had angered its socialist militant base.&lt;ref name="Young117118"/&gt;

On Saturday afternoon, after the grievances were aired, the convention unanimously passed a resolution condemning Premier Drew asking him to stop spying on labour and political officials.&lt;ref name=Torstar19451126&gt;{{cite news|title=End political spying provincial C.C.F. asks|newspaper=The Toronto Daily Star|date=1945-11-26|author=Star Staff|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the party's establishment candidates held on to their positions: University of Toronto professor, [[George Grube]] remained as president, while Jolliffe remained leader.&lt;ref name=Torstar19451126b&gt;{{cite news|title=Drew flouting 48-hour order is C.C.F. charge|newspaper=The Toronto Daily Star|date=1945-11-26|author=Star Staff|location=Toronto|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, there was major labour strife in Ontario, and the CCF made it clear they were on the side of the unionists.&lt;ref name=WinStar461210&gt;{{cite news|title=Jolliffe sees Ottawa vote in 18 months: C.C.F. meeting hears provincial election is possible in 1948|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qiY_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XE8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6634%2C2218128|accessdate=2011-08-21|newspaper=The Windsor Daily Star|date=1946-12-10|author=The Canadian Press|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's annual convention was held outside of Toronto for the first time.&lt;ref name=WinStar451122&gt;{{cite news|title=C.C.F.

Noseworthy]] by four votes.&lt;ref name=Winstar461212/&gt; The main resolution that would affect the upcoming provincial election was one that condemned Drew's government for its hastily approved legislation allowing for cocktail bars to operate in Ontario.&lt;ref name=Winstar461212/&gt;

==1948 Ontario general election==
Though the [[Ontario general election, 1948|1948 election]] came about a year sooner than normal, the Ontario CCF had been expecting this because of the polling information available that indicated that Drew's popularity was falling.&lt;ref name=Winstar461210&gt;{{cite news|title=Jolliffe sees Ottawa vote in 18 months: C.C.F. meeting hears provincial election is possible in 1948|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qiY_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XE8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6634%2C2218128|accessdate=2011-08-22|newspaper=The Windsor Daily Star|date=1946-12-10|author=The Canadian Press|location=Windsor, Ontario|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCF were able to rebound from their previous dismal election performance in 1945, and this time managed to get 21 members elected, including Jolliffe in York South, to again form the Official Opposition.

The real surprise was that Premier Drew lost his seat, even though his Progressive Conservatives won a majority.  In his High Park constituency, Drew was up against his local nemesis [[William Horace Temple|William (Bill) Temple]]. Temple was a [[Temperance movement|temperance]] campaigner and made Drew's cocktail bar legislation the main campaign issue.&lt;ref name="Melnyk 177-8"&gt;Melnyk, pp. 177-178&lt;/ref&gt; Temple castigated Drew for softening Ontario's liquor laws, claiming the Premier was the captive of "liquor interests" because of the government's decision to allow liquor sales in cocktail bars.&lt;ref name="Melnyk 177-8"/&gt;  While Drew's party swept to victory across the province, Drew was defeated by Temple, and decided to resign as premier and move to federal politics.&lt;ref name="Melnyk 177-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew defeated in High Park"&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier losses in High Park, CCF Wins 11 Area Seats|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=1948-06-08|author=Canadian Press|location=Toronto|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1951 election disaster and its aftermath==
The CCF's return to popularity was short-lived because of the prosperity of the 1950s and the [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] hysteria of the [[Cold War]]. This rapid decline in their popularity reduced the party to two seats in the [[Ontario general election, 1951|1951 election]] and allowed the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] to become the Official Opposition. No social democratic party would be the Official Opposition again until [[Ontario general election, 1975|1975]], when Stephen Lewis's NDP displaced the Liberals as the second party in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]].

Beginning with the 1951 provincial campaign, the [[Ontario Federation of Labour]] (OFL) played an increased role in the Ontario CCF by lending it organizational, personnel and material support.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"&gt;Azoulay (1999), pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing role of the trade union leadership in the party was unpopular with some activists like MPP Bill Temple.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt; The "Ginger Group" led by Temple, [[True Davidson]] and others was formed in the wake of the disastrous 1951 electoral result which they blamed on the "bureaucratization" of the party and its movement away from socialist principles and particularly socialist education, developments for which they held what they saw as the conservative, anti-democratic and bureaucratic influence of the OFL as responsible.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt; At the party's 1952 convention, Temple ran for party leader but withdrew at the last moment, allowing Jolliffe to be acclaimed leader.&lt;ref&gt;Azoulay (1999), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torstar Convention"&gt;{{cite news|title=CCF Split Buried as Temple Loses Vote|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1952-04-12|author=Star staff|location=Toronto|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple did not stop from making trouble for the establishment, when he ran for party president, and almost won.&lt;ref name="Torstar Convention"/&gt; He and Davidson were elected to the party executive as vice-presidents and the Ginger Group elected a number of its followers to the provincial council.&lt;ref name="Torstar Convention"/&gt; They were unsuccessful in achieving their goals, however.  The increasing role of the OFL in the Ontario CCF proved to be a precursor to the eventual fusion of the national CCF and the trade union movement with the creation of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada]] at the federal and provincial levels in 1961.

==End of the CCF/New Party and revival==

There was no party leader prior to 1942. From 1932 to 1934 [[Agnes Macphail]], as chair of the Ontario CCF provincial council, was the main co-spokesperson. Her other co-spokesperson was [[Elmore Philpott]] – from 1933 to 1934 – as president of the Ontario Association of CCF Clubs. They were the most prominent figures in the Ontario party and acted as spokespersons until their March 1934 resignations.&lt;ref name = "Macphail quits"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1934 to 1942 the new position of Ontario CCF president was the party's effective leader.

Ontario CCF president John Mitchell, a Hamilton alderman, led the  party's campaigns in the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934]] and [[Ontario general election, 1937|1937 Ontario elections]].&lt;ref name = "CCF Leader raps Hepburn"&gt;

From 1934 to 1937 [[Samuel Lawrence]], MPP for [[Hamilton East (provincial electoral district)|Hamilton East]] led the party in the legislature as its sole MPP. Lawrence succeeded Mitchell as party president in 1941 and recommended that the party select a leader at its 1942 convention.&lt;ref name=law/&gt;

[[Bill Grummett|W. J. Grummett]] (Cochrane South) was House Leader of the CCF, leading the party in the Ontario Legislature from 1951, when Jolliffe lost his seat, until 1955, when MacDonald entered the legislature.{{sfnp|MacDonald|1998|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=pj1Ddn4HJM8C&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}

MacDonald became the first leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party when it was formed in 1961.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21117">The '''Convention of Royal Burghs''', more fully termed the '''Convention of the Royal Burghs of Scotland''', was a representative assembly which protected the privileges and pursued the interests of Scotland’s principal trading towns, the [[royal burghs]], from the middle of the 16th century to the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson and Morpeth 1992 p.31&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved as a forum in which [[burgh]] delegates, termed "commissioners", could "consult together and take common action in matters concerning their common welfare"&lt;ref&gt;W.O. 1899 p.1&lt;/ref&gt; before and during the sittings of [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007 p.59&lt;/ref&gt; An exclusively merchant body, it was essentially a parliament which "declared the law of the burghs" just as the Scottish Parliament "declared the law of the land".&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1961, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention expanded over time by admitting [[Burgh of barony|lesser burghs]] to its membership;&lt;ref name="Mackie1978p107"&gt;Mackie et al. 1978, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 16th century had grown in influence to the extent that "it was listened to rather than directed by the government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J |last=Wormald |title=Court, Kirk and Community |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |date=1981 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though still known as the "convention of royal burghs", it referred to itself from the late 17th century onwards as simply the "convention of burghs", as by then membership was no longer restricted exclusively to royal burghs and commissioners from all types of burgh were represented in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007 p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The mediaeval roots of the Convention lay in the 13th-century '''Court of the Four Burghs''' which comprised delegates from [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Roxburgh]] and [[Stirling]]. (In 1369 [[Lanark]] and [[Linlithgow]] replaced Berwick and Roxburgh after these came under English occupation.)&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson and Morpeth 1992 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson 1980 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Representatives of these burghs met in advance of parliamentary sittings and communicated with the [[Monarch|sovereign]] through the Court or through the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] who presided over its meetings in his function as the Crown’s chief fiscal officer. The Court, described in a charter from the reign of [[James II of Scotland|James II (1430-60)]] as the '''Parliament of the Four Burghs''',&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson and Morpeth 1992 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; determined burghal law (''leges burgorum''), settled inter-burghal disputes and heard appeals from burgh courts.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1961 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record of its deliberations dates from 1292 when "the four burghs" were asked to interpret the law on a question of debt.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1961, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The Court applied a single set of rules and its decisions were binding on all royal burghs.{{#tag:ref|Mackay gives the 16 original royal burghs in the reign of David I as Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Forfar, Haddington, Inverkeithing, Jedburgh, Lanark, Linlithgow, Montrose, Peebles, Perth, Rutherglen, St. Andrews, Selkirk, Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1884, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}}&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007 p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of burgh representation in relation to the history of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] was a long and gradual process, the record of which has been to a large extent obscured by the loss of Scotland's national records at various times in the country's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/history.asp |title=History of the National Archives of Scotland|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=The National Archives of Scotland |publisher= |accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fragmentary nature of the surviving evidence makes it difficult to give a precise chronology of the development.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007 p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

As the main source of [[Coins|specie]] in the kingdom&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; the burghs were specially summoned by royal letters to convene at the sittings of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Rait 1924 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The traditionally accepted date for the first occasion of their being present is 1326, when they were summoned to appear at the parliament of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]] held at [[Cambuskenneth Abbey|Cambuskenneth]].&lt;ref&gt;Rait 1924, p.239&lt;/ref&gt; The reason appears to have been the King's need to restore damage done to the royal [[demesne]]s during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]],&lt;ref name="Mackie1962p85"&gt;R L Mackie, A Short History Of Scotland, Oliver &amp; Boyd 1962, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; It is not, however, clear whether the burgesses sat alongside the bishops and barons as a separate estate within the parliament itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rait 1924, p.240&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scotland Groat ca 1329-1370.jpg|thumb|160px|A groat from the reign of David II in the 14th century. Burghs were expected to pay their taxes in coin.]]
When taxation had to be raised to pay the ransom for the release of [[David II of Scotland|David II]] from English captivity,&lt;ref&gt;Rait 1924, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; the burghs were consulted again at Scone in 1357 and empowered to negotiate the release. Thus, 1357 has been seen as the date for burgh commissioners establishing themselves as a political class within the parliament, indicated by the first use of the term "three estates (''tres communitates'') of the realm" to describe the parliament's composition.
&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson 1989, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

The burghs were consulted again at the parliament held in [[Stirling]] in 1405 when 50,000 merks had to be raised for "the King's fynance", to meet [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]'s demand for "expenses incurred" by [[James I of Scotland|James I]] during his long imprisonment in England.
&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1884, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rait 1924 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this session it was decided that two or three commissioners from every burgh south of the [[River Spey|Spey]] should attend to "treat, ordain and determine upon all things concerning the utility of the common weal of all the King’s burghs".&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1961, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have therefore judged 1405 as the true date for the start of the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson 1989, p.264&lt;/ref&gt; which met at every session of parliament from that time onwards.&lt;ref name="Mackie1962p85"/&gt;

The "Court of Four" continued to function until 1529, "the provost of the burgh where the meeting was held acting as president", though the Chamberlain still attended
&lt;ref name="Mackay1884p6"&gt;Mackay 1884, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; (his involvement ended formally in 1532).&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007 p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reign of James III ==
[[File:James III of Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|upright|160px|King James III]]The growing importance of the Convention can be traced through the reign of [[James III of Scotland|James III (r.1460-88)]] when the burghs contributed one fifth of the total sum of national taxation granted by Parliament.&lt;ref name="Mackie1978p107"/&gt; From 1455 onwards, Parliament was attended on average by 16 burghs, rising to 22 in 1469, 23 in 1471 and 33 by the end of the reign in 1488.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie and Pryde 1923, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Geographical representation also widened and meetings became more frequent. An Act of Parliament in 1487 ordained that commissioners of all burghs should meet annually to deal with matters of common concern.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson 1980, p.101&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...that Commissioners of all Burrowes baith south and north [of the [[River Spey|Spey]]], sall convene and gadder together aince ilk yeare [annually] in the Burche of Inverkeithin [burgh of [[Inverkeithing]]], on the morning eftir Sanct James daie, with full commissioune, and thair to commune and treate upoune the weilfare of merchandise, the gude rule and statutis for the common profite of the Burrowis, and to provide for remeid upoune the skaith [damage] and injuries sustened, within the Burrowis, and quhat Burche that compeiris nocht [does not comply], the saides daie, be thair Commissaris, to paye to the costis of the Commissaris present, five pundis...
&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1884, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== 16th Century ==

By the time more or less continuous{{#tag:ref|A gap exists for 1631–49 when the records were lost or destroyed "during the troubilsum tymes" of the [[Wars of the Covenant]].|group="n"}} records begin in the middle of the 16th century (1552),&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1884, p.6, &lt;/ref&gt; the Convention met regularly as a separate assembly to decide on a common policy for adoption by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson and Morpeth 1992 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1961 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of its Records, Sir James Marwick, relates that the Convention was summoned by royal letters in 1529, 1530–31, 1539 and 1556.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie and Pryde 1923, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Records from the regency of [[Mary of Guise]] suggest that the burghs themselves fixed the date and place of their conventions, a practice later confirmed by statute in 1581.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007 p.8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563 they gained the right to be consulted on "peace and war" and, from 1567, on "weighty affairs" of the realm.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1961 {{page number needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1578 [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] authorised them to meet "foure tymes in the yeare for sic materis as concerns thair Estait, and in quhatever Burche it sal be thocht expedient.&lt;ref name="Mackay1884p6"/&gt; Annual records of the Convention begin in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson and Morpeth 1992 p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

Marwick summarised the Convention’s functions thus,
[[File:Blaeu 1652 - Veere.jpg|thumb|[[Willem Blaeu|Blaeu]] map of [[Veere]], Scotland's staple port in Flanders from 1541 to 1799]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Scarcely anything affecting Burghs of Scotland, in their internal administration, or in their commercial relations at home and abroad, escaped the cognizance of the Convention. It defined the rights, privileges and duties of Burghs; it regulated the merchandise, manufactures and shipping of the country, it exercised control over the Scottish merchants in France, Flanders and other countries in Europe, with which from time to time commercial relations existed; it sent commissioners to foreign powers, and to great commercial communities, entered into treaties with them, and established the staple trade of Scotland wherever this could be most advantageously done: it claimed the right, independently of the Crown, to nominate the Conservator [official charged with safeguarding the privileges of the Scottish [[The Staple|staple]] in Flanders]. And it certainly did regulate his emoluments, and control his conduct; it sometimes defrayed, and sometimes contributed towards, the expenses of ambassadors from the Scottish Court to that of France and other foreign powers in matters affecting the Burghs and the common weal; it allocated among the whole Burghs of the Kingdom their proportion of all extents and taxes granted by the three Estates of the realm; it adjudicated on the claims of Burghs to be admitted to the privileges of free Burghs, and to be added to its roll; it took cognizance of weights and measures."
&lt;ref&gt;Rait 1924, pp.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(The agreed weights and measures were based on the "stane wecht" [stone weight] of [[Lanark]], the "pint stoupe" [liquid measure] of [[Stirling]], the "firlatt" [quarter-boll—a dry measure of meal] of [[Linlithgow]] and the "elland" [length, e.g. of cloth] of [[Edinburgh]])&lt;ref&gt;Mackie and Pryde 1923, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

== 17th Century ==
[[File:Downsitting of the Scottish Parliament.JPG|thumb|18thC French illustration of an opening of the Scottish Parliament. The procession is headed by ''"Les Commissaires des Comtes, et des Bourgs, et des Villes"''.]]
On 21 August 1604, the Convention agreed articles for the guidance of the Scottish Commissioners appointed to negotiate arrangements under the [[Union of the Crowns]]. The first called for the upholding of [[Scots Law]], "that the inhabitants of Scotland be ruled and governed by the laws of this realme, and no way subject to any other law"; the second urged "that in the Treaty of Union nothing be touched which may prejudice the ancient liberties, privileges, immunities, infeftments [possession of heritable property], and laws, made in favour of the burghs by his Majesty and his Highnesses most noble progenitors."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1884, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance of the Convention in the 17th century can be judged from a statement made by the [[Lord Advocate]], [[George Mackenzie (lawyer)|George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh]], that "The burrows of Scotland have liberty to meet in time of Parliament, and to propose as a Body and Third Estate, Overtures for Trade; but no other estate of Parliament can lawfully meet [i.e. outside Parliament], this being a singularity indulged to them for the Good of Commerce."&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, Lord Advocate, Observations on the Scots Acts of Parliament, Printed by the heir of Andrew Anderson, Edinburgh 1686.&lt;/ref&gt; Burghs of [[Burgh of regality|regality]] or of [[Burgh of barony|barony]], hitherto excluded from participating in foreign trade, were accorded the privilege in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie et al. 1978, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; but to maintain the pre-eminent position of the royal burghs an Act of Parliament (1690) stipulated the sum to be paid by the lesser burghs to reduce the burden of taxation imposed on the royal burghs.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1884, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; By 1689, 70 burghs were members of the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;Mackie and Pryde 1923, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; though, according to one study, the royal burghs remained the dominant influence throughout the period: "...meetings did not always involve the whole estate suggesting that a smaller group of wealthier burghs were the driving force behind the convention in general and burghs' parliamentary agenda in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald 2007 p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later importance ==

It has been argued that the effect of the Convention was to make the burgesses historically the most organised of the three estates represented in the Scots parliament. It also "ensured that urban government was much more uniform in Scotland than in England, producing, as the commissioners' inquiry into the Municipal Corporations of Scotland discovered in 1833–1835, considerable corruption amongst self-electing, clone-like burgh establishments". The main concern of the Convention in the early part of the 19th century became "the blocking of reform. The Municipal Reform Act of 1834 sharply reduced its influence and its abolition was considered for a time. The admission to it of parliamentary burghs in 1879 and police burghs in 1895 gave it an added lease of life though probably little extra influence."
&lt;ref name="Garrard"&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Lynch |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year=2001 |date=2007  |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199234820.001.0001 |section-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199234820.001.0001/acref-9780199234820-e-256 |isbn=9780191727481 |article=Royal Burghs, Convention of |page=534: Burgomasters Since 1800 |first=John |last=Garrard |series=Oxford Reference |subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention was viewed by [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] politicians in the late 19th century as "thoroughly representative of public opinion in Scotland" and "as giving those who have to deal with the affairs of Scotland an opportunity of feeling the pulse of Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;W.O. 1899 pp.4-5 quoting W E Gladstone, the Marquess of Lothian and the earl of Rosebery&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, it consisted of 103 burghs and 207 representatives&lt;ref&gt;W.O. 1899 p.6&lt;/ref&gt; in an organisation described by a Scottish government minister as "the oldest existing representative body in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;W.O. 1899 p.9, quoting Under-Secretary of Scotland R W Cochran-Patrick, Esq MP&lt;/ref&gt;
The same study observes that, "the Convention can probably lay claim to being one of the wordiest of Scottish institutions, if measured by the voluminous nature of its records. But its importance was relatively slight".&lt;ref name="Garrard"/&gt;

The Convention was abolished when local government was regionally reorganised in 1975 in line with the recommendations of the [[Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland|Wheatley Report]] of 1969. It was superseded by the present-day Convention of Scottish Local Authorities ([[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities|COSLA]]).

'''Corruption in Poland''' has declined over time in the recent years. In international rankings it is below the world average but not insignificant. Within Poland, surveys of Polish citizens reveal that it is perceived to be a major problem.

==Extent==
Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 36th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the eighth successive year in which Poland's score and ranking have improved in the Index.

[[Global Integrity]] 2010 report gave Poland the score of 80 out of a 100 assessing the legal framework as 86 (strong) and actual implementation as 71 (moderate).&lt;ref name=gi/&gt; The report scored Poland particularly well (score of 90) in categories for "Non-Governmental Organizations, Public Information and Media" and "Elections", and particularly low in the category for "Public Administration and Professionalism" (score of 59).&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt;

[[File:Siedziba NIK - front.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Supreme Audit Office (Poland)|Supreme Audit Office]] (NIK) offices.]]
A 2011 report by the [[Institute of Public Affairs, Poland|Institute of Public Affairs]]  also criticized the standards of public life in Poland, and the prevalence of [[nepotism]] and [[cronyism]].&lt;ref name="t-isp"/&gt;

A 2012 report jointly prepared by from the Institute of Public Affairs and [[Transparency International]] notes that the corruption in Poland is lower than in the past, when in the mid-1990s it was "a phenomenon of a systemic nature".&lt;ref name="t-nis2012"/&gt; As described in that report, the World Bank [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] (accessible here [http://databank.worldbank.org/data/databases.aspx?tags=rule-of-law]) for "rule of law" and "control of corruption" show steady improvement for Poland.&lt;ref name=t-nis2012/&gt; Poland has joined the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] in 2000, implementing relevant legislation in 2001.&lt;ref name="Poland:- Poland - OECD Anti-Bribery Convention - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development"/&gt; Poland has also made significant progress in combating corruption like the establishment of the [[Central Anti-Corruption Bureau]] and the first anti-corruption strategy which was adopted in 2002.&lt;ref name=t-nis2012/&gt;

The 2012 report from the ISP and TI report, reviewing individual Polish anti-corruption institution, praised the [[Supreme Audit Office (Poland)|Supreme Audit Office]] (NIK), followed by the [[Polish Ombudsman]] (RPO).&lt;ref name=t-nis2012/&gt; It criticized the civil society,the private sector, and the executive and public administration of insufficient efforts in fighting corruption.&lt;ref name=t-nis2012/&gt; Poland's watchdog organisations are considered weak in combating corruption, and corruption allegations often appear in government contracting and permit issuance.&lt;ref name=t-isp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snapshot of the Poland Country Profile"/&gt;

The 2012 report from the ISP and TI praised the overall direction of the anti-corruption efforts in Poland, noting that they are "bringing noticeable results", but noted that those efforts, particularly from the public authorities, are "rather chaotic, sometimes contradictory or even controversial". It concluded that "corruption in Poland still entails considerable risks" and "the level of anti-corruption protection is unsatisfactory".&lt;ref name=t-nis2012/&gt; A 2013 OECD report analyzing the implementation of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention concluded that "the current Polish framework for fighting foreign bribery is still inadequate".&lt;ref name="Bribery in international business - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development"/&gt;

A 2013 survey in Poland found that 83% of surveyed Polish citizens think that corruption is a major problem for their country, particularly prevalent among politicians (62 percent) and in the health-care sector (53 percent). A growing number of citizens (57%) is concerned that there is no political will to fight corruption.&lt;ref name="Poles see significant corruption in Poland - Warsaw Business Journal - Online Portal"/&gt;

==Historical==
In the early 1920s, during the first years of the [[Second Polish Republic]], Polish institutions were plagued by endemic corruption,&lt;ref name="The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War"/&gt; and several of the governments of the day were accused of corruption, very likely with sound cause.&lt;ref name="The History of Poland"/&gt; Between 1923 and 1926, [[Józef Piłsudski]] came to conclude that the system which he dubbed "[[Sejm]]ocracy" fostered general corruption, ultimately leading him to launch the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] and seize power.&lt;ref name="The Origins of Modern Polish Democracy"/&gt; His byword [[Sanation]] referred to the cleansing he promised to introduce, in contrast to his predecessors' shady practices.&lt;ref name="Genocide and Fascism: The Eliminationist Drive in Fascist Europe"/&gt;

However, once in power, his allies uncovered very few cases of corruption in past governments; persistent references to mass corruption amounted to a type of "primitive propaganda", in the words of historian [[Andrzej Garlicki]]. Later, it was Piłsudskiites who became embroiled in a well-publicized scandal revolving around election budgets, the [[Czechowicz Affair]].&lt;ref name="The Clash of Moral Nations: Cultural Politics in Piłsudski's Poland, 1926-1935"/&gt; By the 1930s, the country had developed an economic model involving [[state capitalism]], with key industries in government hands. While this fostered growth in vital areas, it also gave rise to inefficiency and corruption. Private businesses found it hard to compete directly with state-owned concerns, in particular for public contracts.&lt;ref name="A Traveller's History of Poland"/&gt;

In the communist [[People's Republic of Poland]], corruption was widespread, particularly by [[Polish United Workers Party]] officials (''see [[nomenklatura]]'').&lt;ref name="Bloom2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChodakiewiczRadzilowski2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Old and New Patterns of Corruption in Poland and the USSR"/&gt; Corruption under the communist regime was so pervasive that some scholars have referred to the system as "legalized corruption".&lt;ref name="Lü2000"/&gt;

The [[Philippines]] suffers from widespread  [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jurado |first=Emil |url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideOpinion.htm?f=2010/march/12/emiljurado.isx&amp;d=2010/march/12 |title=The fourth most corrupt nation |publisher=''Manila Standard Today'' |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Means of corruption include [[Graft (politics)|graft]], [[bribery]], [[embezzlement]], [[backdoor deals]], [[nepotism]], and [[patronage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conde |first=Carlos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-peso.4891792.html |title=Philippines most corrupt, survey says |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=March 13, 2007 |accessdate=August 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
[[Transparency International]]'s 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 111th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is better than the Philippines' 129th out of 178,ranking in 2011 with a 2.6 CPI, in Transparency International's list. The CPI score indicates the perceived level of public sector corruption on a scale of 0 - 100, where 0 means that a country is perceived as highly corrupt and 100 means that a country is perceived as very clean.

Transparency International-Philippines said some of the factors that contributed to the Philippines' (2.6) slight jump are the improvement in government service, and cutting red tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/27/12/ph-corruption-going-going-not-yet-gone|title=PH corruption going, going, but not yet gone|first=By Willard Cheng, ABS-CBN|last=News|date=|website=abs-cbnnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines' corruption further declined in 2014 upgrading its ranking on Transparency.org CPI from 94th to 85th in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

==Political nepotism==
{{Further|Political dynasties in the Philippines|List of political families in the Philippines}}

[[Politics of the Philippines|The Philippine political arena]] is mainly arranged and operated by [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|families or alliances of families]], rather than organised around the voting for political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Coronel, Chua, Rimban, &amp; Cruz ''The Rulemakers'' [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] (2007); p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Called the [[Padrino System]], one gains favor, [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]], or political appointment through family affiliation ([[nepotism]]) or friendship ([[cronyism]]), as opposed to one's [[Meritocracy|merit]].  The ''Padrino System'' in the Philippines has been the source of many controversies and corruption.

It has been an [[open secret]] that one cannot join the political arena of the Philippines without mastery of the Padrino System.  From the lowest [[Barangay]] official, to the [[President of the Philippines|President of the Republic]], it is expected that one gains political debts and dispenses political favor to advance one's career or influence, if not wealth.

[[File:Glasam protiv lat.svg|thumb|Campaign poster calling to vote 'Against'. Translation: I vote against!]]
A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Croatia]] on 1 December 2013. The proposed amendment to the [[Constitution of Croatia|constitution]] would define marriage as being a union between a man and a woman, which would create a constitutional prohibition against [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24873498 Croatia to hold referendum on same-sex marriage ban] BBC News, 8 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 37.9% of eligible voters voted. After processing all of the ballots, the State Election Commission announced that 65.87% voted ''yes'', 33.51% ''no'' and 0.57% of ballots were disregarded as invalid.&lt;ref name=Res01/&gt;

The referendum was called after a conservative organization ''U ime obitelji'' (“On Behalf of the Family”) gathered more than 700,000 signatures in May 2013 demanding a referendum on the subject.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The initiative was supported by conservative political parties, the [[Roman Catholicism in Croatia|Catholic Church]] as well as by several other faith groups. The ruling left-wing coalition opposed the amendment along with numerous human rights organizations{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and the majority of the Croatian media.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Political background==
A petition in favor of the change was organized by a Catholic citizens' group 'On Behalf of the Family' (''U ime obitelji'') and collected over 700,000 signatures by May 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  The initiative was a reaction to the [[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović|government's]] proposal to legalize same-sex partnership.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;Lajla Veselica (1 December 2013) [https://news.yahoo.com/croatia-holds-anti-gay-marriage-referendum-041219323.html Croatia rejects gay marriage in referendum] Yahoo. Retrieved 2 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was approved following a vote in the [[Sabor]] on 8 November in which 104 of the 151 MPs voted in favor of holding a referendum.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

The group Citizens Voting Against was formed from 88 civil society organizations (led [[GONG (organization)|GONG]], Center for Peace Studies and [[Zagreb Pride]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://glasajprotiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/20131213-GGP_-DIP-Obrazac_za_objavu_podataka_o_izvoru_sredstava_i_visini_troskova.pdf|title=Obrazac za objavu podataka o izvoru sredstava i visini troškova referendumske promidžbe}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by numerous public persons, film actors and actresses, academics, activists and politicians, including media such as [[Novi list]] and [[Jutarnji list]] and musicians, such as [[Severina Vučković|Severina]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], [[Let 3]], [[Hladno pivo]], [[The Beat Fleet|TBF]] and others.

The Vote Against campaign claimed that the public faces of the initiative Željka Markić, Krešimir Planinić, Krešimir Miletić, Ladislav Ilčić, as well as members of their families, were simultaneously leaders of the referendum effort and candidates of the right wing political party [[HRAST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.24sata.hr/news/iza-u-ime-obitelji-skriva-se-stranka-jos-opasnijih-namjera-342459|title=Iza 'U ime obitelji' skriva se stranka još opasnijih namjera|trans-title=''In the Name of the Family'' is a public face of even more dangerous political party }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vote Against and the broader coalition of civil society organizations, Platform 112, claimed that the bank account listed on 'On behalf of the Family' web site does not belong to the initiative but an ''ad-hoc'' registered association ''Građani odlučuju'' ("The citizens decide") which was founded by the Vice-president of HRAST Krešimir Miletić.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/261911/Iza-inicijative-U-ime-obitelji-stoji-Hrast.html |title=Platforma 112: 'Iza inicijative 'U ime obitelji' stoji Hrast' |trans-title=Platform 112: HRAST is behind the initiative ''U ime obitelji''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Željka Markić was furthermore criticized by opponents for allegedly being a member of the controversial Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/213188/Default.aspx |title=Željka Markić odbila odgovoriti pripadali li Opusu Dei: Nije pristojno nekoga pitati koje je duhovnosti unutar Crkve |trans-title=Zeljka Markić refused to answer whether she is a member of Opus Dei: It is not polite to Church spirituality they belong to}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutionality of the referendum question===
Voters were asked the question:

{{quotation|"''Are you in favor of the constitution of the Republic of Croatia being amended with a provision stating that marriage is matrimony between a woman and a man?''"}}

After the initiative gathered enough signatures to hold a referendum, it was widely speculated that the referendum would still not be held. The political willingness in the [[Sabor]] to call a referendum was uncertain given that a left-wing coalition which opposed the proposed amendment held a majority of the seats.

However, in a session held on 8 November, the Sabor voted to call a national referendum, with 104 votes in favour, 13 against and five abstentions.&lt;ref name="VecernjiSabor"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/sabor-danas-o-raspisivanju-referenduma-901677 |title=Sabor donio odluku o raspisivanju referenduma! |trans-title=Parliament adopted a decision on the referendum!}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former Prime Minister and an independent MP [[Jadranka Kosor]] proposed that the request for the review of constitutionality of the referendum be submitted to the Constitutional Court. However, the two largest parties, the  HDZ and SDP, did not embrace the proposal and it was rejected by 75 votes against and 39 in favour.&lt;ref name="VecernjiSabor"/&gt; The only political party of the ruling coalition that supported the constitutional review was the [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats|HNS]].&lt;ref name="VecernjiSabor"/&gt;

After a two-day session, on 14 November the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]] announced that there is no reason to over-rule the parliamentary vote on the referendum. The judges emphasized that the constitutionality of the referendum itself was not considered, because they believed that the Sabor had expressed its legal willingness to deem the referendum question compliant with the Constitution. However, they further emphasized that any possible amendment to the Constitution that defined marriage as a union of man and woman could not affect further development of the legal framework of the institution of extramarital and same-sex unions.&lt;ref name="Ustavni"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/298695/Ustavni-sud-presudio-u-korist-bracnog-referenduma.html |title=Evo zašto je Ustavni sud dopustio referendum o braku |trans-title=Here's why the Constitutional Court allowed the referendum on marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the referendum because it was not officially requested to do so by the Croatian Parliament.&lt;ref name="Ustavni"/&gt;

The judges were divided in opinion on whether the Constitutional Court should review the constitutionality of the referendum. Several of them pointed out that the Constitutional Court must give a statement on what the constitutional definition of marriage means for the position of LGBT minorities in Croatia. Others explained that the Constitutional Court did not need to respond to citizen proposals, because only the Sabor had the right to request a review of the constitutionality of the referendum question, but which it has refused to do when making the decision to call a referendum.&lt;ref name="Ustavni"/&gt;

==Campaign==
The Prime Minister [[Zoran Milanović]] told [[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]] that he would vote against the proposal.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; President [[Ivo Josipović]] called the referendum unnecessary, without practical political consequences regardless of the outcome, and a waste of taxpayer money.&lt;ref name="JosipovicPsiho"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.24sata.hr/politika/josipovic-ovaj-referendum-vec-ima-jak-psiholoski-efekt-343447|title=Josipović: Ovaj referendum već ima jak psihološki efekt|trans-title=Josipovic: This referendum already has a strong psychological effect}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president furthermore commented that marriage has already been defined in Croatian law as a union of man and woman, but that the referendum question has a strong psychological effect with an underlying discriminatory message.&lt;ref name="JosipovicPsiho"/&gt;

{{quotation|If successful, this will only strengthen the message that we are not willing to accept diversity, that we want to stop throughout the democratic world a clear process of equalization of rights of all people, regardless of their different personal characteristics, in particular their sexual orientation|Ivo Josipović&lt;ref name="JosipovicPsiho"/&gt;}}

[[Tomislav Karamarko]], leader of the conservative [[Croatian Democratic Union]] said he would vote in favor. Four other parties in the Parliament also supported the referendum;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Trimmer (23 November 2013) [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/gay.marriage.referendum.to.go.ahead.in.croatia/34795.htm Gay marriage referendum to go ahead in Croatia] ''[[Christian Today]]. Retrieved 2 December 2013''.&lt;/ref&gt; in total 104 of 151 members of the [[Croatian Parliament]] supported it.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25172778|title=Croatians back same-sex marriage ban in referendum|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 December 2012|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jutarnji list]]'', one of the country's two largest newspapers, announced it would openly endorse the campaign against the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jutarnji.hr/odluka-urednistva-jutarnji-donira-oglasni-prostor-gradanima-ugrozenima-referendumom/1138602/ ODLUKA UREDNIŠTVA Jutarnji donira oglasni prostor građanima ugroženima referendumom] Jutarnji list, 9 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A similar statement was later made by ''[[Novi list]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Mi-smo-PROTIV Mi smo PROTIV] Novi list, 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Croatian Bishops' Conference]] called for Croatian Catholics to vote in favour of the constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hbk.hr/?type=vijest&amp;ID=465 |title=Podupiremo referendum za brak jer time želimo zaštiti najslabije u našem društvu |trans-title=We support a referendum for marriage because it wants to protect the weakest in our society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from the Croatian Bishops' Conference, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Reformed Christian (Calvinist) Church, the Baptist Union of Croatia, the Evangelical Pentecostal Church, the Bet Israel Jewish Community and the Mesihat of Croatia issued a joint statement in support of the referendum on 12 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.glas-koncila.hr/index.php?option=com_php&amp;Itemid=41&amp;news_ID=23573 |trans-title=Joint statement by top representatives of faith communities in Croatia |title=Zajednička izjava visokih predstavnika vjerskih zajednica u Hrvatskoj}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Croatian Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Jewish Community of Zagreb opposed the proposed amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/299194/Luteranska-crkva-protiv-referenduma-o-braku.html |trans-title=Lutheran Church against a referendum on marriage |title=Luteranska crkva protiv referenduma o braku}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rabbinical Center of Europe has written a statement in support of the referendum and the civil initiative 'On behalf of the family', saying they were "very  disturbed  at  reports  that  some  have  compared  this pro-marriage  initiative  with  the  Nazi  regime  and  the  ideology  of fascism".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/media/files/2013-47/statement-croatia-112.pdf |title=Statement by the Rabbinical Centre of Europe (RCE) Regarding the Referendum in Croatia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal [[Josip Bozanić]] encouraged support for the amendment in a letter that was read in churches where he singled out heterosexual marriage as being the only kind of union that is capable of biologically producing children.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

{{quotation|If marriage is a union between a woman and a man, then it is not the same as other types of unions. The Church does not promote any kind of discrimination when it backs that definition of marriage. On the contrary, we can say that the danger exists today of marriage itself being discriminated against, by presenting it as something that it cannot be. The Church wants to preserve marriage and wants the definition of it be clearly spelled out, so that the institution of marriage and the institution of family are preserved for future generations. The Church is therefore not against anyone, it is open for dialogue with everyone, but wants to make it clear that some things can not be made equal. We respect everyone's opinions, but we want the institution of marriage and family, which is imperiled by societal developments today, to be guarded for the future of the Croatian people and a good in all of us.|Josip Bozanić&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/bozanic-brak-je-u-opasnosti-da-bude-diskriminiran/712608.aspx |title=Bozanić: Brak je u opasnosti da bude diskriminiran |trans-title=Bozanić: Marriage is in danger of being discriminated against |website=Index.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Bozanić repeatedly called the issue of marriage naming a serious issue for country's future and reiterated the viewpoint that it is not Church's intent to discriminate against anybody, but only to "preserve what we already have".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/bozanic-nikome-ne-oduzimamo-prava-samo-zelimo-zastititi-brak/713125.aspx |title=Bozanić: Nikome ne oduzimamo prava, samo želimo zaštiti brak trans |trans-title=Bozanic: We're not depriving anyone of their rights, we just want to protect the marriage|work=Index.hr|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that the referendum was an opportunity for Christians to practically manifest their fate by voting yes, by respecting God's intent and serving the Truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/za-i-protiv/bozanic-referendumom-se-ne-ide-protiv-nikoga-904796 |title=Bozanić: Referendumom se ne ide protiv nikoga |trans-title=Bozanić: referendum is not going against anyone in particular}}&lt;/ref&gt; He echoed his previous statements that marriage and family are not a private affair of the individual which they can shape as they see fit, but are of wider social significance and must not be experimented upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/kardinal-bozanic--brak-nije-nicija-privatna-stvar/193544/ |title=Kardinal Bozanić: Brak nije ničija privatna stvar |trans-title=Cardinal Bozanić: Marriage is not one's private affair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media portrayal===
The initiative and their goals were generally unfavorably reported by the mainstream Croatian media.

On the day of the referendum the initiative decided to forbid access to their headquarters to the journalists belonging to a group of selected media whom the initiative accused of bias, unprofessionalism and plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Mediji"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/za-i-protiv/u-ime-obitelji-zabranio-pristup-medijima-hnd-prijeti-bojkotom-906091 |title=U ime obitelji zabranio pristup medijima, HND pozvao na bojkot |trans-title=''U ime obitelji'' have forbidden access to the media, HND called for a boycott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were the [[Croatian Radiotelevision]], the public broadcasting company, the most visited Croatian Internet portals [[Index.hr]], Net.hr and T-portal, as well as all of the publications by [[Europapress Holding]] and [[Novi list]].&lt;ref name="Mediji"/&gt; The initiative required of all of the journalists to submit their cell phone numbers, their home addresses, e-mail addresses as well as the name and e-mail address of their editors. This was strongly denounced by the [[Croatian Journalists' Association]] who invited all of the media to boycott the coverage of initiative on the referendum day, and emphasized the potential for the abuse of private information.
{{quotation|In the last few weeks we have seen a number of anonymous vulgar letters sent to respected journalists in which they are being insulted and threatened by unknown persons, and obvious semi-fascists, simply because of their position on the issue.

All of the major Croatia media have responded to the call and in solidarity with the banned journalists have completely boycotted the coverage of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Novinari-protiv-netolerancije-najvece-hrvatske-medijske-kuce-nece-izvjestavati-iz-stozera-inicijative-U-ime-obitelji |title=Novinari protiv netolerancije: najveće hrvatske medijske kuće neće izvještavati iz stožera inicijative "U ime obitelji" |trans-title=Journalists against intolerance: the largest Croatian media outlets will not report from the headquarters of the initiative "On behalf of the family"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polls==
A poll conducted in June 2013 revealed that 55.3% of Croats support the changes, while 31.1% said they were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/553-posto-hrvata-za-brak-zene-i-muskarca-u-ustavu-565686 55,3 posto Hrvata za brak žene i muškarca u Ustavu] Vecernji, 6 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Another poll from November revealed that 54.3% of respondents will vote for the proposal and 33.6% against. 12.1% of respondents said they were not sure. The same poll revealed that 85.7% of [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] voters and 39.5% of [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]] voters support the proposed amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=vijesti-clanak&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=225168&amp;cHash=006b964e4e Većina za proglašenje Vukovara mjestom posebnog pijeteta] HRT, 2 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll published by [[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]] two days before the vote showed that 59% of respondents would vote for the proposal, 31% against and 10% did not answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vijesti.hrt.hr/227831/na-referendumu-59-posto-graana-za-31-posto-protiv|title=Na referendumu 59 posto građana za, 31 posto protiv|date=30 November 2013|work=hrt.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After processing all of the ballots, the State Election Commission announced that 65.87% voted ''yes'', 33.51% ''no'' and 0.57% of ballots were disregarded as invalid. 37.9% of eligible voters have voted.&lt;ref name=Res01&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.izbori.hr/2013Referendum/rezult/rezultati.html|title=State Election Commission of the Republic of Croatia, Preliminary unofficial results of the national referendum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pula]], [[Rijeka]], [[Varaždin]] and [[Čakovec]] were the only large cities, and [[Istria county]] and [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]] were the only counties where the majority of the voters voted ''no''.&lt;ref name="CrkvaUnazad"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tportal.hr/scitech/znanost/302248/Dva-desetljeca-crkvene-ideologije-su-nas-unazadila.html |title=Dva desetljeća crkvene ideologije su nas unazadila |trans-title=Two decades of church ideology have set us back}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counties most supportive of changes were in the Croatian South: [[Šibenik-Knin County|Šibenik-Knin]], [[Split-Dalmatia County|Split-Dalmatia]], [[Dubrovnik-Neretva County|Dubrovnik-Neretva]], and [[Brod-Posavina County|Brod-Posavina]].&lt;ref name="CrkvaUnazad"/&gt; This relative polarization of results between Croatian North and South has been interpreted by sociologists as closely connected to economic indicators as well as the extent to which the regions were affected by the [[Croatian War of Independence|war]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="CrkvaUnazad"/&gt; In the capital [[Zagreb]], 43.5% of voters voted ''no'', which was interpreted as the capital being an amalgam of "largely incompatible tendencies".&lt;ref name="CrkvaUnazad"/&gt;

Statistical analysis by electoral units has also indicated a strong correlation to political choices, with regions whose citizens voted for right-wing parties generally voting in favor of the referendum, while regions who voted for the left-wing coalition were largely against the referendum - albeit with many exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://iszd.hr/2013/12/prve-analize-statistickih-podataka-o-referendumu-o-braku/| title=Prve analize statističkih podataka o Referendumu "o braku" |trans-title=The first analyses of statistical data on the marriage referendum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative reactions===
The Prime Minister [[Zoran Milanović]] rejected accusations by civic initiatives that the government was complicit in calling the referendum.&lt;ref name="Milanovic"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/milanovic--vlada-nije-mogla-sprijeciti-referendum-o-braku--ali-ovaj-o-cirilici--dok-sam-je-predsjednik-vlade--nece-nikada-proci--neka-to-dobro-cuju-/1143921/ |title=Premijer Milanović: 'Dok sam ja na čelu Vlade referendum o ćirilici neće proći' |trans-title=Prime Minister Milanović: 'As long as I am the head of the Government, the Cyrillic referendum will not pass'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milanović pointed out that the referendum was allowed by the constitution, that it is in no way related to the government, and no way does it change the existing definition of marriage according to Croatian laws. He further announced the upcoming enactment of the Law on Partnership, which will enable same-sex persons to form a ''lifetime partnership'' union.&lt;ref name="Milanovic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partnerstvo"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/gayevi-ce-se-vjencavati--samo-se-njihova-veza-nece-moci-zvati-brakom-/1144010/ |title=Gayevi će se vjenčavati, samo se njihova veza neće moći zvati brakom |trans-title=Gays will be able to get married, but their relationship can not be called marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a union will share the same rights as that of marriage proper, apart from the fact that gay couples will not be able to adopt children, though they will be allowed to have custody of them.&lt;ref name="Partnerstvo"/&gt;

[[Vesna Pusić]], the First Deputy Prime Minister, also rejected accusations on government's responsibility, commenting that the referendum is result of an omission, when the threshold of 50 percent voter turnout was abolished to pass the [[Croatian European Union membership referendum, 2012|2012 EU membership referendum]].&lt;ref name="Milanovic"/&gt; Pusić contended that the threshold had protected certain groups from discrimination by a minority, but care was not taken to specifically exempt human, civil and minority rights from being the subject of referendum questions.&lt;ref name="Milanovic"/&gt;

[[Hannes Swoboda]], the President of the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|European Socialists]], said that he "was deeply disappointed because he saw Croatia as an open and advanced society, and not as a country which prohibits happiness and equal rights".&lt;ref name="Swoboda"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/swoboda-o-referendumu-duboko-sam-razocaran-mislio-sam-da-ste-napredna-drzava/714392.aspx |title=Swoboda o referendumu: Duboko sam razočaran, mislio sam da ste napredna država! |trans-title=Swoboda about the referendum: I am deeply disappointed, I thought you were a progressive country! |work=Index.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive reactions===
Hungary's [[Ruling party|ruling]] [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP)]] welcomed the results, which cheered the approval of partnership based on "the order of nature" and the affirmation of marriage "in the Christian sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.politics.hu/20131203/kdnp-welcome-croatian-referendum-against-gay-marriage/ |title=KDNP welcome Croatian referendum against gay marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the KDNP, it is the victory of the "European Christian values".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20131203_Unnepelnek_Semjenek_a_meleghazassagrol_sz |title=Ünnepelnek Semjénék a melegházasságról szóló horvát népszavazás után (Hungarian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rabbinical Centre of Europe issued a statement that it was disturbed by comparisons between the initiative and the Nazi regime and totalitarian fascism, and that such statements were inappropriate and insulting to the memory of millions of their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/za-i-protiv/rabinski-centar-europe-u-potpunosti-podrzavamo-u-ime-obitelji-906143 |title=Europski rabinski centar: U potpunosti podržavamo U ime obitelji |trans-title=Rabbinical Council of Europe: We Completely Support ''In the Name of the Family''|newspaper=[[Večernji list]]|date=1 December 2013|accessdate= 3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian bishop [[Vlado Košić]] described the government official's opposition to the referendum as shocking, unacceptable and undemocratic, emphasizing that Croats are Catholic people, cherishing traditions by which they have lived for centuries.&lt;ref name="Košić"&gt;{{citation |url=http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/229789/Default.aspx |title=Biskup Vlado Košić: Ova vlast nije uz narod! |trans-title=Bishop Vlado Košić: This government is not of the people! |date=December 8, 2013 |accessdate=December 23, 2013 |publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accused the government of [[atheism|atheizing]] the population, being eager to erase their traditional values, and has called for their [[resignation]].&lt;ref name="Košić"/&gt;

}}'''Dekulakization''' ({{lang-ru|раскулачивание}}, ''raskulachivanie''; {{lang-uk|розкуркулення}}, ''rozkurkulennia'') was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] campaign of [[political repression]]s, including [[arrests]], [[deportation]]s, and [[execution]]s of millions of wealthy [[peasants]] and their families in the 1929–1932 period of the [[First five-year plan]]. To facilitate the expropriations of farmland, the Soviet government portrayed [[kulaks]] as [[class enemies]] of the USSR.

More than 1.8&amp;nbsp;milion peasants were deported in 1930–1931.&lt;ref name="Harvest"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] (1986) ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine''.

This policy, carried out simultaneously with [[collectivization in the Soviet Union]], effectively brought all agriculture and all the peasants in Soviet Russia under state control.

A combination of dekulakization and collectivization led to mass starvation in many parts of the Soviet Union and the death of an estimated 11&amp;nbsp;million peasants in the period between 1929 and 1933, including 4&amp;nbsp;million deaths during the dekulakization campaign.&lt;ref name="Harvest"/&gt; The results soon became known outside the Soviet Union. In 1941, the American journalist [[H. R. Knickerbocker]] wrote: "It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years."&lt;ref name="knickerbocker1941"&gt;

==Dekulakization in 1917–1923==

In November 1917, at a meeting of delegates of the committees of poor peasants, [[Lenin]] announced a new policy to eliminate supposedly wealthy Soviet peasants, known as "[[kulak]]s": "If the kulaks remain untouched, if we don't defeat the freeloaders, the [[czar]] and the [[capitalist]] will inevitably return."&lt;ref name="aarutyunovdosielenina"&gt;А.Арутюнов «Досье Ленина без ретуши. Документы. Факты. Свидетельства.», Москва: Вече, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1918, "Committees of the Poor" were created to represent poor peasants, which played an important role in the struggle against the kulaks, and led the process of redistribution of confiscated lands and inventory, food surpluses from the kulaks. This launched the beginning of a great crusade against grain speculators and kulaks.&lt;ref name="leninpss"&gt;Ленин В. И. Полн. собр. сочинений. Т. 36. С. 361—363; Т. 37. С. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Before being dismissed in December 1918, the Committees had confiscated 50&amp;nbsp;million hectares of kulak land.&lt;ref name="istkpss"&gt;Краткий курс истории ВКП(б) (1938 год) // Репринтное воспроизведение стабильного издания 30-40-х годов. Москва, изд. «Писатель», 1997 г.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dekulakization under Stalin==
{{Purges in the Soviet Union}}
[[Joseph Stalin]] announced the "liquidation of the kulaks as a [[social class|class]]" on 27 December 1929.&lt;ref name="Harvest" /&gt; Stalin had said: "Now we have the opportunity to carry out a resolute offensive against the kulaks, break their resistance, eliminate them as a class and replace their production with the production of [[kolkhoz]]es and [[sovkhoz]]es."&lt;ref&gt;''Stalin, a biography'' by Robert Service, page 266&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party]] formalized the decision in a resolution titled "On measures for the elimination of kulak households in districts of comprehensive [[collectivization]]" on 30 January 1930. All kulaks were assigned to one of three categories:&lt;ref name="Harvest" /&gt;

# Those to be shot or imprisoned as decided by the local [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|secret political police]]
# Those to be sent to [[Siberia]], [[Northern Russia|the North]], the [[Urals]] or [[Kazakhstan]], after confiscation of their property
# Those to be [[eviction|evicted]] from their houses and used in [[labor colony|labor colonies]] within their own districts

An [[OGPU]] secret-police functionary, [[Yefim Yevdokimov]] (1891–1939), played a major role in organizing and supervising the round-up of peasants and the mass executions.

===Classicide of the Kulaks===
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}

==== Preparation ====
In February 1928, the "[[Pravda]]" newspaper for the first time published materials that claimed to expose the [[kulak]]s: they described widespread domination by the rich [[peasantry]] in the countryside and invasion by kulaks of communist party cells.&lt;ref name="ldtrotskiymr"&gt;Л. Д. Троцкий «Материалы о революции. Преданная революция. Что такое СССР и куда он идет»&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expropriation]] of grain stocks from kulaks and middle class peasants was called a "temporary emergency measure". Later, temporary emergency measures turned into a policy of "eliminating the kulaks as a class".&lt;ref name="ldtrotskiymr"/&gt;

The party's appeal to the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class had been formulated by Stalin:&lt;ref name="ivstalinkvoprosuolikvidacii"&gt;И. В. Сталин «К вопросу о ликвидации кулачества как класса»&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''"In order to oust the kulaks as a class, the resistance of this class must be smashed in open battle and it must be deprived of the productive sources of its existence and development (free use of land, instruments of production, land-renting, right to hire labour, etc.).That is a turn towards the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class. Without it, talk about ousting the kulaks as a class is empty prattle, acceptable and profitable only to the Right deviators."''}}

In 1928 the right [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] was still trying to support the prosperous peasantry and to soften the struggle against the kulaks. In particular, [[Alexei Rykov]], criticizing the policy of dekulakization and "methods of war communism," declared that an attack on the kulaks should be carried out, but not by methods of so-called dekulakization. He argued against taking action against individual farming in the village, the productivity of which was two times lower than in European countries. He believed that the most important task of the party was the development of the individual farming of peasants with the help of the government.&lt;ref name="nasllenina"&gt;[http://lib.meta.ua/index.php?book_id=3744 Н. В. Валентинов, Ю. Г. Фельштинский «Наследники Ленина»]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Forced collectivization USSR.jpg|left|thumb|209x209px|The requisition of grains from wealthy peasants ([[Kulak|kulaks]]) during the forced collectivization in Timashyovsky District, Kuban Soviet Union. 1933]]
Active measures to eliminate the well-to-do peasantry were welcomed by the poor, who feared that "the party set its course on the kulak."{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The party noted that "the poor continue to regard our policy in the countryside as a sharp turn from the poor to the middle peasant and the kulak," describing the perceived reaction of the poor to the "new course" of the Fourteenth Party Congress in 1925. Increasingly, the government noticed an open and resolute protest among the poor against the well-to-do middle peasants.&lt;ref&gt;РГВА, ф. 4, оп. 1, д. 107, л. 215. Цит. по: [http://www.center-bereg.ru/k2552.html ''Чуркин В. Ф.'' Самоидентификация крестьянства на переломном этапе своей истории. // История государства и права, 2006, N 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing discontent of the poor peasants was reinforced by the famine in the countryside. The [[Bolsheviks]] preferred to blame the "rural [[counterrevolution]]" of the kulaks, intending to aggravate the attitude of the people towards the party: "We must repulse the kulak ideology coming in the letters from the village. The main advantage of the kulak is bread embarrassments." [[Red Army]] peasants sent letters supporting anti-kulak ideology: "The kulaks are the furious enemies of [[socialism]]. We must destroy them, don't take them to the [[kolkhoz]], you must take away their property, their inventory." The letter of the [[Red Army]] soldier of the 28th Artillery Regiment became widely known: "The last bread is taken away, the Red Army family is not considered. Although you are my dad, I do not believe you. I'm glad that you had a good lesson. Sell bread, carry surplus - this is my last word."&lt;ref name="churkinsamoidentif"&gt;В. Ф.

[[File:Delhi Durbar, 1911.jpg|thumb|450px|right|The Delhi Durbar of 1911, with King George V and Queen Mary seated upon the [[dais]].]]

The '''Delhi Durbar''' (meaning "[[Noble court|Court]] of [[Delhi]]) was an Indian imperial style mass assembly organised by the British at [[Coronation Park, Delhi]], [[India]], to mark the succession of an [[Emperor of India|Emperor or Empress of India]].  Also known as the '''Imperial Durbar''', it was held three times, in 1877, 1903, and 1911, at the height of the [[British Empire]]. The 1911 Durbar was the only one that a sovereign, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], attended. The term was derived from the common [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] term ''[[Durbar (court)|durbar]]''.

==Durbar of 1877==
[[File:Delhi Durbar 1877.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Delhi Durbar of 1877. The [[Viceroy of India]] is seated on the dais to the left.]]
Called the "Proclamation [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]", the Durbar of 1877, for which the organisation was undertaken by [[Thomas Henry Thornton]], was held beginning on 1 January 1877 to proclaim  [[Queen Victoria]] as [[Empress of India]] by the British. The 1877 Durbar was largely an official event and not a popular occasion with mass participation like later durbars in 1903 and 1911. It was attended by the [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|1st Earl of Lytton]]—[[Viceroy of India]], [[maharaja]]s, [[nawab]]s and intellectuals. This was the culmination of transfer of control of much of [[India]] from the [[British East India Company]] to [[The Crown]].

Inside the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] in [[Calcutta]] is an inscription taken from the Message of [[Queen Victoria]] presented at the 1877 Durbar to the people of India:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We trust that the present occasion&lt;br /&gt; may tend to unite in bonds of close&lt;br /&gt; affection ourselves and our subjects;&lt;br /&gt; that from the highest to the humblest,&lt;br /&gt; all may feel that under our rule the&lt;br /&gt; great principles of liberty, equity,&lt;br /&gt; and justice are secured to them; and&lt;br /&gt; to promote their happiness, to add to&lt;br /&gt; their prosperity, and advance their&lt;br /&gt; welfare, are the ever present aims and&lt;br /&gt; objects of our Empire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Empress of India Medal]] to commemorate the Proclamation of the Queen as [[Empress of India]] was struck and distributed to the honoured guests,&lt;ref&gt;The Illustrated London News  20 Jan. – 17 Feb., (1877) retrieved 3/18/2007 [http://www.iln.org.uk/iln_years/year/1877.htm medal]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ramanath Tagore]] was made a [[Maharaja]] by [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], viceroy of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evan Cotton|Cotton, H. E. A.]], ''Calcutta Old and New'', 1909/1980, p. 596, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this glittering durbar that [[Ganesh Vasudeo Joshi]], wearing "''homespun spotless white khadi''" rose to read a citation on behalf of the grass roots native political organization, the [[Poona Sarvajanik Sabha]], which organization presaged the later rise of the [[Indian National Congress]]. Joshi's citation put forth a demand couched in very polite language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her Majesty to grant to India the same political and social status as is enjoyed by her British subjects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this demand, it can be said that the campaign for a [[Mahadev Govind Ranade#Political|free India]] was formally launched,&lt;ref&gt;The Delhi Durbar, Dimdima.com, magazine of [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], [http://dimdima.com/knowledge/freedom.asp?q_content2=yes&amp;tit=The+Delhi+Durbar free india]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the beginning of a great transformation for India.&lt;ref&gt;KESAVAN MUKUL 
(Sunday, 29 May 2005) "''STORY OF THE CONGRESS – Three pivotal moments that shaped early nationalism in India''", The Telegraph, Calcutta, retrieved 3/19/2007 [http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050529/asp/opinion/story_4798753.asp nationalism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The durbar would later be seen as controversial because it directed funds away from the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Northrop, &lt;i&gt;An Imperial World: Empires and Colonies since 1750&lt;/i&gt; (Boston: Pearson, 2013), pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durbar of 1903==
[[File:DelhiDurbar LordCurzon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord]] and [[Mary Victoria Leiter|Lady Curzon]] arriving at the Delhi Durbar, 1903.]]

The durbar was held to celebrate the succession of [[Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark]] as Emperor and Empress of India.

The two full weeks of festivities were devised in meticulous detail by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], Viceroy of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pramod K.|last=Nayar|title=Colonial Voices: The Discourses of Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CPu1l2zFY0C|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-27897-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a dazzling display of pomp, power and split second timing. Neither the earlier Delhi Durbar of 1877, nor the later Durbar held there in 1911, could match the pageantry of Lord Curzon’s 1903 festivities. In a few short months at the end of 1902, a deserted plain was transformed into an elaborate tented city, complete with temporary light railway to bring crowds of spectators out from Delhi, a post office with its own stamp, telephone and telegraphic facilities, a variety of stores, a Police force with specially designed uniform, hospital, magistrate’s court and complex sanitation, drainage and electric light installations. Souvenir guide books were sold and maps of the camping ground distributed. Marketing opportunities were craftily exploited. A special [[Delhi Durbar Medal]] was struck, firework displays, exhibitions and glamorous dances held.

Edward VII, to Curzon’s disappointment, did not attend but sent his brother, the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] who arrived with a mass of dignitaries by train from Bombay just as Curzon and his government came in the other direction from Calcutta. The assembly awaiting them displayed possibly the greatest collection of jewels to be seen in one place. Each of the Indian princes was adorned with the most spectacular of his gems from the collections of centuries. Maharajahs came with great retinues from all over India, many of them meeting for the first time while the massed ranks of the Indian armies, under their Commander-in-Chief [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], paraded, played their bands and restrained the crowds of common people.&lt;ref&gt;De Courcy Anne (2003) "''The Viceroy's Daughters: The Lives of the Curzon Sisters''", Harper Collins, 464 pages, {{ISBN|0-06-093557-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ju0AEj7kUegC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=peacock+dress+curzon&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vu8c5pA-8E&amp;sig=-5Iu2TjhxTaUTBdWUPwYt5JKCno 61 page Abstract](biography) retrieved from Google 3/14/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first day, the Curzons entered the area of festivities, together with the maharajahs, riding on elephants, some with huge gold candelabras stuck on their tusks. The durbar ceremony itself fell on New Year's Day and was followed by days of polo and other sports, dinners, balls, military reviews, bands, and exhibitions. The world’s press dispatched their best journalists, artists and photographers to cover proceedings. The popularity of movie footage of the event, shown in makeshift cinemas throughout India, is often credited with having launched the country’s [[Cinema of India#1896 - 1910|early film industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes Richard, "''Sahib: The British Soldier in India 1750–1914''". HARPERCOLLINS. 571 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore Stephen  (Oct, 1995) "''An amazing quarter mile of moving gold, gems and genealogy''": filming India's 1902/03 Delhi Durbar, Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, includes extensive bibliography of the event, retrieved 3/18/2007  [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2584/is_n4_v15/ai_17782466/pg_1 filming the Durbar]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The India Post issued a set of two commemorative souvenir sheets with special cancellation struck on 1 January 1903 – 12 noon, a much sought after item for the stamp collectors today.

The event culminated in a grand coronation ball attended only by the highest ranking guests, all reigned over by Lord Curzon and more so by the stunning [[Mary Victoria Leiter|Lady Curzon]] in her glittering jewels and [[Lady Curzon's peacock dress|regal peacock gown]].&lt;ref&gt;Cory, Charlotte (2002) Sunday Times, 29 December, retrieved 3/14/2007 "''The Delhi Durbar 1903 Revisited''",[http://www.charlottecory.com/travel/delhi_durbar.htm 1903 Durbar, extensive description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513183442/http://www.charlottecory.com/travel/delhi_durbar.htm |date=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durbar of 1911==
[[File:The Nizam of Hyderabad pays homage to the king and queen at the Delhi Durbar.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Nizam of Hyderabad pays homage to the Emperor and Empress at the Delhi Durbar, December 1911]]
On 22 March 1911, a royal proclamation announced that the Durbar would be held in December to commemorate the coronation in Britain a few months earlier of [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck]] and allow their proclamation as Emperor and Empress of India. Practically every ruling prince and nobleman in India, plus thousands of landed [[gentry]] and other persons of note, attended to pay obeisance to their sovereigns.

The official ceremonies lasted from 7 December to 16 December, with the Durbar itself occurring on Tuesday, 12 December.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/coronationdurbar030742mbp#page/n13/mode/2up ''Coronation Durbar, Delhi 1911:  Official Directory with Maps''. Calcutta:  Superintendent Government Printing, India, 1911.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The royal couple arrived at [[Coronation Park, Delhi|Coronation Park]] in their Coronation robes, the King-Emperor wearing the [[Imperial Crown of India]] with eight arches, containing 6170 exquisitely cut [[diamond]]s, and covered with [[sapphire]]s, [[emerald]]s and [[Ruby|rubies]], with a velvet and miniver cap all weighing 34.05 ounces (965 g). They received homage from the native princes – including one woman, the [[Kaikhusrau Jahan, Begum of Bhopal|Begum of Bhopal]] – at the [[shamiana]] (ceremonial tent); controversy ensued when the Gaekwar of Baroda, Maharajah (Emperor) [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Sayajirao III]], approached the royal couple without his jewellery on, and after a simple bow turned his back to them when leaving. His action was interpreted at the time as a sign of dissent to British rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16051168 | work=BBC News | title=Indian maharajah's daring act of anti-colonial dissent | date=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the royal couple ascended to the domed royal pavilion, where the King-Emperor announced the move of India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi. The annulment of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]] was also announced during the ceremony&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gktoday.in/gk/delhi-durbar-of-1911/|title=Delhi Durbar of 1911 - General Knowledge Today|website=www.gktoday.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The day after, on 13 December, the royal couple made a [[Darśana|darshan]] (an appearance) at the [[jharoka]] (balcony window) of [[Red Fort]], to receive half a million or more of the common people who had come to greet them, a custom which was started by [[Shahjahan]].&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Ark, Royal and Ruling Houses of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas [http://www.4dw.net/royalark/India/India.htm royal jewels]&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 14 December the King-Emperor presided over a military parade of 50,000 troops.

A [[Delhi Herald Extraordinary|Delhi Herald of Arms Extraordinary]] and an Assistant Herald were appointed for the 1911 Durbar ([[William Peyton|Brigadier-General William Peyton]] and [[Malik Umar Hayat Khan|Captain the Hon. Malik Mohammed Umar Hayat Khan]]), but their duties were more ceremonial than heraldic.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Noel, ''A New Zealand Heraldic Authority?'' in John Campbell-Kease (ed), ''Tribute to an Armorist: Essays for John Brooke-Little to mark the Golden Jubilee of The Coat of Arms'', London, The Heraldry Society, 2000, p. 93 &amp; p. 101: "Two heralds, with ceremonial rather than heraldic responsibilities, were appointed for the Delhi Durbar in 1911... Delhi Herald (Brigadier-General William Eliot Peyton) and Assistant Delhi Herald (Captain the Honourable Malik Mohammed Umar Haiyat Khan)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-six thousand eight hundred (26,800) [[Delhi Durbar Medal]]s in silver were awarded to the men and officers of the British and Indian Armies who participated in the 1911 event. A further two hundred were struck in gold,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Howard N Cole.|title=Coronation and Royal Commemorative Medals.|pp=37. Published J. B. Hayward &amp; Son, London. 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; a hundred of which were awarded to Indian princely rulers and the highest ranking government officers.&lt;ref&gt;Delhi Durbar Medals of 1911 [http://www.northeastmedals.co.uk/britishguide/the_delhi_durbar_medal_1911.htm 1911 medal]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[feature film]] of the event titled ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'' (1912) – also known as ''The Durbar in Delhi'' – was filmed in the early color process [[Kinemacolor]] and released on 2 February 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Filming the Delhi Durbar [http://www.charlesurban.com/durbar.htm 1911 filming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708135411/http://www.charlesurban.com/durbar.htm |date=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the Durbar achieved its purpose of cementing support for British rule among the native princes, as was demonstrated by the support given during the First World War.

Today [[Coronation Park, Delhi|Coronation Park]] is a jealously guarded open space, whose emptiness can come as somewhat of a shock after the dense traffic and crowded [[shanty town]]s of northern Delhi’s urban sprawl. It is mostly overgrown, neglected and locked. The Park is sometimes used for big religious festivals and municipal conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee Sanjeeb (Oct. 2001) Coronation Park – the Raj junkyard, the-south-Asian.com, retrieved 3/18/2007 [http://www.the-south-asian.com/Oct2001/Junkyard_of_statues.htm Coronation Park] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111112718/http://www.the-south-asian.com/Oct2001/Junkyard_of_statues.htm |date=11 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
While [[Edward VIII]] [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in December 1936 before his coronation, it was initially envisaged that his successor [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] would ultimately visit India and have his own Durbar.  The [[History of the Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] passed a motion weeks after his accession calling for a boycott of any such visit, and in February 1937 [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist]] MP [[Willie Gallacher (politician)|Willie Gallacher]] decried expenditure on such festivities in a country of such poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1937/feb/08/the-coronation-durbar#S5CV0320P0-00281 | house=House of Commons | date=1937-02-08 | column_start=8 | column_end=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[speech from the throne|King's Speech]] of October 1937 included "I am looking forward with interest and pleasure to the time when it will be possible for Me to visit My Indian Empire";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard  | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1937/oct/26/the-kings-speech | house=House of Lords | date=1937-10-26 | column_start=1 | column_end=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the onset of [[World War II]] and [[Indian independence movement|the movement towards Indian independence]] meant this visit never happened.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1707">'''"Don't let the fire go out"''' is a phrase used during the [[United States Senate elections, 2000|2000 election]] in a campaign to elect [[Mel Carnahan]] to the [[United States Senate]] after his death, and '''''Don't Let the Fire Go Out''''' is a book written by his widow, US Senator [[Jean Carnahan]], on the same subject.

==Posthumous campaign slogan==
Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash weeks before the election.  There was not time for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to replace him on the ballot.  The goal of the Democratic Party was to get Mel Carnahan elected to the Senate, to give [[Roger B. Wilson|Roger Wilson]], who temporarily succeed Carnahan as Missouri Governor, a chance to appoint a replacement candidate into office.  Carnahan's widow, Jean Carnahan, was the favorite by many to succeed her husband.  Wilson appointed Mrs. Carnahan to the Senate, where she joined the three other new women Senators from the 2000 election.  Carnahan served until was voted out of office in 2002 in favor of Republican challenger [[Jim Talent]].

==Book==
Jean Carnahan wrote the book shortly after losing the 2002 election.  The book concerns mostly the time after her husband Mel Carnahan died and she was subsequently appointed to the US Senate in his place.

The '''EU Anti-Corruption Report''' was the [[European Commission]]'s short-lived anti-corruption reporting mechanism. The report was planned to be published on a bi-annual basis to monitor and assess the efforts of [[Member States]] of the [[European Union]] in tackling corruption. The Anti-Corruption Report was established in June 2011,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/pdf/com_decision_c%282011%29_3673_final_en_en.pdf|title=Establishing an EU Anti-corruption reporting mechanism for periodic assessment ("EU Anti-corruption Report")|last=|first=|date=6 June 2011|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but discontinued in February 2017, having only ever published one report in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/commission-quietly-shelves-corruption-report/|title=Commission ‘quietly shelves’ corruption report|website=EURACTIV.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope and objectives ==

The [[non-binding]] report was activated in 2013 as a monitoring mechanism to identify “failures and vulnerabilities across the 27 EU Member States”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/678&amp;format=DOC&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en European Commission - Press Release, “Commission fights corruption: a stronger commitment for greater results", 6 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, its stated objectives were:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

(a) to periodically assess the situation in the Union regarding the fight against corruption;

(b) to identify trends and best practices;

(c) to make general recommendations for adjusting EU policy on preventing and fighting corruption;

(d) to make tailor-made recommendations;

(e) to help Member States, civil society or other stakeholders identify shortcomings, raise awareness and provide training on anti-corruption.

The monitoring mechanism envisioned engagement with existing European and international initiatives, including the European Council’s [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (GRECO); the [[UN Convention against Corruption]] (UNCAC); and the [[OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]. Each [[Member State]] had a designated “research correspondent” working on the ground and reporting back to an expert group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/13-06/index.php?sz=7 Michael Kubiciel (Expert Germany) - Der EU Anti Corruption Report , Law Review Article (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU alsoaimzd to draw upon the work carried out by existing agencies such as the [[European Anti-Fraud Office]] and [[EUROPOL]].

== Discontinuation ==
In February 2017, the Report was discontinued. In an internal letter to the chair of the EU parliament's civil liberty committee, MEP Claude Moraes, Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans argued that the first and only Report published in 2014 had provided the basis for deepened work and consultations as part of the EU's anti-corruption framework. Subsequent reports were therefore not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transparency.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170130-Letter-FVP-LIBE-Chair.pdf|title=Timmermans letter|last=|first=|date=|website=Transparency International EU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/136775|title=EU commission drops anti-corruption report|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elcor''' is a &lt;!--see talk page regarding "former" status--&gt; [[ghost town]], or more properly, an extinct town, in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]] that was inhabited between 1897 and 1956. It was built on the [[Mesabi Range|Mesabi Iron Range]] near the city of [[Gilbert, Minnesota|Gilbert]] in [[St. Louis County, Minnesota|St. Louis County]]. Elcor was its own unincorporated community before it was abandoned and was never a neighborhood proper of the city of Gilbert.&lt;ref name="Neighborhood"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elcor: A gentle, good neighborhood now more than 50 years gone|url=http://www.virginiamn.com/archives/elcor-a-gentle-good-neighborhood-now-more-than-years-gone/article_d69c8dc6-ce17-5523-afda-cd2ef53aba50.html|accessdate=May 9, 2016|publisher=''[[Mesabi Daily News]] (MN)''|date=March 18, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318231056/http://www.virginiamn.com/archives/elcor-a-gentle-good-neighborhood-now-more-than-years-gone/article_d69c8dc6-ce17-5523-afda-cd2ef53aba50.html|archivedate=March 18, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not rating a figure in the national census, the people of Elcor were only generally considered to be citizens of Gilbert.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url= |title=Elcor-People and the Place|newspaper=Gilbert Herald (MN)|page=1|date=April 14, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area where Elcor was located was [[Municipal annexation in the United States|annexed]] by Gilbert when its existing city boundaries were expanded after 1969.&lt;ref name="Historical Maps Comparison"&gt;{{cite web|title=USGS Historical Topographic Map Explorer|url=http://historicalmaps.arcgis.com/usgs/|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1890, the [[Seven Iron Brothers|seven Merritt brothers]] discovered ore near [[Mountain Iron, Minnesota|Mountain Iron]], triggering an unparalleled iron rush to the Mesabi Range.{{sfn|Havinghurst|1958|pp=75–76}} The Elba mine was opened in 1897, and the town was [[plat]]ted under the direction of Don H. Bacon, president of the Minnesota Iron Company. A second nearby mine, the Corsica, was opened in 1901.  The community was first called "Elba" after the name of the first underground mine (the name "Elcor" was formed later by combining the first syllables of each mine's name). The Elba and Corsica mines were both leased by [[Pickands Mather and Company]] after the formation of the [[United States Steel Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Iron Range History" /&gt;{{sfn|Van Brunt|1921|p=469}}&lt;ref name="Mineral Leases"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Minerals Leases|url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lands_minerals/min_leases.html|publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=February 13, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524040853/http://http/|archivedate=May 24, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influx of people of many ethnicities and many nations followed, and Elcor became a microcosm of U.S. immigration, mirroring the cultural assimilation of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abramitzky|first1=Ran|title=What history tells us about assimilation of immigrants|url=https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/what-history-tells-us-about-assimilation-immigrants|website=Stanford University|publisher=Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research|accessdate=October 23, 2017|date=April 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914190725/https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/what-history-tells-us-about-assimilation-immigrants|archivedate=September 14, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak around 1920, Elcor had two churches, a post office, a [[general store]], a primary school, a railroad station, and its own law enforcement, and housed a population of nearly 1,000.&lt;ref name="Holten" /&gt;

Elcor was a mining location, built by the mining company to house the workers for its mines.&lt;ref name="Holten" /&gt; People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}}{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=4}} After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the residents to vacate the property so that it could [[Mine reclamation|reclaim]] the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned.&lt;ref name="Neighborhood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosts" /&gt;{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=107}} The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers, and bankruptcies.

The Minnesota Steamship Company was organized by, and [[vertically integrated]] with, the Minnesota Iron Company to carry ore in 1889; its steamers and barges all had names that began with M, and the ships were referred to as the M fleet.

The community grew at the beginning of the century.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History"/&gt; In 1902, the Corsica mine began operating in earnest and houses were quickly  built.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=102}} Company houses were built among the tall timbers. The community thrived on iron mining, its population nearing 1,000 after World War I,&lt;ref name=Holten/&gt; resulting in a neat and comfortable location comprising more than 100 houses.{{sfn|Woodbridge &amp; Pardee|1910|p=737|}} The townspeople were [[American pioneer|pioneers]] and largely immigrants, including [[Croatians]], [[Slovenians]], [[Finns]], [[Italians]], [[Germans]], Scandinavians, and English, particularly from [[Cornwall]].{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|pp=4, 25}}&lt;ref name=Eldot&gt;

In the early days, houses were made of wooden boards and surrounded by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a [[boardwalk]]. Most of the streets were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses dragging V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=20}}&lt;ref name=Fleichtinger&gt;

In the center of town was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs, and barrels were used for water storage.&lt;ref name=Neighborhood/&gt;{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=4}}{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=104}} Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History"/&gt;{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=4}} Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=4}}{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=104}}
Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=15}}

The community's Finns organized a [[temperance society]] and built the Finnish Temperance Hall.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=105}} The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts, and a clubhouse for employees.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History"/&gt;{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=5}}{{sfn|Woodbridge &amp; Pardee|1910|p=737}}
A small [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church were built.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=104}} The town also had a night watchman and later a full-time patrolman.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=4}}&lt;ref name=Eldot /&gt; Always noted as a quiet, orderly town,&lt;ref name="Eldot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleichtinger" /&gt; Elcor managed to avoid the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's [[red-light district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Citizens group denounces town's 'Whorehouse Days'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2005-01-27-gilbert_x.htm|accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=January 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the frame houses was used as the first school in Elcor.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=103}} It was not long before a new school was constructed. Elcor was included in the middle part of the Gilbert School system, known then as Independent School District No. 18. There were five schoolhouses in the district. The McKinley-Elba school was built in 1900, halfway between McKinley and Elba, complete with its own well and windmill.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History"/&gt;{{sfn|Van Brunt|1921|p=462}} It had four teachers and housed classes through the [[eighth grade]], accommodating pupils of both communities.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History"/&gt;{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=4}}{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=103}} Students walked to school over boardwalks.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History"/&gt; There were also three primary schools in the district, one of them in Elba on Malta Street.{{sfn|Van Brunt|1921|p=462}}

Elcor's renters were required to take in boarders.&lt;ref name=Holten/&gt;{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=3}} The company rented a "cottage" for $7.50 per month, which later included electricity. Homes were charged an additional dollar per month when water was piped in from Gilbert.&lt;ref name=Holten/&gt; Although people were later allowed to own their homes (even though the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company), rents were never increased.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}}

All families had their own gardens in which they grew vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs, and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=5}} There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=16}} Before the Mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=4}} Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.{{sfn|''Gilbert Centennial''|2008|p=15}}

In 1920, the Finnish Hall became a general store, the Elcor Mercantile, along with an official U.S. Post Office.&lt;ref name=Holten /&gt;{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}} When the post office began operation, much confusion resulted, because there was another town named [[Elba, Minnesota|Elba]] in southeastern Minnesota, just east of [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]].{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}}&lt;ref name=Fleichtinger /&gt;{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=5}} The name "Corsica" was attempted with the same result.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}} Finally, the community was named "Elcor", combining the first syllable of each of the two names.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History" /&gt;{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}}{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=5}} "Elcor" was emblazoned in large white letters on the water tower.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}}

Mail was picked up twice daily at the railroad station,  erroneously named "Elcore", for the [[Duluth and Iron Range Railroad]] (later the [[Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range|Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railroad]]).{{sfn|Upham|2001|p=520}}{{sfn|Leighton|1998|p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|2123651|Elcore Station (historical)|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Elcor Mercantile diversified into the up-and-coming petroleum business, selling [[Conoco]] gasoline, kerosene, fuel oils, motor oils, grease, and even [[outboard motors]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=16}} Concrete [[sidewalks]] were built to line the shady streets, and bright red [[fire hydrants]] were installed.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=106}} Homes were [[Building insulation|insulated]], and people began to purchase refrigerators.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=16}} Manilla Street and Maritana Avenue were paved.

In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=100}}&lt;ref name=Eldot /&gt; The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that "temporary" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps "eventually" be reopened.&lt;ref name=Ghosts /&gt;{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=100}}&lt;ref name=Eldot/&gt; A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=107}} By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.&lt;ref name="Neighborhood" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Breining /&gt;{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=107}}

Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance,&lt;ref name=Holten/&gt; or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=24}} No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.&lt;ref name="Neighborhood"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eldot/&gt;

Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town.{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=8}}{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=108}} For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations.&lt;ref name=Eldot/&gt; Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land [[speculators]]. In the few months after  Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were sold for as much as $500.&lt;ref name=Eldot/&gt; Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley.&lt;ref name=Holten /&gt; The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956.&lt;ref name="Iron Range History"/&gt;{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=100}}{{sfn|Phillipich et al.|1982|p=5}} Every building was torn down or removed.{{sfn|Lamppa|1962|p=108}} All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of [[Minnesota State Highway 135]] between Gilbert and [[Biwabik, Minnesota|Biwabik]].

==Geology==
Elcor sat atop a bed of [[taconite]] consisting of a uniform mixture of about 30&amp;nbsp;percent iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore containing 90 to 95 percent iron,{{sfn|Davis|1964|p=1}} a part of the Biwabik iron formation. The formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the [[Precambrian]] era on the bottom of the [[Animikie Group|Animikie Sea]]. This sea occupied the western portion of the [[Great Lakes]] area, depositing iron-bearing sediments extending under Lake Superior from the [[Mesabi Range|Mesabi]] and [[Vermilion Iron Range]]s in northern Minnesota, to the [[Gogebic Range|Gogebic Iron Range]] in northern [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]'s upper peninsula, to the [[Marquette Iron Range|Marquette Range]] of the upper peninsula, and west to the [[manganese]]-rich ore of the [[Cuyuna Range|Cuyuna Iron Range]] in central Minnesota.{{sfn|Davis|1964|p=31}} Michigan's [[Silicon dioxide|silicious]] steel-blue high-grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was hydrated soft brown [[hematite]].{{sfn|Van Hise|1901|p=337}}{{sfn|Crowell &amp; Murray|1914|p=229}}{{sfn|Havinghurst|1958|p=47}} Geologists disagree about the geologic time period of the region and the mechanism by which the iron-bearing sediment was laid down differently on opposite sides of the lake.{{sfn|Davis|1964|p=34}} There is iron ore in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.&lt;ref name="Southern Minnesota Iron"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pederson|first=C.

Geologists divide the iron-bearing rocks of the eastern Mesabi Iron Range into several layers. In the [[stratigraphic column]], [[Virginia Slate]] and [[Duluth Complex|Duluth gabbro]] lie above, followed by four main iron-bearing divisions named the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty, and Lower Cherty. Below these are [[quartzite]] and [[granite]]. Beneath the shallow [[topsoil]], the slate is from {{convert|50|ft|m}} to several hundred feet thick, and the four iron-bearing layers are from {{convert|400|to|600|ft|m}} thick.{{sfn|Davis|1964|p=34}}

* Assisting the developing world: Development assistance programs have taken place or are planned in [[Burma]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sudan]], South Sudan, [[Tunisia]] and [[Yemen]]. These programs provide training on federalism and decentralized governance, as well as sector specific institutional support.
* Holds major international conferences:  On average every three years, sponsored by [[Canada]] (1999), [[Switzerland]] (2002), [[Belgium]] (2005), [[India]] (2007) and [[Ethiopia]] (2010). Conferences are attended by heads of state and heads of government (e.g. [[Johannes Rau]], president of Germany, in 2002; Indian Prime Minister Dr. [[Manmohan Singh]] and Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] in 2007), as well as ministers, judges, senior officials, young professionals, academics and other specialists.

==History==
The Forum was founded in 1999 following the [[Clarity Act#Conference|First International Conference on Federalism]] in [[Mont-Tremblant]], [[Quebec]]. The event drew then world leaders such as U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]], and Mexican President [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Four consecutive International Conferences were organized in Switzerland, Belgium, India, and Ethiopia. Over the years, the Forum has expanded the focus of its work to include not only established federal countries but also countries in post-conflict situations adopting federal forms of governance and those involved in processes of devolution and decentralization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2188">'''Homelessness NSW''' is the [[peak body organisation]] representing [[homelessness]] services in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelessnessnsw.org.au/|title=Home - Homelessness NSW|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homelessness NSW advocates on behalf of agencies and homeless people across NSW, with a particular focus on single men, single women, families and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.community.nsw.gov.au/for-agencies-that-work-with-us/our-funding-programs/sector-development/peak-bodies|title=Community Services -  Peak bodies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Homelessness NSW has argued that current voting laws in Australia do not account for the situation of homeless people. For example, women escaping domestic violence may feel unsafe attending a public polling booth, however, fear for safety is not a valid excuse for requiring a postal vote.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3951">The '''ICC Working Group on Business and Human Rights''' is a thematic Working Group of [[International Co-ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions|the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC)]].  The Working Group was established by the ICC Bureau in March 2009 and held its [http://www.nhri.net/2009/ICC%20WG%20BHR%20Report%20to%20ICC%20Bureau%20011109.pdf first meeting in Copenhagen in August 2009]. The Working Group includes 2 members from each of the 4 ICC Regions ([[Network of African National Human Rights Institutions|Africa]], [[Network of National Institutions in the Americas|Americas]], [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia-Pacific]] and [[European Group of National Human Rights Institutions|Europe]]). The [[Danish Institute for Human Rights|Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR)]] currently holds the Chair of the Working Group.

The Working Group on Business and Human Rights is the first thematic working group under the ICC. The purpose of the Working Group is to encourage collaboration between [[National human rights institutions|National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs)]] within the Human Rights and Business field and ensure that the issue of human rights and business is included in international frameworks.

== Organization ==

The officers of the WG are a Chair and Vice Chair. The order of succession of the offices of Chair and Vice Chair is distributed between the four ICC regions in the following order: Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific, and Africa. Each ICC Regional Chair determines the method of selection of members representing the four ICC regions. Membership of the Working Group for regional members lasts for a period of two years. If a membership of the Working Group is terminated, the relevant Regional Chair determines a replacement. 
&lt;br /&gt;
The working languages of the Working Group will be those of the ICC: English, French and Spanish.

The '''Institute of World Affairs''' ('''IWA''') was founded 1924 in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] by Maude Miner Hadden and Alexander Mectier Hadden.&lt;ref name="iwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwa.org/.|title=Institute of World Affairs|publisher=iwa.org|accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWA started at the [[Student’s International Union]] (SIU) in Geneva. The SIU had been established at the [[League of Nations]] during its 5th assembly, and the creation of the SIU was at the bequest of students at the nearby university of Geneva and an idea by [[Gilbert Murray]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1696286/Institute-of-World-Affairs-IWA.|title=Institute of World Affairs (IWA) (nongovernmental organization) -- Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWA, in time, would grow to not only have the office in Geneva, but also have offices in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Salisbury, Connecticut.&lt;ref name="iwa"/&gt; In 1941, due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], the IWA was moved to the United States because of security concerns.

The website for the IWA states as its mission statement that “IWA is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization working across cultural and political boundaries to advance creative approaches to conflict analysis, conflict management, and post-conflict peace-building.”

==Foundation==
Maude and Alexander, met when the two of them founded the institution. Alexander was son to a well off family, whose father did not wish for him to go to college. Alexander did end up going to college, funded his education at Columbia University by “saving his allowance and depriving himself of luxuries.” Alexander had met Maude through his social work.

Maude and Alexander had met two university students who were also interested in world affairs. The students were very interested in world peace and security, but they had no structure to understand the very issues they were so interested in. At this point the Hadden’s ended their honeymoon, and they returned to New York and began working on creating an International organization for students. The organization would become the IWA, and it would set out to give students experience and understanding of world politics. The IWA would end up becoming part of the Hadden’s legacy after their deaths in the early and mid-1900’s, and in 1994 the IWA merged, in-part, with the [[Institute of Current World Affairs]] (ICWA). In-line with the mission of the IWA the ICWA site, “fostering understanding of the world by immersing promising individuals in the study of a country, region, or globally important issue and by sharing the benefits of their knowledge with society”, as their mission statement.

==Goals==
The school of thought of both the IWA and ICWA  are mirrored. Although the IWA was geared more towards conflict resolution, conflict management, and post-conflict peacebuilding and the ICWA is more non-conflict oriented –as they do not send fellows to war zones or places where security is a concern--, both  are designed to give real world knowledge to the students. The IWA seemed to be very conflict resolution and analysis oriented, whereas the ICWA seemed to be much more set-up for non-conflict everyday issues ranging from water sanitation to environmental issues.

==Supporting government agencies==
The governmental agencies which fund them in part. The list includes [[U.S. Joint Forces Command]], [[Canadian Department of National Defence]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]] - Government of Switzerland, [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], [[National Endowment for Democracy]], and the U.S. Institute of Peace.

{{Policy Debate}}
'''Inter-collegiate policy debate''' is a form of [[Individual events (speech)|speech competition]] involving two teams of two debaters from different [[college]]s or [[university|universities]] based on a resolution phrased as something the [[United States federal government]] "should" do. [[Policy debate]] also exists as a [[high school]] activity, with a very similar format, but different leagues, tournaments, speech times, resolutions, and styles.

==Format==
Each round is divided into four 9-minute [[Constructive speech|constructive]] speeches, each followed by a 3-minute cross-examination period, then four 6-minute [[Rebuttal speech|rebuttal]] speeches. The two sides alternate, with the affirmative getting the first and last speeches of the round and the negative getting the last constructive and the first rebuttal in the middle. Most affirmative teams present a specific policy option, or plan, as a normative defence of the resolution. However, some teams partake in alternative forms of debate, including performance, personal advocacies, or otherwise [[Kritik|critical]] approaches. Negatives have several options for response, including [[Stock issues|solvency]] arguments against the effectiveness of the plan, external policy [[disadvantage]]s, opportunity-cost-based [[counterplan]]s, arguments stemming from debate theory such as the failure of the affirmative to [[Topicality (policy debate)|advocate the resolution]], and critical approaches. Argument is highly [[Evidence (policy debate)|evidence]]-based, with numerous lengthy excerpts from books and articles read by each side. Speeches are often very fast, so much so as to be incomprehensible to people who are not used to the style.

==Governing organizations==
Inter-collegiate policy debate has been historically overseen by the [[National Debate Tournament]] (NDT), the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] (CEDA), and, especially in the mid-Atlantic region, the [[American Debate Association]] (ADA).  Since 1996-97 these organizations have shared a common topic, and have become largely unified.  They nonetheless continue to host their own national championships.

Other organizations that sponsor policy debate, albeit with different rules, are the [[National Educational Debate Association]] (NEDA) and
the National Forensics Association's Lincoln Douglas (NFA-LD) debate (a policy variant of the high school [[Lincoln-Douglas debate|LD]] format, which is less commonly practiced in colleges and universities).

==Differences with high school debate==
Inter-collegiate and high school policy debate are largely similar. Some of the differences:

*High school debate has its own, separate, leagues and tournaments.
*High school [[Constructive speech|constructives]] are typically only 8 minutes, and high school [[Rebuttal speech|rebuttals]] are typically only 5 minutes. College times are typically 9 minute constructives and 6 minute rebuttals.
*Each year, the High school [[Resolution (policy debate)|resolution]] is different from the College Policy Resolution.
*College rounds tend to be more strategically complex.

Experienced college debaters often act as paid coaches, judges, and summer-camp counselors for high school policy debaters.

In [[computing]], '''kill pill''' is a term given to mechanisms and technologies designed to render [[Computer systems|systems]] useless either by user command, or under a predefined set of circumstances. Kill pill technology is most commonly used to disable lost or stolen devices for security purposes, but can also be used for the enforcement of rules and contractual obligations.

==Applications==

===Lost and stolen devices===
Kill pill technology is used prominently in [[smartphone]]s, especially in the disablement of lost or stolen devices. A notable example is [[Find My iPhone]], a service that allows the user to [[password]] protect or [[Data erasure|wipe]] their [[iDevice|iDevice(s)]] remotely, aiding in the protection of private data.&lt;ref name=FindMyiPhone&gt;{{cite web|title=iCloud - Find my iPhone|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/icloud/#find|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar applications exist for other smartphone [[Operating System|operating systems]], including [[Android (operating system)|Android]],&lt;ref name=Android5Ways&gt;{{cite web|last=Lightner|first=Rob|title=5 ways to help find your lost Android device|url=http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20095637-285/5-ways-to-help-find-your-lost-android-device/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BlackBerry OS|BlackBerry]],&lt;ref name=BlackBerryProtect&gt;{{cite web|title=BlackBerry Protect|url=http://ca.blackberry.com/devices/features/security/protect.html|publisher=BlackBerry Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref name=FindingLostMicrosoftPhone&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding a lost phone|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-ca/how-to/wp7/basics/find-a-lost-phone|publisher=Microsoft Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-piracy measure===
Kill pill technology has been notably used as an [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]] measure. [[Windows Vista]] was released with the ability to severely limit its own functionality if it was determined that the copy was obtained through [[Software piracy|piracy]]. The feature was later dropped after complaints that [[false positive]]s caused genuine copies of Vista to act as though they were pirated.&lt;ref name=VistaKillPill&gt;{{cite news|title='Kill switch' dropped from Vista|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7126902.stm|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of malicious software===
The concept of a kill pill is also applied to the remote removal by a [[Server (computing)|server]] of malicious files or applications from a [[Client (computing)|client's]] system. Such technology is a standard component of most handheld computing devices, mainly due to their generally more limited operating systems and means of obtaining applications. Such functionality is also reportedly available to applications downloaded from the [[Windows Store]] on [[Windows 8]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=Win8KillSwitch&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Jordan|title=The Kill Switch Comes to the PC|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-02-17/the-kill-switch-comes-to-the-pc|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Businessweek|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
Kill pill technology is used frequently in [[Motor vehicle|vehicles]] for a variety of reasons. Remote vehicle disablement can be used to prevent a vehicle from starting, to prevent it from moving, and to prevent the vehicle's continued operation. Non-remotely, vehicles can require driver recognition before starting or moving, such as asking for a password or some form of [[biometrics]] from the driver.&lt;ref name=VehicleKillPill&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Disabling Systems|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm|publisher=US Department of Transportation: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association|accessdate=13 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221084256/http://@fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm|archivedate=21 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kill pill technology is often used by governments to prevent [[drunk driving]] by repeat offenders as a punishment and deterrent. The installation of an [[ignition interlock device]]s is a sentencing alternative for drunk drivers in almost all 50 of the [[United States]]. Such a device requires the driver to blow into a [[breathalyzer]] before starting the vehicle. If the driver is found to be over the legal [[blood alcohol content]] limit, the vehicle will not start&lt;ref name=CarBreathalyzer&gt;{{cite news|last=Cordell|first=LaDoris|title=Baby, You Can't Drive Your Car|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2009/09/baby_you_cant_drive_your_car.html|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Kill pill technology can also be implemented to contextually disable certain aspects of a smartphone's functionality. A patent obtained by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] claims the ability to disable the antenna, screen, or camera of a smartphone in settings like theaters, schools, and areas of high security sensitivity.&lt;ref name=ApplePatent&gt;{{cite patent|country = US|number = 8254902|status = patent|title = Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Kill pill technology has been criticized for allowing for the suppression of personal liberties. While a kill pill can be utilized in a school setting to prevent academic dishonesty, it has been suggested that governments may also use it to suppress their people, for example, by disabling a phone's camera or antenna in the area of a protest.&lt;ref name=ApplePatentProtest&gt;{{cite news|last=Whittaker|first=Zack|title=Apple's patent could remotely disable protesters' phone cameras|url=http://www.zdnet.com/apple-patent-could-remotely-disable-protesters-phone-cameras-7000003640/|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=ZDNet|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to remotely remove files and applications from a user's device has also come under fire. Apple's apparent ability to [[blacklist]] applications, rendering them unusable on any iDevice, has raised concerns about the user's rights when downloading from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref name=AppleRemoteWipe&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=Apple Can Remotely Disable Apps Installed on Your iPhone|url=https://gizmodo.com/5034007/apple-can-remotely-disable-apps-installed-on-your-iphone|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Gizmodo|date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2014, no applications appear on Apple's blacklist website.

{{Intersex sidebar|rights}}
'''[[Intersex]]''' people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical [[Gender binary|binary]] notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{cite web | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex | date = 2015 | url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071043/https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Asia Pacific Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and thirdly it is not about the creation of a [[Third gender|third sex]] or gender classification for intersex people as a population but it is, instead, about self determination.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

The Asia Pacific Forum, the [[Council of Europe]],&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; and the [[Malta declaration (International Intersex Forum)|Malta declaration]] of the Third [[International Intersex Forum]] have called for [[non-binary]] gender classifications to be available on a voluntary, opt-in basis.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; The Council of Europe has called for greater consideration of the implications of new sex classifications on intersex people,&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; while the Third International Intersex Forum called for the long term removal of sex or gender from official identification documents.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

In some countries, legal recognition may be limited, access to any form of birth certificate may be difficult,&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some other countries recognise that intersex people may have non-binary gender identities.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; Sociological research in [[Australia]], a country with a non-binary gender marker, has shown that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics may prefer that option.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Open Book Publishers| isbn = 978-1-78374-208-0| last1 = Jones| first1 = Tiffany| last2 = Hart| first2 = Bonnie| last3 = Carpenter| first3 = Morgan| last4 = Ansara| first4 = Gavi| last5 = Leonard| first5 = William| last6 = Lucke| first6 = Jayne| title = Intersex: Stories and Statistics from Australia| location = Cambridge, UK| accessdate = 2016-02-02| date = February 2016| url = http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160914152729/http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| archivedate = 2016-09-14| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Intersex in history}}
In European societies, [[Roman law]], post-classical [[Canon law]], and later [[Common law]], referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. Under Roman law, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Roller, "The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest," ''Gender &amp; History'' 9.3 (1997), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th-century ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', C. 4, q. 2 et 3, c. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://geschichte.digitale-sammlungen.de/decretum-gratiani/kapitel/dc_chapter_1_1585 | title = Decretum Gratiani (Kirchenrechtssammlung) | work = Bayerische StaatsBibliothek ([[Bavarian State Library]]) | date = February 5, 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220084841/http://geschichte.digitale-sammlungen.de/decretum-gratiani/kapitel/dc_chapter_1_1585 | archivedate = December 20, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raming"&gt;{{cite book | title = A History of Women and Ordination | last1 = Raming | first1 = Ida | last2 = Macy | first2 = Gary | last3 = Bernard J | first3 = Cook | publisher = [[Scarecrow Press]] | date = 2004 | page = 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of common law, the 16th Century ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile."&lt;ref&gt;E Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Institutes 8.a.

Intersex scholar [[Morgan Holmes]] states that much early anthropological material on non-European cultures described gender systems with more than two categories as "primitive", but also that subsequent analysis of third sexes and genders is simplistic or romanticized:&lt;ref name="Holmes2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Holmes |date=July 2004 |title=Locating Third Sexes |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_08/article_03.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626063213/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_08/article_03.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-26 |journal=Transformations Journal |publisher= |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1444-3775 |accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|much of the existing work on cultural systems that incorporate a 'third sex' portray simplistic visions in which societies with more than two sex/gender categories are cast as superior to those that divide the world into just two. I argue that to understand whether a system is more or less oppressive than another we have to understand how it treats its various members, not only its 'thirds'... ''recognition'' of third sexes and third genders is not equal to ''valuing'' the presence of those who were neither male nor female,  and often hinges on the explicit devaluation of women&lt;ref name="Holmes2004" /&gt;}}

In recent years, civil society organization and human rights institutions have raised issues relating to legal recognition.

== Intersex rights ==
{{main article|Intersex human rights}}
Research indicates a growing consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal—if relatively rare—forms of human biology,&lt;ref name=Zderic&gt;{{cite book|first=  Stephen |last = Zderic|title=Pediatric gender assignment : a critical reappraisal ; [proceedings from a conference ... in Dallas in the spring of 1999 which was entitled "pediatric gender assignment - a critical reappraisal"]|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Acad. / Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0306467593}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on medical practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]],&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223221/http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015158/http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | archivedate = 4 July 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide: "Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society."&lt;ref name="ghattas" /&gt;

In 2015, an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'' by the [[Council of Europe]] highlighted several areas of concern, including legal recognition:

* unnecessary "normalising" treatment of intersex persons, and unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics.
* unnecessary medicalisation is said to also impact a right to life.
* inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law; facilitating access to justice and reparations.
* access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support.
* legal recognition, including respect for self-determination in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = [[Council of Europe]]| last2 = Commissioner for Human Rights| title = Human rights and intersex people, Issue Paper| date = April 2015| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH/IssuePaper(2015)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160106203349/https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH%2FIssuePaper%282015%291&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original| archivedate = 2016-01-06| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal recognition ==

According to the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Asia Pacific Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and thirdly, while opt in schemes may help some individuals, legal recognition is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

=== Gender identities ===

Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl. Differentiation and dimorphism of gender identity from conception to maturity |year=1972|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=USA |isbn=0-8018-1405-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Domurat Dreger |first=Alice |title=Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex |year=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=USA |isbn=0-674-00189-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maranon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marañón |first=Gregorio |title=Los estados intersexuales en la especie humana |year=1929 |publisher=Morata |location=Madrid }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8.5-20% of persons with intersex conditions may experience [[gender dysphoria]], distress or discomfort as a result of the [[sex]] and [[gender]] they were [[Sex assignment|assigned at birth]].&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P. S.| year = 2012 | title = Gender dysphoria associated with disorders of sex development | url = | journal = Nat. Rev.

Like non-intersex people, some intersex individuals may not identify themselves as either exclusively female or exclusively male. Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oiiaudemo"&gt;{{Citation| last = Organisation Intersex International Australia| title = Demographics| date = July 28, 2016| url = https://oii.org.au/demographics/| accessdate = 2016-09-30| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161001215740/https://oii.org.au/demographics/| archivedate = October 1, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At birth, 52% of persons in the study were assigned female, and 41% were assigned male.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016" /&gt;

Research has also shown gender identities of intersex individuals to be independent of [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 34| issue = 2| pages = 199–211| last = Diamond| first = Milton| title = Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation in Children with Traumatized or Ambiguous Genitalia| journal = The Journal of Sex Research| date = 1997| jstor = 3813570| doi = 10.1080/00224499709551885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex advocate [[Morgan Carpenter]] states that intersex should not be reduced to a gender identity issue; "intersex as identity is polymorphic, but asserts the dignity of stigmatised embodiment."&lt;ref name="Carpenter2016" /&gt; [[Dan Christian Ghattas]] states that "People who do not have an intersex body and want to use ‘intersex’ to describe their gender identity, should be aware of the fact that, unfortunately, they are actually making intersex human rights violations less visible."&lt;ref name="Ghattas2015" /&gt;

=== Access to identification documents ===
Currently, depending on the jurisdiction, access to any birth certificate may be an issue,&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; including a birth certificate with a sex marker,&lt;ref name="adv-de"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany’s-third-gender-law-fails-equality | first = Hida | last = Viloria | work = The Advocate | title = Op-ed: Germany’s Third-Gender Law Fails on Equality | date = November 6, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170103013558/http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany%E2%80%99s-third-gender-law-fails-equality | archivedate = January 3, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the absence of surgical requirements.&lt;ref name="justicia2017a" /&gt;

In 2014 a [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenyan]] court ordered its government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born with ambiguous genitalia, necessary to allow the child to attend school and obtain a national identity document.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Many intersex persons in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]] are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents, despite a birth registration law that permits intersex minors to change assignment.&lt;ref name="sipd2016"&gt;{{Cite| last = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Baseline Survey on Intersex Realities in East Africa - Specific Focus on Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 submission by Justicia Intersex and Zwischengeschlecht to the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|United Nations Committee Against Torture]] identified two [[Intersex rights in Argentina|Argentinian]] cases of children denied birth certificates without parental consent to irreversible medical interventions.&lt;ref name="justicia2017a"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Justicia Intersex| last2 = Zwischengeschlecht.org| author2-link = Zwischengeschlecht| title = NGO Report to the 6th and 7th Periodic Report of Argentina on the Convention Against Torture (CAT)| location = Buenos Aires| date = March 2017| url = http://intersex.shadowreport.org/public/2017-CAT-Justicia-Intersex-Zwischengeschlecht-IGM.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180104121215/http://intersex.shadowreport.org/public/2017-CAT-Justicia-Intersex-Zwischengeschlecht-IGM.pdf| archivedate = 2018-01-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Access to the same rights as other men and women ===

The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of [[National Human Rights Institutions]] states that:
{{quotation|Recognition before the law means having legal personhood and the legal protections that flow from that. For intersex people, this is neither primarily nor solely about amending birth registrations or other official documents. Firstly, it is about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170115144950/http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/| archivedate = 2017-01-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Accessing the same rights as other men and women supposes the elimination of stigma and discrimination on grounds of [[sex characteristics]], and [[Intersex human rights|rights to physical integrity and freedom from torture and ill-treatment]].

The Asia Pacific Forum also highlights access to sport and concerns with [[Sex verification in sports|sex verification]] policies.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; Sex testing began at the [[1966 European Athletics Championships]] in response to suspicion that several of the best women athletes from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] were actually men.&lt;ref name = "EvesRib"&gt;R. Peel, ''"Eve’s Rib - Searching for the Biological Roots of Sex Differences"'', [[Crown Publishers]], [[New York City]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-517-59298-3}}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Olympics, testing was introduced in 1968. Initially, sex verification took the form of physical examinations. It subsequently evolved into chromosome testing, and later testosterone testing. Reports have shown how elite women athletes with intersex conditions have been humiliated, excluded, and suffered human rights violations as a result of sex verification testing.&lt;ref name="bmj2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/bmj.g2926| issn = 1756-1833| volume = 348| issue = apr28 9| pages = –2926–g2926| last1 = Jordan-Young| first1 = R.

=== Changing identification documents ===

Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

Some countries have the gender self-determination legal model such as [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Malta]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Norway]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Ireland]] permit changes to sex classifications via simple administrative methods.&lt;ref name="guar-irl" /&gt; Some countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, some jurisdictions in both Australia and the United States and many European countries only permit changes to sex classifications following [[sexual reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; Other countries do not permit intersex people to change sex assignment at all or, such as the [[Intersex rights in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], only by declaring that they are transgender and obtaining a diagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="pink-uk" /&gt;

The [[Open Society Foundations]] published a report, ''License to Be Yourself'' in May 2014, documenting "some of the world's most progressive and rights-based laws and policies" enabling changes to gender markers on official documents.&lt;ref name=License&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrne |first=Jack |author-link= |title=License to Be Yourself |year=2014 |publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]] |location=New York |isbn=9781940983103 |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/license-be-yourself |accessdate=2014-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108082144/http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/license-be-yourself |archivedate=2015-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report comments on the recognition of third classifications, stating:
{{quote|
From a rights-based perspective, third sex / gender options should be voluntary... Those identifying as a third sex / gender should have the same rights as those identifying as male or female.&lt;ref name="License" /&gt;}}

The Council of Europe acknowledged concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper, stating that these may lead to "forced outings" and "lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex."&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; The Issue Paper argues that "further reflection on non-binary legal identification is necessary":

{{quotation|[[Mauro Cabral]], [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] (GATE) Co-Director, indicated that any recognition outside the “F”/”M” dichotomy needs to be adequately planned and executed with a human rights point of view, noting that: “People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker”&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions recognised the right of individuals to non-binary or third sex classifications, but stated that, "creating a third, separate category for the registration of people born with an intersex trait ... would risk segregating and potentially stigmatising intersex people. It would also remove their right to determine their own sex or gender."&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

In March 2017, an [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australian]] and [[Intersex rights in New Zealand|Aotearoa/New Zealand]] community statement called for an end to legal classification of sex, stating that legal third classifications, like binary classifications, were based on [[structural violence]] and failed to respect diversity and a "right to self-determination".&lt;ref name="darlington2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="copland2017ds" /&gt;

=== Ending official classification by sex or gender ===

The statement of the Third [[International Intersex Forum]] calls for an end to official classification by sex or gender on identification documents. [[Dan Christian Ghattas]] of [[OII Europe]] states that, "providing the options for all parents to leave the sex/ gender entry open for their child would promote the equality of all sexes and genders".&lt;ref name="Ghattas2015"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/how_to_be_a_great_intersex_ally_a_toolkit_for_ngos_and_decision_makers_december_2015_updated.pdf | title = Standing up for the human rights of intersex people – how can you help? | last1 = Ghattas | first1 = Dan Christian | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[ILGA-Europe]] | date = 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160327095320/http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/how_to_be_a_great_intersex_ally_a_toolkit_for_ngos_and_decision_makers_december_2015_updated.pdf | archivedate = 2016-03-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Inter of [[Intersex rights in Mexico|Mexican]] intersex organization [[Brújula Intersexual]], imagines a society where sex or gender classifications are removed from birth certificates and other official identification documents,&lt;ref name="iad2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Inter| first = Laura| title = The situation of the intersex community in Mexico| work = [[Intersex Day]]| accessdate = 2017-05-19| date = October 3, 2016| url = http://intersexday.org/en/situation-mexico/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170523214331/http://intersexday.org/en/situation-mexico/| archivedate = May 23, 2017| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morgan Carpenter]] of [[OII Australia]] states that, "the removal of sex and gender, like race and religion, from official documentation" is "a more universal, long-term policy goal".&lt;ref name="Carpenter2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.rhm.2016.06.003| issn = 0968-8080| volume = 24| issue = 47| pages = 74–84| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| authorlink = Morgan Carpenter | title = The human rights of intersex people: addressing harmful practices and rhetoric of change| journal = [[Reproductive Health Matters]] | date = May 2016 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhm.2016.06.003|accessdate = 2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Sex and gender distinction}}
Distinctions between sex and gender are lost in many official or legal documents,&lt;ref name="ausag" /&gt; and also online.

=== Malta declaration ===
[[File:Third International Intersex Forum.jpg|thumb|300px|Participants at the third [[International Intersex Forum]], Malta, in December 2013]]
{{main article|Malta declaration (International Intersex Forum)|International Intersex Forum}}
The [[Malta declaration (International Intersex Forum)|Malta declaration]] by the Third International Intersex Forum, in 2013, called for infants and children to be assigned male or female, on the understanding that later identification may differ:

{{quotation|
* To register intersex children as females or males, with the awareness that, like all people, they may grow up to identify with a different sex or gender.
* To ensure that sex or gender classifications are amendable through a simple administrative procedure at the request of the individuals concerned. All adults and capable minors should be able to choose between female (F), male (M), non-binary or multiple options. In the future, as with race or religion, sex or gender should not be a category on birth certificates or identification documents for anybody. (Third [[International Intersex Forum#Third Forum, Malta, November–December 2013|International Intersex Forum]])&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;}}

The LDP has near continuously been in power since its foundation in 1955—a period called the [[1955 System]]—with the exception of a period between 1993 and 1994, and again from 2009 to 2012. In the [[Japanese general election, 2012|2012 election]] it regained control of government. It holds 291 seats in the lower house and 121 seats in the upper house, with the [[Komeito]] the governing coalition has the supermajority in both houses.

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:LDP launching conventin.jpg|thumb|Launching convention, 15 November 1955]]
The LDP was formed in 1955 as a merger between two of Japan's political parties, the {{nihongo|[[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]]|自由党|Jiyutō|1945–1955, led by [[Shigeru Yoshida]]}} and the {{nihongo|[[Democratic Party (Japan, 1954)|Japan Democratic Party]]|日本民主党|Nihon Minshutō|1954–1955, led by [[Ichirō Hatoyama]]}}, both right-wing conservative parties, as a united front against the then popular {{Nihongo|Japan Socialist Party|日本社会党|Nipponshakaitō}}, now {{Nihongo|[[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]]|社会民主党|Shakaiminshutō}}. The party won the following elections, and Japan's first conservative government with a majority was formed by 1955. It would hold majority government until 1993.

The LDP began with reforming [[Foreign relations of Japan|Japan's international relations]], ranging from entry into the [[United Nations]], to establishing diplomatic ties with the [[Soviet Union]]. Its leaders in the 1950s also made the LDP the main government party, and in all the elections of the 1950s, the LDP won the majority vote, with the only other opposition coming from the [[left-wing politics]], made up of the Japan Socialist Party and the [[Japanese Communist Party]].

From the 1950s through the 1970s, the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] spent millions of dollars attempting to influence elections in Japan to favor the LDP against more leftist parties such as the Socialists and the Communists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=C.I.A.

===1960s to 1990s===
For the majority of the 1960s, the LDP (and Japan) were led by [[Eisaku Satō]], beginning with the hosting of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, and ending in 1972 with Japanese neutrality in the [[Vietnam War]] and with the beginning of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]. By the end of the 1970s, the LDP went into its decline, where even though it held the reins of government many scandals plagued the party, while the opposition (now joined with the [[Kōmeitō (1962–98)|Komeito (Former)]]) gained momentum.

In 1976, in the wake of the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]], a handful of younger LDP Diet members broke away and established their own party, the [[New Liberal Club]] (Shin Jiyu Kurabu). A decade later, however, it was reabsorbed by the LDP.

By the late 1970s, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, and the Komeito along with the international community used major pressure to have Japan switch diplomatic ties from the [[Republic of China]] to the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. During the 1980s, the LDP was responsible for Japan's unprecedented economic growth, and the successful economy.

[[File:Jimin Honbu at Tokyo in 2018.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the LDP in Tokyo.]]
By the early 1990s, the LDP's nearly four decades in power allowed it to establish a highly stable process of policy formation. This process would not have been possible if other parties had secured parliamentary majorities. LDP strength was based on an enduring, although not unchallenged, coalition of big business, small business, agriculture, professional groups, and other interests. [[Civil service of Japan|Elite bureaucrats]] collaborated closely with the party and interest groups in drafting and implementing policy. In a sense, the party's success was a result not of its internal strength but of its weakness. It lacked a strong, nationwide organization or consistent ideology with which to attract voters. Its leaders were rarely decisive, charismatic, or popular. But it functioned efficiently as a locus for matching interest group money and votes with bureaucratic power and expertise. This arrangement resulted in corruption, but the party could claim credit for helping to create economic growth and a stable, middle-class Japan.

===Out of power===
But by 1993, the end of the miracle economy and other reasons (e.g. [[Recruit scandal]]) led to the LDP losing its majority in [[Japanese general election, 1993|that year's general election]].

Seven opposition parties—including several formed by LDP dissidents—formed a government headed by LDP dissident [[Morihiro Hosokawa]] of the [[Japan New Party]].  However, the LDP was still far and away the largest party in the House of Representatives, with well over 200 seats; no other party crossed the 80-seat mark.

In 1994, the Socialist Party and [[New Party Sakigake]] left the ruling coalition, joining the LDP in the opposition. The remaining members of the coalition tried to stay in power as a makeshift minority government, but this failed when the LDP and the Socialists, bitter rivals for 40 years, formed a majority coalition.  The new government was dominated by the LDP, but it allowed a Socialist to occupy the Prime Minister's chair until 1996, when the LDP's [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]] took over.

===1996–2009===
In the [[Japanese general election, 1996|1996 election]], the LDP made some gains, but was still 12 seats short of a majority.  However, no other party could possibly form a government, and Hashimoto formed a solidly LDP minority government.  Through a series of floor-crossings, the LDP regained its majority within a year.

The party was practically unopposed until 1998, when the opposition [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|Democratic Party of Japan]] was formed. This marked the beginning of the opposing parties' gains in momentum, especially in the 2003 and 2004 Parliamentary Elections, that wouldn't slow for another 12 years.

In the dramatically paced 2003 House of Representatives elections, the LDP won 237 seats, while the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|DPJ]] won 177 seats. In the 2004 [[House of Councillors]] elections, in the seats up for grabs, the LDP won 49 seats and the DPJ 50, though in all seats (including those uncontested) the LDP still had a total of 114. Because of this electoral loss, former Secretary General [[Shinzō Abe]] turned in his resignation, but Party President Koizumi merely demoted him in rank, and he was replaced by [[Tsutomu Takebe]].

On 10 November 2003, the [[New Conservative Party]] (''Hoshu Shintō'') was absorbed into the LDP, a move which was largely because of the New Conservative Party's poor showing in the 2003 general election.  The LDP formed a coalition with the conservative [[Buddhist]] [[New Komeito]].

After a victory in the [[Japan general election, 2005]], the LDP held an absolute majority in the Japanese [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] and formed a coalition government with the [[New Komeito Party]]. Abe succeeded then-Prime Minister [[Junichirō Koizumi]] as the president of the party on 20 September 2006. The party suffered a major defeat in the election of 2007, however, and lost its majority in the [[House of Councillors|upper house]] for the first time in its history.

The LDP remained the largest party in both houses of the Diet, until 29 July 2007, when the LDP [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 2007|lost its majority in the upper house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/norimitsu_onishi/index.html Norimitsu Onishi] |author2=Yasuko Kamiizumi |author3=Makiko Inoue |title=Premier's Party Suffers Big Defeat in Japan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/world/asia/29cnd-japan.html?ex=1343361600&amp;en=7b98d2dcaceb08e5&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-07-29 |accessdate=2007-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election, 2007|party leadership election]] held on 23 September 2007, the LDP elected [[Yasuo Fukuda]] as its president. Fukuda defeated [[Tarō Asō]] for the post, receiving 330 votes against 197 votes for Aso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Naomi|last=Martig|url=http://voanews.com/english/2007-09-23-voa5.cfm|title=Japan's Ruling Party Chooses New Leader|publisher=VOA News|date=23 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820033055/http://voanews.com/english/2007-09-23-voa5.cfm|archivedate=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20070923dy01.htm "Fukuda wins LDP race / Will follow in footsteps of father as prime minister"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Daily Yomiuri'', September 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  However Fukuda resigned suddenly in September 2008, and Asō became Prime Minister after winning the presidency of the LDP in a 5-way election.

In the [[Japanese general election, 2009|2009 general election]], the LDP was roundly defeated, winning only 118 seats—easily the worst defeat of a sitting government in modern Japanese history, and also the first real transfer of political power in the post-war era.  Accepting responsibility for this severe defeat, Aso announced his resignation as LDP president on election night.  [[Sadakazu Tanigaki]] was elected leader of the party on 28 September 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Sadakazu Tanigaki Elected LDP President {{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/6966/2009/09/28/1781s519095.htm# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310033921/http://english.cri.cn/6966/2009/09/28/1781s519095.htm |archivedate=10 March 2016 |df=dmy }} Retrieved 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; after a three-way race, becoming only the second LDP leader who was not simultaneously prime minister.

===Recent political history===
The party's support continued to decline, with prime ministers changing rapidly, and in the 2009 House of Representatives elections the LDP lost its majority, winning only 118 seats, marking the only time they would be out of the majority other than a brief period in 1993.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8229368.stm|title='Major win' for Japan opposition|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-08-30|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jiji.com/jc/c?g=pol_date1&amp;k=2009083101337|title=衆院党派別得票数・率（比例代表）|publisher=(in Japanese) Jiji|date=2009-08-31}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, numerous party members have left to join other parties or form new ones, including {{Nihongo|[[Your Party]]|みんなの党|Minna no Tō}},{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} the {{Nihongo|[[Sunrise Party of Japan]]|たちあがれ日本|Tachiagare Nippon}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Alex|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2010/04/11/national/ldp-defectors-launch-new-political-party/#.V_x67CQ3BnI|title=LDP defectors launch new political party|publisher=The Japan Times|date=11 April 2010|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the {{Nihongo|[[New Renaissance Party]]|新党改革|Shintō Kaikaku}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} The party had some success in the 2010 House of Councilors election, netting 13 additional seats and denying the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|DPJ]] a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/index.htm|title=House of Councillors The National Diet of Japan|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webtv.sangiin.go.jp/webtv/index.php|title=参議院インターネット審議中継|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDP returned to power with its ally [[New Komeito]] after winning a clear majority in the [[Japanese general election, 2012|lower house general election on 16 December 2012]] after just over three years in opposition.

==Ideology==
The LDP has not espoused a well-defined, unified ideology or [[political philosophy]], due to its long-term government. Its members hold a variety of positions that could be broadly defined as being to the right of the opposition parties. The LDP traditionally identified itself with a number of general goals: rapid, export-based economic growth; close [[United States-Japan relations|cooperation with the United States]] in foreign and defense policies; and several newer issues, such as administrative reform. Administrative reform encompassed several themes: simplification and streamlining of government bureaucracy; [[privatization]] of [[Japanese public corporations|state-owned enterprises]]; and adoption of measures, including [[tax reform]], in preparation for the expected strain on the economy posed by an aging society. Other priorities in the early 1990s included the promotion of a more active and positive role for Japan in the rapidly developing Asia-Pacific region, the internationalization of Japan's economy by the [[liberalization]] and promotion of domestic demand (expected to lead to the creation of a [[High tech|high-technology]] [[information society]]) and the promotion of scientific research. A business-inspired commitment to [[free enterprise]] was tempered by the insistence of important small business and [[Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan|agricultural constituencies]] on some form of [[protectionism]] and [[Subsidy|subsidies]].&lt;ref&gt;The Liberal Democratic Party - {{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/japan/122.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103011921/http://countrystudies.us/japan/122.htm |archivedate=3 November 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the LDP opposes the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"&gt;Inada, Miho; Dvorak, Phred.

''The Wall Street Journal''. 20 September 2013. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{Conservatism sidebar}}
At the apex of the LDP's formal organization is the {{Nihongo|[[#Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party|president]]|総裁|sōsai}}, who can serve three&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/new-rules-give-japans-abe-chance-to-lead-until-2021&lt;/ref&gt; three-year terms (The presidential term was increased from two years to three years in 2002, and from two to three terms in 2017). When the party has a parliamentary majority, the party president is the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]]. The choice of party president is formally that of a party convention composed of [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] members and local LDP figures, but in most cases, they merely approved the joint decision of the most powerful party leaders. To make the system more democratic, Prime Minister [[Takeo Fukuda]] introduced a "primary" system in 1978, which opened the balloting to some 1.5 million LDP members. The process was so costly and acrimonious, however, that it was subsequently abandoned in favor of the old "smoke-filled room" method&amp;nbsp;— so-called in allusion to the notion of closed discussions held in small rooms filled with [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]].

After the party president, the most important LDP officials are the Secretary-General (''kanjicho''), and the chairmen of the LDP Executive Council (''somukaicho'') and of the Policy Affairs Research Council or "PARC" (政務調査会 ''seimu chōsakai'').

The LDP is the most "traditionally Japanese" of the political parties because it relies on a complex network of patron-client (''oyabun-kobun'') relationships on both national and local levels. Nationally, a system of factions in both the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] and the [[House of Councillors]] ties individual Diet members to powerful party leaders. Locally, Diet members have to maintain ''[[koenkai]]'' (local support groups) to keep in touch with public opinion and gain votes and financial backing. The importance and pervasiveness of personal ties between Diet members and faction leaders and between citizens and Diet members gives the party a pragmatic "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" character. Its success depends less on generalized mass appeal than on the so-called ''sanban'' (three "ban"): ''jiban'' (a strong, well-organized constituency), ''kaban'' (a briefcase full of money), and ''kanban'' (prestigious appointment, particularly on the cabinet level).

==Factions==
{{Main article|Factions in the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)}}

==Membership==
	 	
The LDP had over five million party members in 1990. By December 2017 membership had dropped to approximately one million members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |script-title=ja:役員会後　二階幹事長記者会見|publisher=Liberal Democratic Party |date=2018-03-05|url=https://www.jimin.jp/news/press/chief-secretary/136868.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance in national elections until 1993==
{{See also|Elections in Japan}}
Election statistics show that, while the LDP had been able to secure a majority in the twelve House of Representatives elections from May 1958 to February 1990, with only three exceptions (December 1976, October 1979, and December 1983), its share of the popular vote had declined from a high of 57.8 percent in May 1958 to a low of 41.8 percent in December 1976, when voters expressed their disgust with the party's involvement in the [[Lockheed bribery scandals#Japan|Lockheed scandal]]. The LDP vote rose again between 1979 and 1990. Although the LDP won an unprecedented 300 seats in the July 1986 balloting, its share of the popular vote remained just under 50 percent. The figure was 46.2 percent in February 1990. Following the three occasions when the LDP found itself a handful of seats shy of a majority, it was obliged to form alliances with conservative independents and the breakaway New Liberal Club. In a cabinet appointment after the October 1983 balloting, a non-LDP minister, a member of the New Liberal Club, was appointed for the first time. On 18 July 1993, lower house elections, the LDP fell so far short of a majority that it was unable to form a government.

In the upper house, the July 1989 election represented the first time that the LDP was forced into a minority position. In previous elections, it had either secured a majority on its own or recruited non-LDP conservatives to make up the difference of a few seats.

The political crisis of 1988–89 was testimony to both the party's strength and its weakness. In the wake of a succession of issues—the pushing of a highly unpopular [[Consumption tax|consumer tax]] through the Diet in late 1988, the [[Recruit scandal|Recruit insider trading scandal]], which tainted virtually all top LDP leaders and forced the resignation of Prime Minister [[Takeshita Noboru]] in April (a successor did not appear until June), the resignation in July of his successor, [[Uno Sōsuke]], because of a sex scandal, and the poor showing in the upper house election—the media provided the Japanese with a detailed and embarrassing dissection of the political system. By March 1989, popular support for the Takeshita cabinet as expressed in public opinion polls had fallen to 9 percent. Uno's scandal, covered in magazine interviews of a "kiss and tell" [[geisha]], aroused the fury of female voters.

Uno's successor, the eloquent if obscure [[Kaifu Toshiki]], was successful in repairing the party's battered image. By January 1990, talk of the waning of conservative power and a possible socialist government had given way to the realization that, like the Lockheed affair of the mid-1970s, the Recruit scandal did not signal a significant change in who ruled Japan. The February 1990 general election gave the LDP, including affiliated independents, a comfortable, if not spectacular, majority: 275 of 512 total representatives.

In October 1991, Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki failed to attain passage of a political reform bill and was rejected by the LDP, despite his popularity with the electorate. He was replaced as prime minister by [[Miyazawa Kiichi]], a long-time LDP stalwart. Defections from the LDP began in the spring of 1992, when [[Hosokawa Morihiro]] left the LDP to form the [[Japan New Party]]. Later, in the summer of 1993, when the Miyazawa government also failed to pass political reform legislation, thirty-nine LDP members joined the opposition in a no-confidence vote. In the ensuing lower house election, more than fifty LDP members formed the [[Shinseitō]] and the [[New Party Sakigake|Sakigake]] parties, denying the LDP the majority needed to form a government.

==Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party==
With the exception of Yohei Kono and Sadakazu Tanigaki, every {{nihongo|'''President of the LDP'''|自由民主党総裁|Jiyū-Minshutō Sōsai}} has also served as Prime Minister of Japan.

__FORCETOC__

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in Saint Petersburg, Yankovskaya studied ballet between the ages of three- and five-years-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://operawire.com/qa-chicago-opera-theater-music-director-lidiya-yankovskaya-on-future-goals-conducting-and-the-future-of-opera/|title=Q&amp;A: Chicago Opera Theater Music Director Lidiya Yankovskaya on Future Goals, Conducting and the Future of Opera|website=operawire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied music from the age of five, playing piano and singing in the Saint Petersburg Children’s Choir of Radio and Television. She attended performances with her mother regularly, citing a production of [[The Love for Three Oranges|Prokofiev's ''The Love for Three Oranges'']] at the Mariinsky Theater as one of her first experiences with opera.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Out of Russia: A Conversation with Lidiya Yankovskaya|last=Scorca|first=Marc A.|date=|work=Opera America Magazine|access-date=|month=|year=2017|issue=Fall 2017|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the anti-Semitic climate in Russia, Yankovskaya immigrated to the United States with her mother at nine-years-old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They settled in upstate New York, where Yankovskaya attended Hebrew day school.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalsawdust.org/thelog/2017/11/08/meet-the-ns-artist-in-residence-lidiya-yankovskaya-activist-conductor/|title=Meet the NS Artist-in-Residence: Lidiya Yankovskaya, Activist Conductor|work=The Log Journal|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational background ===
Yankovskaya's mother prioritized her musical development, enrolling her daughter at [[Guilderland High School]] in Albany, NY. Yankovskaya also joined the selective private teaching studio of piano duo Vladimir Pleshakov and Elena Winther, and began studying the violin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At 17, she had become concertmaster of Guilderland's orchestra and won the school's concerto competition for a performance of [[Piano Concerto No. 12 (Mozart)|Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 12 (K. 414)]]. During rehearsals, conductor Jeff Herchenroder suggested that Yankovskaya try leading from the piano. She later made her conducting debut at Herchenroder's request, leading the orchestra for the third movement of [[Symphony No. 7 (Dvořák)|Dvořák's Symphony No.7 in D minor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After graduation, Yankovskaya attended [[Vassar College]], where she studied piano, voice, and conducting. She switched her focus from piano performance to conducting during her junior year. Yankovskaya led her own ensemble of approximately 55 instrumentalists and 30 singers in regular performances of contemporary works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Yankovskaya holds a master's degree in conducting from [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2017/05/18/refugee-orchestra-project-spreads-musical-message-inclusion/7slW7KGhCdCqPWMZ3CqAFK/story.html|title=Refugee Orchestra Project spreads a musical message of inclusion - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Career ===
Yankovskaya joined the Boston-based Juventas New Music Ensemble as an associate conductor and served as their music director between 2010-2017. Also taking on the role of artistic director in 2014, she sought to present collaborative, interdisciplinary works ranging from opera and ballet to puppetry, aerial dance, and robotic instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/670428656|title=The Exquisite Corpse|last=Juventas New Music Ensemble|first=|date=2010-09-19|website=|publisher=The Boston Conservatory|language=en|type=CD|oclc=670428656|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also in the Greater Boston area, she has served as the music director of Commonwealth Lyric Theater, music director of Lowell House Opera at [[Harvard University]] (2011-2015), and artistic director of the Boston New Music Festival.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/27/yankovskaya-portrait-lowell-opera/|title=Portrait of an Artist: Lidiya V.

In 2015, Yankovskaya was one of six conductors selected to join the [[Dallas Opera]]'s inaugural Hart Institute for Women Conductors and received honorable mention from [[Marin Alsop]]'s Taki Concordia Conducting Fellowship.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Social and political involvement ==
During the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee crisis]], Yankovskaya started a grassroots performance ensemble that would become known as the [[Refugee Orchestra Project]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The first performance by the ensemble took place on May 10, 2016 in Cambridge, MA. Growing interest on social media led to concerts in Boston, New York City, and Washington, DC. The orchestra joined the National Sawdust artists-in-residence for the 2017-18 season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16679">This is a '''list of countries by past [[Military budget|military expenditure]]''', starting 1988.

==Methodology==
Figures for the tables below are provided by the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) database. They are presented in millions of [[United States dollar]]s in current prices, converted at the exchange rate for the given year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex Stockholm International Peace Research Institute: Military Expenditure Database], sipri.org, Accessed 9 July 2016 (Download data for all countries from 1988-2015 as an Excel spreadsheet.)&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no data for a particular year, a cell if left blank. Although the database includes statistics for over 150 countries, per [https://www.sipri.org/about/terms-and-conditions SIPRI's Terms and Condition] permission is needed to directly reproduce more than 10% of the database.

== Austria ==

When Hitler’s Germany started the Anschluss with Austria in 1938, one of the first casualties was the looting of the public and private libraries of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Harclerode, Peter and Brendan Pittaway, 2000, ''The Lost Masters: World War II and the Looting of Europe’s Treasurehouses''. Pages 9–15, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

* Of the library of the [[University of Graz]], about 100 manuscripts and 4,500 volumes of academic publications, which had been stored for safe keeping in [[Steiermark]], were lost as a result of plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeven, Hans van der; Van Albada, Joan, 1996, “Memory of the World: Lost Memory: Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the 20th Century.” Pages 7–15. They comment from: M. Hirschegger, in Liber Bulletin. Volume 32/33(1989), pages 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1938 the Nazis formed a Bücherverwertungsstelle which was a collection and distribution center for books stolen from the personal libraries, publishing companies and bookstores of Jews and other people whose possessions were declared in forfeit to the states for political or ethnic reasons. These books contained 644,000 volumes, of which 410,000 volumes were destroyed. This center was directed by [[Albert Paust]], who previously had been the director of the [[Deutsche Bucherei]] in [[Leipzig]]. Libraries in Austria could choose desired titles from this center for their own book collections.&lt;ref name="lootedart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/MFVALY48822|title=The Nazi looting of books in Austria and their partial restitution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The two big Vienna Jewish libraries, the library of the [[Israelitische Kultusgemeinde]] (IKG) and of the [[Israelitisch-theologische Lehranstalt]] (ITLA), were transferred separately to the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] (RSHA) in Berlin, where a major part of them was burned in an air raid in 1943."&lt;ref name="lootedart.com"/&gt;
* “The library of the [[Weiner Arbeiterskammer]] (Council of the Trade Unions) had a very valuable collection of material in socialism, communism, trade unions and related fields, but when the Germans took over in 1938 they broke up the entire collection and moved most of the material to Germany. The rumor went around that collection was to form the nucleus for a library of an international labor office to be established under “the New Order”. However, the collection disappeared altogether and has not been recovered yet. The library in Vienna opened its doors again in 1945 with its holdings reduced to a minimum.”&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Elizabeth M. 1949. “Vienna’s Libraries Desire U.S. Books.” Library Journal. May 15, 1945. Page 789.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The National Library had been instrumental in of taking the books and other possessions of Jewish citizens, and also other victims of the Nazi regime. It was estimated that about 195,000 books and other objects had been stolen from politically and racially persecuted victims, and unlawfully added to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/geraubte_buecher/about_eng.htm Austrian National Library]. 2003. “Looted Books: The Austrian National Library confronts its Nazi Past.”&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the Austrian National Library in Vienna stated that 32,937 books, manuscripts maps and other objects had been restored to their lawful owners.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Margot. 2003. “Provenance Research and Restitution.” Bericht der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek an die Kommission für Provenienzforschung (Provenienzbericht). Wien: Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Austrian National Library in Vienna had a number of books stolen from private libraries stored on site. After the war, these were returned without problems. These were the libraries of [[Moriz von Kuffner]], [[Oskar Ladner]], [[Viktor von Ephrussi]], [[Stefan Auspitz]], [[Rudolf Gutmann]] and [[Alphonse Rothschild]].&lt;ref name="lootedart.com"/&gt;
* A review of the library situation in Austria at the end of the war was prompted by the [[American Library Association]]. "“Vienna was heavily bombed and many of its famous buildings were badly damaged or altogether destroyed. But the library buildings were practically untouched. All functioned throughout the war, with only a short interruption when all facilities broke down in the Spring of 1945. But the conditions have suffered a great deal. There was at first a purge of books when the Nazis took over in 1938, and then all through the German occupation restrictions on new acquisitions and complete isolation from the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Elizabeth M. 1949. “Vienna’s Libraries Desire U.S. Books.” ''Library Journal''. May 15, 1945. Pages 788–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Belarus ==
Two hundred libraries in Belarus suffered damage during the war. T. Roschina calculated that 83 per cent of the libraries' collection were plundered, stolen or destroyed. 600,000 of those volumes were subsequently found in Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland after the war, but a million other volumes, including rare and old printed volumes, have not been returned.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Maldis. “The Tragic Fate of Belarusian Museum and Library Collections During the Second World War.” Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belorussian libraries were plundered of 95% of their holding.&lt;ref&gt;Hiller, Marlene P. 1997. “The Documentation of War Losses in the Former Soviet Republics.” In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. “Spoils of War.” Page 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In Smolensk, "...the German fascist invaders plundered and destroyed the most valuable collections in the museums. They desecrated and burned down ancient monuments; they destroyed schools and institutes, libraries, and sanatoriums. The report also mentions the fact that in April 1943, the Germans needed rubble to pave the roads. For this purpose, they blew up the intermediate school. The Germans burned down all the libraries of the city and 22 schools; 646,000 volumes perished in the library fires."&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/02-21-46.asp Nuremberg Trial Proceedings]. Volume 8, 64th Day, Thursday, February 21, 1946. Morning Session.&lt;/ref&gt;

The “Smolensk holdings” of five hundred files of the Communist Party Archives ended up in the National Archives in Washington, DC, along with manuscripts of the Belarusian poet [[Vassily Koval]]. The papers of the Polish folklorist and ethnographer, Professor [[Józef Obrebski]], ended up in the archives of the [[University of Massachusetts]]. The [[Khreptovitch Library]] was temporarily removed to Kyiv (Kiev) during the war. A Dutch Trophy collection was given to the Soviet Union and returned to the Netherlands. Part of the library collection of Petlura was returned to the Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Maldis. “The Tragic Fate of Belarusian Museum and Library Collections During the Second World War.” Page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

* “The occupants looted the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]] housing extremely rare collections of historic documents and books, and destroyed hundreds of schools, clubs, and theaters in Belorussia (White Russia). From the [[Pevlovsk Palace]] in the town of [[Slutzk]] the extremely valuable palace furniture, made by outstanding craftsmen of the 18th century, was removed to Germany.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/02-08-46.asp Nuremberg Trial Proceedings. Volume 7. Fifty-fourth Day, Friday, February 8, 1946.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many of the books returned to Belarus were found in Nazi storage areas in [[Silesia]] at the end of the war, but were mixed up with other books from different countries. Nevertheless, 54 railroad boxcars of books were sent by the Soviet Trophy Brigades (part of the [[Extraordinary State Commission]]) to Minsk. These boxcars carried 1.2 million volumes the Nazis plundered, including 500,000 books taken from French Jewish families and institutions. The books from France were stored in Silesia alongside hundreds of thousands of books stolen from Belarus, and this is why so many French books ended up in Minsk. “According to Nazi records, a squad descended on Professor [Victor] Basch’s Paris apartment in January 1941 and took 17 cases of books. The professor had already left, and ended up in Lyon, where he and his wife were executed in 1944.”&lt;ref&gt;LaGnado, Lucette. 2017. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-the-trail-of-books-stolen-by-the-nazis-1501687602 “On the Trail of Nazi Looted Books: Scholars trace how half a million books stolen from Jewish owners in France During World War II ended up in Minsk.”] Wall Street Journal. August 3, 2017. Page A9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Belgium ==
The Nazis assumed control over libraries and information. Concerning the confiscation of library books, one military order stated: “The Army groups and their designees may demand information from any person concerning economic data, supplies, consumption, storage, purchase and sale of goods, products and wares of every kind. They may demand books, papers, receipts, and samples be shown, and that anyone required to furnish information appear in person… Information shall be given free of charge.”&lt;ref&gt;Lemkin, Raphael. 1944. Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. Page 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Brussels. The contents of the communist bookshop OBLA, Brussels, were sent by the Nazis to [[Racibórz]], Poland.&lt;ref name="Lust, Jacques 1997. Page 59"&gt;Lust, Jacques. 1997. “The Spoils of War Removed from Belgium During World War II.” In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. “Spoils of War.” Page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brussels. The records of the International Federation for Housing and Town Planning were confiscated and brought to Germany.&lt;ref name="Lust, Jacques 1997. Page 59"/&gt;
* Jesuit convent in [[Enghien]] had 200 crates of books removed by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] in 1941. Concerning this library and the École des Hautes Études mentioned below, the Germans said, “Both institutions were considered outposts of French culture on Flemish soil and unfriendly to Nazism.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Grimsted, P.K. Returned from Russia. Pages 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt; The archives and library of the international Jesuit college at Enghien, which was sent to the “Zentrale der anti-Deutschland speziell anti-National-Sozialistischen Information” (“Center for anti-German and anti-National Socialist Information”)&lt;ref name="Lust, Jacques 1997. Page 59"/&gt;
* Ghent. [[École des Hautes Études]] in [[Ghent]] had 56 crates of books confiscated by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The library of Niko Gunzburg (1882-1984) of history, law and Jewish culture, were confiscated by the ERR in January 1941, and shipped to Berlin in February 1941 in ten crates. [[Niko Gunzburg]] was a noted professor of law at the [[University of Ghent]], was a leading member of the Jewish community, a prominent Mason, and he was also a protest-activist against National Socialism in Belgium. Of his large library, only 200 books were returned after the war."&lt;ref&gt;Grimsted, Patricia Kennedy. Returned from Russia. Pages 217-218.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Library of Louvain, 1940 (2).jpg|thumb|The burnt out remains of the Library of Louvain, circa 1940]]
* Liege. “Two remarkable photographic studies of the treatment of libraries by Germans shows what happened to the University of Liége in Belgium and the [[Polish Library in Paris]]. Books have been taken away- stolen, burned, dispersed- statuary lies in heaps of rubble on the floor, wainscoting and decorative woodwork have been pulled from their walls to be hacked to pieces, walls themselves have been destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Kenneth R. and Kipp, Laurence J. 1947. “Books- Agents of War and Peace.” The Scientific Monthly. Volume 64 (5), May 1947, page 429.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Louvain. Library of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]] (900,000 volumes, 800 manuscripts, all [[incunabula]], and 200 prints of old masters lost; 300,000 books, manuscripts and incunabula were destroyed in World War I too) In May 1940, the stacks were completely burned down, as a result of German artillery fire. About 900,000 volumes, 800 manuscripts, all incunabula, and 200 prints of old masters were lost.&lt;ref name="Lemkin, Raphael 1944. Pages 319-320"&gt;Lemkin, Raphael. 1944. Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. Pages 319-320.&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of World War I, Belgium libraries were re-stocked with books from collections in defeated Germany and donations from the government, private citizens and other institutions of the United States. However, it was believed the Germans attacked the library because of a Latin inscription that was proposed for the library balcony, but never placed on the balcony: “Furore Teutonico Diruta, Dono Americano Restituta” (“Destroyed by the fury of the Germans, restored by the generosity of the Americans”).&lt;ref&gt;Battles. Library: An Unquiet History. Pages 156-163.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public Library of Tournay (destroyed)&lt;ref name="Lemkin, Raphael 1944. Pages 319-320"/&gt;

Some of the captured library loot was returned to Belgium by the US Government after the war. A photograph in the [[Offenbach Archival Depot]] records says in its caption, “1st cases of Belgium items being prepared for shipment. Inspected by Belgium Restitution officer, Lt. Raymond and Capt. [[Seymour Pomrenze]].”&lt;ref name="Pomrenze, Seymour p 260"&gt;Pomrenze, Seymour. The records of the Offenbach Collecting Point for books and library collections are in the Ardelia Hall Collection, Boxes 250-262, OMGUS, Record Group 260, National Archives at College Park, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

== China ==
“According to the statistics of 1936 compiled by the Chinese Libraries Association, on the eve of the Japanese invasion there were 4,747 libraries in all throughout China, including independent libraries, school libraries, institutional libraries and county and municipal libraries. But by 1943, however, following the Japanese invasion and occupation, the number of libraries declined to 940. Four-fifths of the libraries were either destroyed or looted. Before the war, there were approximately 25 million volumes housed in the various libraries, but after the war the number was reduced to 15 million volumes. 10 million volumes, or forty percent of the books, were lost in the intervening years… Although some 158,873 volumes have been returned to China in the intervening years, it constitutes 6 percent of the total number taken, i.e., 2,742,108 volumes. The major portion has not been returned.”&lt;ref&gt;Li, Peter (editor). 2003. Japanese War Crimes: The Search for Justice. Page 281, 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the rare books looted by the Japanese from Chinese libraries were sold to collectors, according to [[Frederic D. Schultheis]].&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Margaret C. 1984. “Safekeeping of the National Peiping Library’s Rare Chinese Books at the Library of Congress, 1941-1965.” Journal of Library History. Page 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Czechoslovakia ==
In 1935, there were 17,148 public, school and university libraries in Czechoslovakia, having a book stock of 8,528,744 volumes. Many of these items were confiscated by the Germans, especially any Czech books dealing with geography, biography or history. Works by any Czech writers were taken away, many burned, most others taken directly to the paper pulp mills. Special libraries were devastated, and suffered a loss of about 2,000,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Zivny, Ladislav. 1946. “Czechoslovak Libraries During theWar and After.” Page 877.&lt;/ref&gt;

“Czechoslovak Libraries after the Munich Pact… Soon afterwards all the Czech books dealing with geography, biography, and especially history disappeared… After being confiscated, many of these were burned, whole collections totally destroyed or taken away to Germany….”&lt;ref&gt;Stubbings, Hilda Urén. Blitzkrieg and Books: British and European Libraries As Casualties of World War II. Bloomington (Ind.): Rubena press, 1992. Page 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official notices of censorship and destruction of Czech nationalist and ethnic literature were given. A decree of the autumn of 1942 ordered all university libraries to hand over all early printed Czech works and first editions to the Germans. The collections in the National Museum were pillaged; and the Modern Art Gallery, containing a unique collection of Czech art of the 19th and 20th centuries with some precious specimens of foreign (mainly French) art, was closed. The entire political literature of the free republic, as well as the works of the participants in the Czech revival of the 18th and 19th centuries, were withdrawn. The books of Jewish authors were prohibited, as well as those of politically unreliable writers. The Germans withdrew the Czech classics, as well as the works of the 15th century reformer [[John Hus]], of [[Alois Jirásek]], the author of historical novels, the poet Victor Dyck, Karel Čapek, Vladislav Vančura and others. Thus the Hitlerites destroyed the national culture of the peoples of Czechoslovakia, plundered and pillaged works of art, literature, and science. It can be seen as gruesome precedence allowing communist regime, alongside with Soviet ocuppants post 1948 - 1968 respectively, to withhold parts of the seminal cultural heritage for generations. &lt;ref&gt;Nuremberg Trial Proceedings.

== Italy ==
Italian libraries suffered damage as a result of allied and German air raids. More than 20 Municipal libraries were destroyed and many public libraries suffered the same fate. It has been estimated that almost 2 million printed works and 39,000 manuscripts were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeven, Hans van der; Van Albada, Joan, 1996, “Memory of the World: Lost Memory: Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the 20th Century.”&lt;/ref&gt;

* Parma: [[Biblioteca Palatina, Parma|Bibiloteca Palatina]] (suffered damage from an air raid)
* Rome: After the German occupations of Rome in 1943, [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] (ERR) officers inspected the contents of the Roman Synagogue’s two great libraries, the ''Collegio Rabbinico Italiano'' and ''[[Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica]]'', which contained extraordinary collections gathered over the 2,000 year history of Jewish life in Rome. They demanded the libraries’ catalogs; just days before the first deportation of Roman Jews to Auschwitz, two specially ordered railcars destined for Rosenberg’s institute in Frankfurt were loaded with ten thousand books from these libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew. 2003. Library: An Unquiet History. Page 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rome: [[Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute of Art History]]. Two archaeological libraries, the Hertziana Library of History and Art, and the German Archaeological Institute’s library of the history, topography, art and customs of ancient Rome, were removed from Rome and taken to Germany by the Nazis. At the end of the war, the two library collections were discovered in two Austrian salt mines packed away in 1,985 wooden cases. The German Library’s collection was unharmed, but some of the Hertziana collection and the card catalog were damaged by water when part of the mine flooded. They were returned to Rome, where they became part of the Gallery of Modern Art, where both collections will be in the care of the new International Union for the study of Archaeology, Art and History in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;“Two Roman Libraries Regained from the Nazis.” 1946. New York Times. February 3, 1946. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; One officer of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] program, afterwards wrote about his experiences in the [[Kammergrafen]], the largest of the mine caverns and the most remote in the [[Alt Aussee]], with the Biblioteca Hertziana. “The records listed six thousand pictures... and the books and manuscripts of the biblioteca Herziana [sic] in Rome- one of the greatest historical libraries in the world. Kammergrafen was quality and quantity combined, for here had been stored the collections for Linz.”&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Thomas C. 1946. Salt Mines and Castles. Pages 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* National Library of Turin (heavily damaged) Turin: The National Library was seriously damage by an air raid in December 1942.

About 2 million printed works and 39,000 manuscripts lost.

After the war, many of the major collections looted from Italy were identified by the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives service of the American military government and returned to their owners. The [[Collegio Rabbinico Italiano]], the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]], and the [[Deutsche Historische Bibliothek Rom]] were all returned, although not all were intact, to their owners in Italy. “These last two collections were seized by Hitler with the idea of re-establishing them in Germany.”&lt;ref name="Posté, Leslie 1948"&gt;Posté, Leslie. 1948. “Books Go Home” Library Journal. December 1, 1948, page 1704.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a photograph in the National Archives and Records Administration showing the unloading of some of these re-captured books. The caption reads: “The [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]], Library, is being unloaded at the [[Offenbach Archival Depot]] 9 July 1945. Three freight cars, 578 cases of books and catalogs of paintings, were brought from the Heilbronn salt mine in Württemburg-Baden where they were kept since brought from Italy.”&lt;ref name="Pomrenze, Seymour p 260"/&gt;

== Japan ==
1942-1945 Japan: Air raids did heavy damage to libraries and collections, including the Cabinet Library in Tokyo.

The heaviest damage was sustained by governmental libraries. Over 655,000 volumes in the Tokyo area were destroyed, including those of the cabinet Library (46,695 volumes), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (40,000 volumes), the Transportation Ministry (69,000 volumes), the Bureau of Patents and Standards (15,528 volumes) and the Finance Ministry (manuscripts and catalogs). The entire library of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was lost. Whether directly or indirectly related to the damages of war, total book resources in Japanese libraries were cut by 50%, and when the Occupation forces arrived in 1945 there were probably fewer than five million books in the country.&lt;ref name="Welch, Theodore F 1997. Page 17"&gt;Welch, Theodore F. 1997. Libraries and Librarianship in Japan. Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

“In Japan, as in Germany, human and cultural destruction (including the loss of texts) were, of course, paired. Figures are hard to come by, but by the end of the war, bombing had accounted either directly or indirectly for the destruction of 50 percent of the total book resources in Japanese libraries. When the occupation troops arrived in 1945, there were probably fewer than five million books in the country. Three quarters of all public libraries suffered heavy damage, with 400,000 volumes in public library collections lost in a bombing raid on Tokyo alone. Heavy damage was sustained by government libraries; more than 655,000 volumes of the Tokyo area were burned, including libraries of the Cabinet, Bureau of Patents and Standards, and Finance Ministry.”&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Rebecca. 2003. Libricide: The Regime Sponsored Destruction of Books and Libraries in the 20th Century. Page 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three-fourths of all public libraries, a third of which were located in the Tokyo metropolitan area, suffered serious damage. Tokyo’s largest, the Hibiya Public Library, sustained the greatest losses, estimated to be about half the entire 400,000 public library collections destroyed by bombing raids over Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Welch, Theodore F 1997. Page 17"/&gt;

== Latvia ==
* 1940 Baltic states: After the occupation by Soviet troops an official list of Banned Books and Brochures was issued in Latvia in November 1940. With additional lists, over 4,000 titles were proscribed: historical, political and ‘nationalist authors’. In Latvia as in Estonia and Lithuania such books were removed from bookstores and libraries and, in many cases, publicly burned.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeven, Hans van der; Van Albada, Joan, 1996, “Memory of the World: Lost Memory: Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the 20th Century.” Pages 7-15. They comment from: R.J. Misiunas and R. Taagepera, The Baltic States. Years of dependence 1940-1980. London, 1983, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
Latvia was occupied by the Soviets from 1944 to 1991. What records remained after the defeat of the Germans were either removed to Russia or destroyed by intent or neglect. In Latvia, Holocaust scholarship could only be resumed once Soviet rule had ended. Much of the post-1991 work was devoted to identification of the victims. This was complicated by the passage of time and the loss of some records and the concealment of others by the NKVD and its successor agencies of the Soviet secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Anders, Edward and Juris Dubrovskis. 2003. “Who Died in the Holocaust? Recovering Names from Official Records.” Holocaust and Genocide Studies 17.1 (2003), pages 114-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lithuania ==
“Political upheavals have often created a frustrating situation for librarians and citizens in general. Consider the case of the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which in 1918 had regained their independence after centuries of Russian occupation? As a result of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact of 1940, they were once more occupied by Russian troops and in 1940 bookstores and libraries were 'cleansed' and unwelcome titles were burned. In 1941 Nazi Germany conquered these countries, only to be driven out once more by the Soviet army in 1944-1945. These succeeding regimes brought not only an appalling waste of human lives, but also rapidly alternating prohibitions of books, purging of libraries and the rewriting of history and textbooks.”&lt;ref name="World 1996"/&gt;

In Lituania, all universities and public libraries have been closed, and Gestapo agents removed or destroyed the equipment of the scientific institutions and books of the national libraries. The Academy of Arts was ransacked, and in Kaunas, the archives of the Academies of Science and Music were destroyed. Over 10,000 volumes were stolen from the State Library, and 23,000 more were stolen from the University Library. In part, this was in reprisal for the country’s steadfast refusal to create a legion of Lithuanian volunteers to fight against the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Axelsson, George. 1943. “Lithuania Sacked in Nazi Vengence: Academies of Medicine, Art, Science and Literature Looted, ministers and Intellectuals Rounded Up; Refused Aid in Russia; Failure to Send ‘Volunteers’ Long a Grievance, Finally Brings Reprisals.” The New York Times. June 5, 1943, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vilna (Vilnius, Vilno, Wilno, etc) the ERR set up a collecting point for Lithuania. Dr. Gotthard of the Berlin headquarters arrived in August 1941, and began looting the [[Mattityahu Strashun#Library|Strashun Library]]. He conscripted the labor of two Gestapo prisoners, including [[A.Y. Goldschmidt]], librarian of the [[Hispanic-Ethnographic Society]]. Eventually, he committed suicide rather than assist the looting of the libraries. Dr. [[Johannes Pohl]] appeared in January 1942, and ordered that the city be made a collecting point for the region, and concentrated at the [[YIVO|Yidisher Visenshaftlikker Institut]] (Institute for Jewish Research). Materials were brought in from the private collections from Kovno, Shavle, Mariapol, Volozhn and other towns, and included books from over 300 synagogues and personal libraries. Some of the Jewish workers were able to smuggle out and hide some of the most valuable books in the ghetto, which was stopped when the ghetto was liquidated in July 1943. The accumulated collection of over 100,000 volumes were separated into piles by century of publication, and about 20,000 were selected for shipment to Germany. The remaining materials were pulped to avoid storage and transportation costs, and to make a small profit. One incident involved an assistant of Dr. Pohl dumping out five cases of rare books in order to make room for an illegal shipment of hogs.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, “The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II.” Journal of Library History, volume 18 (1), page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

"On 24 June 1941, the Nazis captured Vilna. In March 1942, representatives of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg (Rosenberg Operation Group), the body charged with looting Jewish cultural property for the [[Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage]] (Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question) in Frankfurt, established a sorting center in the YIVO building. Workers were forced to select the most valuable objects from the collections of YIVO and other local Jewish institutions to be sent to Frankfurt, while the remaining items would be destroyed...
A group that was dubbed the “[[Paper Brigade|paper brigade]]” led by [[Avrom Sutzkever]] and [[Shmerke Kaczerginski]], risked their lives daily by hiding material in the building’s attic or smuggling it into the Vilna ghetto, where they buried it or gave it to non-Jewish contacts for safekeeping. Since it was located outside the ghetto, the YIVO headquarters also served as a transit point for smuggled weapons for the Jewish partisan movement. Such activity continued until the liquidation of the Vilna ghetto in September 1943. Some of the hiding places went undiscovered and the items stored there survived the war, but the YIVO headquarters and its contents were completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kuznitz |first=Cecile Esther |year= 2010 |website=yivoencyclopedia.org |title= YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/YIVO |accessdate= May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“He [Captain [[Seymour Pomrenze]]] was instrumental in the restitution of thousands of looted archives, including those of the [[Strashun Library]] in [[Vilna]], Lithuania. The library was the premier Jewish library in Europe before World War II, and luckily survived the Nazi destruction of Vilna. The contents of the library, along with those of the YIVO building in Vilna, were looted for eventual placement in the anti-Semitic “Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question.” Pomrenze oversaw the return of tens of thousands of items from the Strashun Library to the [[YIVO Institute for Jewish Research]] headquarters in New York.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/monumentsmen/bio.php?personID=238|title=The Heroes|publisher=monumentsmenfoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“In 1954 a depot of 330,000 confiscated books was discovered in the building of a former bank in Vienna. This depot contained also books from Tanzenberg and there was found a part of the library of the famous YIVO in Vilna. With the help of an Austrian-Jewish lawyer called [[Friedrich Weihsenstein]] they were returned to the YIVO in New York. The librarian of the IKG wrote lists of the books, but none of the documents mention their numbers and the YIVO in New York was not very cooperative regarding the research.”&lt;ref name="lootedart.com"/&gt;

== Luxembourg ==
In Luxembourg, all citizens engaged in “culture” had to register with the German government. This would help in the suppression of dissent, and enforce official censorship. In the “Duty of Registration for All Persons Engaged in Creating or Transmitting Cultural Values in Luxemburg (Verordnungsblatt, No. 15, February 21, 1941, page 109)”, all writers, authors, publishers, art publishers, copyists and book dealers had to register. Those who refused to register with the occupation government, would be forbidden to practice their arts in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lemkin, Raphael. 1944. Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. Pages 442-443.&lt;/ref&gt;

“In Luxembourg, non-German reference materials, i.e., French or English were confiscated and replaced by German encyclopaedias. In fact, after 1940, there was an attempt to eliminate all English and French books from collections in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. It was an attempt to seal off occupied countries from the intellectual currents of democracy.”&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Rebecca. 2003. Libricide. Page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malayan Union/Malaysia ==
“…the Japanese looted very thoroughly the head office at Batu Gajah: they removed all the scientific equipment and took away or broke about 5,000 rock slices. Fortunately the rock and mineral collections and the library and records did not fare so badly: eventually they tried to burn down the building, but this was prevented by the Asiatic staff. The district office also suffered badly. A serious loss was the disappearance of a memoir and map ready for publication, as well as all the relevant notes, so a good deal of the country will have to be re-mapped.”&lt;ref&gt;Rastall, R. H. 1948. “Reviews.” Geological Magazine. Volume LXXXV (2), March–April 1948, page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Penang Library had its main collection in English, but also had some materials in indigenous languages. When the Japanese Army entered the city, they looted the library, yet they left behind enough materials for the library to continue operations. After the takeover, the library continued to have over 1,000 subscribers and remained open for their patrons until June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Sterling Joseph. 2008. “The Penang Library (1929-1945)” In: Empire of the Mind: Subscription Libraries, Literacy and Acculturation in the Colonies of the British Empire.

When the Nazis occupied the Netherlands they renamed it “The National Library.”&lt;ref&gt;“Nazis Close The Hague Library.” 1943. New York Times. July 28, 1943. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provincial Library of Zeeland (160,000 volumes lost). "1940 The Netherlands, Middelburg: The Provincial Library of Zeeland was destroyed in May after German bombs hit the town; a valuable scholarly collection of about 160,000 volumes was completely destroyed, while the remainder was seriously damaged by water or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeven, Hans van der; Van Albada, Joan, 1996, “Memory of the World: Lost Memory: Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the 20th Century.” Pages 7-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

“…the library of the Spinoza House, the Dutch Scientific Humanitarian Commission, the International Archives of the Women’s Movement, the Portuguese-Israelitic Seminary Ets Haim, the Beth Hamidrash Library, the library of the Nederlandsch-Israelitic Seminary, the Valkenburg Monastery Library the Dutch Economic and Historical Archives fell into the occupier’s hands. In October and November 1943 it was the turn of the Amsterdam Ashkenzai archive and of several smaller Jewish archives in the provinces. The high point was of course the famous library of about 160,000 volumes of the International Institute for Social History (IISG) in Amsterdam, which was confiscated within two months of the invasion.”&lt;ref&gt;Aalders, Gerard. Nazi Looting. Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

“The [[Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg]] (ERR), established by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] in 1939, was represented in the Netherlands by an Amsterdam office. In 1940, the ERR confiscated all property belonging to the Freemasons, among which was the famous Biblioteca Klossiana. This library had been bought by Prince Hendrik (1876-1934), husband of Queen Wilhelmina, and had been presented by him to the order of Freemasons. It contained important incunabula and books on the occult, which were not available anywhere else in the Netherlands. Other parts of the library and the order’s archive were of importance as well. The library of the International Institute for Social History in Amsterdam was closed, and the ERR took over the building for its offices. In July 1940 the institute’s very important collection of newspapers and the library of approximately 160,000 volumes were confiscated. German arguments over their final destination kept the materials in Amsterdam until the winter of 1944, when they were transported to Germany in eleven ships. The International Archives of the Women’s Movement, established in Amsterdam in 1935, lost its whole collection after the institute was closed by the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police) in June 1940. In August 1942, 499 crates containing books and archives taken from, among others, Jewish antiquarian book dealers and theosophical societies were transported to Berlin.”&lt;ref&gt;Leistra, Josephine. 1997. “A Short History of Art Loss and Art Recovery in the Netherlands.” In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. “Spoils of War.” Page55.&lt;/ref&gt;

“In Holland [sic] the monks of the Abbey van Berne distributed the early printed books on the monastic library among neighboring farmhouses. Virtually all were destroyed by natural causes, by theft, and by shellfire. The Abbey buildings are intact.”&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Kenneth R. and Kipp, Laurence J. 1947. “Books- Agents of War and Peace.” The Scientific Monthly. Volume 64 (5), May 1947, page 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

“[[Sigmund Seeligmann]] (1873–1940) was a renowned Dutch bibliographer and historian. He often invited scholars to use his extensive private library, which included more than 18,000 books on Jewish subjects and was considered one of the most important Jewish libraries in Europe before World War II. After the invasion of the Netherlands, the Nazis confiscated Seeligmann’s library in October 1941. His collection was sent to Berlin, where it became part of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt Library. In 1945, Seeligmann’s library was discovered in Czechoslovakia. At the time, Nazi-looted Jewish cultural property was being uncovered in salt mines, bunkers, and castles across Europe. Often the recovered objects were the only surviving elements of the Jewish communities they once had served. Salvaging and preserving these cultural treasures became a high priority for Jewish organizations.”&lt;ref&gt;Yavnai, Elisabeth M. 2003. “Jewish Cultural Property and Its Postwar Recovery.” In: “Confiscation of Jewish Property in Europe, 1933-1945.” USHMM. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

“The collections as well as the libraries of the International Institute for Social History at Amsterdam have been closed down. The library, which has about 150,000 volumes, as well as a very important collection of newspapers, has been taken to Germany. The [[Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana]] of the University of Amsterdam, which belongs to the city, has been packed in 153 crates and has also been taken to Germany. Famous collections concerning natural history of the College of St. Ignace at Valkenburg and the Museum of Natural History at Maastricht have also been taken to Germany, as well as the library which belonged to it. In 1940 all the property of the Freemasonry Lodges was confiscated and taken away to Germany. It included the well-known Klossiana Library.”&lt;ref&gt;Nuremberg Trial Proceedings. Volume 16. One Hundred and Fifthieth Day, Friday, June 14, 1946. Morning Session. See the site accessed on August 27, 2012: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/06-14-46.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The German authorities were especially interested in manuscripts of German and Dutch mysticism. Libraries and antiquarian bookstores were combed for special manuscripts of ancient lore. A special search by Dr. W. Grothe and F. Brethauer of the ERR was begun in August 1941. The Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden and Groningen university libraries were searched for manuscripts. Also combed were the Haarlem and Nijmegen municipal libraries, as well as the Fries Genootschap, the Meermanno-Westreenaianum in the Hague, the Nijmegen Municipal Museum and the Haarlem Bishop’s Archive. Many manuscripts were taken and then later “exchanged” for manuscripts from German and Austrian libraries. If the manuscripts could not be exchanged or purchased, they were copied. The exchanges were sometimes advantageous for the Dutch, but the balance weighed in favor of the Germans, and many times were not unlike forced sales. Although with a legal appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Aalders, Gerard. Nazi Looting. Pages 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German efficiency in selecting and removing these volumes from the occupied countries and sending them back to German is astounding. Also astounding is that many of the major collections remained more or less intact, and were recovered by the Allies at the end of the war. German libraries had preserved many of these Dutch collections as well as their own. As such, much of the Biblioteca Rosenthaliana, the library of the Jewish Portuguese Seminarium of Amsterdam, the books of the Societas Spinozana, the collections of the Freemasonic Groot Orde der Nederlanden, the volumes of the Etz Chaim Seminarium, and twenty Sifre Toroth (plural of Torah) were returned to their country from the [[Offenbach Archival Depot]].&lt;ref name="Posté, Leslie 1948"/&gt;

== Philippines ==
* Manila. "In the Philippine Islands, the Japanese carried off valuable scientific and other works and then burned nearly every collection within the nation. Almost all of the rich depositories of Filippina materials (books, manuscripts, maps) were burned. In 1945, Manila endured an orgy of murder and rape that killed about 100,000 civilians. By the war’s end, Manila had also lost the [[National Library of the Philippines|National Library]], the [[University of the Philippines Library]], religious archives and many private holdings. "&lt;ref name="Knuth, Rebecca 2003. Pages 167-168"/&gt;

{{see also|Planned destruction of Warsaw}}
[[File:Destroyed Zamoyski Library in Warsaw.jpg|thumb|Destroyed {{Interlanguage link multi|Zamoyski Library|pl|3=Biblioteka Akademii Zamojskiej}} in Warsaw (adjacent to the Blue Palace). Burned down in September, 1939 as a result of severe aerial bombardment by the Germans (incendiary bombing). The surviving collection was later deliberately burned by the Germans in September 1944]]

Most of the Polish libraries were damaged and suffered losses by German occupation, especially prominent was the destruction of libraries in Warsaw who saw continued bombing by the Germans. Poland faced especially great loses during the early years of the war as the Germans focused on "outright destruction of Jewish books and religious artifacts".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borin|first=Jacqueline|date=1993|title=Embers of the Soul: The Destruction of Jewish Books and Libraries in Poland during World War II|jstor=25542595|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|volume=28|issue=4|pages=445–460}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German's created "''Bremn-Komman-dos"'' (arson squads) with their main focus being on burning Jewish synagogues and their libraries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; What little did survive during the initial bombing and shelling was confiscated during the occupation and transported to Berlin so the German's could study the "Jewish Question."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When Polish librarians made a report to the International Federation of Librarians Association after the war , they stated that in 1939 there were 22,500,000 volumes in Polish libraries. By the end of the war a total of 15,000,000 of those had been burned, destroyed, or confiscated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This number is believed to be conservative, as it does not account for private collections which would have been destroyed or looted as Jewish families were deported.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Serbia ==
* In April 1941, the [[National Library of Serbia]] in Belgrade was completely destroyed as a result of German bombs. About 1,300 Cyrillic Manuscripts from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries were burned as well as important manuscript collections of Serbian authors and scholars. Incunabula and old printed works were also destroyed, as were Serbian books printed between 1832 and 1941.

== United Kingdom ==
England also lost her share of books destroyed during the war. Some 54,000 children’s books went up in flames during the bombing of England, and thousands of special collections housed in the libraries are gone forever. Of the 1,145,500 books destroyed in the ruins of the bombed libraries, 982,000 were in city libraries; 155,813 belonged to university libraries, and the rest in county libraries.&lt;ref&gt;"Nazis Burned Books Across the Channel, Too." Christian Science Monitor. 1 October 1945, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Channel Islands. Although the Germans were never able to actually invade England, the Channel Islands were occupied, and many of their library books were also stolen by the ERR. After the war, some 3,740 books were shipped in 17 cases, and included "…books, Masonic documents and emblems looted from the British Channel Islands."&lt;ref&gt;Posté, Leslie. 1948.

'''Maranaos in America for Peace, Integration and Advancement''' was first conceptualized by a group of [[Maranao]]s in [[Los Angeles, California]] in early 2007. After several monthly meetings, the group was successfully launched on September 2, 2007 in [[Burbank, California]]. It is the first Maranao organization ever formed in the United States and Northern America.  It was formed for the advancement and to help build a lasting relationship among the Maranao community in America through social/cultural activities, educational seminars, peace forums, networking and outreach.

The organization's long-term goal is to bridge assistance back home through sponsoring qualified, financially challenged, youth scholars to achieve their ultimate dreams of becoming an informed, educated Maranao.  

Members of ''Maranaos in America'' are from all over the United States, including Texas, Nevada, Florida and New York. Its seat of Main office is in Los Angeles.

'''Michigan Cyber Range''' was established by [[Merit Network]] in the summer of 2012 to teach [[cybersecurity]] certification courses and to provide cybersecurity-related services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.merit.edu/cyberrange/ |title= Michigan Cyber Range |publisher= Merit Network |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merit Network staffs and operates the Michigan Cyber Range in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]. The Range's infrastructure contains [[Virtual private server|virtual servers]] placed on Merit's fiber-optic network. The Michigan Cyber Range currently has four physical locations in Michigan, on the campuses of [[Eastern Michigan University]] in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], [[Ferris State University]] in [[Big Rapids, Michigan|Big Rapids]], [[Northern Michigan University]] in [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]], and the [[110th Attack Wing]] facility in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]]. Expansion plans could involve as many as 10 sites.

== History ==
The Michigan Cyber Range was a foundational piece of [[Michigan Governor]] [[Rick Snyder]]'s cyber initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.michigan.gov/cybersecurity |title= Michigan Cyber Initiative |publisher= State of Michigan |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was launched in October 2011 to improve cybersecurity efforts to protect families, communities, businesses and government. Merit Network's CEO and President Don Welch who, while a professor helped create the [[United States Military Academy]]'s cybersecurity program, worked with David Behen of the State and Brigadier General Mike Stone from the [[Michigan National Guard]] to create the vision for the Cyber Range and secure its start-up funding. Throughout 2012, public and private organizations pledged funds and the Michigan Cyber Range was created and staffed.

William J. "Joe" Adams joined Merit Network in June 2012 as executive director of research and the Michigan Cyber Range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first= Greg |last= Monroe |date= June 13, 2012 |url= https://www.merit.edu/merit-network-welcomes-new-executive-director-of-research-and-the-michigan-cyber-range/ |title= Merit Network Welcomes New Executive Director of Research and the Michigan Cyber Range |publisher= Merit Network |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, a career [[Signal Corps]] officer in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], was formerly CIO of the [[National Defense University]].  Adams has also served as a professor and research scientist at West Point and network engineer for the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]].

Shortly after his hiring, Adams assembled a staff to create and maintain the Michigan Cyber Range's cybersecurity training environment, which is called Alphaville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= John, II |last= Breeden |date= April 25, 2014 |url= http://gcn.com/articles/2014/04/25/alphaville-cybersecurity-training-facility.aspx |title= In Virtual Town of Alphaville, Students Prep for Cyber Sieges |work= GCN Magazine |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alphaville is a virtual environment that simulates the computer systems of a town hall, library, small company, police station, and power company.  Organizations and companies can practice the detection and mitigation of cybersecurity threats using the Alphaville environment.

On November 9, 2012, Michigan Governor Snyder participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for Michigan Cyber Range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= November 9, 2012 |url= http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577-289758--,00.html |title= Governor Snyder Cuts Ribbon on Innovative Cyber Training Center |publisher= Office of the Governor |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jessica |last= Mulholland |date= November 9, 2012 |url= http://www.govtech.com/Michigan-Launches-Cyber-Range-to-Enhance-Cybersecurity.html |title= Michigan Launches 'Cyber Range' to Enhance Cybersecurity |work= Government Technology |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan Cyber Range partners include Merit Network, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], [[DTE Energy]], [[Consumers Energy]], [[Plante Moran|Plante and Moran PLLC]], [[Juniper Networks]], Eastern Michigan University, [[Michigan State Police]], [[Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs|Michigan's Department of Military and Veterans Affairs]], [[Michigan Economic Development Corporation]], and the [[Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget]].

On October 15, 2014, Consumers Energy and DTE Energy conducted an incident response exercise using the Michigan Cyber Range.  Representatives from the two power companies and the Michigan State Police worked closely with Cyber Range staff to create the exercise, called "Power Phoenix", which required participants to diagnose and mitigate a malware-compromised computer network and SCADA environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= October 20, 2014 |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/michigan-cyber-range-hosts-cyber-exercise-for-consumers-and-dte-energy-2014-10-20 |title= Michigan Cyber Range Hosts Cyber Exercise for Consumers and DTE Energy |publisher= MarketWatch |accessdate= October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mile2.com/latest-news/michigan-cyber-range-to-debut-scada-security-training-component.html "Michigan Cyber Range to Debut SCADA Security Training Component," by Nikolay Tsvetkov, Mile2], retrieved April 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, [[Wayne County Community College District]] (WCCCD), in conjunction with the Michigan Cyber Range and Mile2, hosted a groundbreaking veteran's retraining program. The 13-week program prepared a group of military veterans for a career in cybersecurity.  17 students participated in the retraining program. The veterans were selected based on their experience and aptitude, in conjunction with Wayne County’s veterans affairs office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merit.edu/new-cybersecurity-retraining-program-for-veterans-debuts/ "New Cybersecurity Program for Veterans"], press release, Merit Network, February 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2016, the Michigan Cyber Range added new publicly-accessible hubs of the in Southeast Michigan.  Each location provides certification courses, cybersecurity training exercises and product hardening/testing through a direct connection to the Michigan Cyber Range.  Cyber Range Hubs opened inside the Velocity Center at Macomb-Oakland University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20160318/NEWS/160319653 "Michigan Cyber Range opens in Sterling Heights"], Sean Delaney, Macomb Daily, March 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in Sterling Heights on March 18th and at Pinckney Community High School&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinckneyschools.org/index.php/home/more-pcs-info/pinckney-pride/1178-pinckney-cyber-training-institute-grand-opening "Pinckney CTI Grand Opening"], news article, Pinckney Community Schools, December 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; on December 7th.  

During the fall of 2016, Merit Network and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder launched the Governor's High School Cyber Challenge, a competition for high school students to test their skills in computer science, information technology and cybersecurity.  The final round of the challenge happened at the North American International Cyber Summit, hosted by Governor Snyder on October 17, 2016.  The three-person team from Clinton High School was crowned champions of the competition after defeating the 28 other teams in the inaugural event.  The Michigan Cyber Range provided the challenges and infrastructure for the annual cyber competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statescoop.com/michigan-aims-to-spur-economy-through-student-cyber-competition "Michigan aims to spur economy through student cyber competition"], Darlene Aderoju, State Scoop, August 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan Cyber Range has twice been named the North American Authorized Training Center (ATC) of the year by [[Mile2]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merit.edu/merit-named-mile2-training-center-of-the-year/ "Merit Named Mile2 Training Center of the Year," by Brian Warkoczeski, Merit, March 26, 2015], retrieved April 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Michigan Cyber Range doubled the participation in the Governor’s High School Cyber Challenge from 292 high school students to 584. This included successful elicitation of participation from Native American tribal areas in Michigan. Another milestone was the addition of Cyber Range hubs in Florida and Georgia. Continuing their commitment since 2015, the Cyber Range provides exercises, support and infrastructure to the US Cyber Challenge, a national cyber competition sponsored by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. Other milestones include the creation of virtual environments to facilitate cybersecurity involvement in kinetic training exercises, creation of an International Cyber Exercise (ICE) to promote collaboration and partnership between states’ [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] units and the countries participating in the [[State Partnership Program]] (SPP), and the successful launch of the Regional Cybersecurity Education Collaboration in partnership with the [[Michigan|State of Michigan]] and [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]. The ICE event in 2017 was run at the NAICS – 12 states and 10 countries participated.

The '''Mong Tai Army''' ({{lang-my|မိုင်းတိုင်းတပ်မတော်}}; sometimes [[transcription (linguistics)|transcripted]] '''Muang Tai Army'''; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''MTA'''), was an [[Insurgency|insurgent group]] consisting of soldiers from the [[Shan people|Shan minority]] in [[Myanmar]], founded in 1985 by [[Khun Sa]]. It had up to 20,000 armed troops at its peak, and was one of the largest forces [[Internal conflict in Burma|opposing]] the government of Myanmar at its time. It was also involved in [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|drug trafficking in Southeast Asia]].

The MTA had its headquarters in [[Ho Mong]] (Homein), [[Langkho District]], a village near the border of [[Mae Hong Son Province]].&lt;ref name="F&amp;D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Myanmar/sub5_5g/entry-3078.html|title=Golden Triangle drug Lords: Khun Sa, Lo Hsing Han, Miss Hairy Legs and the Wa State Army|work=Facts and Details|accessdate=26 May 2016}}; [[Bertil Lintner]], in Asia Online; November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The Mong Tai Army was founded in 1985, after the merging of two rebel factions; Khun Sa's [[Shan United Army]] (SUA)&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/sua.htm|title=Shan United Army (SUA) - Mong Tai Army (MTA)|work=GlobalSecurity|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moh Heng's "Tai Revolutionary Council" faction of the [[Shan United Revolutionary Army]] (SURA). Despite officially stating that their goal is ultimately independence for [[Shan State]], both groups have been accused of acting as private armies for Shan warlords (Khun Sa and Moh Heng, respectively). They have both also been accused of being heavily involved in the drug trade in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], an area that produces millions of dollars of opium every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=112&amp;regionSelect=7-Eastern_Asia#,|title=Uppsala Conflict Encyclopedia, Myanmar (Burma)|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the Mong Tai Army had a peak strength of 20,000 soldiers. After heavy battles against the [[Tatmadaw]] (Myanmar Armed Forces) between 1993 and 1995, tensions grew between the [[Shan nationalist]] field officers and the Chinese leaders. Shan nationalists wanted to achieve an independent state for the Shan minority, while the Chinese leaders were more interested in the illicit opium trade and the money that it earned.&lt;ref name=ThGoogle&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LclscNCTz9oC&amp;pg=PA870&amp;lpg=PA870&amp;dq=%22Shan+State+National+Army%22+MTA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ym-nYd0e02&amp;sig=QV59FgiypPy07ZYlP0e6_ZDONgI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u2MSVJSODc6hugTjjYGwDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shan%20State%20National%20Army%22%20MTA&amp;f=false|title=''The Far East and Australasia 2003'', p. 870|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1996, the Mong Tai Army was also fighting the [[United Wa State Army]] (UWSA), something which benefited Tatmadaw forces in the area. During their fighting, the USWA managed to occupy two large swathes of territory near the Thai border, north and south of the city of [[Kengtung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.panglong.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5430:wa-will-not-budge-from-thai-border-areas&amp;catid=86:war&amp;Itemid=284|title=Wa will not budge from Thai border areas|author=S.H.A.N.|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 1995, an internal dispute broke out within the Mong Tai Army, and 8,000 fighters under the command of Colonel Yod Kan and Dae Wain retreated into the village of Hsipaw, where they built a new base. They renamed themselves the [[Shan State National Army]], and the group intended to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with government forces. Khun Sa claimed that the source of the dispute was that the soldiers who left did not want to fight for a leader with multiple goals. However, the soldiers claimed that the drug profits went only to Khun Sa, and that civilian casualties were the highest in fighting between the Mong Tai Army and government forces because of a lack of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanland.org/politics/2006/News-06160406/|title=Shanland|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204151249/http://www.shanland.org/politics/2006/News-06160406/|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands died as a direct result from fighting between the Mong Tai Army and government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=112&amp;regionSelect=7-Eastern_Asia#,|title=Uppsala Conflict Encyclopedia, Myanmar (Burma)|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the Mong Tai Army laid down their arms and surrendered to government forces in 1995, but around 3,000 split and formed a new faction of the [[Shan United Revolutionary Army]], which later renamed to the [[Shan State Army - South]] (SSA-S). According to the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC), the terms of the surrender stipulated that in return for ending his insurgency and surrendering his weaponry, Khun Sa would be allowed to live under close government supervision in [[Yangon]] (Rangoon), where he would be allowed to engage indirectly, through third-party investors, in legitimate business operations and he would not be prosecuted for his trafficking activities or be extradited to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/wa.htm|title=Trafficking|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khun Sa was not only pardoned by the government, but received the title of "honored elder", and was allowed to live out the remainder of his life in Yangon, where he died in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=112&amp;regionSelect=7-Eastern_Asia#,|title=Uppsala Conflict Encyclopedia, Myanmar (Burma)|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug trafficking==
Khun Sa has frequently claimed that the Mong Tai Army was not about the drug trade or making profits from drug trafficking, and claimed that in fact, they were strongly opposed to opium. However, it is reported that Khun Sa once offered to sell his army's entire opium supply to the US government, an offer which was refused. In 1989, Khun Sa was charged by a New York court for trying to import 1,000 tonnes of heroin into the US, with the US DEA offering a $2,000,000 bounty for his arrest.&lt;ref name=ThGoogle /&gt;

The '''National Athletic and Cycling Association''' ('''NACA''' or '''N.A. and C.A.'''), from 1990 the '''National Athletic and Cycling Association of Ireland''' ('''NACAI''' or '''NACA(I)''')&lt;ref name="OCallaghan5"/&gt; was a federation of sports clubs in [[Ireland|the island of Ireland]] practising [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] or [[bicycle racing]] or both. It existed from 1922 to 2000, though for most of the period it was not the sole governing body in Ireland for either sport. Its refusal to recognise [[partition of Ireland|the partition of Ireland]] got it expelled from the [[International Amateur Athletics Federation]] (IAAF) and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). Clubs formerly in the NACAI are now affiliated to [[Athletics Ireland]] or [[Cycling Ireland]], each formed by the merger of the NACAI with rival bodies respectively affiliated to the IAAF and the UCI.

==Foundation==
The NACA was formed on 19 July 1922,&lt;ref name="OCallaghan5"&gt;O'Callaghan (2012) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; from a merger of the Irish Amateur Athletic Association or IAAA (including its subsidiary the [[cross country running|Cross Country]] Association of Ireland), the Irish Cycling Association (ICA) and the Athletics Council of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA).&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cain"&gt;{{Cite web |first=John |last=Sugden |author2=Scott Harvie |year=1995 |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/sugdenharvie/sugdenharvie95-1.htm |title=Sport and Community Relations in Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GAA was [[Irish nationalist]] and mainly rural, while the IAAA and ICA members were mainly [[Irish unionist|unionists]], universities, and the urban middle class. The IAAA was linked to the [[Amateur Athletic Association of England]] (AAA).

The unionist-dominated [[Northern Ireland]] and the nationalist [[Irish Free State]] had recently been separated politically, and the GAA was prepared to surrender its authority to ensure national unity in athletics and cycling and avoid a division which would reinforce the reality of partition. The GAA after 1923 thus restricted itself to [[Gaelic games]], ceding athletics and cycling to NACA, with which it remained on friendly terms.  [[John J. Keane (Olympics)|John J. Keane]], previously Chairman of the GAA Athletic Council, became first NACA President.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (2012) pp.1,4&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the GAA had [[Rule 21|a ban on members of the RUC and British Army]], the NACA narrowly voted not to introduce such a measure.&lt;ref&gt;Coyle 2003, p.192&lt;/ref&gt;

The NACA affiliated to the IAAF on 11 January 1924,&lt;ref name="OCallaghan5"/&gt; and sent teams to the Olympics of [[Ireland at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]], [[Ireland at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], and [[Ireland at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932]].&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt; It also sent [[Ireland at the Commonwealth Games#1930|five athletes]] to the [[1930 British Empire Games]] in Canada. In each case, the team was claimed to represent "Ireland" rather than the Irish Free State.

In 1937, the National Cycling Association (NCA) was formed as a NACA subsidiary for cycling clubs, and affiliated to the UCI. The [[Rás Tailteann]] was its headline event, an 8-day stage race whose name reflected the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]].

==Splits and isolation==
Already by 1925 there was a split, with the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletic, Cycling and Cross Country Association (NIAAA) formed over a dispute concerning an Easter Monday sports meeting in Belfast, which as well as athletics featured [[greyhound racing]] and associated betting, which had been allowed by the IAAA but not by NACA.&lt;ref name="reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/a-first-class-splitpolitical-conflict-in-irish-athletics-1924-40/ |title='A first-class split':political conflict in Irish athletics, 1924–40 |journal=History Ireland |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=July–August 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2013 |first=Pearse |last=Reynolds |location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the meeting was to raise funds for [[Belfast Celtic F.C.]], with an [[Irish nationalist]] fanbase, the NACA alienated nationalists as well as unionists in Belfast.&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; The NIAAA affiliated to the English AAA in 1930, with its unionist president [[Thomas Moles]] encouraging links within the UK,&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; and [[Dawson Bates]], the [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|NI Home Affairs minister]], lobbying the AAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunt |first1=Tom |title=The National Athletic Association of Ireland and Irish Athletics, 1922–1937: steps on the road to athletic isolation |journal=Sport in Society |date=17 July 2015 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=130–146 |doi=10.1080/17430437.2015.1038918}}; reprinted as  {{cite book |editor-last1=Hassan |editor-first1=David |editor-last2=McElligott |editor-first2=Richard |title=A Social and Cultural History of Sport in Ireland |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317326472 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=xnRUDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT310 |accessdate=30 July 2018 |language=en |chapter=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, [[Eoin O'Duffy]] was president of the NACA, and raised at the IAAF the dispute with the British AAA over jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. The IAAF deferred a decision till its conference at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]].&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; In the meantime O'Duffy tried to resolve the matter by proposing an Irish Amateur Athletic Union (IAAU) in negotiations between NACA and the NIAAA, to have an agreed flag containing the arms of the four provinces on a background of [[St Patrick's Blue]].&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports flag question|date=29 February 1932|work=The Irish Times|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposal foundered when an NACA general meeting insisted that the flag used at international events be the [[Irish tricolour]] rather than the IAAU flag.&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Irish athletics and a flag|date=4 April 1932|work=The Irish Times|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Northern athletics and the flag|date=30 April 1932|work=The Irish Times|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAAF decided in 1932 not to intervene in the Northern jurisdcition dispute.&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt;

In 1934, the IAAF amended its constitution to require member associations to be delimited by international political boundaries.&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; After a year's delay, the NACA council voted 24 to 27 to reject the IAAF decision and was suspended the following month.&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; There was no Irish team at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], other Irish sports boycotting in solidarity with the NACA exclusion.&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; In 1937, some clubs in the Irish Free State left NACA and formed an Irish Amateur Athletic Union (IAAU, the same name as the abortive 1932 proposal) whose remit excluded Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt; The IAAU applied to join the IAAF, but due to [[Names of the Irish state#Name dispute with the UK|British objections to the name "Ireland"]] was required to rename itself the Amateur Athletic Union of [[Éire]] (AAUE).&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; AAUE affiliation in 1938 meant the NACA was definitively expelled from the IAAF.&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (2012) pp.4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Most Irish athletics clubs remained in NACA, and it was NACA that was affiliated to the [[Irish Olympic Council]], though it was AAUE athletes who competed at the Olympics.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Sullivan |first=Patrick T.  |date=Spring 1998 |title=Ireland &amp; the Olympic Games |journal=History Ireland |location=Dublin |volume=6 |issue=1 |url=http://www.historyireland.com/volumes/volume6/issue1/features/?id=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronnie Delany]]'s gold medal in the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics – Men's 1500 metres|1956 1500 m]] was not mentioned at the next NACA executive meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Coyle 2003, p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCI emulated the IAAF in 1947 by requiring the NCA to disclaim Northern Ireland, expelling it when it refused. In 1949, several clubs broke away from the NCA to form Cumann Rothaíochta na hÉireann (CRE), which would restrict its area of jurisdiction to the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The CRE was recognised by the UCI, as was the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation (NICF), formed the same year and linked to the [[British Cycling|British Cycling Federation]].&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt; The CRE and NICF co-operated and organised the [[Tour of Ireland]], which attracted fewer Irish cyclists than the Rás Tailteann but more from abroad. A joint CRE-NICF Ireland team competed in international events, from which the NCA was excluded. Rogue NCA teams joined the [[1955 UCI Road World Championships|1955 amateur world road race championship]] and the [[Cycling at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race|1972 Olympics road race]] in protest at their exclusion.&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt;

The NACA retained some international links, through the [[International Labour Sports Federation]] (CSIT).&lt;ref&gt;Coyle 2003, pp.203–4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
In 1979, the NCA joined the NICF and the Irish Cycling Federation (ICF; the renamed CRE) in the Irish Cycling Tripartite Committee (ICTC).&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt; In 1987 all three merged into the Federation of Irish Cyclists (FIC),&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt; later renamed [[Cycling Ireland]].

After many failed attempts at unification, Bord Luthchleas na hÉireann (BLÉ) was formed in 1967 by the merger of the AAUE and most clubs of the NACA.&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt; However, some NACA clubs refused to join BLÉ, though in 1987 the rump NACA reached agreement with BLÉ allowing joint international representation.&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"/&gt; In 2000, both bodies were dissolved into the Athletics Association of Ireland, which forms [[Athletics Ireland]] together with the NIAAA.&lt;ref name="athleticsireland"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.athleticsireland.ie/content/?page_id=5990 | title=History | publisher=Athletics Ireland | accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==

The '''National Precursor Log Exchange''' (NPLEx) is a real-time electronic logging system which tracks sales of the [[methamphetamine]] [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] in the [[United States]]. The program is operated by the [[National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators]] (NADDI), funded by manufacturers of pseudoephedrine medicine, and technology provided through contract by [[Apriss Inc]].&lt;ref name="nplexfaq"&gt;{{Cite web | title = NPLEx - National Precursor Log Exchange | url = http://nplexservice.com/faq.html | publisher = Apriss Inc. | accessdate = 14 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2014, 29 states have passed NPLEx-related legislation,&lt;ref name="shelby2014_a"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Anti-meth efforts have little impact: State report | url = http://www.t-g.com/story/2040605.html | publisher = Shelbyville Times-Gazette | date = 12 January 2014 | accessdate = 14 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is implemented in most other states on a voluntary basis by national retail chains.

Whenever an individual purchases a precursor medicine from a participating retailer, identifying information is gathered at the point of sale and submitted to NPLEx. The system cross-references the sale to other purchases made by that individual to determine whether that person has purchased in excess of daily and monthly legal quantities. The sale may optionally be blocked, and the record is made available to law enforcement over the Internet.&lt;ref name="nplexfaq" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6610">The '''National Raisin Reserve''' was a [[raisin]] reserve of the United States.&lt;ref name="Totenberg 2015"/&gt; It was created after [[World War II]] by the government in order to control raisin prices. The reserve was run by the Raisin Administrative Committee.&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahrenthold|first=David|title=One grower's grapes of wrath|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-07/lifestyle/40427624_1_raisins-grapes-dried-fruit|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enforced by means of a "[[marketing orders and agreements|marketing order]]". In 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled the reserve unconstitutional and ended it.

==History==
The reserve was founded in 1949 as a means to prevent the crash of raisin prices in post-[[World War II]] America. Because there was less demand from the federal government for [[raisin]]s, there was suddenly a glut of raisins on the market. As a result, prices began to go down. In 1949, Marketing Order 989 was passed which created the reserve and the Raisin Administrative Committee, which was responsible for running the reserve. Once established, the reserve functioned as a government-mandated [[cartel]], artificially limiting the raisin supply in order to drive up prices, for the collective benefit of raisin growers.&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1 /&gt;

American raisins, once seized, were sent to various warehouses across [[California]], to be stored until sold to foreign nations, fed to cattle or schoolchildren, or disposed of in any other way to get them off the market that year.&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1 /&gt;

The Raisin Administrative Committee was based in [[Fresno, California]] and was overseen by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. The committee was made up of industry representatives, who would decide each year on the size of the reserve and what to do with the stockpiled supply. The profits from the sale of the reserved raisins (taken from growers often for no payment) were used to pay the expenses of the committee or pay farmers for their seized produce. In one recent year, $65,483,211 was made, although it was all spent, with none left over for farmers.&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1 /&gt;

Regarding the National Raisin Reserve, Daniel Sumner, director of the [[University of California]]’s Agricultural Issues Center stated "It’s a cartel. Let’s use the power of the government to operate a cartel...", "Congress had given the [[USDA]] the authority to operate reserves during the [[New Deal]]: Other reserves existed for [[almond]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[Tart cherry|tart cherries]] and other products."&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1 /&gt;

In 2013, Florida Congressman [[Trey Radel]] introduced a bill that would repeal Marketing Order 989.&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold2&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahrenthold|first=David|title=Florida congressman's bill would do away with U.S. raisin reserve|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-26/politics/40863612_1_raisins-florida-congressman-northern-california|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced but not enacted.&lt;ref name="H.R. 2840 (113th): To amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to exclude raisins from agricultural marketing orders."&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2840], Died in a previous Congress. This bill was introduced on July 25, 2013, in a previous session of Congress, but was not enacted.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court case===
The reserve gained prominence in 2013 when [[Marvin Horne]] challenged the legitimacy of the reserve in ''[[Horne v. Department of Agriculture]]''. Horne's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Takings clause|takings claim]] made its way all the way to the [[United States Supreme Court]], which reversed and remanded the determination of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] that it had no jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Horne v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture |vol=133 |reporter=S. Ct. |opinion=2053 |date=2013 |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-123_c07d.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On remand, the Ninth Circuit found that the reserve's requirements did not constitute a taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Horne v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture |vol=750 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1128 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2014 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16643762165201363767&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, the case was argued again before the Supreme Court.,&lt;ref name="scotusblog"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/horne-v-department-of-agriculture-2/], Horne v. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; which decided in June 2015, by a majority of 8:1,&lt;ref name="Totenberg 2015"/&gt; that the confiscation of a portion of a farmer's crops without market price compensation was unconstitutional. This ended the raisin reserve.

==Other reserves==
In addition to the National Raisin Reserve, during the New Deal other reserves existed for [[almond]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[Prunus cerasus|tart cherries]] and other products. Enacted during the [[Great Depression]], the New Deal reserves were a result of the government's attempt to keep prices viable for farmers to grow the fruit and make a suitable profit. Most of these no longer exist.&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1 /&gt;

'''''Op Hoop van Zegen''''' (Dutch for "Hoping for the best"), is a 1900 Dutch play, taking place in a fishing village, with the conflict between the [[fisherman|fishermen]] and their employer ending in [[tragedy]] with the unsound boat setting out to sea and sinking with all hands and the owner pocketing the insurance money. It is still staged, and remains the most popular play by Dutch dramatist [[Herman Heijermans]]. The socialist Heijermans is considered to have meant the play as a criticism of the entire [[capitalist]] system, though some present-day productions downplay this radical approach.

There are four films based on the play. The most recent was made in 1986, featuring [[Danny de Munk]] as ''Barend''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3443">The '''Pakistan Muslim League (J)''' ([[Urdu]]: '''پاکستان مسلم لیگ ج''') was a [[political party]] in [[Pakistan]] established in 1988. It merged with PML-Q in 2004.

It is one of the factions of the original [[Pakistan Muslim League]], named "J" after [[Muhammad Khan Junejo]]. It was created in 1986 as the sole Pakistan Muslim League when [[Muhammad Khan Junejo]] was the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] under President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. In September 1988, the party formed an alliance called [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad]] with [[Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi]]'s [[National Peoples Party (Pakistan)|National Peoples Party]], and [[Qazi Hussain Ahmed]]'s [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] against [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] for the 1988 general elections. During that time [[Nawaz Sharif]] became the most prominent politician outside PPP, and eventually became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1990.

After Junejo dismissed by Gen Zia ul Haq, Nawaz Sharif parted with the PML, and created his own faction called the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML (N)]], which became a major political party far more influential than the original PML. Junejo's death also marked the formation of PML (Junejo) in 1993 led by his supporters including [[Hamid Nasir Chattha]] and Iqbal Ahmed Khan.

There was a party split within PML (Junejo) when [[Manzoor Wattoo]] in 1995 parted ways with his cousin [[Hamid Nasir Chattha]] and created his own [[Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah)|PML (Jinnah)]]. The party broke because Chattha wanted to be the president of PML (Junejo), much to the annoyance of Wattoo. The differences cropped up in the same year when Wattoo was removed as the [[Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab Chief Minister]] in the power struggle between the province (headed by PML (Junejo) and the center (headed by rival [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]), leading Arif Nakai another PML (Junejo) candidate to be the new Chief Minister. 

At the [[Pakistani general election, 2002|2002 general elections]] held on October 20, the party won 0.7% of the popular vote and 2 out of 272 elected members. Hamid Nasir Chattha was the head of the party. 

In May 2004, PML-J merged with PML-Q along with other parties to form united [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Ashraf|last = Mumtaz|url = http://www.dawn.com/2004/05/20/nat1.htm|title = Parties to inform EC about merger with PML|publisher = Dawn |date = May 20, 2004|accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pakistani general election, 2008|2008 general elections]], Hamid Nasir Chattha, being part of ruling PML-Q, lost his National Assembly seat.

The '''Belgian Army of Partisans''' ({{lang-fr|Armée belge des partisans}}), better known as the '''Armed Partisans''' ({{lang-fr|Partisans Armés}}) or '''PA''' was a group of the [[Belgian resistance]] during [[World War II]] and affiliated to the [[Belgian Communist Party]]. In 1941, many of its members left to join the ''[[Front de l'Independance]]'' while the rest of the group was undermined in 1943 when almost all the leadership of the group and the Communist Party were arrested by German forces.&lt;ref name=Conway21&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The sorrows of Belgium : liberation and political reconstruction, 1944-1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199694341|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107–171, Sec. 1301–1310) replaced the longtime (65-year) support program for peanuts with a framework identical in structure to the program for the so-called [[covered commodities]] (wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, soybeans, and other oilseeds). The three components of the '''Peanut Price Support Program''' are fixed direct payments (at $36/ton), [[counter-cyclical payments]] (based on a target price of $495/ton), and [[marketing assistance loans]] or [[loan deficiency payments]] (LDPs) (based on a loan rate of $355/ton). The [[peanut poundage quota]] and the [[two-tiered pricing]] features of the old program were repealed. Only [[historic peanut producers]] are eligible for the [[Direct and Counter-cyclical Program]] (DCP). All current production is eligible for marketing assistance loans and LDPs. Previous owners of peanut quota were compensated through a buy-out
program at a rate of 55¢/lb. ($1,100/ton) over a 5-year period.

The '''Peasant rebellion in Podhale''' (1669-1670) was a rebellion of rural residents of southern [[Poland|Polish]] region of [[Podhale]] against high taxes imposed on them by the government. It resulted in the defeat of the rebels. 

In the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[gorals]] of Podhale frequently opposed local authorities, high taxes and the rule of the [[szlachta|nobility]]: the best known such revolt was the [[Kostka-Napierski Uprising]], which took place in 1651. 

In late September 1669, a heavy cavalry unit of [[Jan Wielopolski]] (see [[Towarzysz pancerny]], [[Choragiew (military unit)]]) came to Podhale to spend winter in the region. By December, the cavalrymen had found their lodgings in the area of [[Nowy Targ]]: according to the legal regulations, local residents were obliged to provide food to the soldiers and their officers. Jan Wielopolski sent his envoys to the Podhale villages to collect the food and tax money. In response, the residents of [[Czarny Dunajec]] and [[Dzianisz]] attacked Wielopolski’s men, disarmed them, beat them up and robbed them. The envoys were then taken to Nowy Targ, where the locals tried to explain their actions to the officers of the unit. Wielopolski ordered the arrest of the peasants’ envoys, which resulted in widespread anger among the gorals. Several hundred peasants approached Nowy Targ, but no skirmish took place. 

When authorities in [[Krakow]] found out about the riots, they decided to pacify the rebellion, so that it would not spread over to other regions. On 6 April 1670 Crown [[Hetman]] [[Jan Sobieski]] sent seven [[choragiew|units]] (total of 1000 men), consisting mostly of foreign soldiers, to end the rebellion. Meanwhile the rebels had made thorough preparations for the expected action. They even created their own artillery, and divided their forces into several subunits. Apart from military preparations, the gorals sent a letter to King [[Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki]], in which they explained their reasons. 

In May 1670, Sobieski’s forces clashed with the rebels near Nowy Targ. The exact date of the battle is unknown, but it happened most likely between 1 and 3 May 1670. Rebel forces were located around the city, to protect local villages and their residents. The skirmish did not last long, as experienced and well-armed Crown units managed to destroy the rebels. Survivors fled to a nearby forest. The battle ended the rebellion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">The '''People’s Pledge''' is a formal campaign finance agreement between all candidates and their campaigns in a given election. It aims to reduce non-party group spending in an election by limiting expenditures to candidates’ campaigns and party committees.&lt;ref&gt;http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sitaraman-Ganesh.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pledge requires candidates to pay a penalty if outside spending groups spend on behalf of their campaign. Outside spending is defined as any [[independent expenditure]] by a non-party group to benefit a candidate.

The People’s Pledge was developed by [[Elizabeth Warren|Sen. Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Scott Brown (politician)|Sen. Scott Brown]] during the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2012|2012 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts]].  The candidates publicly called on outside groups to stop spending in support of either candidate. They then agreed to pay a penalty equal to half the amount of any outside expenditure from their campaign account to a charity of the opponent’s choice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/brown-warren-pledge-to-curb-outside-campaign-spending/2012/01/23/gIQAi4jbLQ_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2012|2012 U.S Senate election in Massachusetts]], the Pledge significantly reduced outside spending.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/05/01/common-cause-report-lauds-people-pledge/DoDoL3Iqj63RZ6F9BOe4PO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  People’s Pledges have been implemented in 2014 primary elections and proposed in numerous federal races. Nonprofits [[Common Cause]] and [[Public Citizen]] have launched a campaign to promote the People’s Pledge in the 2014 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoplespledge2014.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 2012 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, a People’s Pledge was implemented in the democratic primary for the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2013|2013 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbur.org/2013/02/13/markey-lynch-peoples-pledge&lt;/ref&gt;  and the democratic primary for the [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 gubernatorial election Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/content/20140428-3-democratic-candidates-for-r.i.-governor-sign-peoples-pledge-deal-on-outside-money.ece&lt;/ref&gt; The Pledge has been proposed by at least one candidate in the [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2012|2012 U.S. Senate election in Maine]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/06/maine_senate_candidate_challen.html&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Los Angeles mayoral election, 2013|2013 mayoral election in Los Angeles]]&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/01/la-mayor-race-peoples-pledge.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2014 U.S. Senate elections in [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 2014|Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kentucky.com/2014/05/28/3263685/group-challenges-grimes-and-mcconnell.html?sp=/99/164/329/&lt;/ref&gt;  [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2014|New Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmur.com/political-scoop/following-shaheen-sheaporter-asks-her-gop-opponents-to-take-peoples-pledge/25376296&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2014|Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/10/the-peoples-pledge-is-back-in-alaska-wait-what-the-heck-is-that/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5641">'''Peppermint extract''' is an [[herbal extract]] of [[peppermint]] (''Mentha x piperita'') made from the [[essential oils]] of peppermint leaves.  It is commonly used in [[cooking]], as a [[dietary supplement]], as an herbal or [[alternative medicine]], and as a pest repellent. The liquid is obtained by [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extracting]] the oils from dried or fresh leaves and the flowering tops of the plant using [[alcohol]]{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and is commonly sold in 1 oz. or 4 oz. bottles.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Uses in cooking==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Peppermint extract can be used to add a peppermint flavor to [[baked goods]], [[desserts]], and [[candy]], particularly [[candy canes]], [[mint (candy)|mints]], and peppermint patties. Extracts for cooking may be labeled as pure, natural, imitation, or artificial. While pure and natural extracts contain peppermint oil specifically, imitation and artificial extracts generally use a mix of ingredients to achieve a flavor resembling peppermint.

Peppermint extract can be substituted in [[recipes]] with peppermint oil (a stronger ingredient primarily used in candy-making), [[crème de menthe]], or [[schnapps|peppermint schnapps]]. If the food is not heated, the [[alcohol|alcoholic properties]] of [[liqueurs]] may remain present in the finished product.

Peppermint extract may also be added to hot water to create [[peppermint tea]].

== Medicinal uses ==
Medicinal uses of peppermint extract are well-documented, however the efficacy of most applications is only beginning to be confirmed in clinical trials. For example, Peppermint extract is commonly used to soothe symptoms of the [[common cold]] and the [[flu]], and as a [[digestion|digestive]] aid to relieve [[bloating]] and [[flatulence]]. It may be used to aid in the relief of pain from [[menstrual cramp]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.hermed.2016.05.001 |title=The effect of peppermint (Mentha piperita) capsules on the severity of primary dysmenorrhea |journal=Journal of Herbal Medicine |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=137–141 |year=2016 |last1=Heshmati |first1=Akram |last2=Dolatian |first2=Mahrokh |last3=Mojab |first3=Faraze |last4=Shakeri |first4=Nozhat |last5=Nikkhah |first5=Somayeh |last6=Mahmoodi |first6=Zohreh }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tension headaches]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} and because of its cooling properties, it may relieve itching when applied [[topical]]ly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}  Additionally, peppermint oil may be an effective remedy for [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]] (IBS) with constipation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.a2313 |pmid=19008265 |pmc=2583392 |title=Effect of fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: Systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |pages=a2313 |year=2008 |last1=Ford |first1=A.

It encompassed the area surrounded by the rivers [[Maritsa]] (Evros) in the east, [[Mesta River|Mesta]] (Nestos) in the west, the  [[Rhodope Mountains]] in the north and the [[Aegean Sea]] in the south. Its total territory was c. 8.600&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cangelaris.com/exmuh.htm |title=Panayotis D.

The whole of Western Thrace was captured by Bulgaria during the [[First Balkan war]] and awarded to the country by the Treaty of London. During the Second Balkan War the Greek Army captured most of the area between [[Xanthi|Skecha]] and the [[Maritsa river]] south of [[Soufli|Soflu]] without encountering resistance by the weak Bulgarian army which retreated to the southern slopes of the Rhodope mountains (several kilometers to the north of Skecha and [[Komotini|Gyumyurdzhina]]) while the Ottoman forces occupied the regions of Soflu, [[Didymoteicho|Dimotika]] and [[Ivaylovgrad|Ortakyoy]]. After the [[Second Balkan War]] the treaty of Bucharest was signed which returned the area to Bulgaria and the Greek army withdrew from Western Thrace. Thereupon local Muslims and Greeks petitioned, with the encouragement of the Greek authorities refused to recognize the Bulgarian control of the area and petitioned the Ottoman army to occupy Western Thrace. On their invitation the region was then occupied by small Ottoman forces, largely irregulars. While the area had been returned to Bulgaria by the Bucharest treaty, the Bulgarian army wished to conflict with the Ottomans and retreated to a line coinciding with the pre-Balkan war border up to [[Zornitsa, Haskovo Province|Aydomush]] and from there along a ridge of the Rhodope mountains running west of [[Zlatograd|Daridere]] and east of [[Madan, Smolyan Province|Madan]] up to the Bulgarian-Greek border.&lt;ref&gt;The Destruction of Thracian Bulgarians in 1913, Lybomir Miletich, 1918, p. [http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/bmark/lm_tr/lm_tr_pril_1.htm 205]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the retreat of both the Bulgarian and Greek armies an autonomous state was declared with Ottoman support, in order to avoid Bulgarian rule after the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], in which the Ottomans had not taken part. Under British pressure, the Bulgaria and the Ottomans signed the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1913)|Treaty of Constantinople]], which satisfied the Turkish claims to recognition of [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] and recognized Western Thrace as part of Bulgaria. The Ottomans withdrew their forces and by 25 October, and the area was returned by Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="bakalopoulos_meiz_thrakh_p234_235"&gt;{{cite book | title=''Ιστορία της Μείζονος Θράκης, από την πρώιμη Οθωμανοκρατία μέχρι τις μέρες μας,'' History of Greater Thrace, from early Ottoman rule until nowadays | author=Constantinos Vacalopoulos | year=2004 | publisher=Publisher Antonios Stamoulis | location=Thessaloniki | page=282 | isbn=960-8353-45-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern part of the former Provisional government was occupied in 1918 by [[France|French]] forces. This area was finally [[Treaty of Neuilly|annexed by]] [[Greece]] in 1920 and has been part of that country ever since, except for the Bulgarian occupation between 1941–1944. The northern part of the former Provisional Government remained part of Bulgaria after 1919.

The capital of Provisional Government of Western Thrace capital was [[Gümülcine]], now [[Komotini]], in [[Greece]]. 

== Overview ==
'''President''': Hoca Salih Efendi.

'''Army''': Standing force of 29,170, largely infantry. Commander of the Armed Forces &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Çeçen, Anıl, Tarihte Türk Devletleri, Milliyet Kültür Yayınları, İstanbul 1986&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2011}} was [[Süleyman Askerî Bey]].

'''Steering Committee''': Reshid Bey, Raif Effendi, Hafous Salih Effendi, Nicodimos (commissioner of the Diocese of Maroneia, representing the Greeks), Mikirditch Tabakian (Armenian), Yaka Cassavi (Jew), Hafous Galip and Eshref Bey Kushchubasi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triklopodia.gr/2013/09/blog-post_2868.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193427/http://www.triklopodia.gr/2013/09/blog-post_2868.html |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as independence was declared the Provisional Government of Western Thrace determined the borders of the country, put up the new flags on the official buildings, commissioned a national anthem, raised an army, published its own stamps &lt;ref name="dcstamps.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcstamps.com/?p=2561 |title=Western Thrace, Autonomous Government (1913) » Dead Country Stamps and Banknotes |website=Dcstamps.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passports&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2011}}, and prepared the budget of the new country.

A Jewish citizen, Samuel Karaso, was tasked by the government with establishing an official press agency and to publish a newspaper named ''Müstakil'' ("Independent") in Turkish and [[French language|French]]. The Ottoman Laws and Regulations were adopted without any change and the cases started to be heard by the Court of Western Thrace.

However, it was widely believed at the time that her dismissal was in response to her activities promoting the equality of [[African-American]]s during a time when the leading citizens of the city were not ready to face equality for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiegard |first=Wayne |title=This Month 49 years Ago... |journal=American Librarian |date=June–July 1999 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Caute |authorlink=David Caute |title=The Great Fear: the Anti-Communist purge under Truman and Eisenhower |location=London |publisher=Secker and Warburg |year=1978 |isbn=0-436-09511-4 |page=454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Brown was born in [[Hiawatha, Kansas]] on July 26, 1891 to Silas and Jennie Brown, two [[New England]] transplants.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p28&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Louise S.|title=''The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown''|location=[[Norman, Oklahoma]]|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2000|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived with her parents and brother Merrit in Kansas until the family moved to California where Brown went to high school. She attended high school in [[California]] and then [[Northwestern Oklahoma State University|Northwestern State Normal School]] in [[Alva, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p28 /&gt; Graduating in 1910, Brown then attended the [[University of Oklahoma]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]], graduating in 1915. Brown also attended the School of Library Service of Columbia University during summers, where she was worked with [[Helen E. Haines]] and [[Ernestine Rose]], both of which were fierce supporters of intellectual freedom.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Louise S. ''The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Brown taught in [[Eufaula, Oklahoma|Eufaula]] and [[Nowata, Oklahoma|Nowata]] but chose not to continue in the profession. Instead she wanted to move back home to be closer to her parents, especially her mother who was confined to a wheelchair. Brown moved to the small town of [[Bartlesville]] in 1919, where her parents now lived.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p28 /&gt; In November 1919, Brown accepted the job a librarian at the local [[Carnegie library]] in Bartlesville.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p28 /&gt; She felt a calling to her work and said she would not marry because the library was "like a marriage to her."&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; She was passionate about the children who visited the library, knew them all by name, and even persuaded some to become librarians.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Louise S. ''The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the Oklahoma Library Association (OLA), Brown was elected secretary in 1920, treasurer in 1926, and president in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Louise S. ''The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000 p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; During her presidential year she gave a speech which advised librarians to "reduce to a minimum worry about lost books" and to encourage the many who did not "make use of their right to library service."&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p32&gt;Robbins, Louise S. ''The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000 p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  She stated that libraries should provide "recreational culture suited to all needs" of the community they served which was a forward-thinking idea for libraries at that time.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p32 /&gt; Like Ranganathan's first law, she believed books were for use and wanted "books worn out by use."&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p32 /&gt; Brown truly believed that the library should be both a repository for information and a source for wholesome recreation.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p32 /&gt;

Brown was a library advocate during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]] and provided useful materials for the unemployed men in the community as well as their families. She also documented how her materials were used, sometimes in great detail. For example, in 1931, she reported that the library’s collection of 20,062 volumes had been used 13.19 times by every person in her service area. She was also a fervent believer in the principle of "equity of access" with her commitment to [[racial equality]] in the use of the public library.&lt;ref name=Robbins1/&gt;

==Activities leading to dismissal==
[[File:Original Bartlesville Public Library.jpg|thumb|right|The original Bartlesville Public Library, which was built with a Carnegie library grant. Ruth W. Brown worked there.]]
Brown had long worked for equal rights for all citizens. As early as the 1920s she was working to allow equal access to the library for African-Americans.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; 

In 1946, after the observing how [[Military history of African Americans|African-American soldiers fought in the army]] for [[Racial segregation in the United States|rights they were denied at home]], Brown helped established the Committee on the Practice of Democracy (COPD) in Bartlesville .&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; The COPD worked to improve "relations among people of all races; more particularly, to foster improvement of conditions arising out of discrimination based on race, creed, or color."&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; Later the same year, the Bartlesville chapter of COPD decided to affiliate with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) becoming the only chapter of CORE below the [[Mason–Dixon line]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Louise S. (2007). "Responses to the Resurrection of Miss Ruth Brown: An Essay on the Reception of a Historical Case Study". ''Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record'' 42 (4). p.423&lt;/ref&gt; The group quickly went into action working to recruit an African-American doctor to live and work in the black community of Bartlesville.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np&gt;Robbins, L. S. (1996). Racism and censorship in cold war Oklahoma: The case of Ruth W. Brown and the Bartlesville public. ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'', 100(1)&lt;/ref&gt; They, together with the YWCA, sponsored interracial conferences and seminars featuring black and white speakers.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt;

In 1939, only 99 of the 774 Southern public libraries provided services for African American patrons.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p38&gt;Robbins, Louise S. ''The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Though these libraries were under the doctrine of “[[separate but equal]]”, African American libraries received inadequate reading materials, short hours, and minimal budgets.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000p38 /&gt; In the Bartlesville Public Library, Brown had been providing service to African Americans since the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt;  Records show borrower's names in the registry and a small number are identified as "colored".  By 1950, the library subscribed to ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' and ''[[Negro Digest]]''.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; Apparently, Brown was also interested in integrating the children's story time but was dissuaded from doing so by the library commission.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt;  She then turned her attention to an educational exhibit on "Negro Culture from Africa to Today".&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt;  On a personal note, Brown was pushing the cultural norms and limits in many ways. She upset many in the community when she took two female, African-American teachers to a local diner in downtown Bartlesville.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; The diner refused to serve them and Brown and her companions staged what later became known (during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968)|1960s Civil Rights protests]]) as a "sit-in".&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; She took African-American friends with her to church and promoted a lecture by [[Bayard Rustin]], an African-American Quaker pacifist.&lt;ref name=Robbins2000np /&gt; Almost immediately the leaders of the community began to work to remove Brown.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt;

The battle between the [[American Legion]] and librarian Ruth W. Brown over materials in the Bartlesville Public Library (BPL) revealed the racial tensions in 1950s Oklahoma and the use of [[McCarthyist]] tactics to counter the forces of [[racial integration|integration]].

A citizens' committee was formed to work towards her dismissal.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; Though it now seems apparent that the true reason behind the anger in the community was a backlash against integration, at the time even the city leaders and commission realized that Brown could not be fired because of her political views and her civil rights activities as they all took place on her own time.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; Instead, the citizen's group against Brown attacked her for having supposedly subversive materials in the library.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; The library board was asked by the city commission to perform a complete examination of the library's collection and the general operations and work ethic of Brown.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt;  After a thorough examination, the library board reported that they could not find any evidence of subversive materials or subversive teachings.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt;

On March 9, 1950, The Bartlesville paper, the ''[[Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise|Examiner-Enterprise]]'', published a picture of the materials in question.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; The picture showed a pile of copies of ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'' (magazines that were now being questioned but which had been subscribed to by the library for years) with two books on top.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; The first book was ''The Russians: the land, the people and why they fight'' and the other was pictured without its dust jacket or any library markings.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; There was never any acknowledgement or admission by the paper of where this picture was taken. It had not been authorized by the library board and the books on top could never again be located.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; The library board, the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee and Brown were locked in a battle with the Bartlesville city leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlesville.lib.ok.us/aboutlibrary/missbrown.htm|title=Miss Ruth Brown|work=Bartlesville Public Library|accessdate=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Brown is nationally recognized as the first librarian to receive assistance from the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name=Robbins2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.bartlesville.lib.ok.us/aboutlibrary/missbrown.htm Bartlesville Library: Miss Brown]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, the city commission thanked the library board for its service and summarily dismissed them all.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; A new board was immediately appointed which supported the city's position regarding Brown. The campaign to fire her was almost complete and though "everyone knows what they are really fighting" as Brown later commented to a friend, her opponents chose the [[McCarthy era]] scare tactics as a more viable way to rid the city of her progressive views on racial equality.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; Brown was interviewed by the city commission on July 25, 1950. She refused to answer questions about her private life except in writing at her attorney's request.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; When asked about having the subversive materials (''New Republic'', ''The Nation'', ''Soviet Russia Today'') in the library she responded that they were three of seventy-five publications to which she subscribed. Further, she continued, she did not feel she should censor what her public chose to read and that she had subscribed to them for 15 or 20 years. However, in spite of no clear evidence of subversion, she was fired the same day.&lt;ref name=dc /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt;

Allegations of subversive Communist activity centered on threatening the "[[American way of life]]", as it was put by one of her antagonists, the postmaster and library board chairman E. R. Christopher. Bartlesville's elite resorted to [[censorship]] and suppression to silence the proponents of racial justice and equality and rid the library of supposedly subversive material. McCarthyism was an effective means to ensure the preservation of Bartlesville's conservative power structure.&lt;ref name=Robbins2&gt;Robbins, L. S. (1996). "Racism and censorship in Cold War Oklahoma: the case of Ruth W. Brown and the Bartlesville Public Library". ''[[Southwestern Historical Quarterly]]'', (1), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Bartlesville commission's public position was that Brown was fired for insubordination, to the outside it appeared she had been fired for trying to protect the library's position of intellectual freedom and the right to free speech.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; A group of supporters, calling themselves the Friends of Miss Brown, tried to pursue her cause in court but were unsuccessful due to a lack of constitutional standing. Though she was unsuccessful, her Friends managed to keep her case in the public eye for quite some time. The [[Oklahoma Library Association]] as well as the ALA and the [[ACLU]] all protested the attack on intellectual freedom and Bartlesville continued to be scrutinized on a national level.&lt;ref name=Robbins1996np /&gt; This attention surprised and embarrassed the town which wished to go back to the way things were and end the spotlight on Bartlesville.&lt;ref name=Robbins2007np&gt;Robbins, Louise S. (2007). "Responses to the Resurrection of Miss Ruth Brown: An Essay on the Reception of a Historical Case Study". Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record 42 (4).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2007, a bronze bust of Brown was unveiled at the Bartlesville Library and a library scholarship fund was established in her honor.&lt;ref name=Robbins2007np /&gt;

==Personal life==
Although Brown never married, she did attempt to adopt two sisters who were [[orphan]]ed. The welfare agency was unwilling to place them with Brown who was unmarried. The eldest, Mildred "Holly" Holiday, ran away from her abusive [[foster parent]]s when she was eighteen and went back to live with Brown. Holly's sister Ellen then ran away to live with Brown who was finally able to adopt the youngest girl.&lt;ref name=Robbins1/&gt;

==Popular culture==
The events in Columbia Picture's 1956 movie ''[[Storm Center]]'' were largely fictional, but the character played by [[Bette Davis]] was based on Ruth Brown and her struggle with the county commission over communist literature.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association (N.D.).

'''Securities fraud''', also known as '''stock fraud''' and '''investment fraud''', is a deceptive practice in the stock or [[commodity market|commodities market]]s that induces investors to make purchase or sale decisions on the basis of false information, frequently resulting in losses, in violation of securities laws.&lt;ref name = "Securities Fraud Awareness &amp; Prevention Tips" &gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/securities-fraud "Securities Fraud Awareness &amp; Prevention Tips] faq by FBI, accessed February 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref name=NYT021013&gt;{{cite news|title=Complex Investments Prove Risky as Savers Chase Bigger Payoff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/business/wave-of-investor-fraud-extends-to-ordinary-retirement-savers.html|accessdate=February 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2013|author=Nathaniel Popper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASAA2012&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 NASAA Top Investor Threats|url=http://www.nasaa.org/3752/top-investor-threats/|publisher=North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)|accessdate=February 11, 2013|quote=A con artist will use every trick in the book to take advantage of unsuspecting investors, including exploiting well-intended laws, in order to fatten their wallets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Securities fraud can also include outright theft from investors ([[embezzlement]] by [[stockbrokers]]), [[stock manipulation]], misstatements on a public company's financial reports, and lying to corporate auditors. The term encompasses a wide range of other actions, including [[insider trading]], [[front running]] and other illegal acts on the trading floor of a stock or commodity exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts092606lct.htm|title=Testimony: Testimony Concerning Insider Trading(Linda Chatman Thomsen, September 26, 2006)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trading Scandal May Strengthen Stock Exchange |publisher= New York Times |date=April 14, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/14/business/14place.html |accessdate= May 3, 2008 |first=Floyd |last=Norris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco FBI web link, supra&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of securities fraud==

===Corporate fraud===

====Corporate misconduct====
Fraud by high level corporate officials became a subject of wide national attention during the early 2000s, as exemplified by corporate officer misconduct at [[Enron]]. It became a problem of such scope that the Bush Administration announced what it described as an "aggressive agenda" against corporate fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/corporateresponsibility/ |title=The President's Leadership in Combating Corporate Fraud |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less widely publicized manifestations continue, such as the securities fraud conviction of Charles E. Johnson Jr., founder of [[PurchasePro]] in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/15/AR2008051504052.html |title=Ex-PurchasePro Chief Found Guilty of Fraud, Obstruction |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2008-05-16|accessdate=2012-02-18 |first=Cecilia |last=Kang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-[[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] predicted in April 2008 that corporate fraud cases will increase because of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/FedCrimes/story?id=4677410 ABCnews.go.com], Retrieved May 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dummy corporations====
[[Dummy corporations]] may be created by [[fraud]]sters to create the illusion of being an existing corporation with a similar name. [[Fraud]]sters then sell securities in the dummy corporation by misleading the investor into thinking that they are buying shares in the real corporation.

===Internet fraud===

According to enforcement officials of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], criminals engage in [[Pump and dump|pump-and-dump]] schemes, in which false and/or fraudulent information is disseminated in chat rooms, forums, internet boards and via email (spamming), with the purpose of causing a dramatic price increase in thinly traded stocks or stocks of shell companies (the "pump").

When the price reaches a certain level, criminals immediately sell off their holdings of those stocks (the "dump"), realizing substantial profits before the stock price falls back to its usual low level. Any buyers of the stock who are unaware of the fraud become victims once the price falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud.htm |title=Internet Fraud: How to Avoid Internet Investment Scams |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC says that Internet fraud resides in several forms:

* Online investment newsletters that offer seemingly unbiased information free of charge about featured companies or recommending "stock picks of the month." These newsletter writers then sell shares, previously acquired at lower prices, when hype-generated buying drives the stock price up. This practice is known as [[scalping (trading)|scalping]]. Conflict of interest disclosures incorporated into a newsletter article may not be sufficient. Accused of scalping, [[Thom Calandra]], formerly of [[MarketWatch]], was the subject of an [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] enforcement action in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp19028.pdf|title=SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, I COMPLAINT VS. THOM CALANDRA, Defendant |publisher=sec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/personalfinance/2004/01/23/cz_nv_0123calandra.html |title=Calandra Quits Amid Probe, Forbes, January 23, 2004, article |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |first=Nathan |last=Vardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bulletin boards that often contain fraudulent messages by hucksters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud.htm |title=Internet Fraud |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Phishing]]

===Insider trading===
{{main article|Insider trading}}

There are two types of "insider trading". The first is the trading of a corporation's stock or other security by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, or holders of more than ten percent of the firm's shares. This is generally legal, but there are certain reporting requirements.&lt;ref name="Harrisp584"&gt;Larry Harris, ''Trading &amp; Exchanges'', Oxford Press, Oxford, 2003. Chapter 29 "Insider Trading" p. 584&lt;/ref&gt;

The other type of insider trading is the purchase or sale of a security based on material non-public information. This type of trading is illegal in most instances. In illegal insider trading, an insider or a related party trades based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise misappropriated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/about/laws.shtml#secexact1934 Laws that Govern the Securities Industry] U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accessed March 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microcap fraud===
{{main article|Microcap stock fraud}}

In [[Microcap stock|microcap]] fraud, stocks of small companies of under $250 million market capitalization are deceptively promoted, then sold to an unwary public. This type of fraud has been estimated to cost investors $1–3 billion annually.&lt;ref name="SIPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipc.org/who/notfdic.aspx |title=Securities Investor Protection Corporation &gt; Who &gt; Not FDIC |publisher=SIPC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microcap fraud includes [[pump and dump]] schemes involving [[Boiler room (business)|boiler rooms]] and scams on the Internet. Many, but not all, microcap stocks involved in frauds are [[penny stock]]s, which trade for less than $5 a share.

Many penny stocks, particularly those that sell for fractions of a cent, are thinly traded. They can become the target of [[stock promoter]]s and [[stock manipulation|manipulators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pump&amp;Dump.con|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/pump.htm|author=SEC|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|date=2005-01-11|accessdate=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These manipulators first purchase large quantities of stock, then artificially inflate the share price through false and misleading positive statements. This is referred to as a pump and dump scheme. The pump and dump is a form of [[microcap stock fraud]]. In more sophisticated versions of the fraud, individuals or organizations buy millions of shares, then use newsletter websites, chat rooms, stock message boards, press releases, or e-mail blasts to drive up interest in the stock. Very often, the perpetrator will claim to have "inside" information about impending news to persuade the unwitting investor to quickly buy the shares. When buying pressure pushes the share price up, the rise in price entices more people to believe the hype and to buy shares as well. Eventually the manipulators doing the "pumping" end up "dumping" when they sell their holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spams and Scams|url=http://www.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/FraudsAndScams/index.htm|author=FINRA|publisher=Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|year=2012|accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expanding use of the Internet and personal communication devices has made penny stock scams easier to perpetrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet Makes Scams Easy|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/06/12/BU11242.DTL|author=Harry Domash|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2000-06-12|accessdate=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it has also drawn high-profile public personalities into the sphere of regulatory oversight. Though not a scam per se, one notable example is rapper [[50 Cent|50 Cent's]] use of [[Twitter]] to cause the price of a penny stock (HNHI) to increase dramatically. 50 Cent had previously invested in 30 million shares of the company, and as a result made $8.7 million in profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/11/50-cent-makes-87-million-on-twitter-encourages-fans-to-invest-in-scheme_n_807327.html|title=Importing By Encouraging Fans To Invest |date=11 January 2011|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=30 March 2012|first=Jordan|last=Zakarin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of an activity that skirts the borderline between legitimate promotion and hype is the case of LEXG. Described (but perhaps overstated) as "the biggest stock promotion of all time", Lithium Exploration Group's market capitalization soared to over $350 million, after an extensive direct mail campaign. The promotion drew upon the legitimate growth in production and use of lithium, while touting Lithium Exploration Groups position within that sector. According to the company's December 31, 2010, form 10-Q (filed within months of the direct mail promotion), LEXG was a lithium company without assets. Its revenues and assets at that time were zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/268947-lithium-exploration-group-beware-of-mailmen-bearing-gifts|title=Lithium Exploration Group: Beware of Mailmen Bearing Gifts|date=10 May 2011|publisher=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gary Weiss"&gt;{{cite news|title=Investors Beware|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1997/50/b3557003.htm|author=Gary Weiss|publisher=Business Week|date=1997-12-15|accessdate=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the company did acquire lithium production/exploration properties, and addressed concerns raised in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lithium Exploration Group |url=http://www.thechairmansblog.com/alex-walsh/2012-07/lexg-answers-dean-beeby-of-the-canadian-press-on-lithium-mining.html |title=LEXG Answers Dean Beeby of The Canadian Press on Lithium Mining |publisher=the chairmans blog |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104233354/http://www.thechairmansblog.com/alex-walsh/2012-07/lexg-answers-dean-beeby-of-the-canadian-press-on-lithium-mining.html |archivedate=2013-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/mariposa-resources-ltd/index.html |title=Lithium Exploration Group Inc. News - Company Information - The New York Times |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penny stock companies often have low liquidity. Investors may encounter difficulty selling their positions after the buying pressure has abated, and the manipulators have fled.

===Accountant fraud===
{{further|Accounting scandals}}

In 2002, a wave of separate but often related accounting scandals became known to the public in the U.S. All of the leading public accounting firms—Arthur Andersen, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers— and others have admitted to or have been charged with negligence to identify and prevent the publication of falsified financial reports by their corporate clients which had the effect of giving a misleading impression of their client companies' financial status. In several cases, the monetary amounts of the fraud involved are in the billions of USD.&lt;ref name="ENRON"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,263006,00.html|title=Called to Account|first=Cathy Booth|last=Thomas|date=18 June 2002|publisher=|via=time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boiler rooms===
{{main article|Boiler room (business)|l1=Boiler room}}
Boiler rooms or boiler houses are stock brokerages that put undue pressure on clients to trade using telesales, usually in pursuit of [[microcap]] fraud schemes.  Some boiler rooms offer clients transactions fraudulently, such as those with an undisclosed profitable relationship to the brokerage. Some 'boiler rooms' are not licensed but may be 'tied agents' of a brokerage house which itself is licensed or not. Securities sold in boiler rooms include commodities and [[private placements]] as well as [[microcap]] stocks, non-existent, or distressed stock and stock supplied by an intermediary at an undisclosed markup.

===Mutual Fund fraud===
{{main article|2003 Mutual-fund scandal}}
A number of major brokerages and mutual fund firms were accused of various deceptive acts that disadvantaged customers. Among them were late trading and market timing. Various SEC rules were enacted to curtail this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mutual Fund Trading Scandals |publisher=Journal of Accountancy |date=December 2004 |url= http://www.aicpa.org/pubs/jofa/dec2004/carroll.htm  |accessdate= May 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank of America Capital Management was accused by the SEC of having undisclosed arrangements with customers to allow short term trading.&lt;ref&gt;SEC Admin. Proc. File No. 3-11818, February 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short selling abuses===
{{main article|Pump and dump|Short and distort}}
Abusive [[short selling]], including certain types of [[naked short selling]], are also considered securities fraud because they can drive down stock prices. In abusive naked short selling, stock is sold without being borrowed and without any intent to borrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Points About Regulation SHO |publisher= Securities and Exchange Commission |url=
https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/keyregshoissues.htm |accessdate= May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of spreading false information about stocks, to drive down their prices, is called "short and distort." During the takeover of [[Bear Stearns]] by [[J.P. Morgan Chase]] in March 2008, reports swirled that shorts were spreading rumors to drive down Bear Stearns' share price. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said this was more than rumors and said, "This is about collusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Wave of Vilifying Short Sellers |publisher= New York Times |date=April 30, 2008 |url=
https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/business/30shorts.html |accessdate= May 15, 2008 |first=Jenny |last=Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ponzi schemes===
{{Main article|Ponzi scheme}}
A Ponzi scheme is an [[investment fund]] where withdrawals are financed by subsequent investors, rather than profit obtained through investment activities. The largest instance of securities fraud committed by an individual ever is [[Madoff investment scandal|a Ponzi scheme]] operated by former [[NASDAQ]] chairman [[Bernard Madoff]], which caused up to an estimated $64.8 billion in losses depending on which method is used to calculate the losses prior to its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aHSYu2UPYrfo|title=Bernard Madoff Gets 150 Years in Jail for Epic Fraud|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2009-08-05|date=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE52A5JK20090311?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true|title=Madoff mysteries remain as he nears guilty plea|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-08-05|date=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pervasiveness of securities fraud==

The [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] (SIPC) reports that the [[Federal Trade Commission]], [[FBI]], and state securities regulators estimate that investment fraud in the United States ranges from $10–$40 billion annually. Of that number, SIPC estimates that $1–3 Billion is directly attributable to microcap stock fraud.&lt;ref name="SIPC" /&gt; Fraudulent schemes perpetrated in the securities and commodities markets can ultimately have a devastating impact on the viability and operation of these markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iowa Insurance Division |url=http://www.iid.state.ia.us/docs/investoreducation1.pdf |accessdate=May 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923133427/http://www.iid.state.ia.us/docs/investoreducation1.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class action securities fraud lawsuits rose 43 percent between 2006 and 2007, according to the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse. During 2006 and 2007, securities fraud class actions were driven by market wide events, such as the 2006 backdating scandal and the 2007 subprime crisis. Securities fraud lawsuits remained below historical averages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse |url= http://securities.stanford.edu/scac_press/20080103_YIR07_Press_Release.pdf |accessdate= May 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manifestations of this [[white collar crime]] have become more frequent as the [[Internet]] gives criminals greater access to prey. The trading volume in the United States [[Securities#The securities markets|securities and commodities market]]s, having grown dramatically in the 1990s, has led to an increase in [[fraud]] and misconduct by [[investors]], [[corporate officer|executives]], [[shareholders]], and other market participants.

Securities fraud is becoming more complex as the industry develops more complicated [[investment vehicle]]s. In addition, white collar criminals are expanding the scope of their fraud and are looking outside the United States for new markets, new investors, and [[Bank secrecy|banking secrecy havens]] to hide [[unjust enrichment]].

A study conducted by the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in the mid-1990s reveals approximately 51.4 million individuals owned some type of traded [[stock]], while 200 million individuals owned securities indirectly. These same financial markets provide the opportunity for wealth to be obtained and the opportunity for white collar criminals to take advantage of unwary investors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Recovery of [[assets]] from the proceeds of securities fraud is a resource intensive and expensive undertaking because of the cleverness of fraudsters in concealment of assets and [[money laundering]], as well as the tendency of many criminals to be [[conspicuous consumption|profligate spenders]]. A victim of securities fraud is usually fortunate to recover any money from the defrauder.

Sometimes the losses caused by securities fraud are difficult to quantify. For example, insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf "The World Price of Insider Trading"] by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the Journal of Finance, Vol. LVII, No. 1 (Feb. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of victims and perpetrators==
Any investor can become a victim, but persons aged fifty years or older are most often victimized, whether as direct purchasers in securities or indirect purchasers through [[pension]] funds. Not only do investors lose but so can creditors, taxing authorities, and employees.

Potential perpetrators of securities fraud within a publicly traded firm include any dishonest official within the company who has access to the payroll or financial reports that can be manipulated to:

#overstate assets
#overstate revenues
#understate costs
#understate liabilities
#understate pennystock

[[Enron Corporation]]&lt;ref name="ENRON" /&gt; exemplifies all five tendencies, and its failure demonstrates the extreme dangers of a culture of corruption within a publicly traded corporation. The rarity of such spectacular failures of a corporation from securities fraud attests to the general reliability of most executives and boards of large corporations.

==Other effects of securities fraud==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
Even if the effect of securities fraud is not enough to cause bankruptcy, a lesser level can wipe out holders of common stock because of the leverage of value of shares upon the difference between assets and liabilities. Such fraud has been known as [[watered stock]], analogous to the practice of force-feeding livestock great amounts of water to inflate their weight before sale to dealers.

==Penny stock regulation==

The regulation and prosecution of securities fraud violations is undertaken on a broad front, involving numerous government agencies and [[self-regulatory organization]]s. One method of regulating and restricting a specific type of fraud perpetrated by pump and dump [[stock manipulation|manipulators]], is to target the category of stocks most often associated with this scheme. To that end, penny stocks have been the target of heightened enforcement efforts. In the United States, regulators have defined a [[penny stock]] as a security that must meet a number of specific standards. The criteria include price, [[market capitalization]], and minimum [[shareholder|shareholder equity]]. Securities traded on a national [[stock exchange]], regardless of price, are exempt from regulatory designation as a penny stock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-51983.pdf|title=SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION|publisher=sec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it is thought that exchange traded securities are less vulnerable to [[market manipulation|manipulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-117.htm |title=SEC Charges Eight Participants in Penny Stock Manipulation Ring |date=May 21, 2009 |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[CitiGroup]] (NYSE:C) and other [[NYSE]] listed securities which  traded below $1.00 during the market downturn of 2008–2009, while properly regarded as "low priced" securities, were not technically "penny stocks". Although penny stock trading in the United States is now primarily controlled through [[rulemaking|rules]] and regulations enforced by the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA), the genesis of this control is found in State securities law. The [[State of Georgia]] was the first state to [[codification (law)|codify]] a comprehensive penny stock securities law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/business/fi-532_1_penny-stock |title=Georgia to OK Tough Law for Penny Stocks |date=March 20, 1990 |author=Stan Darden |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=[[UPI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State [[Max Cleland]], whose office enforced State securities laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ga.gov/securities/|title=Georgia Secretary of State|publisher=sos.ga.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], the only [[stockbroker]] in the [[Georgia General Assembly]] at the time, was principal sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Georgia's penny stock law was subsequently challenged in court. However, the law was eventually upheld in [[U.S. District Court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/111783/GEORGIA-LAW-WONT-HURT-BROKERS-JUDGE-RULES.html?pg=all |title=GEORGIA LAW WON'T HURT BROKERS, JUDGE RULES |date=July 11, 1990 |work=Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[statute]] became the template for laws enacted in other states. Shortly thereafter, both FINRA and the SEC enacted comprehensive revisions of their penny stock regulations. These regulations proved effective in either closing or greatly restricting [[broker-dealer|broker/dealers]], such as Blinder, Robinson &amp; Company, which specialized in the penny stocks sector. Meyer Blinder was jailed for securities fraud in 1992, after the collapse of his firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/business/penny-stock-fraud-from-both-sides-now.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Penny-Stock Fraud, From Both Sides Now |author=Diana B. Henriques |date=February 16, 2003 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sanctions under these specific regulations lack an effective means to address [[pump and dump]] schemes perpetrated by unregistered groups and individuals.

{{Apartheid}}
The '''storming of the Kempton Park World Trade Centre''' took place in [[South Africa]] on 25 June 1993 when approximately three thousand members of the [[Afrikaner Volksfront]] (AVF), [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB) and other right-wing [[Afrikaner]]  paramilitary groups stormed the World Trade Centre in [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]], near [[Johannesburg]]. At the time of the attack the World Trade Centre was the venue for multi-party [[CODESA|negotiations]] to end the [[apartheid]] system through the country's first multi-racial elections. These negotiations were strongly opposed by right-wing white groups in South Africa.  The invasion came after other clashes between police and right-wingers, such as the [[Battle of Ventersdorp]], and much belligerent rhetoric from right-wing leaders such as [[Eugene Terre'Blanche]] of the AWB.

==Storming of the negotiation venue==
A protest led by the AVF was scheduled for 25 June outside the negotiation venue. At 8 a.m. protesters began arriving, and began harassing delegates to the negotiations.

The mood had begun as a festive one, with AWB supporters bringing their families, as well as barbecuing equipment and other provisions, associations one would normally make with a peaceful sit-in or protest. However, the mood changed for the worse when members of Terre'Blanche's personal bodyguard wing, the Ystergarde (Iron Guard) began rocking cars; many were armed, paramilitary members of various right-wing organisations, carrying firearms and other weapons. 

A 'Viper' armoured vehicle was used to crash through the glass windows of the WTC allowing supporters, carrying firearms and chanting "AWB", to invade the premises. Police attempted to form a cordon to prevent the invasion but were ineffective. A police captain who tried to prevent the vehicle from breaking through was assaulted and suffered internal bleeding.&lt;ref name=goldstone&gt;{{cite web|

The protesters painted slogans on the walls, urinated over furniture, and harassed delegates.  Damage was estimated at more than 700,000 [[South African Rand|Rand]].&lt;ref name=goldstone/&gt;  

The protesters also held a prayer meeting in the main negotiating chamber. Before leaving, negotiations with the police were held in which it was agreed that no members would be arrested that day. The departure was peaceful compared to the entrance. 

General [[Constand Viljoen]], a conservative Afrikaner leader who was participating in the negotiations, later denied that the invasion was planned by the Afrikaner Volksfront as part of their protest, and criticised the AWB members who had "got out of hand".&lt;ref name=constand&gt;{{cite web|

==Goldstone Commission==

The [[Goldstone Commission]], headed by Justice [[Richard Goldstone]], was tasked with investigating the protest. The commission found that the [[South African Police]] protecting the negotiations had been completely ineffective, that the protesters had broken the law and breached agreed conditions for their protest, and welcomed the arrest and charging of 60 persons. It found that the AWB members had acted as hooligans, and recommended that assurances from the AWB regarding the conduct of its members should not be relied on in future. It also made recommendations to further restrict public carrying of weapons, paramilitary uniforms and face covering during demonstrations.&lt;ref name=goldstone/&gt;

The first issue was published the same evening, allegedly printed from the repurposed presses that had printed ''Mein Kampf''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zerofsky|first1=Elisabeth|title=How a German Newspaper Became the Go-To Place for Leaks Like the Paradise Papers|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-a-german-newspaper-became-the-go-to-place-for-leaks-like-the-paradise-papers|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=11 November 2017|date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first article begins with:

A reversal in ad sales in the early 2000s was so severe that it brought the paper to the brink of bankruptcy in October 2002. The Süddeutsche survived through a 150 million euro investment by a new shareholder, a regional newspaper chain called Südwestdeutsche Medien. Over a period of three years, the newspaper underwent a reduction in its staff, from 425, to 307, the closing of a regional edition in Düsseldorf, and the scrapping of a section devoted to news from Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Landler (19 January 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/business/media-woes-at-two-pillars-of-german-journalism.html MEDIA; Woes at Two Pillars of German Journalism] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2004, ''SZ'' launched the ''Süddeutsche Bibliothek''. Each week, one out of 50 famous novels of the 20th century was made available in hardcover at certain newsstands and in book shops. Later a series of 50 influential movies on DVD followed. In late 2004 the daily also launched a [[popular science]] magazine, ''SZ Wissen''.&lt;ref name=eweb&gt;{{cite web|title=New trend in Germany: scientific magazines by Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung|url=http://wef.blogs.com/editors/2004/12/new_trend_in_ge_1.html|work=Editors Weblog|accessdate=5 October 2013|date=3 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2005 a series of children's books continued this branch of special editions.

In early 2015, the newspaper received a 2.6-[[terabyte]] data set from an anonymous source. The dataset contained confidential information of a law firm offering the management of offshore companies. The newspaper in conjunction with the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] reviewed the data from the ''[[Panama Papers]]'' for over a year before publishing stories from it on 3 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panama Papers.

In the late 2017, the newspaper released snippets from a 1.4-[[terabyte]] data set to be known as the ''[[Paradise Papers]]'' containing about 13.4 million documents, throwing light on the financial offshore jurisdictions, whose workings are unveiled, including Bermuda, the HQ of the main company involved, [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]], corporate services provider Estera, corporate registries in Caribbean and Singapore-based international trust and corporate services provider, [[Asiaciti Trust]]. It contains the names of more than 120,000 people and companies.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41877932 Paradise Papers: Your guide to four years of offshore revelations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107042727/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-41877932 |date=7 November 2017 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper called in the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] to oversee the investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian are among the nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. The leaked data covers seven decades, from 1950 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153 Paradise Papers: Everything you need to know about the leak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109071826/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153 |date=9 November 2017 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
The title, often abbreviated ''SZ'', translates as "South German Newspaper". It is read throughout Germany by 1.1 million readers daily and boasts a relatively high circulation abroad. The editorial stance of the newspaper is [[Liberalism|liberal]] and generally of [[centre-left]],&lt;ref name=spiegelonline/&gt;&lt;ref name=koopmans/&gt; leading some to joke that the ''SZ'' is the only opposition in the state of [[Bavaria]], which has been governed by the conservative [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] almost continuously since 1949. In the [[German election, 2013|2013 elections]] the paper was among the supporters of the [[SPD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Juan P.

''SZ'' is published in [[Newspaper format|Nordisch format]].&lt;ref name=adsm/&gt;

==Contents==

===Sections===
The national edition features four sections: Politics, Culture, Economy and Sports. Editions sold in Munich and its surrounding counties include local news inserts.

The ''SZ'' is well known for its daily frontpage column ''Streiflicht'' (searchlight) of 72 lines, which is published anonymously.

===Supplements===
*SZ Magazin (Friday), a magazine supplement
*Wochenende (Saturday), featuring longer articles and short stories for the weekend
*[[The New York Times]] (Friday), selected articles (English language).
*The TV programme (Tuesday) and an event guide (Thursday) are only included in the Bavarian edition.

===Articles in English===
''SZ'' has published ''[[International New York Times|The New York Times International Weekly]]'' on Mondays since 2004, now a supplement on Fridays, an 8-page broadsheet insert of English language articles from ''[[The New York Times]]''.

===Web presence===
Süddeutsche.de (formerly sueddeutsche.de) is the Internet portal of the ''Süddeutsche Zeitung''. The articles are made up of own contributions from the Süddeutsche.de editors, from texts that are taken over by the ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' and from agency reports. On the 50th birthday of the ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' launched on 6 October 1995 their internet edition under the name "SZonNet". The project went from SZ-Text Archive (now DIZ - Documentation and Information Center Munich) under the direction of Schmitt from Hella. At the beginning there were no own editors, but selected contents of the print edition have been taken. 1996 wrote Oliver Bantle from the SZ-Science Department, the first journalistic online concept. This Focus on science went online in the fall of that year with Angelika Jung-Huettl as an editor. They created the first journalistic content that were not in the newspaper. Editorial responsibility lay with the then leader of the SZ Science Department, Martin Urban. In the spring of 1998, the travel journal went into the net. Wenke Hess wrote the concept and implemented it as an editor.

The online content of ''Süddeutsche.de'' is created and maintained by 25 journalists. Circa 140 million clicks are received on ''Süddeutsche.de'' pages.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}{{vague|date=February 2014}} ''Sued-café'' is the [[virtual lounge]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}} for SZ readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suedcafe.sueddeutsche.de/ Süedcafe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013080117/http://suedcafe.sueddeutsche.de/ |date=13 October 2009 }} ''Süeddeutsche Zeitung''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable writers==
Some of Germany's best known journalists either work for the ''SZ'' or spent considerable parts of their careers working for the paper. [[Heribert Prantl]], head of the national desk, is a lawyer by education, a former public prosecutor, and the most cited author of editorial commentaries in German press. [[Hans Leyendecker]] is one of Germany's best known [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]]. Leyendecker formerly worked for the magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', unveiling various political and economic scandals, such as the widespread illegal party financing during the 1980s, and that of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] in 1999. He also unveiled the smuggling of Russian [[plutonium]] into Germany with the help of the foreign intelligence service ''[[Bundesnachrichtendienst]]'' in 1994, bribery at arms deals, the [[German Visa Affair 2005]] and corruption of the staff council at [[Volkswagen]].  Another well-known journalist working for the ''SZ'' is [[Rudolph Chimelli]], a political reporter who has been working for the paper since 1 January 1957.

[[Martin Süßkind]] also formerly worked with the ''SZ'' and eventually became the editor of the ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]''. [[Giovanni di Lorenzo]], who was responsible for the ''SZ'''s full page [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Seite 3'' (Page 3) from 1994 to 1998, and who was later editor-in-chief of the ''[[Tagesspiegel]]'', also worked for the paper. He is now editor-in-chief of the weekly German newspaper ''[[Die Zeit]]''.

The investigative reporters [[Frederik Obermaier]] and [[Bastian Obermayer]] in 2016 initiated and coordinated the worldwide [[Panama Papers]]-revelations

==Controversy==
In May 2018, the German Press Council launched an inquiry to determine whether a ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' cartoon which depicted Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was anti-Semitic; readers had complained that the image “reminded them of the anti-Semitic language of Nazi times.” ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' ended its decades-long collaboration with the cartoonist and apologized to readers, calling the cartoon a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Riham Alkousaa (May 18, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-antisemitism-cartoon/german-newspaper-drops-cartoonist-after-netanyahu-drawing-idUSKCN1IJ1MT German newspaper drops cartoonist after Netanyahu drawing] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tehran Communiqué''', also known as the ''Joint statement of the heads of state in Tehran'' is the joint [[communiqué]] mediated by [[Iranian President]], [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and signed by the acting President of Azerbaijan, [[Yagub Mammadov (politician)|Yagub Mammadov]] and President of Armenia, [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]] on May 7, 1992 with an intention to end the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|four-year-long hostilities]] between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region, a former autonomous oblast of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]].&lt;ref name=Peacekeeper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacekeeper.ru/index.php?id=16|title= Peacekeeper.ru.

==Background==
The [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|conflict]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of Azerbaijan SSR which started in early 1988&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/news/newsid_3681000/3681079.stm | script-title=ru:Карабах: хронология конфликта |trans-title=Karabakh: Chronology of the conflict | publisher= [[BBC News]] | author =  | date=2005-08-29| accessdate=2010-05-06|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; had developed unmitigated and claimed lives of many civilians, interior troops and army. Upon the initiative of the Iranian side, within the framework of diplomatic efforts on the normalization
of the situation in Nagorno Karabakh and at the Azerbaijani-Armenian border, the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia were invited to Tehran for negotiations on May 7, 1992.&lt;ref name=CC/&gt; The invitation was considered as the third stage of peace efforts initiated by Iran. First mediation stage started in February when Iranian envoy [[Ali Akbar Velayati]] visited both Baku, Yerevan and Karabakh but it was quickly halted due to capture of [[Khojali Rayon|Khojaly]] and subsequent [[Khojaly Massacre]] by Armenian troops.&lt;ref name=Strategic&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csr.ir/departments.aspx?lng=en&amp;abtid=07&amp;depid=74&amp;semid=989 |title= Mediation in the Karabakh Dispute |author= Dr. Mahmood Vaezi.

==The signing of the communiqué==
During the talks between Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders, it was agreed that meetings between top level representatives from both countries, including military personnel, would be organized and all disputes between the parties would be solved by peaceful means on the basis of principle of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE, ''now OSCE'') and international law. Parties committed to international legal norms and UN Charter to ensure peace and stability of borders as well as resolve ongoing refugee crisis. As a result of talks, the parties agreed to open all communications after subsequent visit of Iranian envoy [[Mahmoud Vaezi]] to [[Baku]], [[Stepanakert]] and [[Yerevan]] and involve CSCE observers for continuation of mediation efforts.&lt;ref name=CC/&gt;

However, the peace efforts failed the next day, when Armenian troops attacked and captured the Azerbaijani town of [[Shusha]] on May 8, 1992 forcing 23,156 ethnic Azerbaijanis out,&lt;ref name=Peacekeeper/&gt; in violation of the ceasefire agreement.&lt;ref name=RFE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Croissant&gt;{{Citation | first = Croissant | last = Michael P. | author-link = | title = The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict: causes and implications | place = United States of America | publisher = Praeger Publishers | year = 1998 | page = 99 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeP7OZZswtcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-275-96241-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armenia.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/159383/|title= Тегеран считает, что урегулированием конфликта в Карабахе должны заниматься страны региона |trans-title=Tehran thinks that conflict resolution in Karabakh should be handled by countries in the region |date= 2009-09-15 |accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This significantly undermined the outcome of the peace efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/89-92/CHAPTER%208/EUROPE/item%2019_Nagorny-Karabakh.pdf|title= UN Chapter VIII.

'''Tragic Week''' ({{lang-es|'''Semana Trágica'''}}) was a series of riots and massacres that took place in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], during the week of January 7, 1919. The riot was led by [[Anarchism in Argentina|anarchists]] and communists, and was eventually crushed by the [[Argentine Federal Police]] under [[Luis Dellepiane]] and the intervention of the [[Argentine Army]], Argentine Marine Corps and [[Argentine Navy]].

==Background==

From 1902 until 1909 the FORA (''[[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation|Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina]]'') was founded by Italian immigrant Pietro Gori, an Italian anarchist of international renown){{citation needed|date=February 2012}} waged a long campaign of general strikes against the employers and against anti-labour legislation. In May 1904, a clash between workers and police left two dead and fifteen injured. In 1907, the feminist-anarchist league was established in Buenos Aires. Toward the end of this decade there arose a situation in which the brutality of the authorities and the militancy of the workers incited each other to greater heights, until, on May Day, 1909, a giant gathering marched through Buenos Aires and was broken up by the police, with 12 killed and a hundred wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19091116.2.64 |title=Buenos Aires Treagedy. Two Police Officials Killed |work=Evening Post |location=Wellington NZ|date=16 November 1909 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the time that anarchists had provoked the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=BA19090503.2.23 |title=An Anarchists' Riot |work=Bush Advocate |location= |date=3 May 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine President José Figueroa Alcorta narrowly himself escaped death when an anarchist bomb was thrown at him while he was driving in Buenos Aires on 28 February 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kVxjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MWQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2020,2967528&amp;dq= |title=New Anarchist Plot. Two Arrests and Raid on Bomb Factory in Buenos Ayres |work=The Evening News |location=Providence RI|date=11 July 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government officials were again thrown into panic when a 19-year-old anarchist, Ukrainian immigrant [[Simón Radowitzky]], killed with a hand-held bomb the city's police chief, Ramón Falcón and his aide Alberto Lartigau, who were driving through  Callao street in Buenos Aires on 15 November 1909. On 16 October 1909, bombs exploded at the Spanish consulate in the city of Rosario, injuring an anarchist and damaging the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19091018.2.59 |title=Bombs Exploded in Spanish Consulate |work=Evening Post |date=18 October 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1909, as a result of Falcón's assassination the  self-styled "Patriotic students" known as Juventud Autonomista was formed. On 25 May 1910, in an effort to disrupt the Argentine centennial celebrations in Buenos Aires, an anarchist gave a bomb to an unsuspecting boy to carry into a cathedral, the bomb however exploded prematurely and the boy was killed and another lost both arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19100603.2.59 |title=Bombs in Argentina.

The attempt was made while the president was reviewing a troop march past during celebrations of the one-hundred anniversary of Argentine independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v6dRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LmgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4473,3490772&amp;dq= |title=Effort Made to Kill President of Argentine |work=The Gazette Times |date=10 July 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 1918, violent strikes took place across Argentina and regular troops were rushed to the affected areas after anarchists wrecked trains, destroyed tracks and burned carriages laden with wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yQteAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7l8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3282,3532019&amp;dq= |title=Anarchy Reigns in Argentina When General Rail Strike Brings Riots |work=The Telegraph-Herald |date=10 February 1918 |location=Dubuque, Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The conflict began as a [[strike (labor)|strike]] at the Vasena metal works, a [[British Empire|British]] owned plant in the suburbs of [[Buenos Aires]]. The strike at first attracted no attention, but on January 3 the picketing workers fired on a group of policemen who were conducting  wagonloads of metal to the Vasena works. Two days later a police sergeant died of his wounds. On January 7 an unrelated event took place: the maritime workers of the port of Buenos Aires voted a general strike for  better hours and wages. That same day, at Vasena metal works, the police, who had laid  a trap of cleverly planned crossfire, fought it out with the striking workers when they tried to stop a load of metal escorted by the police. Five workers were killed and twenty wounded.

The next day, Wednesday, the waterfront strike began: all ship movements, and all loading and unloading, came to a halt. On Thursday, funerals were held for the five workers who had been killed by the police. A procession of 150 mourners, some of them armed, followed the funeral coaches, and as they passed, they attacked property and burned an automobile, before reaching Lacroze, a British-owned tram station, which they attacked. The group then broke into the Convent of the Sacred Heart, at Yatay Street and [[Corrientes Avenue]], and set the church on fire. As the group were attacking a store the police caught up with them, fired into the procession, and killed and wounded numerous demonstrators.

Mobs went loose all over the city. Groups overturned and burned streetcars and robbed sports shops for the guns inside. In the afternoon, at 3pm, 3,000 people stormed [[Estación Federico Lacroze|Lacroze Station]]. Violence also erupted in the [[Argentine Congress|Congress]], where members of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] reportedly threw notebooks at each other, rather than taking action.

The funeral procession met a suburban train at a railroad crossing and broke every window in the carriages. At Vasena Workshop, angry crowds pushed garbage wagons against the doors to break them down and get at the British directors who were besieged inside. The British Minister appealed to the President [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] for help. Yrigoyen gave the order to shoot to kill, but as the toll of dead and wounded mounted, the mobs became more frantic and destructive.

That night the ''Federación Obrera Regional Argentina'' (Argentine Regional Workers' Federation) met to consider police action and voted for a general strike for 24 hours throughout the city of Buenos Aires. On Friday there were no newspapers; markets, stores, hotels and bars were closed, and transportation and communication networks (including the telephone lines) were stopped.

A new participant in the massacres, the [[Argentine Patriotic League]], emerged. Targeting the city's sizable Jewish population, the right wing League sought [[pogrom]]s, and brought an ever-growing list of dead and wounded Jews to the newspaper columns. Mobs were running the streets, shouting "death to the ''Rusos''," a reference to [[Argentine Jew]]s, who were mainly [[Russian people|Russian]], and identified in the minds of those in the League and the like-minded as [[anarchist]]s and [[Bolsheviks]]. The Russian Jewish sections of Buenos Aires were invaded, and terrified Jews were dragged from their homes, beaten, shot and killed; some escaped by pleading they were [[Italian Argentine|Italian]]s.

Food shortages in the city became acute, and eggs that were selling for 90 cents a dozen in the morning reached 3 [[peso moneda nacional|peso]]s (US$1.35) by evening.  The railroad union voted to stop trains all over the country in a sympathy strike. The union ordered its members back to work, and issued a statement disclaiming all responsibility for Friday's killings.

The Montevideo police had informed the authorities of Buenos Aires that they had uncovered a Communist plot to seize both sides of [[Río de la Plata]] with the taking of the capitals of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. On Sunday the police informed the press that they had broken into a private apartment where 40 persons, all of them [[Russian Jew]]s, were in session as the "First Soviet of the Federal Republic of Argentine Soviets."

Placing the city under [[martial law]], President Yrigoyen appointed Colonel [[Luis Dellepiane]] as the commander of riot control forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bolsheviki Invade Argentina |work=Los Angeles Times |date=11 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which disturbances subsided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5520">{{Politics of Fiji}}
'''Western United Front''' (WUF) was an ethnically [[Fijians|Fijian]] [[List of political parties in Fiji|political party]] formed prior to the [[Fijian general election, 1982|1982 elections]] and contested the election in coalition with the [[National Federation Party]] (NFP-WUF Coalition).

== The formation of the Party ==
Its support was concentrated in the [[Western Division, Fiji|Western Division]], mainly in the provinces of [[Nadroga-Navosa Province|Nadroga]] and [[Ba Province|Ba]]. Its formation was due to disenchantment of western Fijians about not receiving fair return from the [[Native Land Trust Board (Fiji)|Native Land Trust Board]] (NLTB) from the income derived from their land. Fiji's foreign exchange earnings are mainly generated from sugar, tourism, pine and gold, produced in the western division. It was claimed that western landowners, despite providing 65% of the money that financed the NLTB, received only 9%. The Party was launched on 17 July 1981 with the following goals:

* Protect and encourage the unity of western Fijians
* Protect the interests of landowners and to defend their rights to develop their resources according to their aspirations.
* Seek changes in the Ministry of Fijian Affairs and Rural Development to improve the lives of western Fijians.
* Improve educational facilities of western Fijians and provide them opportunities in commercial and industrial enterprises.

== Coalition with NFP ==
As the WUF had a narrow base and a regional focus it formed a coalition with NFP on 11 January 1982, because it regarded the NFP as "the most prominent political party opposed to the Alliance". Each party was to maintain its independent identity and objectives. [[Jai Ram Reddy]], the leader of the NFP regarded the coalition as a partnership of equals.

== Leadership of WUF ==
The leader of the party was [[Osea Gavidi|Ratu Osea Gavidi]], a [[Nadroga-Navosa Province|Nadroga]] chief, who had had a long-standing dispute with NLTB regarding pine plantations in Nadroga. He had contested the [[Fijian general election, March 1977|parliamentary election]] of March 1977 and [[Fijian general election, September 1977|September 1977]] as an independent candidate, narrowly winning the Nadroga Fijian [[Communal constituencies|Communal Constituency]]. A prominent member was [[Ratu Napolioni Dawai|Napolioni Dawai]], a [[Nadi]] chief, who had been an assistant Minister in the [[Alliance Party of Fiji|Alliance]] Government, but had lost pre-selection for his seat. He had been involved in disputes with tourist resort operators in Nadi regarding appropriate compensation for the use of his tribal land. Another prominent member was [[Isikeli Nadalo]], who had formed the [[Nadroga Fijian Cane Growers Association]] and later the [[Fijian National Party]] to contest the [[Fijian general election, 1963|1963 election]]. He had then merged his party with [[Apisai Tora]]'s [[Western Democratic Party (Fiji)|Western Democratic Party]] to form the [[National Democratic Party (Fiji, 1960s)|National Democratic Party]], which in turn had merged with the Federation party to form the National Federation Party (NFP). Isikeli Nadalo was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] in [[Fijian general election, 1972|1972]] under the NFP ticket but left the party following its split in 1977.

== 1982 Election ==
In the 1982 election, the WUF contested all the Fijian Communal Seats in the Western Division plus some others in adjoining provinces. Osea Gavidi narrowly lost the Nadroga Fijian seat, with 47.9% of the votes. [[Isikeli Nadalo]] won the National seat based in the Nadroga Province, while [[Napolioni Dawai]] lost his Ba-Nadi Fijian Communal seat obtaining only 22.8% of the votes. All other WUF candidates did poorly, getting less than 10% of the votes. Although WUF delivered 7% of the ethnic Fijian vote to the NFP-WUF coalition it was not enough to win enough seats to form Government. The coalition ended with the election and the leader of NFP blamed the failure of WUF to win enough Fijian votes for the coalition's loss.

== 1987 Election ==
On 6 June 1986, the first meeting regarding a coalition with the [[Fiji Labour Party]] (FLP) took place with '''Western United Front''' delegates where MP, Isikeli Nadalo argued that, "there should only be two political groups fighting the election." With the common aim of defeating the [[Alliance Party (Fiji)|Alliance]], on 10 October 1986, agreement was reached for coalition with FLP. In November 1986, when only Ratu Osea Gavidi of the WUF was endorsed as a candidate by the Coalition, which now also included the National Federation Party (NFP), WUF withdrew from the coalition. WUF fought the [[Fijian general election, 1987|1987 election]] in partnership with an NFP splinter group led by Sharda Nand, a supporter of [[Sidiq Koya]]. In the elections, WUF lost ground to both the Alliance and the Labour Party, with Gavidi receiving 41.7 percent of the vote and Nadalo only 13 percent.

'''Women at the Hague''' was an [[International Congress of Women]] conference held at [[The Hague]], Netherlands in April 1915. It had over 1,100 delegates and it established an International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) with [[Jane Addams]] as president. It led to the creation of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).&lt;ref name=1915Hague&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36546779/The_Women_Who_Tried_to_Stop_the_Great_War_The_International_Congress_of_Women_at_The_Hague_1915 The Women Who Tried to Stop the Great War: The International Congress of Women at The Hague 1915], In A. H. Campbell (Ed.), Global Leadership Initiatives for Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding (pp. 249-266). (Chapter 12) Hershey, PA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
The 1915 International Congress of Women was organized by the [[German people|German]] [[feminism|feminist]] [[Anita Augspurg]], Germany's first female [[jurist]], and [[Lida Gustava Heymann]] (1868–1943) at the invitation of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[pacifist]], feminist and [[women's suffrage|suffragist]] [[Aletta Jacobs]] to protest the [[World War I|war]] then raging in [[Europe]], and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. 

The scheme of an International Congress of Women was formulated at a small conference of women from neutral and belligerent countries, held at [[Amsterdam]] early in February 1915. A preliminary programme was drafted at this meeting, and it was agreed to request the Dutch women to form a committee to take in hand all the arrangement for the Congress and to issue the invitations. 
The expenses of the Congress were guaranteed by British, Dutch and German women present who all agreed to raise one third of the sum required.&lt;ref name="AddamsBalch1916"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Addams|first1=Jane|last2=Balch|first2=Emily Greene|last3=Hamilton|first3=Alice|title=Women at the Hague: The International Congress of Women and Its Results|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLzUAAAAMAAJ|edition=Public domain|year=1916|publisher=Macmillan|pages=146–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress opened on April 28&lt;ref name=pp&gt;{{cite web|title=International Congress of Women opens at The Hague|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/international-congress-of-women-opens-at-the-hague|website=History.Doc|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and [[non-belligerent|belligerent]] [[nation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der Veen|first1=Sietske|title=Hirschmann, Susanna Theodora Cornelia (1871-1957)|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|website=Huygens ING|publisher=Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands|accessdate=30 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830163944/http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|archivedate=30 August 2017|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|language=Dutch|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an '''International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace''' (ICWPP) with [[Jane Addams]] as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP

Invitations to take part in the Congress were sent to women's organisations and mixed organisations as well as to individual women all over the world. Each organisation was invited to appoint two delegates. Women only could become members of the Congress and they were required to express themselves in general agreement with the resolutions on the preliminary programme. This general agreement was interpreted to imply the conviction (a) That international disputes should be settled by pacific means; (b) That the parliamentary franchise should be extended to women.&lt;ref name=AddamsBalch1916 /&gt;

The Congress was carried on under two important rules:
# That discussions on the relative national responsibility for or conduct of the present war,
# Resolutions dealing with the rules under which war shall in future be carried on, shall be outside the scope of the Congress.&lt;ref name=AddamsBalch1916 /&gt;

Countries represented included the United States, which sent 47 members; Sweden, 12; Norway, 12; Netherlands, 1,000; Italy, 1; Hungary, 9; Germany, 28; Denmark, 6; Canada, 2; Belgium, 5; Austria, 6, and Great Britain, 3, although 180 others from there were prevented from sailing owing to the closing of the North Sea for military reasons. The Congress, which was attended by a large number of visitors as well as by the members, was extremely successful. Proceedings were conducted with the greatest goodwill throughout, and the accompanying resolutions were passed at the business sessions.&lt;ref name=AddamsBalch1916 /&gt;

==Delegations==
There were problems in getting 1200 women together during wartime. The delegation from Britain was trimmed by the Foreign Office to 24 delegates and actually only two (or three) made it to the Hague. Italy only managed one delegate and she was keen to note that she did not represent her country. One woman also came from Canada to represent what was called at the time "the Colonies".&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/6/17/1393777/-Hellraisers-Journal-From-The-Survey-Women-of-the-Hague-a-first-hand-report-by-Mary-Chamberlain|title=Hellraisers Journal: From The Survey: "Women of the Hague"  a first-hand report by Mary Chamberlain|work=Daily Kos|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
