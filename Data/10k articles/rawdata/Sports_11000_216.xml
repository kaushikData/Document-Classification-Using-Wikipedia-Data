The organization of the 2008 [[Africa Cup of Nations]] was awarded to [[Ghana]] on 8 July 2004 by the [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] Executive Committee members which are 12 in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. Voters had a choice between [[Ghana]] and [[Libya]] which was disadvantaged by the fact that two countries in the North Africa region had already hosted the last two editions ([[Tunisia]] in [[2004 African Cup of Nations|2004]], and [[Egypt]] in [[2006 African Cup of Nations|2006]]).

South Africa, also was a candidate at the start, eventually withdrew in May 2004 after being nominated for the organization of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

This is the fourth time that Ghana has hosted the African Cup after [[1963 African Cup of Nations|1963]], [[1978 African Cup of Nations|1978]] and [[2000 African Cup of Nations|2000]] (jointly with [[Nigeria]]).

==Seeding and grouping procedure==
The draw for the tournament took place on 19 October 2007. The sixteen teams were divided into four pots according to their performances in past Cup of Nations tournaments. Ghana, as host, were automatically seeded as the top team in Group A. Egypt, the defending champions, were seeded as the top team in Group C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7050974.stm ''Caf release Cup of Nations' seeds''], "BBC Sport", 18 October 2007. Accessed 4 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Each group consists of four teams, one drawn from each of the pots.

* Pot 1: Ghana (Group A), Egypt (Group C), Nigeria, Tunisia
* Pot 2: Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Morocco, Senegal
* Pot 3: Guinea, Mali, South Africa, Zambia
* Pot 4: Angola, Benin, Namibia, Sudan

==Tournament ball==
During the previous editions of the Africa Cup of Nations, the ball used was not a ball especially made for the tournament. As the tournament was held on even years, the same years big tournaments such as the UEFA European Cup of Nations or the FIFA World Cup were held, the official ball for the tournament held this year was used for the African Cup of Nations: the Adidas Roteiro in 2004, or the Adidas Teamgeist in 2006. However, for the 2008 tournament, Adidas made a special ball, clearly different from the Adidas Europass going to be used five months later for the Euro. The ball was named '''Wawa Aba''' and was designed to include host nation Ghana’s red, yellow and green. The ball was later used for the other African competitions.

For the Akan culture originating from Western Africa, the name ''Wawa Aba'' is a symbol of persistence. People there particularly believe in the strength and team spirit of a community. The ''Wawa Aba'' is the seed of the Wawa tree, one of the strongest and most processible woods of Africa. For the population, the ''Wawa Aba'' mainly has mystical significance. These are people who don’t let failure discourage them, who seize all opportunities successfully and who are thus just as strong and adaptable as the ''Wawa Aba''.

The '''2011 [[United States Men's Curling Championship]] qualifiers''' took place during January at various locations throughout the nation. Prior to the national finals, the number of entrants was pared down to ten teams through regional qualifiers and then a challenge round.

Teams qualified for the men's nationals in one of two ways. Two teams automatically qualified as the top two US teams on the Order of Merit list after the [[Curl Mesabi Cash Spiel]] was completed. This year, those two teams were the [[Pete Fenson]] and [[Tyler George]] rinks.&lt;ref name="OOM"&gt;[http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//images/PDFs/ytd%20oom_122110.pdf Order of Merit as of 12/21/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining eight spots for the nationals were awarded to the top finishers in the regional qualifiers and challenge rounds. Five teams qualified from the qualifiers round, where each qualified site received one or more qualifying spots. The other three spots went to the winners of the challenge round.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;[http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks/images/Championships/pages%20from%20nationals.rules.pdf Nationals Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional Qualifiers==
This year, there were three regional qualifiers, which will take place in [[Medford, Wisconsin]], [[Bismarck, North Dakota]], and [[Rochester, New York]]. The qualifiers will take place from January 5–9. A total of 29 teams (not including the Fenson rink or the George rink) participated in the qualifiers.

The qualifiers either were held using a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format or a knockout format of play. The double knockout provision, which states that a team is eliminated from qualifying for the nationals if the team has at least two losses in their win-loss record, was in place for all three qualifiers. If there are teams with less than two losses, they will play each other until the number of teams still able to qualify matches the number of qualification spots available.

The qualifier scheduled in [[Seattle, Washington]] was cancelled because there were not enough teams to meet the minimum five teams that need to sign up for a qualifier in order for it to take place. Two teams transferred to other qualifiers, while two other teams dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1143&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alexandra Sports Club''' (also called the '''Alex Sports Club''') is a sporting complex in [[Harare]], the capital of [[Zimbabwe]]. The venue's primary use is as a [[cricket ground]], and it has hosted both international and domestic fixtures.

==History==
Cricket is first recorded as being played at the Alexandra Sports Club in January 1949, at a time when Harare was called Salisbury, and was the capital of the British colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]]. It may have been played earlier.&lt;ref name="misc"&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/32/1816_misc.html Other matches played on Alexandra Sports Club, Harare] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 1 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural first-class match on the ground was in October 1990, when a [[Zimbabwe A cricket team|Young Zimbabwe]] team played a three-day game against [[Pakistan A cricket team|Pakistan B]] (which held [[first-class cricket|first-class]] status).&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/32/1816_f.html First-class matches played on Alexandra Sports Club, Harare] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 1 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[1993–94 Logan Cup]], the Alexandra Sports Club began to host matches in top-level domestic competitions, generally for teams based in the [[Mashonaland]] region (which includes Harare).

'''Canadian football''' ({{Lang-fr|Football canadien}}) is a [[team sport|sport]] played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play {{convert|110|yd|m|0}} long and {{convert|65|yd|m|0}} wide attempting to advance a pointed oval-shaped ball into the opposing team's scoring area ([[end zone]]).

In Canada, the term "'''football'''" may refer to Canadian football and [[American football]] collectively, or to either sport specifically, depending on context. The two sports have shared origins and are closely related but have [[comparison of American and Canadian football|some key differences]].

[[Rugby football]] in Canada originated in the early 1860s,&lt;ref name=1860s /&gt; and over time, the game known as Canadian football developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1880 and the founding of the [[Rugby Canada#Canadian Rugby Football Union|Canadian Rugby Football Union]].

The CFL is the most popular and only major professional Canadian football league. Its championship game, the [[Grey Cup]], is one of Canada's largest sporting events, attracting a broad television audience. In 2009, about 40% of Canada's population watched part of the game;&lt;ref name="Houston 2006-12-20"&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Zelkovich  | first = Chris  | title = Grey Cup a ratings champion | newspaper = The Toronto Star | location = Toronto, Ontario | date=1 December 2009  | url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/greycup/article/732817--zelkovich-grey-cup-a-ratings-champion | accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014, it was closer to 33%, peaking at 5.1 million viewers in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Zelkovich, [https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/drop-in-grey-cup-ratings-doesn-t-spell-doom-for-the-cfl-180806741.html The Great Canadian ratings report: Drop in Grey Cup audience follows CFL's downward trend], Yahoo Sports, 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian football is also played at the bantam, high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the [[Canadian Junior Football League]], formed May 8, 1974, and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] are leagues for players aged 18–22, many post-secondary institutions compete in [[U Sports football]] for the [[Vanier Cup]], and senior leagues such as the [[Alberta Football League]] have grown in popularity in recent years. Great achievements in Canadian football are enshrined in the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] located in Hamilton, Ontario.

Other organizations across Canada perform senior league Canadian football during the summer.

== History ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Canadian Football League]] --&gt;
The first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], [[University of Toronto]] (approximately {{convert|400|yd|disp=or}} west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was Sir William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.&lt;ref name=1860s&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |title=Timeline 1860s |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501160230/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://footballcanada.com/about/about-us/|title=History|date=2014-05-10|work=Football Canada|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written account of a game played was on October 15, 1862, on the Montreal Cricket Grounds. It was between the First Battalion [[Grenadier Guards]] and the Second Battalion [[Scots Fusilier Guards]] resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals, 2 rouges to nothing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1864, at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on [[rugby football]].&lt;ref name= 1860s /&gt; The game gradually gained a following, with the Hamilton Football Club formed on November 3, 1869, Montreal formed a team April 8, 1872, Toronto was formed on October 4, 1873, and the Ottawa FBC on September 20, 1876. (Of those clubs, only the Toronto club is still in continuous operation today.)

This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's [[McGill University]]. McGill challenged [[Harvard University]] to a game, in 1874  using a hybrid game of English rugby devised by the University of McGill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1870|title=History – CFL.ca – Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213001352/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1870|archivedate=13 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football |title=gridiron football (sport)|work = Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=13 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to establish a proper governing body and adopted the current set of Rugby rules was the Foot Ball Association of Canada, organized on March 24, 1873 followed by the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU) founded June 12, 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1880|title=History – CFL.ca – Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213001343/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1880|archivedate=13 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included teams from Ontario and Quebec. Later both the Ontario and Quebec Rugby Football Union (ORFU and QRFU) were formed (January 1883), and then the Interprovincial (1907) and Western Interprovincial Football Union (1936) (IRFU and WIFU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91923/Canadian-Football-League-CFL#ref283286|title=Canadian Football League (CFL)|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRFU reorganized into an umbrella organization forming the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1890|title=History – CFL.ca – Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213001357/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1890|archivedate=13 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original forerunners to the current Canadian Football League, was established in 1956 when the IRFU and WIFU formed an umbrella organization, The Canadian Football Council (CFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1950 |title=History – CFL.ca – Official Site of the Canadian Football League |work=CFL.ca |accessdate=1 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213001401/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1950 |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 the CFC left the CRFU to become the CFL.

The [[Burnside rules]] closely resembling American football (which are similar rules developed by [[Walter Camp]] for that sport) that were incorporated in 1903 by the ORFU, was an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side, introduced the Snap-Back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the Throw-In from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks. The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country. The CIRFU, QRFU and CRU refused to adopt the new rules at first.&lt;ref name="cfl.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1900|title=History – CFL.ca – Official Site of the Canadian Football League|work=CFL.ca|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109145244/http://cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1900|archivedate=9 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forward pass]]es were not allowed in the Canadian game until 1929, and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes. The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was not based on American rules, as the Canadian game was played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums.

The [[Grey Cup]] was established in 1909 after being donated by [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], The Governor General of Canada as the championship of teams under the CRU for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada.&lt;ref name="cfl.ca" /&gt; Initially an amateur competition, it eventually became dominated by professional teams in the 1940s and early 1950s. The [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], the last amateur organization to compete for the trophy, withdrew from competition in 1954. The move ushered in the modern era of Canadian professional football, culminating in the formation of the present-day [[Canadian Football League]] in 1958.

Canadian football has mostly been confined to Canada, with the United States being the only other country to have hosted high-level Canadian football games. The CFL's controversial "[[Canadian Football League in the United States|South Division]]" as it would come to be officially known attempted to put CFL teams in the United States playing under Canadian rules between 1992 and 1995. The move was aborted after three years; the [[Baltimore Stallions]] were the most successful of the numerous Americans teams to play in the CFL, winning the [[83rd Grey Cup]]. Continuing financial losses, a lack of proper Canadian football venues, a pervasive belief that the American teams were simply pawns to provide the struggling Canadian teams with expansion fee revenue, and the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|return of the NFL to Baltimore]] prompted the end of Canadian football on the American side of the border.

The CFL hosted the [[Touchdown Atlantic]] regular season game at Nova Scotia in 2005 and New Brunswick in 2010, 2011 and 2013. In 2013, Newfoundland and Labrador became the last province to establish football at the minor league level, with teams playing on the Avalon Peninsula and in Labrador City.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The province however has yet to host a college or CFL game. [[Prince Edward Island]], the smallest of the provinces, has also never hosted a CFL game.

== League play ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
[[File:CFL footballs and helmet.jpg|thumb|right|Footballs and a helmet at a [[Calgary Stampeders]] ([[Canadian Football League|CFL]]) team practice]]
Canadian football is played at several levels in Canada; the top league is the professional nine-team [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). The CFL regular season begins in June, and playoffs for the [[Grey Cup]] are completed by mid-November. In cities with outdoor stadiums such as [[Edmonton]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], low temperatures and icy field conditions can seriously affect the outcome of a game.

Amateur football is governed by [[Football Canada]]. At the university level, 26 teams play in four conferences under the auspices of [[U Sports]] (known from 2001–2016 as Canadian Interuniversity Sport); the U Sports champion is awarded the [[Vanier Cup]]. Junior football is played by many after high school before joining the university ranks. There are 20 junior teams in three divisions in the [[Canadian Junior Football League]] competing for the [[Canadian Bowl]]. The [[Quebec Junior Football League]] includes teams from Ontario and Quebec who battle for the Manson Cup.

[[Semi-professional]] leagues have grown in popularity in recent years, with the [[Alberta Football League]] becoming especially popular. The Northern Football Conference formed in Ontario in 1954 has also surged in popularity for former college players who do not continue to professional football. The Ontario champion plays against the Alberta champion for the "National Championship". The Canadian Major Football League is the governing body for the semi-professional game.

Women's football has gained attention in recent years in Canada. The first Canadian women's league to begin operations was the [[Maritime Women's Football League]] in 2004. The largest women's league is the [[Western Women's Canadian Football League]].

== The field ==
[[File:Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton, August 2005.jpg|thumb|Edmonton's [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]], in 2005. A [[Canadian Football League]] venue.]]
The Canadian football field is {{convert|150|yd|m|0}} long and {{convert|65|yd|m|0}} wide, within which the [[end zone|goal areas]] are {{convert|20|yd|m|0}} deep, and the goal lines are {{convert|110|yd|m|0}} apart. Including the endzones, the total area of the field is {{convert|87750|sqft}}.

At each goal line is a set of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|0}} [[goalposts]], which consist of two ''uprights'' joined by an {{convert|18+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} crossbar which is {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the ground) is preferred.

The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} from the goal line. These lateral lines are called "yard lines" and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. In previous decades, arrows were not used and every yard line (in both multiples of 5 and 10) was usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with either a "0" or "00"; in most stadiums today, only the yard markers in multiples of 10 are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a "G". The centre (55-yard) line usually is marked with a "C" (or, more rarely, with a "55"). "Hash marks" are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at {{convert|1|yd|m|1}} intervals, {{convert|24|yd|m|1}} from the sidelines.

On fields that have a surrounding [[running track]], such as [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium|Molson Stadium]] and many [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|universities]], the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. Until 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://cfldb.ca/faq/game-rules-regulations/#what-is-the-size-of-the-cfl-field
|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Game Rules and Regulations
|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the end zones were {{convert|25|yd|m}} deep, giving the field an overall length of {{convert|160|yd|m}}, and a correspondingly larger cutoff could be required at the corners. The first field to feature the shorter 20-yard endzones was [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver's]] [[BC Place]] (home of the [[BC Lions]]), which opened in 1983. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL's American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field. The end zones in Toronto's [[BMO Field]] are only 18 yards instead of 20 yards.

== Play of the game ==
{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}
Teams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, [[prolate spheroid]] ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes.

=== Start of play ===
At the beginning of a match, an official tosses a coin and allows the captain of the visiting team call heads or tails. The captain of the team winning the coin toss is given the option of having first choice, or of deferring first choice to the other captain. The captain making first choice may either choose a) to kick off or receive the kick at the beginning of the half, or b) which direction of the field to play in. The remaining choice is given to the opposing captain. Before the resumption of play in the second half, the captain that did not have first choice in the first half is given first choice. Teams usually choose to defer, so it is typical for the team that wins the coin toss to kick to begin the first half and receive to begin the second.

Play begins at the start of each half with one team place-kicking the ball from its own 35-yard line. Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or lateral throw the ball to a teammate.

=== Stoppage of play ===
Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a ''tackle''); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). If no score has been made, the next play starts from ''scrimmage''.

=== Scrimmage ===
Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it was at the stop of clock, but no nearer than 24 yards from the sideline or 1 yard from the goal line. The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is similar to "[[no-man's land]]"; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.

[[File:Anthony Calvillo game action, 93rd Grey Cup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montreal Alouettes]] quarterback [[Anthony Calvillo]] looks down field with the ball during the [[93rd Grey Cup]] game at [[BC Place]].]]
On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence.&lt;!-- Canadian spelling uses the "c" --&gt; Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to another member of the offensive team. This is usually the quarterback or punter, but a "direct snap" to a running back is also not uncommon. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:
* run with the ball, attempting to run farther down field (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards).
* ''drop-kick'' the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is exceedingly rare in both Canadian and American football.)
* pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a ''lateral'', and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a ''forward pass'' (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals.
* ''hand-off''—hand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback.
* ''punt'' the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it ''before'' it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the no-yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays).
* place the ball on the ground for a ''place kick''
* throw a ''[[forward pass]]'', where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther down field (closer to the opponent's goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions:
** They must be made from ''behind'' the line of scrimmage
** Only one forward pass may be made on a play
** The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver or pass 10 yards after the line of scrimmage

Each play constitutes a ''down''. The offence&lt;!-- Canadian spelling uses the "c" --&gt; must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.

=== Change in possession ===
The ball changes possession in the following instances:
* If the offence scores a field goal, the scored-against team can either scrimmage from its 35-yard line or have the scoring team kickoff from its 35-yard line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2009/05/11/sp-cfl-ruleschanges.html |title=CFL introduces 4 rule changes for 2009 season |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Company |accessdate=13 July 2010 | date=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If a team scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard line.
* If the defence scores on a safety (bringing the ball down in the offence's own end zone), they have the right to claim possession.
* If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession.
* If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defence ''takes over on downs''.
* If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is ''intercepted'' by the defence; the defence takes possession immediately (and may try to advance the ball on the play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team.
* If the offence ''fumbles'' (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.
* When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half will receive a kickoff to start the second half.
* After the three-minute warning near the end of each half, the offence can lose possession for a time count violation (failure to legally put the ball into play within the 20-second duration of the play clock). However, this can only occur in one very specific scenario:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cflofficials.ca/docs/2015%20Rule%20Book%20English.pdf |title=Rule 1, Section 7, Article 9: Time Count |work=The Official Playing Rules for the Canadian Football League 2015 |publisher=Canadian Football League |pages=18–19 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133157/http://www.cflofficials.ca/docs/2015%20Rule%20Book%20English.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The offence committed a time count violation on its last attempted scrimmage play.
** This prior violation took place on third down.
** The referee deemed said violation to be deliberate, and warned the offence that it had to legally place the ball into play within the 20-second clock or lose possession. Such a loss of possession is statistically treated as the defence taking over on downs.

=== Rules of contact ===
There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.

=== Infractions and penalties ===
Infractions of the rules are punished with ''penalties'', typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as ''offside'' (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations of the rules (such as face-masking) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, from where the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.

If the defence is penalized on a two-point convert attempt and the offence chooses to attempt the play again, the offence must attempt another two-point convert; it cannot change to a one-point attempt. Conversely, the offence can attempt a two-point convert following a defensive penalty on a one-point attempt.

Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offside), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]]).

Penalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.

In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of ''declining'' the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.

=== Kicking ===
Canadian football distinguishes four ways of kicking the ball:

; [[Place kick]]: Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), optionally placed on a [[Tee#Kicking tee|tee]].
; [[Drop kick]]: Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's [[Rugby football|rugby]] heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adopted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.
; [[Punt (gridiron football)|Punt]]: Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time.
; Dribbled ball: A dribbled ball is one that has been kicked while not in possession of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage. The kicker of the dribbled ball and any player onside when the ball was kicked may legally recover the ball.

On any kicking play, all onside players (the kicker, and teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick) may recover and advance the ball. Players on the kicking team who are not onside may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team, or by an onside teammate.

=== Scoring ===
The methods of scoring are:

; Touchdown : Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent's end zone, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent's goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a "major score" or simply a "major."
; Conversion (or convert) : After a touchdown, the team that scored gets one scrimmage play to attempt to add one or two more points. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point (a "point-after"); what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a "two-point conversion"). In amateur games, this scrimmage is taken at the opponents' 5-yard line. The CFL formerly ran all conversion attempts from the 5-yard line as well, but starting in 2015 the line of scrimmage for one-point kick attempts became the 25-yard line, while two-point attempts are scrimmaged at the 3-yard line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2015/04/08/major-rule-changes-approved-by-cfl-governors/|title=Major rule changes approved by CFL Governors|date=8 April 2015|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).
; Field goal : Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points. If the ball hits the upright above the cross-bar before going through, it is '''not''' considered a dead ball, and the points are scored. (Rule 5, Sect 4, Art 4(d)) If the field goal is missed, but the ball is not returnable after crossing the dead-ball-line, then it constitutes a '''rouge''' (see below).
; Safety : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a ''single'' (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team's own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), by way of a kickoff from the 25 yard line or scrimmaging from the {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line on their side of the field.
; [[Single (football)|Single (rouge)]] : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a Safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score.
:Officially, the single is called a ''rouge'' ([[French language|French]] for "red") but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown, but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signalled with a red flag. A ''rouge'' is also a method of scoring in the [[Eton field game]], which dates from at least 1815.

==== Resumption of play ====
Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.
* Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own 35-yard line (45-yard line in amateur leagues).
* Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a single or [[rouge (football)|rouge]], play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own 35-yard line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, in which case the non-scoring team scrimmages from either the 35-yard line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, whichever is greater.

=== Game timing ===
The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half.
A short break interval of 2 minutes occurs after the end of each quarter (a longer break of 15 minutes at halftime), and the two teams then change goals.

In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:
* points are scored,
* the ball goes out of bounds,
* a forward pass is incomplete,
* the ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown,
* the ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation),
* the ball is dead and a player is injured, or
* the ball is dead and a captain or a coach calls a [[sport time-out|time-out]].

The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).

In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play
* the ball was kicked off,
* the ball was punted,
* the ball changed possession,
* the ball went out of bounds,
* there were points scored,
* there was an incomplete forward pass,
* there was a penalty applied (not declined), or
* there was a team time-out.

During the last three minutes of a half, the penalty for failure to place the ball in play within the 20-second play clock, known as "time count" (this foul is known as "delay of game" in American football), is dramatically different from during the first 27 minutes. Instead of the penalty being 5 yards with the down repeated, the base penalty (except during convert attempts) becomes loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. In addition, as noted previously, the referee can give possession to the defence for repeated deliberate time count violations on third down.

The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to ''decline'' any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing infractions.

=== Overtime ===
In the CFL, if the game is tied at the end of regulation play, then each team is given an equal number of offensive possessions to break the tie. A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and conducts a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a two-point conversion.&lt;ref name="TSN-Rules2010"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other team then scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.

In U Sports football, for the [[Uteck Bowl]], [[Mitchell Bowl]], and [[Vanier Cup]], the same overtime procedure is followed until there is a winner.

|}

=== Offence ===
The offensive positions found in Canadian football have, for the most part, evolved throughout the years, and are not officially defined in the rules. However, among offensive players, the rules recognize three different types of players:

; Down linemen: Down linemen are players who, at the start of every play, line up at the line of scrimmage; once in their stance, they may not move until the play begins. The offence must have at least seven players lined up at the line of scrimmage on every play. The exception to this rule is the player (typically the ''centre'') who snaps the ball to the quarterback. Linemen generally do not run with the ball (unless they recover it on a fumble) or receive a hand-off or lateral pass, but there is no rule against it. Interior linemen (that is, excluding the two players at either end of the scrimmage line) are ineligible receivers; they may not receive a forward pass either. (The two [[offensive end]]s on the line of scrimmage may receive forward passes, and may be in motion along the line of scrimmage prior to the snap.)
; Backs: Backs line up behind the linemen; they may run with the ball, receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes. They may also be in motion before the play starts.

Specific offensive positions include:

;Backs/Receivers:
; Quarterback: Generally the leader of the offence. Calls all plays to teammates, receives the ball off of snap, and initiates the action usually by running the ball himself, passing the ball to a receiver, or handing the ball off to another back.
; Fullback: Multiple roles including pass protection, receiving, and blocking for the running back. On short yardage situations may also carry the ball.
; Running back/Tailback: As the name implies, the main runner on the team. Also an eligible receiver and blocker on pass plays.
; Wide receiver: Lines up on the line of scrimmage, usually at a distance from the centre. Runs a given route to make a successful play catch ball and gain yardage, not that a tight end can count as an eligible receiver  so if one is on the wide outs field that the wideout cannot be on the line of scrimmage and may adopt a slotback start.
; [[Slotback]]: Is an eligible receiver but lines up off the line (usually 8yds back) of scrimmage and runs before snap and can not have any part on field over scrimmage or it's an off-side call
; Down linemen:
; Centre: Snaps the ball to the quarterback. Most important pass blocker on pass plays. Calls offensive line plays.
; Left/right guard: Stands to the left and right of the centre helps protect the quarterback, Usually very good run blockers to open holes up the middle for runners.
; Left/right tackle: Stands on the ends of the offensive line, The biggest men on the line, usually well over {{convert|300|lb}}. Usually very good pass blockers.
; Offensive lineman: Collective name for the centre, guards and tackles.

=== Defence ===
The rules do not constrain how the defence may arrange itself (other than the requirement that they must remain one yard behind the line of scrimmage until the play starts).

; Cornerback: Covers the wide receivers on most plays.
; Safety: Covers deep. Last line of defence, can offer run support or blitz.
; Defensive halfback: Covers the slotback and helps contain the run from going to the outside.
; Defensive back: Collective term for cornerback, safety and defensive halfback.
; Nose tackle: Lineman across from centre, tries to get past the offensive-line or take double team and open holes for blitzes.
; Defensive tackle: Inside defensive linemen try to break through the offensive line and open holes for linebackers.
; Defensive end: Main rushing lineman. Rushes the quarterback and tries to contain rushers behind the line of scrimmage.
; Defensive lineman: Collective term for defensive tackle (or nose tackle) and defensive end.
; Middle linebacker: Lines up across from the centre 3 to 4 yds/m back. Quarterback of the defence. Calls plays for lineman and linebackers.
; Weak-side linebacker: Lines up on the short side of field, and can drop into pass coverage or contain.
; Strong-side linebacker: Lines up on the opposite side and usually rushes.

=== Special teams ===
''Special teams'' generally refers to kicking plays, which typically involve a change in possession.

; Holder: Receives the snap on field goal tries and converts; places the ball in position and holds it to be kicked by the kicker. This position is generally filled by a reserve quarterback; occasionally the starting quarterback or punter will fill in as holder.
; Kicker: Kicks field goals, converts, kick-offs
; Punter: Punts ball, usually on third downs
; Returners: Fast, agile runners who specialize in fielding punts, field goals and kickoffs, attempting to advance them for better field position or a score.

The '''Course de la Solidarité Olympique''' ({{lang-pl|Wyścig Solidarności i Olimpijczyków}}; {{lang-en|Race of Solidarity and Olympics}}) is a [[road bicycle racing]] stage race held annually in [[Poland]]. From 1991 until 1995, it was a race for amateurs, becoming a professional race in 1996. It was classified as a 2.3 event in 2003 and since 2005, it has been organised as a 2.1 event on the [[UCI Europe Tour]].

'''Dow Diamond''' is a Minor League baseball stadium located in [[Midland, Michigan]]. It is the home of the Single-A [[Great Lakes Loons]] of the [[Midwest League]]. The Loons are affiliated with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

The stadium is located near Buttles, Ellsworth and State streets in Midland. The [[Dow Chemical Company]], whose world headquarters are in Midland, donated the land for the stadium and also purchased the [[naming rights]] to the facility in 2006. The stadium name is a reference to both Dow's logo (a red diamond) and that "diamond" is a slang term for a baseball field.

==History==
Ground was broken for the ballpark on April 11, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About MBF|url=http://www.milb.com/team3/page.jsp?ymd=20090204&amp;content_id=504886&amp;vkey=team3_t456&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t456|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park opened April 13, 2007 and on June 8, 2007 it was announced that Dow Diamond would host the 2008 Midwest League All Star Game, which was held on June 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fans Pack Dow Diamond for All-Star Game|first=Cash|last=Kruth|url=http://www.ourmidland.com/local_news/article_30742ad9-d32d-5e2e-9409-ee3341a74ab4.html|newspaper=[[Midland Daily News]]|date=June 18, 2008|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The venue also hosted the 2017 Midwest League All Star Game.

==Facility==
The seating bowl can accommodate 3,100 persons, with an additional 100 on the Party Deck. The park features 12 luxury suites containing a total of 300 seats, a Green Room for waiting performers and 3 dressing rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dow Diamond|url=http://www.milb.com/team1/page.jsp?ymd=20090107&amp;content_id=492976&amp;vkey=team1_t456&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t456|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dow Diamond indoors is a year-round facility that can be rented for most any event and the facility's catering company can provide anything from hors d'œuvres for two dozen to a formal dinner for 200 or a reception for 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facility Rentals|url=http://www.milb.com/team1/page.jsp?ymd=20090203&amp;content_id=504310&amp;vkey=team1_t456&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t456|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=February 3, 2009|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoors, the Diamond can provide seating for 3,500 with the stage behind home plate; 5,500 with the stage behind second base or 9,000 with the stage in center field.

'''Frederick, Prince of Wales''', [[Knight of the Garter|KG]] (Frederick Lewis; 1 February 1707 – 31 March 1751), was [[heir apparent]] to the British throne from 1727 until his death from a lung injury at the age of 44 in 1751. He was the eldest but estranged son of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], and the father of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] passed by the [[English Parliament]] in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the [[line of succession to the British throne]] at birth, after his [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover|great-grandmother]], [[George I of Great Britain|paternal grandfather]] and father. He moved to Great Britain following the accession of his father, and was created [[Prince of Wales]]. He predeceased his father, however, and upon the latter's death on 25 October 1760, the throne passed to Prince Frederick's eldest son, George III.

==Early life==
[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales (anonymous).jpg|thumb|left|Prince Frederick, ca. 1720.]]
Prince Frederick Lewis was born on 1 February 1707 in [[Hanover]], [[Holy Roman Empire]] (Germany), as Duke Friedrich Ludwig of Brunswick-Lüneburg, to Prince George, son of George, Elector of Hanover, who was also one of Frederick's two godfathers. The Elector was the son of [[Sophia of Hanover]], granddaughter of [[James VI and I]] and first cousin and heir presumptive to [[Queen Anne of Great Britain]]. However, Sophia died before Anne at age 83 in June 1714, which elevated the Elector to heir-presumptive; Queen Anne died on 1 August the same year, and Sophia's son became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. This made Frederick's father the new Prince of Wales and first-in-line to the British throne and Frederick himself second-in-line. Frederick's other godfather was his grand-uncle [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], King in Prussia and Elector of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings]&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick was nicknamed "Griff" within the family.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 20. Van der Kiste observes that "griff" was a Caribbean term for a half-caste, and that it was applied to Frederick because he was "heavy-nosed, thick-lipped and yellow-skinned."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of Anne's death and the coronation of George I, Frederick's parents, George, Prince of Wales (later [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]), and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], were called upon to leave Hanover for Great Britain when their eldest son was only seven years old. He was left in the care of his grand-uncle [[Ernest, Duke of York and Albany|Ernest Augustus]], [[Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück]], and did not see his parents again for 14 years.

In 1722, the 15-year-old Frederick was inoculated against [[smallpox]] by [[Charles Maitland (physician)|Charles Maitland]] on the instructions of his mother Caroline.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, George I, created him [[Duke of Edinburgh]], Marquess of the Isle of Ely,&lt;ref name="gazwales"&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/6741/page/2 London Gazette — creation as Prince of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; Earl of Eltham in the county of Kent, Viscount of Launceston in the county of Cornwall, and Baron of Snaudon in the county of Carnarvon, on 26 July 1726.&lt;ref name="gazedin"&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/6494/page/1 London Gazette — creation as Duke of Edinburgh]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two titles have been interpreted differently since – the ''of''s are omitted and ''Snaudon'' rendered as ''Snowdon''.

Frederick arrived in England in 1728 as a grown man, the year after his father had become [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. By then, George and Caroline had had several younger children, and Frederick, himself now Prince of Wales, was a high-spirited youth fond of drinking, gambling and women.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 39, 85&lt;/ref&gt; The long separation damaged their relationship, and they would never be close.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; 1728 also saw the foundation of [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], which was named after him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

==Prince of Wales==
[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales, and his sisters by Philip Mercier.jpg|thumb|left|The Prince of Wales, ca. 1733, with his sisters, [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]], [[Princess Caroline of Great Britain|Caroline]] and [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]].]]
The motives for the ill-feeling between Frederick and his parents may include the fact that he had been set up by his grandfather, even as a small child, as the representative of the House of Hanover, and was used to presiding over official occasions in the absence of his parents. He was not permitted to go to Great Britain until after his father took the throne as [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] on 11 June 1727. Frederick had continued to be known as Prince Friedrich Ludwig of Hanover (with his British HRH style) even after his father had been created Prince of Wales.

In 1728, Frederick (his name now anglicised) was finally brought to Britain&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 141–142; Van der Kiste, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; and was created Prince of Wales on 8 January 1729.&lt;ref name="powprev"&gt;[https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/titles-and-heraldry/previous-princes-of-wales Prince of Wales: Previous princes]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the tenth Chancellor of the [[University of Dublin]] from 1728 to 1751, and a portrait of him still enjoys a commanding position in the Hall of the [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

He sponsored a court of 'opposition' politicians. Frederick and his group supported the [[Opera of the Nobility]] in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] as a rival to [[George Frederic Handel|Handel]]'s royally sponsored opera at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in the [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick was a lover of music who played the viola and cello;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; he is depicted playing a cello in a portrait by [[Philip Mercier]] of Frederick and his sisters, now part of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp07308&amp;role=art Frederick, Prince of Wales, and his sisters], National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved 19 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed the natural sciences and the arts, and became a thorn in the side of his parents, making a point of opposing them in everything, according to the court gossip [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Lord Hervey]]. At court, the favourite was Frederick's younger brother, [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], to the extent that the king looked into ways of splitting his domains so that Frederick would succeed only in Britain, while Hanover would go to William.&lt;ref name="Vander"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Hervey and Frederick (using a pseudonym "Captain Bodkin") wrote a theatrical comedy together which was staged at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] in October 1731. It was panned by the critics, and even the theatre's manager thought it so bad that it was unlikely to play out even the first night. He had soldiers stationed in the audience to maintain order, and when the play flopped the audience was given their money back.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Hervey and Frederick also shared a mistress, [[Anne Vane]], who had a son called FitzFrederick Vane in June 1732. Either of them or [[William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington]], another of her lovers, could have been the father.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Jealousy between them may have contributed to a breach, and their friendship ended. Hervey later wrote bitterly that Frederick was "false&amp;nbsp;... never having the least hesitation in telling any lie that served his present purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Van der Kiste, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patron of the arts==

A permanent result of Frederick's patronage of the arts is "[[Rule, Britannia!]]", one of the best-known British patriotic songs. It was composed by the English composer [[Thomas Arne]] and written by the Scottish poet and playwright [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] as part of the [[masque]] ''Alfred'' which was first performed on 1 August 1740 at [[Cliveden]], the country home of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Thomas Arne was also one of Frederick's favourite artists. A masque linking the Prince with both the medieval hero-king [[Alfred the Great]]'s victories over the [[Vikings]] and with the contemporary issue of building up the British [[sea power]] obviously went well with Frederick's political plans and aspirations. Later the song got a life of its own regardless of the masque. Thomson, who supported the Prince of Wales politically, also dedicated an earlier work dedicated to him: ''Liberty'' (1734).

Unlike the king, Frederick was a knowledgeable amateur of painting, who patronised immigrant artists like [[Jacopo Amigoni]] and [[Jean Baptiste Vanloo]], who painted the portraits of the prince and his consort for Frederick's champion [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath]]. The list of other artists he employed—[[Philip Mercier]], [[John Wootton]], [[George Knapton]] and the French engraver [[Joseph Goupy]]—represents some of the principal painterly figures of the English [[Rococo]]. The Prince was also crucially important for furthering the popularity of the [[Rococo]] style in the decorative arts, with a clear predilection for French Huguenot craftsmen, patronising silversmiths such as Nicolas Sprimont (1713–1771), ''toyshop'' owners like Paul Bertrand and carver and gilders, the most notable being Paul Petit (1729–c.1756) who first worked for the prince on [[William Kent]]'s [[Palladian architecture|neo-Palladian]] [[Prince Frederick's Barge|state barge of 1732]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Kent and the Royal Barge.|last=Beard|first=Geoffrey|publisher=The Burlington Magazine , Vol. 112, No. 809, pp 488-493+495.|year=August 1970|isbn=|location=|pages=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still preserved in the [[National Maritime Museum]]. Petit worked on a handful of magnificent trophy frames in the Rococo style for Frederick that are among the most significant remaining testaments to his patronage of the decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carltonhobbs.com/portfolio-items/a-royal-giltwood-frame-of-colossal-scale-by-paul-petit-at-the-command-of-frederick-prince-of-wales-to-contain-a-portrait-of-frederick-the-great-by-antoine-pesne-1683-1757/ |title=9880 – A ROYAL GILTWOOD FRAME OF COLOSSAL SCALE BY PAUL PETIT AT THE COMMAND OF FREDERICK, PRINCE OF WALES {{!}} Carlton Hobbs New York |website=''carltonhobbs.com'' |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One frame made for his namesake cousin in 1748, [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia, was especially lavish and represented the esteem in which the Prince held his cousin, suggesting the Prince identified with Frederick the Great's style of enlightened rule, over that of his own father [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. Petit's frame contained a portrait of Frederick the Great painted by [[Antoine Pesne|Antoine Pense]], and remains today in the [[Royal Collection|British Royal Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/41/collection/406797/frederick-ii-king-of-prussia-1712-86 |title=Antoine Pesne (1683–1757): Frederick II, King of Prussia (1712–86) 1747 – 1748 |website=Royal Collection |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of Frederick's homes are left standing except for the country residence of [[Cliveden]], which is in a much altered state. His London houses of [[Norfolk House]], [[Carlton House]], Leicester House and [[Kew Palace#George II's children|Kew House or the White House]] have all been demolished.

==Domestic life==
Negotiations between George II and his brother-in-law [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] on a proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter [[Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Wilhelmine]] were welcomed by Frederick even though the couple had never met.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; George II was not keen on the proposal but continued talks for diplomatic reasons. Frustrated by the delay, Frederick sent an envoy of his own to the [[Prussian court]]. When the King discovered the plan, he immediately arranged for Frederick to leave Hanover for England.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage negotiations foundered when Frederick William demanded that Frederick be made Regent in Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 86, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick also almost married [[Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford|Lady Diana Spencer]], daughter of [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland]] and [[Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1683–1716)|Lady Anne Churchill]]. Lady Diana was the favourite grandchild of the powerful [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]]. The duchess sought a royal alliance by marrying Lady Diana to the Prince of Wales with a massive dowry of £100,000. The prince, who was in great debt, agreed to the proposal, but the plan was vetoed by [[Robert Walpole]] and the king. Lady Diana soon married [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford]].

Although in his youth he was undoubtedly a spendthrift and womaniser, Frederick settled down following his marriage to the sixteen-year-old [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] on 27 April 1736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/the-royal-wedding-of-1736|title=The Royal Wedding… of 1736|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was held at the [[Chapel Royal#St James's Palace|Chapel Royal]] at [[St James's Palace]], presided over by [[Edmund Gibson]], Bishop of London and Dean of the Chapel Royal. [[Handel]] provided the new anthem '[[Sing Unto God/Anthem for the Wedding of Frederick, Prince of Wales|Sing unto God]]' for the service and the wedding was also marked in London by two rival operas, Handel's ''[[Atalanta (opera)|Atalanta]]'' and [[Nicola Porpora|Porpora]]'s ''[[La festa d'Imeneo]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-10140|title=Matthew Kilburn, 'Frederick Lewis, prince of Wales (1707–1751)', in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1736, George II returned to Hanover, which resulted in unpopularity in England; a satirical notice was even pinned to the gates of St James's Palace decrying his absence. "Lost or strayed out of this house", it read, "a man who has left a wife and six children on the parish."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The King made plans to return in the face of inclement weather; when his ship was caught in a storm, gossip swept London that he had drowned. Eventually, in January 1737, he arrived back in England.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately he fell ill, with piles and a fever, and withdrew to his bed. The Prince of Wales put it about that the King was dying, with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip-mongers.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales 1754 by Liotard.jpg|thumb|Frederick (pictured) opposed his father's government.]]

Quickly accumulating large debts, Frederick relied for an income on his wealthy friend, [[George Bubb Dodington]]. The Prince's father refused to make him the financial allowance that the Prince considered should have been his. Frederick's public opposition to his father's government continued; he opposed the unpopular [[Gin Act 1736]], which tried to control the [[Gin Craze]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick applied to Parliament for an increased financial allowance which had hitherto been denied him by the King, and public disagreement over the payment of the money drove a further wedge between parents and son. Frederick's allowance was raised but by less than he had asked for.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1737, Frederick informed his parents that Augusta was pregnant, and due to give birth in October. In fact, Augusta's due date was earlier and a peculiar episode followed in July in which the Prince, on discovering that his wife had gone into labour, sneaked her out of [[Hampton Court Palace]] in the middle of the night, to ensure that the King and Queen could not be present at the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; George and Caroline were horrified. Traditionally, royal births were witnessed by members of the family and senior courtiers to guard against supposititious children, and Augusta had been forced by her husband to ride in a rattling carriage while heavily pregnant and in pain. With a party including two of her daughters and [[John, Lord Hervey|Lord Hervey]], the Queen raced over to [[St James's Palace]], where Frederick had taken Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline was relieved to discover that Augusta had given birth to a "poor, ugly little she-mouse" rather than a "large, fat, healthy boy" which made a supposititious child unlikely since the baby was so pitiful.&lt;ref name=vdk157&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of the birth deepened the estrangement between mother and son.&lt;ref name=vdk157/&gt;

Frederick was banished from the King's court,&lt;ref name="Vander" /&gt; and a rival court grew up at Frederick's new residence, [[Leicester Square|Leicester House]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; His mother fell fatally ill at the end of the year, but the King refused Frederick permission to see her.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He became a devoted family man, taking his wife and eight children (his youngest daughter was born posthumously) to live in the countryside at [[Cliveden]], where he fished, shot and rowed.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1742, [[Robert Walpole]] left office and the realignment of the government led to a reconciliation between father and son, as Frederick's friends gained influence.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]], Frederick met [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]], who had been imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for aiding the escape of the Rising's leader [[Charles Edward Stuart]]. He helped in securing her eventual release.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 1747, Frederick rejoined the political opposition, and the King responded by calling an [[British general election, 1747|early general election]], which Frederick's party lost.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==

[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales attr. to Joseph Highmore.jpg|thumb|Frederick was a cricket enthusiast and patron.]]

By the time Frederick arrived in Great Britain, [[cricket]] had developed into the country's most popular team sport and it thrived on gambling. Perhaps because he wished to Anglicise and so fit in with his new society, Frederick developed an academic interest in cricket and soon became a genuine enthusiast. He began to make wagers and then to patronise and play the sport, even forming his own team on several occasions.

The earliest mention of Frederick in cricket annals is in a contemporary report that concerns a [[First-class cricket|first-class match]] on 28 September 1731 between [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] and [[London Cricket Club|London]], played on [[Kennington Common]]. No post-match report was found despite advance promotion as "likely to be the best performance of this kind that has been seen for some time". The records show that "for the convenience of the gamesters, the ground is to be staked and roped out"&amp;nbsp;– a new practice in 1731 and possibly done partly for the benefit of a royal visitor. The advertisement refers to "the whole county of Surrey" as London's opponents and states that the Prince of Wales is "expected to attend".&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[[H. T. Waghorn]], ''The Dawn of Cricket'', Electric Press, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1732, the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'' reported that Frederick attended "a great cricket match" at Kew on Thursday 27 July.&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G. B. Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1733 season, Frederick was seriously involved in the game, in effect as a county cricketer for Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Marples, Morris  ''Poor Fred and the Butcher : Sons of George II'' London 1970 p41  {{ISBN|0718108167}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have given a guinea to each player in a Surrey v [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]] game at [[Moulsey Hurst]].&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; Then he awarded a silver cup to a combined Surrey &amp; Middlesex team which had just beaten [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]], arguably the best county team at the time, at Moulsey Hurst on Wed 1 August.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;[[H. T. Waghorn]], ''Cricket Scores, Notes, etc. (1730–1773)'', Blackwood, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first reference in cricket history to any kind of trophy (other than hard cash) being contested. On Friday 31 August, the Prince of Wales' XI played [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]]'s XI on Moulsey Hurst. The result is unknown but the teams were said to be of county standard, so presumably it was in effect a Surrey v Sussex match.&lt;ref name=TJM&gt;[[Timothy J. McCann]], ''Sussex Cricket in the Eighteenth Century'', Sussex Record Society, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following 1733, there are frequent references to the Prince of Wales as a patron of cricket and as an occasional player.

When he died on 31 March 1751 (N.S), cricket suffered a double blow as his death closely followed that of [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]], the game's greatest financial patron at the time. Accordingly, the number of top-class matches declined for several years, although economic difficulties and priorities from the wars of the period certainly inhibited many potential investors.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300–1787 |accessdate=29 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140105/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html#wales |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

His political ambitions unfulfilled, Frederick died at Leicester House at the age of 44 in 1751. In the past this has been attributed to a burst [[human lung|lung]] [[abscess]] caused by a blow from a cricket or a [[real tennis]] ball,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fisher, ''Princes of Wales'' (University of Wales Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now thought to have been from a [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/41xVBDYmZgbmgwPNc9XlNY8/frederick-prince-of-wales|title=Frederick Prince of Wales|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wWbkBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT160&amp;ots=n4A3Z0zxUV&amp;dq=blood%20clot%20lungs%20frederick%20prince%20wales&amp;pg=PT160#v=onepage&amp;q=blood%20clot%20lungs%20frederick%20prince%20wales&amp;f=false Natalie Livingstone, ''The Mistresses of Cliveden'' (Random House, 2015), chapter 6]&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 13 April 1751.

The Prince of Wales' epigram (quoted by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], "Four Georges"):
::"Here lies poor Fred who was alive and is dead,
::Had it been his father I had much rather,
::Had it been his sister nobody would have missed her,
::Had it been his brother, still better than another,
::Had it been the whole generation, so much better for the nation,
::But since it is Fred who was alive and is dead,
::There is no more to be said!"

'''Garrett''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] during the 1750s.

==Career==
Garrett is first mentioned in the report of the Kent v [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] game at [[Dartford Brent]] on Friday, 6 July 1750.&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;  He then played for Kent against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] in the two matches at the [[Artillery Ground]] in May 1751.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

As Garrett had established his reputation by 1750, he must have been active for some years previously.  His career probably spanned the 1740s and 1750s when very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports.

'''Hodges Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] at the [[University of North Florida]] (UNF), and the home field for the [[North Florida Ospreys]] [[soccer]], [[track and field]], and [[cross country running|cross country]] teams. It is located on the university's campus in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], U.S. It is named for George and Kernan Hodges, who donated $2 million to upgrade the facility in 2006.&lt;ref name=Hodges&gt;{{cite news |title= Ospreys receive major donation |first= Jason|last= Schneider|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= October 10, 2006|url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/101006/col_5515372.shtml|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12,000-capacity stadium opened in 2004 with s capacity of 9,400 and underwent renovations in 2006 and 2008 that installed additional seating, a [[press box]], and a 9-lane [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] quality [[running track]]. The facility additionally includes classrooms, offices, and the Browning Athletic Training and Education Center. Following the completion of the current track, it became one of seven facilities in the U.S. certified by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF), allowing it to host all NCAA and IAAF events within its grounds. In addition to its use by UNF the stadium has become a center for [[rugby league football]], serving as home field for the [[Jacksonville Axemen]] of the [[USA Rugby League]] (USARL), and hosting several international matches and [[training camp]]s.&lt;ref name=UNFrugby&gt;{{cite news |title= UNF rugby support has worldwide draw|first= Matt|last= Coleman|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= November 13, 2009|url= http://jacksonville.com/sports/2009-11-13/story/unf_rugby_support_has_worldwide_draw|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of North Florida's field was first opened in 2004 in order to serve the [[North Florida Ospreys]] men's and women's [[soccer]], [[cross country running]], and [[track and field]] teams.&lt;ref name=unfospresys&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unfospreys.com/sports/2008/9/19/HodgesStadium.aspx|title= UNF Athletics Facilities: Hodges Stadium|author= |date= |work= University of North Florida Ospreys |publisher= unfospreys.com|accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Jacksonville philanthropists George and Kernan Hodges issued a $2 million donation to UNF to improve the facility. The donation funded the construction of seats for 10,000, an eight-lane [[400 metres|400-meter]] track, a [[press box]], lighting, and classrooms and offices. The nameless field was renamed Hodges Stadium after them.&lt;ref name=Hodges/&gt; Other additions included the Browning Athletic Training and Education Center and a strength and conditioning center.&lt;ref name=track&gt;{{cite news |title= State-of-the-art track has UNF running with fast crowd|first= Francine|last= King|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= October 10, 2006|url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/082108/spu_320965908.shtml |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the stadium underwent another renovation to install a new state-of-the art [[running track]]. The university spent another $3 million to complete the 9-lane [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-quality track. It was designed by the Italian company Mondo and was the third facility in the world to feature the company's Mondotrack SX rubber surface.&lt;ref name=track/&gt; It was built to meet [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) standards, and is one of only seven facilities in the U.S. to be certified by the IAAF.&lt;ref name=unfospresys/&gt;&lt;ref name=track/&gt; It is the third largest stadium in the United States dedicated to track &amp; field and soccer.&lt;ref&gt;http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/8cc7b03d#/8cc7b03d/14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==
The stadium has also held three international [[rugby league|rugby league football]] matches, and has hosted [[training camp]] for several international teams. Academy Award-winning actor [[Russell Crowe]] visited UNF to organize preparations for an international club rugby league played at UNF. Crowe's [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] played against the [[Leeds Rhinos]] on January 26, 2008, with 12,000 people in attendance. In 2009, the Leeds Rhinos returned to UNF to play the [[Salford Red Devils|Salford City Reds]] in an exhibition game.

'''House Park''' is a 6,000-6,500 seat [[American football]] stadium in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] that is owned and operated by the [[Austin Independent School District]]. Unlike many school districts in Texas, AISD uses multiple shared stadiums including House Park for use in athletic events rather than building a stadium for each high school.

==History==
On October 31, 1938, the Public Works Administration (PWA) offered the City of Austin a grant not to exceed $613,127 to cover 45% of the costs of school buildings, a stadium and field house, and additions and alterations to existing school buildings, including necessary equipment and acquisition of necessary land under PWA Docket No. Texas-2134-F. House Park was built using a portion of this funding package. Giesecke &amp; Harris designed the project and J. R. Blackmore &amp; Sons built it.

House Park opened in fall 1939 along [[Shoal Creek (Texas)|Shoal Creek]], just down the hill from the old campus of [[Austin High School (Austin, Texas)|Austin High School]] near downtown.  The stadium was built on land donated by [[Edward M. House]], a former diplomat and adviser to [[Woodrow Wilson]].  House Park was later dedicated to the memory of the Austin High students that lost their lives serving in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

==High school sports==
{{As of|2012}}, the stadium still serves as the home stadium for Austin High, as well as [[Anderson High School (Austin, Texas)|Anderson]], [[McCallum High School|McCallum]] and [[Lanier High School (Austin, Texas)|Lanier]] High Schools.  The absence of a [[Track and field|track]] sets it apart from most other high school stadiums in large cities, but it does also host [[soccer]] games and has in the past been the site of the Texas High School [[Lacrosse]] Championships.

==Professional sports==

House Park is the home of [[Austin Sol]], Austin's professional ultimate frisbee team. Their inaugural season home opener was April 9, 2016.

House Park is also the home of [[Austin Yellow Jackets]] of the [[Independent Women's Football League]].

In 2008, the natural grass playing surface was replaced with [[artificial turf]]. Fans were able to take patches of the grass turf as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinisd.org/newsmedia/releases/index.phtml?more=1548 Austin Independent School District]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2015, [[2015 Texas–Oklahoma floods|historic flooding]] along Shoal Creek damaged the stadium and turf forcing the [[Austin Aztex|Aztex]] to search for a temporary home.&lt;ref&gt;http://kxan.com/2015/05/26/aisd-assessing-house-park-after-floods/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaipal Singh Stadium''' is a multi-purposed stadium loacated in the city of [[Ranchi]] in [[Jharkhand]]. The stadium was built in 1978 and was named after famous hockey player and captain [[Jaipal Singh|Jaipal Singh Munda]] after a request was made by [[Birsa Seva Dal]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/Jaipal-Singh-Stadium-to-get-international-look/articleshow/22242547.cms Jaipal Singh Stadium to get international look]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the stadium built, it was neglected for its sporting infrastructure but in 2013 [[Government of Jharkhand]] and [[Ranchi Municipal Corporation]] made plan to revamp the stadium into sports complex with aid from Central Government of India.&lt;ref&gt; [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/Jharkhands-Rs-650-crore-khelgaon-in-a-shambles/articleshow/20599150.cms Jharkhand's Rs 650-crore khelgaon in a shambles]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a proposal came from urban development minister [[Raghubar Das]] to make a site of stadium into shopping complex but the planwas opposed by residents and sports lovers as well as Councillor. Sport lovers and residents also created '''Jaipal Singh Stadium Bachao Sangharsh Samit''' to save the stadium. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120713/jsp/jharkhand/story_15720341.jsp#.Vc8dw7Kqqko Revamp hope for Jaipal stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

In lasted proposal in 2013, the stadium will under-go changes and will have football ground, tennis court, badminton court, multi-gym, two pavilions, open air theatre, food court and shops. Gym will have all the modern equipment's as well as two pavilions for the players and football ground  will be 300 meters long and 150 meters wide.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2346932/Jharkhand-sports-complex-lies-unused-crumbling-despite-Rs-650-crore-price-tag.html Jharkhand sports complex lies 'unused and crumbling' despite Rs 650 crore price tag] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [http://sports.ndtv.com/world-cup-2011/news/168852-national-games-begins-with-a-colourful-opening-ceremony National Games begins with a colourful opening ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
After the Games, the Arena is utilized as a permanent [[ice skating]] rink open to the community.

Located at the northern end of the [[Makomanai Park]], the arena is used not only as an ice skating venue, but also for a huge meeting, and concert venue.

The stadium has been known as its nickname, "Makomanai Ice Arena", and on April 1, 2007, the nickname was changed to the "Makomanai Sekisui Heim Ice Arena", after ''Sekisui Heim'', a Japanese [[real estate]] company, acquired its [[naming rights]].

In 1998, it was one of the venues for the [[1998 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|Volleyball Men's World Championship]], the Pool D of the tournament was played here.

==Location==
The arena is a 20 to 25 minute walk from [[Makomanai Station]] on the [[Namboku Line (Sapporo)|Namboku Line]].

'''Abuja National Stadium''' (also known as '''National Stadium''' or '''Abuja Stadium''') is a multipurpose [[National Stadium|national sports stadium]] located in [[Abuja]], in the [[Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria]]. The stadium serves as a home to the [[Nigerian national football team]], as well as a center for various social, cultural, and religious events. The Federal Government of Nigeria approved the contract for the construction of the National Stadium complex and Games Village on 18 July 2000. The stadium was constructed to host the [[2003 All-Africa Games|8th All Africa Games]] which took place in October 2003.

==Construction and Architecture==
[[File:Abuja Stadium 3.jpg|thumb|190px|Seats view of the stadium]]
Abuja stadium is one of the 50 most expensive stadiums&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesportmarket.biz/charts/stadiumstats/top50stadiums/ranktop.html |title=Top 50 Most Expensive Stadiums in the World (adjusted for inflation) |website=The Sport Market |accessdate=18 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730194811/http://www.thesportmarket.biz/charts/stadiumstats/top50stadiums/ranktop.html |archivedate=30 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ever built in the world.

==Structure==
The Abuja National Stadium main bowl is designed to accommodate 60,491 spectator seats&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gus-ai.de/pdf/B177_AST-Stadion.pdf |title=National Stadium Complex, Abuja/Nigeria |website=GUS - Gesellschaft für Umweltplanung Stuttgart |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered by a lightweight roof construction. The main characteristics are the two overlapping spectator tiers; the lower tier accommodating 32,000 seats and the upper tier 28,000 seats. The lower tier also incorporates 56 corporate suites with viewing terraces and one presidential lounge for 50 guests. All functional and secondary areas are accommodated in the entrance building which provides a gross floor area of approximately 25,000 m². This building is arranged below the concourse level which serves as the spectators‘ distribution level and therefore provides several kiosks, banks, first aid stations and toilet buildings. The structure of the stadium is a combination of insitu and precast concrete elements. There are 36 towers supporting the upper tier and the roof structure. These towers are founded on 140 bored piles with diameters of 1.30 m and 1.50 m in a depth of 8.00 m to 30.00 m. Precast concrete elements varying between 13 and 15 meters in length are placed between the towers, forming the spectator stands. A total of 6,300 precast elements were produced in the company’s production yard 15 kilometers away. The towers are connected on the top by a 2.50 m high and 2.00 m wide hollow concrete ring beam with a wall thickness of 0.35 m. The roof structure is fixed on 36 massive concrete points to the ring-beam. For the first time in the world, the ringbeam for this kind of roof structure was made of concrete. The roof structure itself is a cable construction with a weight of 800 tons carrying a 28.000 m² membrane.

==Facilities==
[[File:Abuja Stadium 6.jpg|thumb|190px|External view]]
All facilities within the stadium are designed and engineered in compliance with the requirements of international sport associations, particularly the [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) and the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF).

The complex includes:
*60,491 capacity covered main bowl
*Presidential suite and viewing area
*56 corporate suites
*Post offices
*Banks
*Media facilities
*Two scoreboards and floodlights
*Shops and kiosks for snacks
*Helipad
*3000 capacity indoor sports hall
*2000 capacity gymnasi* 2000 capacity swimming pool
*Tennis Courts
*3000 capacity hockey stadium
*Baseball and softball complex

The Abuja Stadium meets the requirements of the International safety standards; it is equipped with emergency service units, closed circuit security cameras as well as crowd control steel fencing. There are also stand-by fire fighting equipment and metal detectors which have been put in place to avoid any misfortunes.

==History of the Stadium==
Although Nigeria had several stadiums scattered throughout the country, there was a lack of stadiums that met international standards. The capital city of Nigeria, Abuja, was selected to host the 8th All Africa Games in 2000 (a regional multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa) despite having no facilities for  such a major sporting event. The Federal Government of Nigeria embarked on a multimillion-dollar project for the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium and games village to be completed in time to host the All Africa Games. The contract was awarded on 18 July 2000 from a choice list of about 80 different bidders. Construction of the complex was initiated.

Citizens and athletes had doubts as to whether the completion of the stadium was feasible before the games. However, construction went very smoothly and ended up being ahead of schedule. As a matter of fact, the stadium was scheduled to be the host center for the [[Miss World]] [[Beauty Contest|Beauty Pageant]] that took place later in 2002. Unfortunately, the stadium not being fully completed by then as well as an uprising amongst citizens forced the pageant to relocate to [[London]], [[England]]. The construction of the main bowl went on from its inception in September 2000 to its completion in April 2003, well in time for the games. The Games Village construction went on from September 2000 to August 2003.

The official commissioning of the complex was on 8 April 2003. Following its commissioning was the final leg of preparations for the games. The games that year were the largest in All Africa Games history;&lt;ref&gt;"8th All Africa Games." ''2K+ International Sports Media.'' Retrieved 30 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 6,000 athletes from 53 countries competed in 22 sports, watched over by 1,200 officials. Over 1,500 journalists reported for the world's media. The games took place from the 4th to 18 October 2003 and was deemed successful by many. The host country, Nigeria, accumulated a total of 226 medals, emerging as leader of the games that year.

Apart from the All African Games, the stadium has hosted important football matches, such as World Cup qualifiers between Nigeria and other countries. The first game played at the stadium was a football (soccer) match between two local rival teams; the Shooting Stars of [[Ibadan]] and Sunshine Stars of [[Akure]] on 8 April 2003&lt;ref&gt;"Nigeria; Who Will Score First International Goal at Abuja Stadium?." ''VANGUARD Newspapers'' 19 April 2003. Retrieved 30 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first goal scored in the complex was from Shooting Stars' striker Shakiru Lawal who scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes.

The complex has given the country confidence to bid for various up-coming international events. The Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) has given the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF) the provisional hosting rights of the 2007 World Youth Championship because of the facilities the stadium has.

==Other uses==
Apart from its function as a sports center, the Abuja Stadium serves as a home to cultural and religious events. Its capacity attracts various events such as concerts, and religious conferences, events which sometimes have preference over sports. Nigeria is a highly religious country with a population split almost equally between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Due to this fact, several religious events occur each year that attract a lot of citizens and require a large capacity arena. For example, in September 2006, the Nigeria Football Association was rendered helpless over the Presidency's preference of a religious event in the main bowl of the Abuja Stadium to an international football match against Rwanda.

Some citizens are however concerned about the use of the stadium for such large events. Similar events held at the Stadium in Lagos resulted in its demise. The management of the stadium, however, intends to keep these events coming. Cost of maintenance is an issue and renting out the facility for various events is a strategy that has been employed to cover these costs. There were no plans whatsoever by the former military ruler late general Sani Abacha to build a national stadium in Abuja as some people might think.

==Maintenance==
Several issues have risen concerning the maintenance of the sports complex. The [[National Stadium, Lagos|National Stadium]] in [[Lagos, Nigeria|Lagos]], the most populous and industrialized city in the country, was built for the [[1973 All-Africa Games]]. Though it initially was considered state-of-the-art, it today is considered below any standard facility-wise and environmental-wise. The Nigerian sports boss [[Amos Adamu]] advised the government to privatize the Abuja stadium immediately after the 2003 All-Africa Games in order to forestall the vandalisation typical of publicly owned buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22608356_ITM
 |title=COJA Boss Wants Abuja Stadium Sold.
 |date=4 March 2003
 |publisher=This Day (Nigeria)
 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government of Nigeria, who owns 100% equity on the property at the moment, has faced a lot of antagonism both locally and internationally. The average estimate for annual maintenance since its inauguration has been about $7 million, a number considered high by many standards. Due to the high cost of maintenance, the federal government has been seeking options for privatization of the facility. Through the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Federal Government of Nigeria intends to grant a concession to a sole Concessionaire who will enter into an investment commitment, and essentially operate the stadium with a primary goal of generating revenue from the proceeds of sporting events, concerts, religious activities, corporate sponsorship, corporate advertising and other  promotional activities.

The Concessionaire has the choice of assuming the role of Facility Manager for the property encompassed in the National Stadium and the Indoor Sports Complex, or employ a firm to perform the task. The BPE will act as the monitor in the arrangement, and the Concessionaire will report to the federal government through the BPE. A minimum tenure of 20 years was recommended, subject to review every five years. Maintenance of the Stadium and its external areas will be the responsibility of the Concessionaire.

[[File:Potato_race_2.png|thumb|Riders in a mounted potato race. The rider on the white horse has just scored a point by placing a potato in his side's basket.]]

A '''potato race''' may refer to several similar [[racing]] events where contestants compete to collect a number of [[potato]]es as quickly as possible. Participants may be mounted on [[horseback]] or running on foot, depending on the style of race. Potato races of both types were most popular at community events such as [[county fair]]s, [[rodeo]]s, [[picnic]]s, and [[track and field]] meets from the middle of the 19th century until approximately the 1930s.

Mounted events were held in many locations across America, but were particularly prevalent in the [[American Southwest]]. Individual mounted events usually consisted of individuals competing to be the fastest at collecting potatoes along a structured course. Team-based events had no defined course, and were notable for their violence. Players were permitted almost every possible tactic for interfering with the opposing team, including dragging other riders off their horses.

Potato races, both on-foot and mounted, are occasionally still held at local gatherings or riding competitions today, although the violent mounted version has died out.

== History ==
It is unclear precisely where and when the potato race was originally developed. It was mentioned by name without elaboration in newspaper reports of athletic events in [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], and [[Wales]] as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref name="CourierArgus"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20452415/1865_potato_race_scotland_article/|title=Presentation of prizes.

In 1902, ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] described a mounted potato race that took place at the Louisville Horse Show, remarking on its violence and noting that it "made a big hit."&lt;ref name="The CJ" /&gt; It was not until 1912 that newspapers reported potato racing as a mounted rodeo event, with advertisements for one large [[Los Angeles]] rodeo listing the potato race by name, although without elaboration on the rules.&lt;ref name="ArizonaStar"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20364673/potato_race_rodeo/|title=$10000 Prizes Offered For First Rodeo|last=|first=|date=February 13, 1912|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=May 25, 2018|location=Tuscon, Arizona|page=3|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1913 report in the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] clearly describes a team-based potato race taking place at a [[Mardi Gras]] celebration in [[Salinas, California]], calling it a "new riding stunt".&lt;ref name="SFChronicle"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20364768/potato_race_san_francisco/|title=Spirit of Mardi Gras in Control|last=|first=|date=August 3, 1913|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=May 25, 2018|page=35|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1913, on-foot potato races were being referred to as old-fashioned.&lt;ref name="Meader13"&gt;{{Cite book| url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Indoor_and_Outdoor_Gymnastic_Games.djvu/57| title=Indoor and Outdoor Gymnastic Games|last=Chesley|first=Albert Meader|publisher=American Sports Publishing Company|year=1913|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49|language=en|access-date=May 28, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=en.wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1917 article in [[Popular Mechanics]] magazine suggested racing to screw in a line of [[Lightbulb|lightbulbs]] as a substitute for potato races.&lt;ref name="PopMech1917"&gt;{{Cite magazine| url=https://archive.org/stream/PopularMechanics1917/Popular_Mechanics_07_1917#page/n69/mode/2up/search/potato |title=Light Bulbs Supplant Potatoes in Odd Race| magazine=Popular Mechanics|last=|first=|date=July 1917|publisher=Popular Mechanics Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of mounted potato races as rodeo events died out by the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Plains"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hR7lrNLCi5sC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22potato+race%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh1re1lI_bAhUl6YMKHTf6B18Q6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22potato%20race%22&amp;f=false|title=Plains Folk: A Commonplace of the Great Plains|last=Hoy|first=Jim|last2=Isern|first2=Tom|date=1987|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=|isbn=9780806120645|location=|pages=126–127|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foot races ==
[[File:Potato race on roof of Public School 44, New York City LCCN2016652411.tif|thumb|A potato race run on foot at a New York City school. ]]

A number of lanes, one per runner, would be marked out. Potatoes would be placed at intervals along each lane, and a basket would be placed several feet behind the lane. Runners would race to retrieve potatoes one by one, returning each one to the basket before returning for the next. The winner was the first to collect all the potatoes in their lane.&lt;ref name="Playground" /&gt; In one variation, two runners competed to be the first to return fifty potatoes to their own basket, racing simultaneously to take the closest potato from a single line of one hundred potatoes rather than separate lanes.&lt;ref name="Puzzles"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QCy6DzgqcI4C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22potato+race%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjomvfflI_bAhVMwYMKHRj-B6k4ChDoAQhLMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22potato%20race%22&amp;f=false|title=Mathematical Puzzles|last=Loyd|first=Sam|date=1959|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=|isbn=9780486204987|location=|pages=103|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On-foot potato races have been likened to the [[Zuni]] game of ''A-we-wō-po-pa-ne,'' which involved collecting stones rather than potatoes.&lt;ref name="Owens1891"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Owens|first=John G.|date=May 1891|title=Some Games of the Zuni|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_39/May_1891/Some_Games_of_the_Zuni| pages=40–41|magazine=Popular Science Monthly|volume=39|via=en.wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1915, feminist theorist [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] described seeing a [[Film|moving picture]] of a potato race on ice, and remarked on the notable difference between the performance of men and women, which she attributed to women's restrictive clothing.&lt;ref name="Perkins1915"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Dress of women : a critical introduction to the symbolism and sociology of clothing|last=Gilman|first=Charlotte Perkins|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=0313312702|editor-last=Hill|editor-first=Michael R.|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=33|oclc=70735344|orig-year=1915|editor-last2=Deegan|editor-first2=Mary Jo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mounted ==

=== Individual sport ===
Potato races with mounted participants were historically geared toward adult participation. They were prominent in the American Southwest.&lt;ref name="PopMech1915"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=td8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA704&amp;dq=%22potato+race%22+invented&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeq42zxJrbAhXhCTQIHd78Aq4Q6AEIPTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22potato%20race%22%20invented&amp;f=false|title=Potato Race is Fast Game When Played By Cowboys|magazine=Popular Mechanics|date=November 1915|publisher=Hearst Magazines|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=704|access-date=May 28, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mounted races, competitors used sharpened stakes to spear potatoes and bring them from one end of a course to another. These races were timed, and the racer whose basket was heaviest at the end was the winner.&lt;ref name="Plains" /&gt; One less common variation bore some similarities to the [[blood sport]] of [[Goose pulling#United States|rooster pulling]], but used potatoes rather than partially-buried [[rooster]]s. A line of potatoes was spaced out along a course, and a rider would ride by at a [[Canter and gallop|loping pace]], leaning down from their horse and snatching the potatoes from the ground. Riders who failed to maintain speed, or missed a potato, would be disqualified. The fastest remaining rider was the winner.&lt;ref name="Plains" /&gt;

Mounted potato races have been staged which feature participants riding on vehicles rather than horses. The ''[[British Almanac]]'' of 1897 mentions a bicycle-mounted potato race in an article describing bicycle gymkhana.&lt;ref name="Almanac1897"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YnI3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;dq=%22potato+race%22+britain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFuM3qgKDbAhVuIDQIHTPUAG0Q6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22potato%20race%22&amp;f=false|title=The British Almanac: Containing Astronomical, Official and Other Information Relating to the British Isles, the Dominions Oversea and Foreign Countries|last=|first=|date=1897|publisher=Stationers' Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=330|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large picnic in [[Radford, Coventry|Radford]], England, in 1908 featured a bicycle potato race whose riders were young women. It was described at the time as a "splendid exhibition".&lt;ref name="McGrory2002"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-93421681/weekend-time-tunnel|title=Weekend: Time Tunnel|first=David |last=McGrory| work= Coventry Evening Telegraph |location= Coventry, England|date=October 26, 2002 |via=Questia |page=34| language=en|access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, 5,000 spectators at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] watched a sort of reverse potato race where passengers in [[car]]s tried to throw potatoes from the vehicle into baskets placed along a track.&lt;ref name="Kramer2009"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.questia.com/read/122038774/indianapolis-motor-speedway-100-years-of-racing|title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway: 100 Years of Racing|year=2009|page=44|last=Kramer|first=Ralph|last2=Andretti|first2=Mario|via=Questia|language=en|access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Motorcyclist]]'' magazine reported that the First Annual Motorcycle Rodeo, held in 1970, featured a potato race with riders mounted on motorcycles.&lt;ref name="Fee1970"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KvkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=%22potato+race%22+%22old+fashioned%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GPnuLYWp5w&amp;sig=R2Jww_qa-r0FA_bNCtb0tncaDWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHyb-at6nbAhWVLH0KHYl5AgI4ChDoAQg3MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22potato%20race%22%20%22old%20fashioned%22&amp;f=false|title=AMA Club Sponsors Motorcycle Rodeo|magazine=American Motorcyclist|last=Fee|first=Robert O.|date=October 1970|page=12|publisher=American Motorcyclist Association|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team-based tournament ===

[[File:Mounted potato race.png|thumb|279.981x279.981px|Riders engaging in a mounted potato race.]]

Around the turn of the 20th century some mounted potato races were run as competitions between teams attempting to fill a basket with potatoes. These events were not so much ordered races as they were free-for-alls, which could last as long as ten minutes.&lt;ref name="The CJ"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20174032/potato_racing/|title=The Potato Race|last=|first=|date=October 3, 1902|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=May 18, 2018|publication-place=Louisville, Kentucky|page=2|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were notably chaotic, as riders were not confined to lanes, and the rules permitted competitors to use their stakes to knock potatoes off the stakes of the other teams.&lt;ref name="Plains" /&gt; Physical violence often ensued; the [[autobiography]] of [[cowboy]] [[Henry Arthur Gant]] describes one team race at a [[Frontier Days (rodeo)|Frontier Days]] event in 1909 that became so violent that the judges were forced to halt the competition in the middle.&lt;ref name="Gant2009"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=SyaC-lNC20IC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=sharpened+lath&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0ZfVS_Vr9C&amp;sig=uHA1QfAAgFucDlIUTFGwmhButB8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR7p6_oY_bAhXK7IMKHTX9DrYQ6AEIXTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=potato&amp;f=false|title=I Saw Them Ride Away|last=Gant|first=Harry Arthur|date=September 22, 2009|publisher=Castle Knob Publishing|year=|isbn=9781441402349|location=|pages=138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Courier-Journal'' noted that violent tactics such as pulling riders off their horses were considered acceptable, and that "biting is about the only thing that is barred."&lt;ref name="The CJ" /&gt;

Writing in ''Plains Folk'', James Hoy remarked upon the similarity of these races to the [[Central Asia]]n sport of [[buzkashi]], which also involves fiercely competitive riders attempting to bring items to a goal, albeit on a much larger scale than potato races.&lt;ref name="Plains" /&gt;

'''The Rev. Harold Ridley, S.J. Intercollegiate Athletic Complex''' is a multi-sport facility owned and operated by [[Loyola University Maryland]].

[[File:Ridley Athletic Complex.jpg|thumb|Loyola Maryland Greyhounds Lacrosse in the Patriot League Championships]]
The auxiliary practice field immediately to the south is named the [[Sean Lugano]] Memorial Field, in memory of the 1995 Loyola graduate and one-time captain of the university's men's [[rugby union]] team who died in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Lugano's family and friends raised over $1 million to name the field in his honor. It is the home of the [[Loyola Rugby Football Club]]. The playing surface is the same as the one at Awalt Field.&lt;ref name="celebraterac"/&gt;

The McClure Tennis Center, which consists of eight lighted courts, opened on April 11, 2015. Financed by a $3.2 million gift from an anonymous donor, it is named for Rick McClure, the university's men's and women's tennis coach since 1979 who had been inducted in Loyola's hall of fame in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-09-25/sports/bal-loyola-maryland-announces-construction-of-tennis-center-in-honor-of-coach-rick-mcclure-20140925_1_new-tennis-facility-longtime-tennis-coach-patriot-league Lee, Edward.

==History==
The idea for the athletic complex originated in a 1995 conversation between Ridley, Loyola's president at the time, and  [[athletic director]] [[Joe Boylan]]. Land for the [[smart growth|smart-growth]] project was purchased in 1998, with {{convert|21|acre|ha}} previously owned by [[LifeBridge Health]] and the other 50 (20.23 ha) by the City.&lt;ref name="maacsoccer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17400&amp;ATCLID=3633953|title=Loyola to Host 2010 MAAC Soccer Championships at Rev. Harold Ridley, S.J. Intercollegiate Athletic Complex|publisher=Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was stalled for years as the university faced opposition from Woodberry residents, mainly over environmental concerns since the parcel was once a [[landfill]]. Eventually the land underwent [[environmental remediation]] with the installation of [[geomembranes]] to prevent [[water pollution|groundwater contamination]] and a collection system that captured [[landfill gas|gases]] from leaking into the atmosphere. Additionally {{convert|29|acre|ha}} of the site were placed in forest [[conservation easement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wbal.com/apps/news/templates/story.aspx?articleid=13288&amp;zoneid=3|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720112946/http://wbal.com/apps/news/templates/story.aspx?articleid=13288&amp;zoneid=3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 20, 2012|author=Jackson, Angela|title=Loyola College Announces New Stadium Completion Date|publisher=WBAL Radio|date=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Construction]] of the complex finally began in the spring of 2006.&lt;ref name="celebraterac"/&gt;

The opening event at the Ridley was a friendly match on March 10, 2010 between the [[Loyola Greyhounds men's soccer]] team and [[Crystal Palace Baltimore]] in a [[fundraiser]] to benefit [[Catholic Relief Services]]' [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haitian earthquake]] recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyolagreyhounds.com/sports/m-soccer/spec-rel/030210aab.html|title=Men's Soccer Hosts Crystal Palace In Charity Friendly|publisher=Loyola University Maryland Athletics|date=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greyhounds won 4&amp;ndash;3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyolagreyhounds.com/sports/m-soccer/spec-rel/031010aaa.html|title=Men's Soccer Wins First Match At Ridley|publisher=Loyola University Maryland Athletics|date=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first intercollegiate contest there, a 3&amp;ndash;1 loss to [[William &amp; Mary Tribe|William &amp; Mary]], was played six months later on September 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyolagreyhounds.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/090710aaa.html|title= William And Mary Downs Men's Soccer, 3&amp;ndash;1|publisher=Loyola University Maryland Athletics|date=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palace hosted a regular-season game that summer on August 18, a 2&amp;ndash;0 defeat to the [[Rochester Rhinos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palacebaltimore.com/home/457629.html|title=Rochester Defeats Palace Baltimore 2&amp;ndash;0|publisher=Crystal Palace Baltimore|date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stambaugh Stadium''', officially '''Arnold D. Stambaugh Stadium''', is a multi-purpose stadium in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], United States, on the campus of [[Youngstown State University]]. The stadium was built in 1982, and is primarily used for [[American football]]. It is the home venue for the [[Youngstown State Penguins football]] team, a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) at the [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Division|Division I Football Championship Division]] (FCS) level and the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]].

==History==
When it opened in 1982, Stambaugh had one large grandstand on the west side, with a seating capacity of approximately 17,000. During their time at Stambaugh, the football team has risen to become a power in FCS football, qualifying for [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]] playoffs 12 times, advancing to the championship game on six occasions, and winning four national championships through the 2015 season. The stadium is also known by fans as the "Ice Castle".&lt;ref name=stambaugh&gt;{{cite web |title=Stambaugh Stadium |url=http://www.ysusports.com/information/facilities/stambaugh_stadium |year=2013 |work=YSUSports.com |publisher=[[Youngstown State University]] |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's 25th Anniversary was celebrated during the 2007 season, and the top 25 players in the stadium's first 25 years were honored at a ceremony on September 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Youngstown State University. [http://ysusports.com/fan_zone/traditions/top_25_players "Top 25 Players Represent Stadium's Storied 25-Year History"], YSUSports.com, Accessed March 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Those players were:

===Renovations===
The stadium was upgraded and expanded prior to the 1997 athletic season with the addition of over 3,000 bleacher seats on the east side of the field, on the site of a practice field. In addition, a new press box was created and 14 additional luxury suites were built, along with a stadium club, which hosts the football team's weekly press conferences and is rented out for private events.  Since 1997, the stadium's capacity is 20,630, making it the largest stadium in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]].&lt;ref name=stambaugh/&gt;

In the summer of 2009, an auxiliary scoreboard was constructed in the south end zone, giving Stambaugh Stadium a scoreboard in each end zone. New reserved chairback seats were also installed during the 2009 season along with two new flagpoles next to the scoreboard in the north end zone, one for the [[Flag of Ohio|Ohio flag]] and one for the United States flag.

==Other uses==
In addition to hosting football and soccer home games, Stambaugh is also the home of YSU's athletic offices, football locker rooms and weight rooms, racquetball courts, ROTC offices, and visitor locker rooms. From 1996–2012, Stambaugh Stadium was also the home field for the YSU women's soccer team.

The cricket ground, commonly known as '''The Grange''', is the regular home of the [[Scotland national cricket team]], and is situated adjacent to the [[Edinburgh Academy]] sports ground, which is in [[Raeburn Place]].

==Cricket==
The Grange has hosted numerous high profile international matches over the years featuring teams such as [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[England cricket team|England]]. Some of the world's finest cricketers have played at The Grange, from [[W. G. Grace]] in 1895 and [[Donald Bradman]] in 1948 to [[Brian Lara]] in 1995, [[Shane Warne]] and [[Andrew Flintoff]]. The ground has hosted Scotland's home matches in ECB domestic cricket competitions. 

The Grange hosted Scotland's first official [[One Day International]] (ODI) outside of [[Cricket World Cup]] on 27 June 2006. A capacity crowd saw Scotland lose by five wickets to Pakistan. The Grange Cricket Club has won the Scottish Cup six times, the East of Scotland League (1953–1996) fourteen times and the Scottish National Cricket League (1997–present) five times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13868">The '''United South of England Eleven''' (USEE) was an itinerant [[cricket]] team founded in November 1864 by [[Edgar Willsher]], as secretary, and [[John Lillywhite]], as treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt; The USEE had no home venue as its prime purpose, like all similarly named teams of the time, was to operate as a travelling show and bring top-class cricket to places in Great Britain and Ireland which rarely received it. Fourteen USEE matches have been recognised by ''CricketArchive'' as [[first-class cricket|first-class]], mostly against the rival [[United North of England Eleven]] (UNEE). The USEE is estimated to have played 217 "odds" matches as a visiting team against local club sides which generally used 22 players.

The USEE was founded at a time of protracted antagonism between northern and southern professionals when the public's demand for exhibition matches was in decline. This was due to an excess of supply, as there had been several predecessors, and the growing interest in county cricket that was developing in the 1860s. But the USEE did succeed in prolonging its existence when it signed contracts with [[W. G. Grace]] and his brother [[Fred Grace|Fred]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next ten years, until Fred Grace's early death, the Grace brothers ran the USEE as its match organisers, for which they received payment, but they played for expenses only. Although the Graces were an expensive acquisition, they were cricket's main attraction and were guaranteed to draw large crowds wherever the USEE played. As a result, the USEE continued to prosper while the trend among its rival elevens was to fade from the scene. The USEE was the last of the major travelling elevens to fold, having seen a decline in public interest through its last three or four seasons. The travelling elevens lost out in the cricket market to county cricket which burgeoned during the 1870s, ironically because of the Graces' county [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]]. In addition, the public quickly warmed to international cricket which emerged at the end of the 1870s. The travelling elevens, which played largely meaningless matches against weak and unbalanced opposition, could not compete with the quality of top-class matches played by the county clubs against each other or a touring [[Australia national cricket team|Australian team]].

==Foundation==
The USEE was created by [[Edgar Willsher]], as secretary, and [[John Lillywhite]], as treasurer in November 1864. It was part of the fall-out from a north-south schism within professional cricket which centred on bad relations between [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] and [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. The two counties played each other in July 1864 but then the northern professionals boycotted an [[All-England cricket teams|England]] v Surrey match and a [[North v South]] match later in the season. The southern professionals played in the North v South and won with embarrassing ease against makeshift opposition. Soon afterwards, they issued a statement that they would not honour the return match and this ended the fixture for some years. It was temporarily replaced by a match involving mostly southern players which was called North of the Thames v South of the Thames. In ''[[Scores and Biographies]]'', it was noted that "the United South was formed at first entirely from secessionists from the [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All England]] and [[United All-England Eleven]]s, principally the latter body". W. G. Grace commented that "after 1864 the All-England and United England Elevens were seen very little in the south".&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant event in the USEE's history was a match in August 1866 at [[John Walker's Ground]] against a [[Southgate Cricket Club|Southgate XV]] formed by [[V. E. Walker]] and his family. Southgate won the game by 3 wickets but, for the first time, the USEE team included [[W. G. Grace]], who scored 0 and 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/194/194690.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Southgate XV v v UNEE XI, Southgate 1866 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also involved was [[E. M. Grace]] but he only ever played for the USEE a couple of times whereas W. G. and [[Fred Grace]] would in time become the team's mainstays.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;

After their father died in December 1871, W. G. and Fred Grace increased their involvement with the USEE to finance both their home (they still lived with their mother) and their medical studies. They received payment from USEE funds for organising matches and claimed expenses for travel and accommodation whenever they played. For example, when the team went to Scotland in 1872, the USEE was paid £100 by their hosts to cover the costs and £5 each went to the nine professionals in the team, leaving £55 (which in 2013 would be about £3,300) of which the lion's share would go to the Graces with perhaps £30 to W. G. and £15 to Fred (i.e., about £900 and £450 respectively per match in 2013 terms).&lt;ref name=R103&gt;Rae, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W95&gt;Williams, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; Since W. G. averaged ten USEE appearances per season through the 1870s, he was potentially receiving £10,000 per season in 2013 terms. This was not the end of it because he claimed appearance fees whenever he guested for another team, rightly adjudging himself to be the main attraction who was bringing in the crowds;&lt;ref name=W95/&gt; and he claimed what he termed his "expenses" whenever he took part in a first-class match.&lt;ref name=R103/&gt; By the standards of the time, cricket was a lucrative business for the Graces, especially considering that they held [[Amateur status in first-class cricket#Distinction between amateurs and professionals|amateur status]].&lt;ref name=R103/&gt;

The peak of the Graces' involvement was 1873 when W. G. made 16 appearances, which was considerable in terms of the travelling involved and given his commitments to Gloucestershire, MCC and elsewhere. [[James Lillywhite]] was the team secretary at this time, in succession to Willsher, but W. G. and Fred effectively took over. Fred did most of the spadework, hardly ever missing a match and effectively running the team which he captained in W. G.'s absence. Indeed, it was on occasion billed as "G. F. Grace's United South of England XI".&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==USEE matches against the UNEE==
When the [[United North of England Eleven]] (UNEE) was founded in 1869, it soon established a regional rivalry with the USEE and the two teams met three times in 1870, the UNEE's first season. The UNEE got off to a flying start when they easily beat the USEE, including the Graces, at [[Lord's]] in July 1870 by an innings and 70 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1645.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=USEE v UNEE, Lord's 1870 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next match at [[Bramall Lane]], Sheffield, the UNEE won by an innings and 5 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1657.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=UNEE v USEE, Bramall Lane 1870 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Graces did not play in this game. The teams met again at The Oval in August and this match was drawn, the USEE needing 33 more to win with eight wickets standing and W. G. Grace still in with 51 not out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1668.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=USEE v UNEE, The Oval 1870 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams did not meet in 1871 and their rivalry was renewed in 1872 when four matches were arranged although the last one at Leeds in September was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1790.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=UNEE v USEE, Leeds 1872 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first match at Bishop's Stortford in June was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1748.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=USEE v UNEE, Bishop's Stortford 1872 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the UNEE won by 8 wickets at Hunslet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1777.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=UNEE v USEE, Hunslet 1872 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September at Northampton, the tide turned and the USEE recorded its first win over the UNEE by 8 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1788.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=USEE v UNEE, Northampton 1872 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elevens did not meet in 1873 and there were two matches in 1874 at Todmorden and Wellingborough. At Todmorden in July, the USEE won convincingly by an innings and 30 runs, largely due to a century by [[Henry Charlwood]] and ten wickets taken by W. G. Grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1906.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=UNEE v USEE, Todmorden 1874 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USEE won by 9 wickets at Wellingborough in September after the UNEE followed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1923.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=USEE v UNEE, Wellingborough 1872 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no matches in 1875 and then the UNEE reasserted itself in 1876 with a win and a draw from two matches. The first at [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield]] was won by 7 wickets after [[Andrew Greenwood]] scored 111.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2041.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=UNEE v USEE, Huddersfield 1876 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match at the [[Town Cricket Club Ground]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], the UNEE was saved by an innings of 108 not out by [[Ephraim Lockwood]] but the highlight of the match was W. G. Grace's innings of 126 in a USEE total of only 159.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2052.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=UNEE v USEE, Hull 1876 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other first-class matches==
The 1876 match in Hull was the last time the UNEE played the USEE although there was a curious footnote to the series when the USEE played against the official [[North of England cricket team]] on 6 &amp; 7 September 1880. The North's team in this match at Rotherham bore little resemblance to the UNEE but, nevertheless, the official North hammered another nail into the coffin of the unofficial USEE with a 53 run victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2422.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=North v USEE, Rotherham 1880 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USEE had earlier played in two other first-class matches. These were in June 1874, when they played [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in Bradford; and May 1876 when they played the [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All-England Eleven]] (AEE) at Lord's. The USEE lost both these matches. Yorkshire beat them by 26 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1885.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Yorkshire v USEE, Bradford 1874 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lost to the AEE by an innings and 84 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2004.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=AEE v USEE, Lord's 1876 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odds matches==
According to ''CricketArchive'''s database, the USEE played in 217 matches in which they were the travelling team operating on an itinerant basis by taking on local sides that invariably had odds, typically using 22 players against the USEE's eleven. The first of these games took place at Dublin in May 1865 and the USEE fielded a strong team of [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] professionals, but the Ireland XXII managed a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/99/99607.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Ireland XXII v USEE XI, Dublin 1865 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last-ever match was at Stroud on 9, 10 &amp; 11 September 1880, just after the match in Hull against the official North. The match against the Stoud XXII was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/195/195120.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Stroud XXII v USEE XI, Stroud 1880 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poignantly, it was also the last cricket match ever played by USEE stalwart Fred Grace, who died eleven days later. According to [[Simon Rae]], the United South died with him.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p.266.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volt Kinizsis Lányok Sportklubja Egyesület''' is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] women's [[team handball|handball]] club from [[Győr]]. They currently compete in the [[Nemzeti Bajnokság I/B (Women's handball)|Nemzeti Bajnokság I/B]], the second tier championship in Hungary.

== History ==
The club was founded in 2000 by the former [[Győri ETO KC|Győri Keksz ETO]] players, who have played on hobby level after their retirement from professional handball. In 2001 they entered the county level championship, which is the fourth tier of Hungarian handball leagues. They dominated through the whole season and gained immediate promotion to [[Nemzeti Bajnokság II (Women's handball)|Nemzeti Bajnokság II]]. After finishing constantly between 3rd and 5th places in the next half decade the breakthrough came in the 2007/08 edition of NB II. By winning 18 league matches beside only one loss and one draw, the Győr-based team found themselves on the top spot at the end of the season and celebrated a further promotion.

Getting ready for a higher level went slowly for VKLSE. Their inaugural season in [[Nemzeti Bajnokság I/B (Women's handball)|Nemzeti Bajnokság I/B]] ended tristful: with only three wins the team finished second from bottom and escaped from relegation only because the league have been expanded from 11 to 14 teams that year. For the 2009–10 season VKLSE strengthened the squad with experienced players, which resulted some improvement and they captured the 9th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vkcsk.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=58|title=Bemutatkozás|publisher=VKLSE Győr Official Website|accessdate=22 February 2011|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West African Cricket Council organised a unified team called the [[West African cricket team|West African Cricket Team]]. They never managed to qualify for the [[ICC Cricket World Cup]], although competed in the [[ICC Trophy]] on three occasions.

The team was an associate member of the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] from 1976 until 2003, when the member states of the West African Cricket Council came under the administration of the newly formed [[African Cricket Association]].
