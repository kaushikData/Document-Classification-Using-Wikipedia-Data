'''''Bácskai Friss Újság''''' (lit. ''Bachkan Fresh News'') was a [[Hungarian language]] daily [[newspaper]]. It was founded in 1901, with the purpose of serving as the information source for the Magyars and Hungarian language-speaking population in [[Bács-Bodrog County]] within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in [[Austria-Hungary]]. It was published in [[Subotica]] (Today in [[Serbia]]). Its editors were Imre Dugovich and János Kovács. Bácskai Friss Újság was disestablished that same year.

'''"Carry Me in Your Dreams"''' was the [[Albania]]n entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], held in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="English"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13466|title=Albania: Kejsi Tola to sing Carry me in your dreams|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=2009-03-08|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was composed by [[Edmond Zhulali]] and [[Agim Doçi]], composers of Albania's first entry to Eurovision, "[[The Image of You]]" by [[Anjeza Shahini]], and is performed by Albanian singer [[Kejsi Tola]] in [[English language|English]]. It finished 17th with 48 points.

==Background==
The song was the winner of [[Festivali I Këngës 47]], the festival used to select Albania's Eurovision entry. Albania was the first country to select and publicly present its song. The song was chosen as the winner of the festival on 21 December 2008—five months before Eurovision, to be held on 16 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12771|title=Albania decided: Kejsi Tola to Eurovision!|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2008-12-21|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=4639 |title=Albania: Kejsi Tola chosen to sing in Moscow |last=Wells |first=Simon |date=2008-12-21 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2008-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224121911/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=4639 |archivedate=24 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was performed during Festivali I Këngës in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as '''"Më merr në ëndërr"''' (Take me into your dreams), and the English version of the song was premiered on 18 March.&lt;ref name="English" /&gt;

==At Eurovision==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kejsi Tola.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kejsi Tola]] performing "Carry Me In Your Dreams at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]] in Moscow.]] --&gt;
Kejsi performed the song at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 semi-final on 14 May 2009, performing 16th in the running order, following [[Moldova]]'s [[Nelly Ciobanu]] with "[[Hora din Moldova]]" and preceding [[Ukraine]]'s [[Svetlana Loboda]] with "[[Be My Valentine! (Anti-Crisis Girl)]]". She received 73 points, placing 7th of the 19 competing songs, and qualifying to the final.

At the final on 16 May Tola performed 19th in the running order, following [[Turkey]]'s [[Hadise]] with "[[Düm Tek Tek]]" and preceding [[Norway]]'s [[Alexander Rybak]] with "[[Fairytale (Alexander Rybak song)|Fairytale]]". The song received 48 points, placing 17th of the 25 competing songs.

The staging featured two b-boys dressed as mimes (twin brothers) and a sequined green man (Jenia Evgenios Buli, who has performed with [[Kalomira]] in 2008 and [[Giorgos Alkaios]] in 2010).
If only tele-voting had been used, Albania would have come in 11th.

'''Djibouti City''' (also called '''Djibouti'''; {{lang-ar|مدينة جيبوتي}}, {{lang-fr|Ville de Djibouti}}, {{lang-so|Magaalada Jabuuti}}, {{lang-aa|Magaala Gabuuti}}) is the eponymous [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Djibouti]]. It is located in the coastal Djibouti Region on the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]].

Djibouti City has a population of around 529,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; which counts for over 70% of the country's population. The settlement was founded in 1888 by the French, on land leased from the ruling Somali and Afar Sultans. During the ensuing period, it served as the capital of [[French Somaliland]] and its successor the [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]].

Known as the ''Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura'' due to its location, Djibouti City is strategically positioned near the world's busiest shipping lanes and acts as a refueling and transshipment center. The [[Port of Djibouti]] is the principal maritime port for imports to and exports from neighboring [[Ethiopia]]. Additionally, the city is the headquarters of many international organizations {{Which|date=September 2017}}, non-profit organizations {{which|date=September 2017}} and companies. [[Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport]] is the main domestic airport, connecting the capital to various major global destinations. Djibouti City has the second-largest economy of any city in the [[Horn of Africa]] after [[Addis Ababa]].

From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] was called "Obock". It was ruled by [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, local authorities with whom [[France]] signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.&lt;ref name="Uwechue"&gt;Raph Uwechue, ''Africa year book and who's who'', (Africa Journal Ltd.: 1977), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Somaliland#History of French Somaliland |display=Somaliland: History of French Somaliland |volume=25 |page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apcoatf"&gt;''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor &amp; Francis), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OlderDjibouticity.jpg|thumb|left|Djibouti City's [[Al Sada Mosque]] in the 1940s.]] 

The French subsequently founded Djibouti City in 1888, in a previously uninhabited stretch of coast. In 1896, the settlement was made the capital of [[French Somaliland]].&lt;ref name="Wbi"&gt;World Book, Inc, ''The [[World Book Encyclopedia]]'', Volume 1, (World Book: 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The city later grew considerably in size following the construction of the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Imperial Ethiopian Railway]]. 
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
It at the time had a population of 15,000 residents,&lt;ref name=EBJ&gt;"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Jibuti |volume=15 |page=414}}" (i.e., Djibouti)&lt;/ref&gt; exceeding the population of all cities in neighbouring [[Ethiopia]] except [[Harar]].&lt;ref name=EBA&gt;"{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia#Provinces and Towns |display=Abyssinia: (7) Provinces and Towns |volume=1 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the initial company failed and required a government bailout to avoid falling under [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] administration,&lt;ref name=EBA/&gt; the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Franco-Ethiopian Railway]] itself was a success and allowed Djibouti city's commerce to quickly eclipse the former caravan-based trade carried on with nearby [[Zeila]] in [[British Somaliland]].&lt;ref name=EBZ&gt;"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Djibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the [[Ogaden]], including trade in [[Harari coffee]] and [[khat]].&lt;ref name=EBJ/&gt;

[[File:French troops Djibouti 1935.jpg|thumb|right|French colonial troops landing in 1935.]]
When [[Germany]] invaded [[France]] in 1940, Djibouti fell under the control of the Axis-allied Vichy French. In response, the [[United Kingdom]] closed the port, but it could not prevent local French from providing information on the passing ship convoys. In December 1942, about 4,000 British troops [[British invasion of French Somaliland|occupied]] the town. Djibouti city had about 22,046 residents. The population of the City Of Djibouti was growing rapidly, from officially about 17,000 inhabitants in 1947 to 40,000 in early 1960, 62,000 in 1967, 118,000 in 1972 to over 150,000 in the early 1980s. It then became the headquarters of the succeeding [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]].

Since [[Independence Day (Djibouti)|independence]] in 1977, the city has served as the administrative and commercial capital of the Republic of Djibouti.

Djibouti City is a multi-ethnic town. It has a population of around 529,000 residents (Djiboutians), making it by far the largest settlement in the country.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=February 26, 2013|date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest ethnic groups are the [[Somalis|Somali]] and the [[Afar people|Afars]], who are traditionally attached to the [[Hamitic]] anthropological group. The city's urban [[landscape]] is shaped by many communities. The ethnic make-up of Djibouti City changed in 1990s, when significant numbers of Ethiopians and Somali immigrants arrived in the city, with Djibouti City nicknamed the "French Hong Kong in the Red Sea" due to its cosmopolitan urbanism.&lt;ref name="Kevin Anglin 2004 p. 698"&gt;Kevin Anglin, Becca Blond and Jean-Bernard Carillet, ''Africa on a Shoestring'' (London: Lonely Planet, 2004), p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of local residents speak [[Somali language|Somali]] (303,100 speakers) or [[Afar language|Afar]] (101,200 speakers) as a first language, which are the [[mother tongue]]s of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively. Both languages belong to the larger [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. There are two official languages in Djibouti: [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (Afroasiatic) and [[French language|French]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]).&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=DJ ''Ethnologue'', "Languages of Djibouti"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic is of social, cultural and religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Colloquially, about 40,000 local residents speak the [[Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic]] dialect, also known as ''Djibouti Arabic''. French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 14,200 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include [[Omani Arabic]] (38,900 speakers), [[Amharic language|Amharic]] (1,400 speakers), [[Greek language|Greek]] (1,000 speakers) and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] (600 speakers).&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;

Djibouti's population is predominantly [[Muslim]]. [[Islam]] is observed by 94% of the nation's population (around 740,000 {{As of|2012|lc=y}}), whereas the remaining 6% of residents are [[Christianity|Christian]] adherents.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Djibouti|Diocese of Djibouti]] serves the small local [[Catholicism|Catholic]] population, which it estimates numbered around 7,000 individuals in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David M.

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[File:Djibouti, Djibouti.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Space image of Djibouti City.]]
Djibouti City is the capital and largest settlement in [[Djibouti]], situated in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The city is located in eastern Djibouti, approximately {{convert|21|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the [[Somalia]] border. It is a seaport, with the only sheltered harbour on the western side of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]]. The landscape around the city, along with Djibouti's coastal lowlands, is [[desert]] or [[semi-desert]]. The city's sandy beaches include Siesta Beach and Heron Beach. It is known as the "Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura" due to its location.

===Climate===
Djibouti City has an [[arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''[[hot desert climate|BWh]]''). It is characterised by very hot rainless summers and a very warm, less dry winter season. Most of the annual precipitation falls between October and May. The city sees on average {{convert|163.5|mm|in|2}} of rainfall per year. Average high temperatures range from {{convert|29|C|F}} during the months of December, January and February, to about {{convert|42|C|F}} in July. There are two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season with more precipitation from November to April (winter). The rainfall on the coast usually occurs between November to March, whereas further inland it falls between April to October. In the summer months, temperatures routinely exceed {{convert|40|C|F}}, with relative humidity at its lowest point of the year. Sunshine is abundant in the city, averaging eight to ten hours a day year-round. It is lowest during the rainy period, when there is some coastal [[fog]] and greater [[cloud]] coverage as warm air passes over the cool sea surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal {{convert|224|mm|in|2}} falling in November 1949.&lt;ref&gt;KNMI Climate explorer, Precipitation totals 1901–2000&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[climate]] zone has summers that reach a maximum [[temperature]] of {{convert|41.7|C|F}} and a minimum temperature of {{convert|32|C|F}}. Winters have average nighttime temperatures of {{convert|21|C|F}} and a daytime maximum temperatures of {{convert|29|C|F|}}. There are barely any days in the year without sunshine, and even during the [[winter]] there are many clear days.

Djibouti City is home to different architectural styles that represent various periods in its history. The old section is filled with [[bazaar]]s and [[souk]]s nestled along narrow streets. It is serves as both a center for commerce and entertainment, as well as a residential area. To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being constructed in and around the city. A few of the building fronts have been renovated and date back to the 19th century. The Place Menelik in the city center is also distinguished by its [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]]-inspired arches. Due to its numerous exotic edifices and structures, the city has also been likened to a European settlement.&lt;ref name="Kevin Anglin 2004 p. 698"/&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:DjiboutiNationalAssembly.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Djibouti National Assembly in downtown Djibouti City.]]
Djibouti City has the distinction of being both a city and an administrative province. The Djibouti Region is one of the six regions of Djibouti. It borders the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] to the north and east, and the [[Arta Region]] to the south and west. The Djibouti Region is the smallest province in the country, but also the region with the highest population. Containing Djibouti's capital, Djibouti City, the province occupies an area of {{convert|200|km2|0|abbr=off}}.
[[File:Addsdjib.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Headquarters of the Social Development Agency of Djibouti.]]
Djibouti City has been the capital of Djibouti since independence in 1977. Due to its maritime location, it was the logical choice as the young republic's administrative center. Following independence, Djibouti City continued with its status as the country's political and cultural hub.

===Air===
[[File:An Turkish Airlines aircraft at the Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport (2016).png|thumb|left|A [[Turkish Airlines]] aircraft at the Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport (2016).]]
Djibouti City is served primarily by the [[Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport]]. It is the second largest airport in the [[Horn of Africa]], and offers flights to numerous global destinations. {{As of|2016}}, the largest services using the airport include [[Air Djibouti]], [[Yemenia]], [[Air France]], [[Flydubai]], [[Ethiopian Airlines]], [[Turkish Airlines]], [[Kenya Airways]] and [[Qatar Airways]]. It is the largest airport in Djibouti and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Horn of Africa and the world. Located approximately {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the city centre, the airport was opened in 1948. Originally a modest-sized facility, the airport grew considerably in size in the post-independence period after numerous successive renovation projects. Outbound international travel from the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport accounts for the majority of all air passengers traveling to and from Djibouti. Due to its strategic location, the facility acts as a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of departures and arrivals, and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing.

About 70% of the seaport's activity consists of imports to and exports from neighboring Ethiopia, which depends on the harbour as its main maritime outlet. The port also serves as an international refueling center and transshipment hub.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; In 2012, the Djiboutian government in collaboration with DP World started construction on the [[Port of Doraleh|Doraleh Container Terminal]],&lt;ref name="Cdpafoid"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bansal|first=Ridhima|title=Current Development Projects and Future Opportunities in Djibouti|url=http://www.aaeafrica.org/start/current-development-projects-and-future-opportunities-in-djibouti/|publisher=Association of African Entrepreneurs|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third major seaport intended to further develop the national transit capacity.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; A $396 million project, it has the capacity to accommodate 1.5 million twenty foot container units annually.&lt;ref name="Cdpafoid"/&gt;

'''''Fano tesemara''''' ({{lang-am|ፋኖ ተሰማራ}}, 'O Guerrilla, rise to arms') is an [[Ethiopia]]n song. It was one of the most popular [[protest song]]s of the Ethiopian [[Student activism|Student Movement]] during the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;Bahru Zewde.

The '''flag of the United Nations''' was adopted on December 7, 1946, and consists of the official emblem of the [[United Nations]] in white on a [[blue]] background.

==Design==
[[File:Flag-of-the-United-Nations.jpg|thumb|right|The flag flying at United Nations Plaza in the [[Civic Center, San Francisco, California]]]]
The emblem's design is described as:

{{quote|A map of the world representing an azimuthal equidistant projection centred on the North Pole, inscribed in a wreath consisting of crossed conventionalized branches of the olive tree, . . .  The projection of the map extends to 60 degrees south latitude, and includes five concentric circles.|Official Seal and Emblem of the United Nations, Report of the Secretary-General, 15 October 1946&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct link from this page http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;DS=A/107&amp;Lang=E can't be linked directly due to referrer checking--&gt; [https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/maplib/flag.htm UN General Assembly A/107, Official Seal and Emblem of the United Nations, 15 October 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[olive branch]]es are a [[peace symbol|symbol for peace]], and the world map represents all the people and the countries of the world.

White and blue are the official colours of the [[United Nations]].

==History==
[[File:Flag of the United Nations (1945-1947).svg|thumb|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|20px]] The first version of the UN flag, April 1945.]]
[[File:Four Freedoms Flag or United Nations Honour Flag ca 1943-1948.svg|thumb|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|20px]]The "[[United Nations Honour Flag]]", used as a symbol of the wartime allies, ca. 1943–1948]]
[[File:UN (miniature flag).JPG|thumb|In miniature flag]]
The organizers of the 1945 [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in [[San Francisco, California]] wanted an insignia that could be made into a pin to identify delegates. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Edward Stettinius, Jr.]] was chairperson of the U.S. delegation, and realized that a temporary design might become the permanent symbol of the United Nations. He formed a committee headed by [[Oliver Lundquist]] that developed a design consisting of a world map surrounded by leaves from a design created by [[Donal McLaughlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram, Hulen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1946/03/10/archives/origin-of-the-uno-seal.html "Origin of the UNO Seal"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 10, 1946. Accessed January 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Catherine. [http://www.unausa.org/site/apps/s/content.asp?c=fvKRI8MPJpF&amp;b=369041&amp;ct=4212781 "UN Logo Designer Celebrates His Centennial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010173141/http://www.unausa.org/site/apps/s/content.asp?c=fvKRI8MPJpF&amp;b=369041&amp;ct=4212781 |date=2008-10-10 }}, [[United Nations Association]], c. 1975. Accessed January 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[blue]] that appears in the background of the insignia was chosen to be "the opposite of red, the war colour",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/maplib/flag.htm UN General Assembly A/107, Official Seal and Emblem of the United Nations, 15 October 1946]. Accessed March 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; although the exact shade has never been officially specified by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/uno.html#col Flags Of The World, United Nations Organization, Flag Colour]. Accessed March 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The original colour the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current United Nations flag. The globe used in the original design was an [[azimuthal projection]] focused on the [[North Pole]] with the United States, the host nation of the conference, at the centre. The projection that was used cut off portions of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] at the latitude of [[Argentina]], which was acceptable at the time, as Argentina was not planned to be an original member of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Heller, Steven. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/world/04lundquist.html "Oliver Lincoln Lundquist, Designer, Is Dead at 92 "], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 2009. Accessed January 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The projection was later altered so that no country will be at prominence within the flag. The new logo was now designed so that the globe is bisected in the centre by the [[Prime Meridian]] and the [[International Date Line]].

In 1946, a UNO committee got the task of making a definite design, which was presented December 2, 1946, and adopted by the plenary session of the UNO on December 7, 1946. The earlier version had the globe 90 degrees turned eastward compared with the present flag, which has the [[Prime Meridian]] and the [[International Date Line]] forming the vertical diameter. According to press statements, the change was made to move [[North America]] away from the centre of the emblem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/uno.html#1945 Flags Of The World, United Nations Organization, UN Flag, 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

According to the [[Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel]], the emblem and the flag of the United Nations can be used by the personnel and material of UN [[peacekeeping]] missions as a [[protective sign]] to prevent attacks during an [[War|armed conflict]].

The United Nations flag may also be flown as a garrison flag with other country flags. Garrison size is 10 feet by 30 feet.

==Derived flags==

===Agencies and organizations===
*&lt;!--WFP--&gt;The flag of the [[World Food Programme]] has the olive leaves of the UN flag, with a hand clutching grains in the centre, in place of the globe. The white/blue colours of the UN flag are reversed in the WFP flag.

*&lt;!--UNPA--&gt;A proposed flag for a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] uses the same colours and olive branches and uses the cartographic elements of the globe to create what appear to be parliamentary benches.
* Dr. [[Arthur Keppel-Jones]] wrote in 1946 the Future History novel "[[When Smuts Goes]]", whose plot culminates with a UN-sponsored military intervention in South Africa, to topple White Minority rule. In the book, UN forces are depicted as flying a four-color "[[Four Freedoms|Four Freedoms Flag]]". The book was actually published in 1947, when the UN already adopted its present flag, but Keppel-Jones did not update this detail of his book.

'''''Apollon''''' was an 18th-century [[ship of the line]] in service with the [[French Navy|Royal French Navy]].

A '''hamburger''', '''beefburger''' or '''burger''' is a [[sandwich]] consisting of one or more cooked [[patty|patties]] of [[ground meat]], usually [[Ground beef|beef]], placed inside a sliced [[bread roll]] or [[bun]]. The patty may be [[pan frying|pan fried]], [[grilling|grilled]], or [[Flame broiler|flame broiled]]. Hamburgers are often served with [[cheese]], [[lettuce]], [[tomato]], [[bacon]], [[onion]], [[pickled cucumber|pickles]], or [[Chili pepper|chiles]]; [[condiment]]s such as [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[mayonnaise]], [[ketchup]], [[relish]], or "[[special sauce]]"; and are frequently placed on [[Bun|sesame seed buns]]. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a [[cheeseburger]].

The term "burger" can also be applied to the [[patty|meat patty]] on its own, especially in the UK where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to [[ground beef]]. The term may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in "[[Turkey meat|turkey burger]]", "[[bison]] burger", or "[[veggie burger]]".

Hamburgers are sold at [[fast-food restaurant]]s, [[diner]]s, and specialty and high-end [[restaurant]]s (where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.

==Etymology and terminology==
The term ''hamburger'' originally derives from [[Hamburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hamburger|accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]]'s second-largest city. In [[German language|German]], ''Burg'' means "castle", "fortified settlement" or "fortified refuge" and is a widespread component of place names. The first element of the name is perhaps from [[Old High German]] ''hamma'', referring to a bend in a river, or [[Middle High German]] ''hamme'', referring to an enclosed area of pastureland.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hamburg|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hamburger'' in German is the [[demonym]] of Hamburg, similar to ''[[hot dog|frankfurter]]'' and ''wiener'', names for other meat-based foods and demonyms of the cities of [[Frankfurt]] and [[Vienna]] (Wien), respectively.

The term "burger", a [[back-formation]], is associated with many different types of sandwiches, similar to a (ground meat) hamburger, but made of different meats such as [[American bison|buffalo]] in the [[buffalo burger]], [[venison]], [[kangaroo]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[elk]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or fish like [[salmon as food|salmon]] in the [[salmon burger]], but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the [[veggie burger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/burger Burger] ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of the hamburger|History of the hamburger in the United States}}
[[File:Hamburg steak.jpg|thumb|[[Hamburg steak]] has been known as "[[Frikadeller|Frikadelle]]" in Germany since the 17th century.]]
[[File:Oberhafenkantine (Hamburger Rundstück).jpg|thumb|The "Hamburger Rundstück" was popular already 1869, and is believed to be a precursor to the modern Hamburger.]]
There have been many claims about the origin of the hamburger, but the origins remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=VritIGJ5f48C|title=The Story behind the Dish: Classic American Foods: Classic American Foods|last=McWilliams|first=Mark|date=April 6, 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313385100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular book "[[The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy]]" by [[Hannah Glasse]] included a recipe in 1758 as "Hamburgh sausage", which suggested to serve it "roasted with toasted bread under it". A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg by the name "Rundstück warm" ("bread roll warm") in 1869 or earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11005595_00083.html|title=Neuester, vollständiger Führer durch Hamburg, Altona und Umgegend : Mit Berücksichtigung von Kiel, Helgoland, Lübeck und Travemünde.

[...]|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supposedly eaten by many emigrants on their way to America, but may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than [[Frikadeller]]. Hamburg steak is reported to have been served between two pieces of bread on the [[Hamburg America Line]], which began operations in 1847. Each of these may mark the invention of the Hamburger, and explain the name.

There is a reference to a "[[Hamburg steak]]" as early as 1884 in the Boston Journal.&lt;sup&gt;[OED, under "steak"]&lt;/sup&gt;   On July 5, 1896, the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' made a highly specific claim regarding a "hamburger sandwich" in an article about a "Sandwich Car": "A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range."&lt;ref name="hamburger1896"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/829656/specific_hamburger_sandwich_claim_prior/? | title=In a "Sandwich Car" | publisher=Chicago Daily Tribune | date=July 5, 1896 | accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims of invention ===
According to Congresswoman [[Rosa DeLauro]], the hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a [[Danes|Danish]] immigrant, owner of [[Louis' Lunch]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="James"&gt;[[Rosa L. DeLauro]] (2000). [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/CT/200002814.html Louis' Lunch]. the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;/ref&gt; There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher Davis.&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;Sam Gazdziak (August 1, 2006). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152420803.html "Giving the BURGER its due: the hamburger's origins are somewhat shrouded in mystery, but there is no doubt as to its impact on American dining habits and culture.(Editorial)."] The National Provisioner. BNP Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin2"&gt;Nancy Ross Ryan (February 6, 1989). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-7049156.html Great American food chronicles: the hamburger. (restaurant marketing)]. Restaurants &amp; Institutions. Reed Business Information, Inc. (US).&lt;/ref&gt; [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Gay Scripps (April 2, 2004). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7144512.html Birth of an icon: Hamburger's origins unclear, but it became popular 100 years ago]. Deseret News (Salt Lake City).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it gained national recognition at the [[1904 St. Louis World's Fair]] when the ''New York Tribune'' referred to the hamburger as "the innovation of a food vendor on the pike".&lt;ref name="Origin2" /&gt; No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: "One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2856336 | title=A Major Beef!

====Louis Lassen====
Louis Lassen of [[Louis' Lunch]], a small lunch wagon in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], is said to have sold the first hamburger and [[steak sandwich]] in the U.S. in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/ct/es_ct_burger_1.html Louis' Lunch A Local Legacy]. Library of Congress. Americaslibrary.gov. Retrieved on April 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Library of Congress Folklife Center Local Legacies Project retrieved on April 13, 2009 [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/CT/200002814.html Louis' Lunch A Local Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ct.gov/ctportal/cwp/view.asp?a=843&amp;q=246434 About Connecticut]. State of Connecticut official website&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine states that "The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later", noting also that this claim is subject to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC |title=New York Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |year = 1977 |publisher=New York Media, LLC |page=42 |issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast.&lt;ref name="Origin2"/&gt; Some critics like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for ''New York Magazine'', claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.&lt;ref name=Beach /&gt;

====Charlie Nagreen====
One of the earliest claims comes from [[Charlie Nagreen]], who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair&lt;ref name=Harmon /&gt; now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair.&lt;ref name=Beach&gt;Randall Beach (February 3, 2008) [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25510511.html Louis' Lunch has beef with book claiming it didn't invent the hamburger]. ''New Haven Register'' (New Haven, CT). McClatchy-Tribune Information Services.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seymour Community Historical Society]] of [[Seymour, Wisconsin]], credits Nagreen, now known as "Hamburger Charlie", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the [[Hamburg steak]] with which local German immigrants were familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seymourhistory.org/news/?id=35 |title="Hamburger" Charlie Nagreen |publisher=SeymourHistory.org |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Myron|last=Heuer |title=The real home of the hamburger |url=http://www.herald-journal.com/archives/1998/columns/mh101298.html |work=Herald &amp; Journal |date=October 12, 1999 |accessdate=March 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- For proof, the Historical Society's web site refers to articles posted on http://www.homeofthehamburger.org/history.html, but these establish only that Seymour's first annual fair took place in 1885 and Nagreen claimed in 1947 to have invented the hamburger there. --&gt;

====Otto Kuase====
According to White Castle, Otto Kuase was the inventor of the hamburger. In 1891 he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg. German sailors would later omit the fried egg.&lt;ref name=Origin2 /&gt;

====Oscar Weber Bilby====
The family of Oscar Weber Bilby claim the first-known hamburger on a bun was served on July 4, 1891 on Grandpa Oscar's farm. The bun was a yeast bun.&lt;ref name=Origins /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Josh|last=Ozersky |title=The Hamburger: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjP0Jf2DGkEC&amp;pg=PT19 |year=2009 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15125-1 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John T.

====Frank and Charles Menches====
[[File:NYC-Diner-Bacon-Cheeseburger.jpg|thumb|right|A bacon cheeseburger, from a New York City diner]]
Frank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in [[Hamburg, New York]].&lt;ref name=Beach /&gt; During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef.&lt;ref name=Harmon /&gt; Kunzog{{who|date=May 2015}}, who spoke to Frank Menches, says they exhausted their supply of sausage, so purchased chopped up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market not Klein's, despite Stein's having sold the market in 1874.&lt;ref name=Harmon /&gt; The story notes that the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York not Hamburg Germany.&lt;ref name=Harmon /&gt; Frank Menches's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Charles Menches". The New York Times. October 5, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fletcher Davis====
Fletcher Davis of [[Athens, Texas]] claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, in the 1880s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side.&lt;ref name="Origin2"/&gt; The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair.&lt;ref name="Origin2"/&gt; Historian Frank X. Tolbert, noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with 'Old Dave' a.k.a. Fletcher Davis.&lt;ref name=Harmon&gt;John E. Harmon [http://web.ccsu.edu/faculty/harmonj/atlas/atlasf.html "The Better Burger Battle"], in ''Atlas of Popular Culture in the Northeastern United States''.&lt;/ref&gt; A photo of "Old Dave's Hamburger Stand" from 1904 was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim.&lt;ref name=Harmon /&gt;

====Other hamburger-steak claims====
Various non-specific claims of invention relate to the term "hamburger steak" without mention of its being a sandwich. The first printed American menu which listed hamburger is said to be an 1834 menu from [[Delmonico's]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Louis E. |last1=Grivetti |first2=Jan L. |last2=Corlett |first3=Bertram M. |last3=Gordon |first4=Cassius T. |last4=Lockett |date=January–February 2004 |title=Food in American History, Part 6-Beef (Part 1): Reconstruction and Growth Into the 20th Century (1865–1910) |journal=Nutrition Today |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=18–25 |pmid=15076706 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0029-666X&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=18 |doi=10.1097/00017285-200401000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the printer of the original menu was not in business in 1834.&lt;ref name="amhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm|title=What's cooking America: History of the Hamburger|first=Matthew|last=Preusch|date=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.&lt;ref name="Origin2"/&gt;

Between 1871 and 1884, "Hamburg Beefsteak" was on the "Breakfast and Supper Menu" of the Clipper Restaurant at 311/313 Pacific Street in [[San Fernando, California]]. It cost 10 cents—the same price as mutton chops, pig's feet in batter, and stewed veal. It was not, however, on the dinner menu. Only "Pig's Head," "Calf Tongue," and "Stewed Kidneys" were listed.&lt;ref&gt;Roger M. Grace (January 15, 2004). [http://www.metnews.com/articles/2004/reminiscing011504.htm Old Menus Tell the History of Hamburgers in L.A.] metnews.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Another claim ties the hamburger to Summit County, New York or Ohio. Summit County, Ohio exists, but Summit County, New York does not.&lt;ref name=Harmon /&gt;

* 1921: [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Due to widely anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during [[World War I]], an alternative name for hamburgers was [[Salisbury steak]]. Following the war, hamburgers became unpopular until the White Castle restaurant chain marketed and sold large numbers of small 2.5-inch square hamburgers, known as ''sliders''{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. They started to punch five holes in each patty, which help them cook evenly and eliminate the need to flip the burger. In 1995 White Castle began selling frozen hamburgers in convenience stores and vending machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/white-castle-system-inc | title=Hoover's Company Profiles: White Castle System, Inc.|publisher=[[Answers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1923: [[Kewpee|Kewpee Hamburgers]], or Kewpee Hotels, [[Flint, Michigan]]. Kewpee was the second hamburger chain and peaked at 400 locations before World War II. Many of these were licensed but not strictly franchised. Many closed during WWII. Between 1955 and 1967, another wave closed or caused changes of name. In 1967 the Kewpee licensor moved the company to a franchise system. Currently only five locations exist.

* 1936: [[Big Boy Restaurants|Big Boy]]. In 1937, Bob Wian created the double deck hamburger at his hamburger stand in Glendale California. Big Boy would become the name of the hamburger, the mascot and the restaurants. Big Boy expanded nationally through regional franchising and subfranchising. Primarily operating as drive-in restaurants in the 1950s, interior dining gradually replaced curb service by the early 1970s. Many franchises have closed or operate independently, but at the remaining American restaurants, the Big Boy double deck hamburger remains the signature item.
* 1940: [[McDonald's]] restaurant, [[San Bernardino, California]], was opened by [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]]. Their introduction of the "[[Speedee|Speedee Service System]]" in 1948 established the principles of the modern [[fast-food restaurant]]. The McDonald brothers began franchising in 1953. In 1961, [[Ray Kroc]] (the supplier of their multi-mixer milkshake machines) purchased the company from the brothers for $2.7 million and a 1.9% royalty.

Hamburgers are usually a feature of [[fast food]] [[restaurant]]s. The hamburgers served in major fast food establishments are usually mass-produced in factories and frozen for delivery to the site.&lt;ref&gt;For references see the literature review in William O. Giles "Method for preparing hamburger patties" {{US Patent|5484625}} issued January 16, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These hamburgers are thin and of uniform thickness, differing from the traditional American hamburger prepared in homes and conventional restaurants, which is thicker and prepared by hand from [[ground beef]]. Most American hamburgers are round, but some fast-food chains, such as [[Wendy's]], sell square-cut hamburgers. Hamburgers in fast food restaurants are usually grilled on a flat-top, but some firms, such as [[Burger King]], use a gas flame grilling process. At conventional American restaurants, hamburgers may be ordered "rare", but normally are served medium-well or well-done for food safety reasons. Fast food restaurants do not usually offer this option.

The [[McDonald's]] fast-food chain sells the [[Big Mac]], one of the world's top selling hamburgers, with an estimated 550 million sold annually in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500395_162-3200598.html Big Mac Hits The Big 4-0], [[CBS News]], February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major fast-food chains, including [[Burger King]] (also known as [[Hungry Jack's]] in Australia), [[A&amp;W Restaurants|A&amp;W]], [[Culver's]], [[Whataburger]], [[Carl's Jr.]]/[[Hardee's]] chain, [[Wendy's]] (known for their square patties), [[Jack in the Box]], [[Cook Out (restaurant)|Cook Out]], [[Harvey's (restaurant chain)|Harvey's]], [[Shake Shack]], [[In-N-Out Burger]], [[Five Guys]], [[Fatburger]], Vera's, [[Burgerville]], [[Back Yard Burgers]], [[Lick's Homeburger]], [[Roy Rogers Restaurants|Roy Rogers]], [[Smashburger]], and [[Sonic Drive-In|Sonic]] also rely heavily on hamburger sales. [[Fuddruckers]] and [[Red Robin]] are hamburger chains that specialize in the mid-tier "restaurant-style" variety of hamburgers.

Some restaurants offer elaborate hamburgers using expensive cuts of meat and various cheeses, toppings, and sauces. One example is the [[Bobby's Burger Palace]] chain founded by well-known chef and [[Food Network]] star [[Bobby Flay]].

Hamburgers are often served as a fast dinner, picnic or party food and are often cooked outdoors on barbecue grills.
[[File:Rye hamburger in Jätkäsaari.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Finland]], hamburgers are sometimes served in buns made of [[rye]] instead of [[wheat]].]]

A high-quality hamburger patty is made entirely of ground (minced) beef and seasonings; these may be described as "all-beef hamburger" or "all-beef patties" to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added [[flour]], [[textured vegetable protein]], [[Pink Slime|ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings]] (which the company [[Beef Products]] Inc, calls "lean finely textured beef"),&lt;ref name="Anatomy of a Burger"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/10/04/us/20090917-meat.html |work=The New York Times |title=Anatomy of a Burger |date=October 4, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/health/04meat.html |work=The New York Times |title=The Burger That Shattered Her Life |first=Michael|last=Moss |date=October 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[advanced meat recovery]], or other [[meat extenders|fillers]]. In the 1930s ground [[liver]] was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like [[Egg (food)|eggs]] or [[breadcrumb]]s. Seasonings may include [[salt]] and [[black pepper|pepper]] and others like as [[parsley]], [[onion]]s, [[soy sauce]], [[Thousand Island dressing]], [[French onion soup|onion soup]] mix, or [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Many name brand [[seasoned salt]] products are also used.

===Safety===
Raw hamburger may contain harmful bacteria that can produce food-borne illness such as [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]], due to the occasional initial improper preparation of the meat, so caution is needed during handling and cooking. Because of the potential for food-borne illness, the [[USDA]] recommends hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of {{convert|160|F}}.&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/meat-preparation/ground-beef-and-food-safety/CT_Index |title=Ground Beef and Food Safety|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If cooked to this temperature, they are considered [[well-done]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/news/1998/colorpr.htm USDA Urges Consumers To Use Food Thermometer When Cooking Ground Beef Patties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903093259/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/news/1998/colorpr.htm |date=September 3, 2009 }}.

{{Steak}}

A '''steak burger''' is marketing term for a hamburger claimed to be of superior quality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Butters, "Trademark linguistics: Trademarks: Language that one owns", in Malcolm Coulthard, Alison Johnson, ''The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics'', p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Motz, ''Hamburger America'', 2011 {{isbn|0762440708}}, p. 17, 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Riggs, ''Encyclopedia of major marketing campaigns'', '''2''':456&lt;/ref&gt; or, in Australia, a [[sandwich]] containing a [[steak]].

Steak burgers are first mentioned in the 1920s. Like other hamburgers, they may be prepared with various accompaniments and toppings.

Use of the term "steakburger" dates to the 1920s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt; In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. "Gus" Belt, the founder of [[Steak 'n Shake]], devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a "steakburger" to customers at the company's first location in [[Normal, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="LR66"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oq80iaT38k4C&amp;pg=PA210|title=Legendary Route 66|publisher=|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of [[T-bone steak]] and [[sirloin steak]] in its preparation.&lt;ref name="LR66"/&gt; Steak burgers are a primary menu item at [[Steak 'n Shake]] restaurants,&lt;ref name="LR66"/&gt; and the company's registered [[trademark]]s included "original steakburger" and "famous for steakburgers".&lt;ref name="AFDLD"/&gt; Steak 'n Shake's "Prime Steakburgers" are now made of [[Beef carcass classification|choice grade]] brisket and chuck.&lt;ref&gt;"Prime Steakburgers", Steak 'n Shake web site [https://www.steaknshake.com/menu_specials/prime-steakburger/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beef]] is typical, although other meats such as lamb and pork may also be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZARABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6|title=Be Your Own Burger King|publisher=|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meat is ground&lt;ref name="Croft"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indystar.com/story/life/2014/10/09/make-great-steak-burger/16911277/ | title=Make your own great steak burger | work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]| date=October 9, 2014 | accessdate=9 October 2014 | author=Croft, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt; or chopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=in2jaYctmOkC&amp;pg=PA14|title=London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], burgers may be classified as two main types: fast food hamburgers and individually prepared burgers made in homes and [[restaurant]]s. The latter are often prepared with a variety of toppings, including [[lettuce]], [[tomato]], [[onion]], and often sliced [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] (or pickle relish). [[French fries]] often accompany the burger. [[Cheese]] (usually [[processed cheese|processed cheese slices]] but often [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]], [[Swiss cheese|Swiss]], [[pepper jack]], or [[blue cheese|blue]]), either melted directly on the meat patty or crumbled on top, is generally an option.

[[Condiment]]s might be added to a hamburger or may be offered separately on the side including [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[mayonnaise]], [[ketchup]], salad dressings and [[barbecue sauce]].

Other toppings can include [[bacon]], [[avocado]] or [[guacamole]], sliced sautéed [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], cheese sauce, [[chili con carne|chili]] (usually without [[bean]]s), [[fried egg]], [[scrambled egg]], [[feta cheese]], [[blue cheese]], [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]], [[pineapple]], [[jalapeño]]s and other kinds of [[chili pepper]]s, [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]], slices of [[Ham (meat)|ham]] or [[Bologna sausage|bologna]], [[pastrami]] or [[teriyaki]]-seasoned beef, [[tartar sauce]], [[french fries]], [[onion ring]]s or [[potato chip]]s.

*Standard toppings on hamburgers may depend upon location, particularly at restaurants that are not national or regional franchises.
*Restaurants may offer hamburgers with multiple meat patties.  The most common variants are double and triple hamburgers, but California-based burger chain [[In-N-Out]] once sold a sandwich with one hundred patties, called a "100x100." &lt;ref name="100x100"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Does A 100x100 In-N-Out Cheeseburger Cost?|url=http://robertkaplinsky.com/work/in-n-out-100-x-100/|website=Robert Kaplinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pastrami burgers may be served in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John T. Edge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/dining/29united.html |title=Pastrami Meets the Patty in Utah |work=The New York Times |date=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[patty melt]] consists of a patty, [[Sautéing|sautéed]] onions and cheese between two slices of [[rye bread]]. The sandwich is then buttered and fried.
* A [[slider (sandwich)|slider]] is a very small square hamburger patty sprinkled with diced onions and served on an equally small bun. According to the earliest citations, the name originated aboard U.S. Navy ships, due to the manner in which greasy burgers slid across the galley grill as the ship pitched and rolled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/slider_or_slyder_mini_hamburger/ Slider or Slyder (mini-hamburger)]. ''[[Barry Popik]]'', February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Plocek (February 21, 2008). [http://blogs.houstonpress.com/eating/2008/02/sliders_rollers_and_monkey_dic.php Sliders, Rollers and Monkey Dicks]. ''Houston Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions claim the term "slider" originated from the hamburgers served by flight line galleys at military airfields, which were so greasy they slid right through you; or because their small size allows them to "slide" right down your throat in one or two bites.
* In [[Alberta]], Canada a "kubie burger" is a hamburger made with a pressed Ukrainian sausage ([[kubasa]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Canadian Oxford Dictionary has headwords for the Canadianisms "[[kubasa]]", "kubie" (as a [[hot dog]]), and "kubie burger", the latter two being specific to [[Alberta]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Minnesota]], a "[[Jucy Lucy|Juicy Lucy]]" (also spelled "Jucy Lucy"), is a hamburger having cheese inside the meat patty rather than on top. A piece of cheese is surrounded by raw meat and cooked until it melts, resulting in a molten core of cheese within the patty. This scalding hot cheese tends to gush out at the first bite, so servers frequently instruct customers to let the sandwich cool for a few minutes before consumption.
* A [[low carb]] burger is a hamburger served without a bun and replaced with large slices of lettuce with mayonnaise or mustard being the sauces primarily used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlsjr.com/menu/charbroiled-burgers/the-low-carb-six-dollar-burger/ The Low Carb Six Dollar Burger | Carl's Jr. Menu].

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]], burgers (called ''hamburguesas'') are served with [[ham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Schwartz |title=Uncovering Mexico: Best of times, worst of times: Celebrating the 100th |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/mexico/entries/2007/08/27/im_sure_youve_all_been_1.html |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |newspaper=[[Statesman.com]] |date=August 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102102321/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/mexico/entries/2007/08/27/im_sure_youve_all_been_1.html |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and slices of [[American cheese]] fried on top of the meat patty. The toppings include [[avocado]], jalapeño slices, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato. The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. In certain parts are served with bacon, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of pineapple is also a usual option, and the variation is known as a "Hawaiian hamburger".

Some restaurants' burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others also replace the ground patty with sirloin, [[Al pastor]] meat, [[barbacoa]] or a fried chicken breast. Many burger chains from the United States can be found all over Mexico, including Carl's Jr., Sonic, as well as global chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
Hamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to those in the US, and the [[High Street]] is dominated by the same big two chains as in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;— McDonald's and Burger King. The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK. In Ireland the food outlet [[Supermacs]] is widespread throughout the country serving burgers as part of its menu. In Ireland, [[Abrakebabra]] (started out selling kebabs) and [[Eddie Rocket's]] are also major chains.

An original and indigenous rival to the big two U.S. giants was the quintessentially British fast-food chain [[Wimpy (brand)|Wimpy]], originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon's Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style [[french fries|chips]], accompanied by [[cutlery]] and delivered to the customer's table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |title=Wimpy History |work=wimpy.uk.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122138/http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, [[Grand Metropolitan]]. A [[management buyout]] in 1990 split the brands again and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centres whilst new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations.

Hamburgers are also available from mobile [[kiosk]]s, commonly known as “burger vans", particularly at outdoor events such as [[football (soccer)|football]] matches. Burgers from this type of outlet are usually served without any form of salad&amp;nbsp;— only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard or brown sauce.

Chip shops, particularly in the West Midlands and North-East of England, Scotland and Ireland, serve battered hamburgers called batter burgers. This is where the burger patty, by itself, is deep-fat-fried in batter and is usually served with chips.

Hamburgers and [[veggie burger]]s served with chips and salad, are standard [[pub grub]] menu items. Many pubs specialize in "gourmet" burgers. These are usually high quality minced steak patties, topped with items such as blue cheese, brie, avocado et cetera. Some British [[pub]]s serve burger patties made from more exotic meats including [[venison]] burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), [[bison]] burgers, [[ostrich]] burgers and in some Australian themed pubs even [[kangaroo]] burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served in a similar way to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce and plum sauce.

In the early 21st century "premium" hamburger chain and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often [[Organic food|organic]], usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Guardian (UK news)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,,1676523,00.html|title=Camembert with that, sir? | location=London | first=Josh| last=Lacey | date=January 2, 2006 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chains include [[Gourmet Burger Kitchen]], Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union and Byron Hamburgers in London. Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty Burger developed a style of rich, juicy burger in 2012 which is known as a ''dirty burger'' or ''third-wave burger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://lostincatering.com/lostincatering/london_dining_trends.html |chapter=Third Wave Burgers |title=London Menu Trends 2012 |publisher=LostinCatering |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In recent years [[Rustlers]] has sold pre-cooked hamburgers reheatable in a [[microwave oven]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rustler's Microwave Quarterpounder 190g | url=http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/groceries/index.jsp?bmUID=1272223297835|work=sainsburys.co.uk | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, as in North America and Japan, the term "burger" can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Hamburger in New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|This hamburger in a fast food restaurant in [[Auckland]], New Zealand contains [[beetroot]] for flavor.]]
Fast food franchises sell American style fast food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand. The traditional [[Australasia]]n hamburgers are usually bought from [[fish and chip shop]]s or milk bars. The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef, or "mince" as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand. They commonly include tomato, lettuce, grilled onion and meat as minimum, and can optionally include cheese, [[beetroot]], pineapple, a fried egg and bacon. If all these optional ingredients are included it is known in Australia as "burger with the lot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The term 'burger' is also applied to any hot sandwich using a bun for the bread, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger (generally with chicken breast rather than chicken mince), salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc. The term 'sandwich' is usually only applied when the bread used is sliced bread.

The only variance between the two countries' hamburgers is that New Zealand's equivalent to "The Lot" often contains a steak (beef) as well. The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and tomato sauce. The [[McDonald's]] "McOz" Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers, having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger; however, it is no longer a part of the menu. Likewise, McDonald's in New Zealand created a [[Kiwiburger]], similar to a Quarter Pounder, but features salad, beetroot and a fried egg. The [[Hungry Jack's]] ([[Burger King]]) "Aussie Burger" has tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, beetroot, egg, ketchup and a meat patty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hungryjacks.com.au/menu |title=Hungry Jack's menu |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In China, restaurants such as [[McDonald's]] and [[KFC]] exist, which sell hamburgers.

===Japan===
[[File:MOS Kaisen01.JPG|thumb|right|[[MOS Burger]] [[rice burger]]]]
In [[Japan]], hamburgers can be served in a bun, called ''hanbāgā'' (ハンバーガー), or just the patties served without a bun, known as ''hanbāgu'' (ハンバーグ) or "hamburg", short for "hamburg steak".

''[[Salisbury steak|Hamburg steaks]]'' (served without buns) are similar to what are known as [[Salisbury steak]]s in the U.S. They are made from minced beef, pork or a blend of the two mixed with minced onions, egg, breadcrumbs and spices. They are served with [[brown sauce]] (or [[demi-glace]] in restaurants) with vegetable or salad sides, or occasionally in [[Japanese curry|Japanese curries]]. Hamburgers may be served in casual, western style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as "[[casual dining|family restaurants]]".

Hamburgers in buns, on the other hand, are predominantly the domain of fast food chains such as American chains known as McDonald's and [[Wendy's]]. Japan has home grown hamburger chain restaurants such as [[MOS Burger]], [[First Kitchen]] and [[Freshness Burger]]. Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include [[teriyaki]] burgers, ''katsu'' burgers (containing [[tonkatsu]]) and burgers containing shrimp [[korokke]]. Some of the more unusual examples include the [[rice burger]], where the bun is made of rice, and the luxury 1000-yen (US$10) "Takumi Burger" (meaning "artisan taste"), featuring [[avocado]]s, freshly grated [[wasabi]], and other rare seasonal ingredients. In terms of the actual patty, there are burgers made with [[Kobe beef]], butchered from cows that are fed with beer and massaged daily. McDonald's Japan also recently launched a McPork burger, made with U.S. [[pork]]. McDonald's has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains, due in part to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined, "upscale" hamburger offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ideaforesight: Upscale, modern fast food | url=http://ideaforesight.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/upscale-modern-fast-food/|work=ideaforesight's blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burger King]] once retreated from Japan, but re-entered the market in Summer 2007 in cooperation with the Korean owned Japanese fast-food chain Lotteria.

According to the Guinness World Records, a Japanese man, [[Takeru Kobayashi]] ate the most amount of hamburgers in three minutes on July 11, 2014.[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-hamburgers-eaten-in-three-minutes]

===Other countries===
[[File:Taiwan McDonald's chicken rice burger 20050218.jpg|thumb|Chicken burger with rice bun (sold in Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macao, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore). Note that the "bun" is composed of cooked rice]]
Rice burgers, mentioned above, are also available in several East Asian countries such as [[Taiwan]] and [[South Korea]]. [[Lotteria]] is a big hamburger franchise in Japan owned by the South Korean [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] group, with outlets also in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition to selling beef hamburgers, they also have hamburgers made from squid, pork, tofu, and shrimp. Variations available in South Korea include [[Bulgogi]] burgers and [[Kimchi]] burgers.

In the [[Philippines]], a wide range of major U.S. fast-food franchises are well represented, together with local imitators, often amended to the local palate. The chain [[McDonald's]] (locally nicknamed "McDo") have a range of burger and chicken dishes often accompanied by plain [[steamed rice]] or French fries. The Philippines boasts its own burger-chain called [[Jollibee]], which offers burger meals and chicken, including a signature burger called "Champ". Jollibee now has a number of outlets in the United States, the Middle East and East Asia.
[[File:Jumbo Vada Pav (dodged).jpg|thumb|left|[[Vada pav]] or "Indian Burger" is made of potatoes and spices.]]
In [[India]], burgers are usually made from chicken or vegetable patties due to cultural beliefs against eating beef (which stem from [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious practice) and pork (which stems from [[Islamic]] religious practice). Because of this, the majority of fast food chains and restaurants in India do not serve beef. McDonald's in India, for instance, does not serve beef, offering the "Maharaja Mac" instead of the Big Mac, substituting the beef patties with chicken. Another version of the Indian vegetarian burger is the [[Wada Pav]] consisting deep-fried potato patty dipped in gramflour batter. It is usually served with mint chutney and fried green chili.

In [[Pakistan]], apart from American fast food chains, burgers can be found in stalls near shopping areas, the best known being the "shami burger". This is made from "shami kebab", made by mixing lentil and minced lamb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.recidemia.com/wiki/Arouk Fried lamb burger recipe on Recidemia]. En.recidemia.com (July 15, 2012). Retrieved on April 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Onions, scrambled egg and ketchup are the most may be toppings.

In [[Malaysia]] there are 300 McDonald's restaurants. The menu in Malaysia also includes eggs and fried chicken on top of the regular burgers. Burgers are also easily found at nearby mobile kiosks, especially [[Ramly Burger]].

In [[Mongolia]], a recent fast food craze due to the sudden influx of foreign influence has led to the prominence of the hamburger. Specialized fast food restaurants serving to Mongolian tastes have sprung up and seen great success.
[[File:Beef Burger In Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beef|Beef burger]] with [[fried egg]], [[cabbage]] and some [[french fries]] in [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Malaysia]].]]

In [[Turkey]], in addition to the internationally familiar offerings, numerous localized variants of the hamburger may be found, such as the Islak Burger (lit. "Wet-Burger"), which a beef slider doused in seasoned tomato sauce and steamed inside a special glass chamber, and has its origins in the Turkish fast food retailer Kizilkayalar. Other variations include lamb-burgers and [[offal]]-burgers, which are offered by local fast food businesses and global chains alike, such as McDonald's and [[Burger King]]. Most burger shops have also adopted a pizzeria-like approach when it comes to home delivery, and almost all major fast food chains deliver.

In the [[former Yugoslavia]], and originally in [[Serbia]], there is a local version of the hamburger known as the ''[[pljeskavica]]''. It is often served as a patty, but may have a bun as well.

Throughout [[Belgium]] and in some eateries in the [[Netherlands]], a Bicky Burger is sold that combines pork, chicken, and horse meat.&lt;ref name=Steves2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steves|first1=Rick|title=Rick Steves Belgium: Bruges, Brussels, Antwerp &amp; Ghent|date=2015|publisher=Avalon Travel|isbn=1631210653}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew F.|title=Hamburger a global history|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=186189631X|chapter=The Global Burger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hamburger, usually fried, is served between a bun, sprinkled with sesame seeds. It often comes with a specific ''Bickysaus'' (Bicky dressing) made with mayonnaise, mustard, cabbage, and onion.&lt;ref name=Steves2015 /&gt;

The '''Hunzibs''' are an indigenous people of [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]] living in three villages in the [[Tsuntinsky District]] in the upper regions of the [[Avar-Koisu river]] area. They have their own language, [[Hunzib language|Hunzib]], and primarily follow [[Sunni Islam]], which reached the Hunzib people around the 8th or 9th century. The only time that the Hunzibs were counted as a distinct ethnic group in the Russian Census was in 1926, when 105 people reported to be ethnic Hunzibs. Subsequently, they were listed as [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]] in the Russian Censuses. In 1967, it was estimated that there were about 600 ethnic Hunzibs (E. Bokarev).

'''Intelsat 802''' was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1997 it was operated in [[geostationary orbit]] at a longitude of 174 degrees west for around fourteen years.

==Satellite==
The second of six [[Intelsat VIII]] satellites to be launched, Intelsat 802 was built by [[Lockheed Martin]]. It was a {{convert|3447|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft. The satellite carried a 2x[[LEROS-1B]] [[apogee motor]] for propulsion and was equipped with 38 [[C band (IEEE)|C Band]] [[transponder]]s and 6 [[Ku band]] [[transponder]]s, powered by 2 solar cells more batteries.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/intlsat.htm|title=Intelsat|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed for a fourteen-year service life.&lt;ref name="gsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-8.htm|title=Intelsat-8 (801, 802, 803, 804) / NSS 803 → NSS 5|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
The launch of Intelsat 802 made use of a [[Ariane 4]] rocket flying from [[Guiana Space Centre]], [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]]. The launch took place at 01:07 UTC on June 25, 1997, with the spacecraft entering a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]].&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt; Intelsat 802 subsequently fired its apogee motor to achieve [[geostationary orbit]].

The '''International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations''' (IFALPA) is a worldwide association of national pilots' associations. IFALPA was founded in 1948 and is based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.

== History ==
After the end of the [[Second World War]] as international [[civil aviation]] began to re-establish itself, pilots around the world realized that their associations could not protect them across national boundaries.){{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Furthermore, they did not have a voice at the newly formed [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} At a meeting in London in April 1948 a conference of pilot associations was held that formed the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} IFALPA was located in the UK from 1948 to 2012. In 2012 the Federation established its headquarters in Montreal, Canada, the global Civil Aviation Decision Making Hub, and is located near ICAO.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Membership ==
In 1976 the IFALPA represented 54,000 pilots in their Member Associations in 60 countries. By 2015, that number had grown to over 100,000 pilots in over 100 countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Connections with ICAO ==
IFALPA has a number of standing committees in regulatory, industrial and safety/technical areas. It also has permanent membership on a number of ICAO Panels and Task Forces to provide pilot input into regulations, design criteria, [[Air traffic management|Air Traffic Management]] and Airport requirements just to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifalpa.org/about-us/our-history.html Our History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

'''"Let Me Cry"''' was [[Bulgaria]]’s entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]], performed in English by [[Mariana Popova]].

The song was performed second in the semi-final (following [[Armenia]]’s [[André (singer)|André]] performing "[[Without Your Love (André song)|Without Your Love]]" and preceding [[Slovenia]]’s [[Anžej Dežan]] performing "[[Mr Nobody (Anžej Dežan song)|Mr. Nobody]]") and received 36 points, ending the night in 17th place—thus ensuring that Bulgaria would again start in the semi-final in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007 edition of the Contest]].

The song is a power ballad sung from the perspective of a woman who has found out that her lover is unfaithful. She tells him that she wants him to "let me cry" rather than be comforted.

It was covered by Israeli [[countertenor]] [[David D'Or]] on his album entitled ''David D’Or &amp; the Philharmonic; Live Concert''.&lt;ref name=discography:&gt;{{cite web|title=David D'Or &amp; The Philharmonic |publisher=daviddor.com |date=February 2009 |url=http://daviddor.com/e_disc_6.htm |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101044517/http://daviddor.com/e_disc_6.htm |archivedate=January 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Philharmonic2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjfw.ca/music/albums/700265/overview|title=David D'Or – David D'Or and the Philharmonic|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-05-05}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was succeeded as [[Bulgaria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bulgarian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] by [[Elitsa Todorova]] and [[Stoyan Yankoulov]] with "[[Water (Eurovision song)|Water]]".

'''Life360''' is a family networking [[Application software|app]] released in 2008. It is a [[location-based service]] designed to allow friends or family members to share their location with each other and communicate with each other.

==History==

Life360 was founded by [[Chris Hulls]] and Alex Haro and has received a total of $90 million in funding since its launch, including funding from both [[Facebook]] and [[Google]].&lt;ref name="20MillionLife360"&gt;{{cite news | last =Perez | first =Sarah | coauthors = | title =Life360, The Family Locator With More Users Than Foursquare, Raises A $10 Million Series B | newspaper =Tech Crunch| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =10 July 2013| url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/10/life360-the-family-locator-with-more-users-than-foursquare-raises-10-million-series-b/ | accessdate =22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was initially released in 2008 in the Android marketplace.&lt;ref name="TechCrunchSurpassFS"&gt;{{cite news | last =Perez | first =Sarah | coauthors = | title =Life360, A Family Networking App With more Users Than Foursquare, Is Now Headed For Cars, Smart Home Systems | newspaper =Tech Crunch | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =26 April 2013 | url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/26/life360-a-family-networking-app-with-more-users-than-foursquare-is-now-headed-for-cars-smart-home-systems/ | accessdate =22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first funding for Life360 came in the form of a $275,000 grant as a winner of Google's 2008 [[Android Developer Challenge]].&lt;ref name="AndroidDeveloperChall"&gt;{{cite news | last =Siegler | first =MG | coauthors = | title =Android Developer Challenge I winners – nary a big name in sight | newspaper =Venture Beat | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =28 August 2008 | url = https://venturebeat.com/2008/08/28/android-developer-challenge-i-winners-nary-a-big-name-in-sight/ | accessdate =22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding included $5.5 million in a Series A round, $17 million in a Series B round, and $50 million in a Series C round.&lt;ref name="20MillionLife360"/&gt;

Life360 entered into an agreement with [[BMW]] in 2013 to integrate the location services of Life360 with the navigation in BMW automobiles.&lt;ref name="TechCrunchSurpassFS"/&gt; The same year, Life360 surpassed [[Foursquare]] in the number of registered users with 34 million&lt;ref name="TechCrunchSurpassFS"/&gt; and reached more than 40 million registered users the same year.&lt;ref name="20MillionLife360"/&gt; Life360 also saw an increase in user registration following the announcement from Google that they would be shutting down their [[Google Latitude]] platform in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Riddell | first =Lindsay | coauthors = | title =Life360 goes after Google Latitude’s evicted users | newspaper =San Francisco Business Times | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =24 July 2013 | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2013/07/life360-goes-after-google-latitudes.html | accessdate =22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in 2013 that Life360 would be adding global support for its app which would include support in languages other than English and international SMS.&lt;ref name="BloombergKnowYourChildren"&gt;{{cite news | last =Fitchard | first =Kevin | coauthors = | title =Life360’s App Knows Where Your Children Are | newspaper =Bloomberg Businessweek| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =3 July 2013| url = http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-03/life360-s-app-knows-where-your-children-are | accessdate =22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement came after downloads of the Life360 app increased internationally, even though the app was only available in English.&lt;ref name="BloombergKnowYourChildren"/&gt;

In 2016, Life360 added a feature that enables smartphones to detect when people are in a car crash and automatically contacts emergency response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/Life360-Adds-Car-Crash-Detection-and-Automatic-Emergency-Call-to-App_a5929.html|title=Life360 Adds Car Crash Detection and Automatic Emergency Call to App|last=Privat|first=Ludovic|website=GPS BUSINESS NEWS|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, Life360 acquired the private messaging application and Y Combinator grad Couple based in Mountain View.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/12/family-app-life360-acquires-couple-a-private-messaging-app-for-two/|title=Family App Life360 Acquires Couple, A Private Messaging App For Two – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] in January 2018, [[The ADT Corporation|ADT]] announced ADT Go in partnership with Life360. ADT Go connects and protects families outside the home, utilizing ADT's expansive security infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/adt-unveils-apps-doorbells-and-more-at-ces-2018/|title=ADT unveils apps, doorbells and more at CES 2018|date=2018-01-08|work=CNET|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pando.com/2014/05/14/life360-continues-to-prioritize-utility-in-its-family-social-network-raises-50m-from-adt-to-tackle-the-connected-home/|title=Prioritizing utility in its family social network, Life360 raises $50M from ADT to tackle the connected home|date=2014-05-14|work=Pando|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Life360 is both a web and [[mobile app]]lication and was referred to as a "family-oriented private social network" by [[Bloomberg Businessweek]].&lt;ref name="BloombergKnowYourChildren"/&gt; The app is a social network for families and differentiates itself in this way as it is not based around peer groups or professional networks such as [[Find My Friends]] and [[LinkedIn]]. It allows users to share locations, group message, and call for roadside assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theappzine.com/reviews/life360-app-stay-connected-family-and-friends|title=Life360 app stay connected with family and friends|publisher=theappzine.com, Retrieved 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has four main features which include location sharing, circles, places, and premium.

===Locations sharing===

The main feature of the app is location sharing. Users can open the app and see where other members are instantly. Users can choose to share or not to share their location with any particular circle at any particular time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Dickinson | first =Boonsri | coauthors = | title =Life360 turns your smartphone into a lifeline | newspaper =CNet | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =20 June 2011 | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20071791-1/life360-turns-your-smartphone-into-a-lifeline/| accessdate =22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circles===

Circles is the app’s newest feature, released on September 3, 2013. Circles allows users to create separate groups within the app, e.g. “caregivers,” “extended family,” and “John’s baseball team.” Users’ location is only visible to those who are also in the circle, and members in “caregivers” cannot see the location of users in “extended family,” unless they are also in that circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Fitchard | first =Kevin | coauthors = | title =Life360 moves beyond the nuclear family, adding social features to its tracking app | newspaper =Gigaom | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =4 September 2013 | url = http://gigaom.com/2013/09/04/life360-moves-beyond-the-nuclear-family-adding-social-features-to-its-tracking-app/| accessdate =22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4292">[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|The Maravi Kingdom at its greatest extent in the 17th century.]]
'''Maravi''' was a kingdom which straddled the current borders of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, in the 16th century. The present-day name "[[Malawi|Maláŵi]]" is said to derive from the [[Chewa language|Chichewa]] word "malaŵí", which means "flames".

At its greatest extent, the state included territory from the Tonga and [[Tumbuka people]]'s areas in the north to the [[Shire River|Lower Shire]] in the south, and as far west as the [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]] and [[Zambezi]] river valleys. Maravi's rulers belonged to the Mwale [[Serer maternal clans|matriclan]] and held the title [[Kalonga]]. They ruled from [[Manthimba]], the secular/administrative capital, and were the driving force behind the state's establishment. Meanwhile, the patrilineal Banda clan, which traditionally provided healers, sages and metallurgists, took care of religious affairs from their capital [[Mankhamba]] near [[Nthakataka]]. 

After contact with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], trade intensified. It included such items as beads of the [[Khami]] type and [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]] imported via Portuguese intermediaries. In the 19th century, the state declined and the Maravi were frequently raided by their neighbours the [[WaYao|Yao]] and captured for sale as [[slavery|slaves]].  [[David Livingstone]] visited Lake Nyasa in 1859, and other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries soon followed.

The Maravi Confederacy was founded by the Bantu people immigrating into the valley of the Shire River (flowing out of Lake Nyassa) around 1480 AD. It prospered into the late 18th century, extending to reach what is now belonging to Zambia and Mozambique. In the 19th century the neighboring Yao raided on them, selling captive Maravi on the slave markets of Kilwa and Zanzibar. In the 1860s, Islam was introduced into the region through contact with Swahili slave traders. The region was visited by David Livingstone and stations were set up by Protestant missionaries in 1873. A British consul was also sent there in 1883. 

Beginning as early as the thirteenth century, the first signs of a large-scale migration of related clans entered the region of Lake Malawi. Traditional accounts indicate that these people originated in the [[Congo Basin]] to the west of [[Lake Mweru]], in an area that subsequently formed part of the Luba Kingdom. The movement continued during the succeeding two or three centuries, but it appears certain that by the sixteenth century the main body of these people, known collectively as the Maravi, were settled in the Shire River valley and over a wide area lying generally west and southwest of Lake Malawi, including parts of present-day Zambia and Mozambique. The first (colonial) historical account of the Maravi was by Gaspar Boccaro, a Portuguese man who traveled through their territory in 1616. The picture presented in the 1660s by Father Manuel Barretto, a Jesuit priest, was of a strong, economically active confederation that swept an area from the coast of Mozambique between the Zambezi River and the bay of Quelimane for several hundred miles into the mainland. An account from the following century implied that the western limits of the confederation were near the Luangwa River and that it extended on the north to the Dwangwa River. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maravi-Confederacy&lt;/ref&gt;

"Maravi" is therefore a general name of the peoples of Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique and the eastern part of Zimbabwe. The [[Chewa language]], which is also referred to as Nyanja, Chinyanja or Chichewa, and is spoken in southern and central Malawi, in Zambia and to some extent in Mozambique, is the main language that emerged from this empire.

==Construction and design==
The square- or diamond-shaped [[resonator]] is made of four small wooden boards glued together, then covered with a stretched [[parchment]] or [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]]. The single string is typically made of horse hair, and passes over a bridge.  The instrument is tuned by means of a large [[tuning peg]] to fit the range of the singer's voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The use of electronic [[surveillance]] by the United Kingdom grew from the development of [[signal intelligence]] and pioneering [[code breaking]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the British and Americans started listening in|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35491822|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=BBC|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war period, the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) was formed and participated in programmes such as the [[Five Eyes]] collaboration of English-speaking nations. This focused on intercepting electronic communications, with substantial increases in surveillance capabilities over time. A series of [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|media reports in 2013]] revealed bulk collection and surveillance capabilities, including collection and sharing collaborations between GCHQ and the United States' [[National Security Agency]]. These were commonly described as [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA leaks: US and Britain team up on mass surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/nsa-leaks-britain-us-surveillance|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=The Guardian|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar capabilities exist in other western European countries, such as France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France and the UK are on the edge of Kafkaesque surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/28/surveillance-law-france-uk-kafka|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ and European spy agencies worked together on mass surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/01/gchq-europe-spy-agencies-mass-surveillance-snowden|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveillance of [[telecommunication|electronic communications]] in the United Kingdom is controlled by laws made in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. In particular, access to the content of private messages (that is, interception of a communication such as an email or telephone call) must be authorised by a warrant signed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=GCHQlaw&gt;{{cite web|title=The Law|url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/how_we_work/running_the_business/oversight/Pages/The-law.aspx|publisher=GCHQ|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refISC20130717&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on GCHQ's Alleged Interception of Communications under the US PRISM Programme|url=https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/20130717_ISC_statement_GCHQ.pdf|publisher=Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Security Inquiry – Call for Evidence|url=https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/20131211_ISC_Call_for_papers-Privacy.pdf|publisher=Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition European Union [[Data Protection Directive|data privacy]] law applies in UK law.

Various government bodies maintain databases about citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. These include "bulk data sets" such as [[medical records]]. In January 2016 the [[Home Secretary]] stated she would neither restrict the data sets that might be accessed for such purposes, nor state whether or not communications protected from law enforcement access such as [[Source (journalism)|journalist's sources]] and [[Legal professional privilege in England and Wales|legal privilege]] had been accessed covertly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500270802/UK-is-not-involved-in-mass-surveillance-says-Home-Secretary|title=UK not involved in mass surveillance, says Theresa May|author=Julia Gregory|date=13 Jan 2016|work=ComputerWeekly|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of video surveillance cameras in the United Kingdom is common, as it is in many countries, its prevalence may historically have been overstated .&lt;ref name=C42008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian2011/&gt; Legal provisions exist that control and restrict the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases, and require local governments or police forces operating video surveillance cameras to comply with a code of conduct: the [[Surveillance Camera Code of Practice]].

== Legal framework for lawful interception ==
{{further information|History of mass surveillance in the United Kingdom}}
The legal framework in the United Kingdom for [[lawful interception]] and storage of [[communications data]] and, when a warrant exists, the content of electronic communications is based on the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and several other pieces of legislation. The [[Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act]] (DRIPA) 2014 deals with the [[telecommunications data retention|retention]] of certain types of communications data (not the content of messages). It was brought into effect after the European Union's Data Retention Directive was declared invalid. The Telecommunications Act 1984 has also been used by the government to facilitate bulk communications data collection. The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 includes several provisions related to controlling or restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases. The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] requires the intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, to respect citizens' rights as enumerated in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

=== Compatibility with human rights law ===
The [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]] ruled in December 2014 that the legal frameworks in the United Kingdom governing the bulk interception of data and intelligence sharing with agencies in other countries do not breach the European Convention on Human Rights, and are compliant with Articles 8 (right to privacy) and 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=refBBC141206 /&gt;&lt;ref name=refGCHQ20141205 /&gt;&lt;ref name=refIPTList /&gt; However, the Tribunal stated that one particular aspect of intelligence sharing, the data-sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance programmes [[PRISM (surveillance program)|Prism]] and [[Upstream collection|Upstream]], had been in contravention of human rights law until two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed to the public in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPT Ruling on Interception |url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-Ruling-on-Interception-Feb-2014.aspx |publisher=GCHQ |accessdate=6 February 2015 |date=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206205536/http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-Ruling-on-Interception-Feb-2014.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20150206&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ censured over sharing of internet surveillance data with US|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31164451|accessdate=6 February 2015|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refGuardian20150206&gt;{{cite news|title=UK-US surveillance regime was unlawful 'for seven years'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/06/gchq-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful-court-nsa|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=The Guardian|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Privacy]] and [[Civil liberties in the United Kingdom|civil liberties]] advocates such as [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] and [[Privacy International]], who brought a legal case against the government to force the judgement, continue to oppose to the temporary bulk collection of data, powers to access this and retain selected data, as well as intelligence sharing relationships; they intend to appeal the judgement to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=BBC20150206 /&gt;&lt;ref name=refGuardian20150206 /&gt; Intelligence agencies and MPs have criticised the viewpoint of privacy campaigners on this issue.&lt;ref name=BBC20151019 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Times20151030 /&gt;&lt;ref name=refTimes20150313 /&gt;

Following the publication of a [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament#Report on Privacy and Security, March 2015|special report]] by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in March 2015,&lt;ref name=BBC20150314 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISC2015March /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian20150314 /&gt; which identified shortcomings in past oversight and potential improvements to the legislative framework, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] initiated an inquiry into the legalisation governing the interception powers of the intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cameron orders inquiry into spy agencies' use of snooping laws|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/defence/article4380540.ece|accessdate=14 March 2015|work=The Times|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third independent report into surveillance in the UK published in July 2015 found the intelligence agencies are not knowingly carrying out illegal mass surveillance of British citizens. However, it did say the laws governing the agencies' powers to intercept private communications need a significant overhaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review clears UK spies of illegal surveillance, says laws need overhaul|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/14/uk-britain-security-surveillance-idUKKCN0PN2MI20150714|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=Reuters|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Panel of the Independent Surveillance Review|title=A Democratic Licence to Operate: Report of the Independent Surveillance Review|url=https://www.rusi.org/publication/whitehall-reports/democratic-licence-operate-report-independent-surveillance-review|publisher=Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Heather Brooke|title=Mass surveillance: my part in the reform of GCHQ and UK intelligence gathering|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/14/mass-suveillance-reform-gchq-uk-intelligence-gathering-rusi-report|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is consistent with separate reports by the [[Interception of Communications Commissioner]].&lt;ref name=ICC20150312&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by the Interception of Communications Commissioner's Office (IOCCO) on the publication of the Interception of Communications Commissioner's Report 2014|url=http://www.iocco-uk.info/docs/2015%20Press%20Release%20Final.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=12 March 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Report of the Interception of Communications Commissioner|url=http://www.iocco-uk.info/docs/IOCCO%20Report%20March%202015%20(Web).pdf|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled British security services had, in secret, unlawfully collected citizens' information, including financial information, individual phone and web use, and other confidential personal data, without adequate safeguards or supervision for 17 years.&lt;ref name="2016-10-guardian"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20161018003035/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/uk-security-agencies-unlawfully-collected-data-for-decade&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal found that from its inception in 1998 until its public acknowledgement in 4 November 2015, this bulk collection was in breach of article 8 of the [[European convention on human rights]].&lt;ref name="2016-10-guardian"/&gt;

After a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] victory by two MPs challenging the legality of DRIPA, the UK government appealed to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ), but in December 2016 the verdict of the national court was upheld.  The ECJ ruled that general and indiscriminate retention of emails and electronic communications by governments was illegal, opening the way to challenges against the UK’s new Investigatory Powers Act (2016), which replaced DRIPA.&lt;ref name="2016-12-guardian"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Owen Bowcott|title=EU's highest court delivers blow to UK snooper's charter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter|accessdate=30 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigatory Powers Act 2016 ==
{{Main article|Investigatory Powers Act 2016}}
{{As of|2015|11|4}} the Investigatory Powers Bill was published for scrutiny. The bill would introduce new powers, as well as restate existing ones, for [[targeted surveillance|targeted interception]] of communications, bulk collection of communications data, and bulk interception of communications. New oversight procedures would be introduced, including a requirement for a judge to review a warrant signed by a Minister for interception of communications, that is reading the content of messages. The bill would require Internet connection records – which websites were visited but not the particular pages and not the full browsing history – to be kept by [[internet service provider]]s for one year.

The [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]] is a comprehensive statute which makes provision for both targeted and bulk retention of content and metadata.  It consolidates much of the previous legislation and makes public a number of previously secret powers (equipment interference, bulk retention of metadata, intelligence agency use of bulk personal datasets).

Controversially, it enables the Government to require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of (but not the content of) customers' Internet connections for up to 12 months.  Police and intelligence officers may seek approval for access to these records without a warrant, as part of a targeted investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/theresa-may-surveillance-measures-edward-snowden|title=Theresa May unveils surveillance measures in wake of Snowden claims|date=4 November 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, the Act creates new safeguards, including a requirement for judges to approve the warrants authorised by a Secretary of State before they come into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34715872|title=Details of UK website visits 'to be stored for year'|date=4 November 2015|work=BBC|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/investigatory-powers-bill-the-key-points|title=Investigatory powers bill: the key points|date=4 November 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 ==
{{main article|Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014}}

In April 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that the European Union's [[Data Retention Directive]] was invalid. Since October 2007, [[telecommunication companies]] had been required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for a minimum of 6 months and at most 24 months under this directive. The European Court of Justice found it violates two basic rights, respect for private life and protection of personal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top EU court rejects EU-wide data retention law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26935096|accessdate=7 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by all three major political parties in the UK, Parliament passed the [[Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014|Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act]] in July 2014 to ensure the police and security services retained their existing powers to access telephone and internet records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commons passes emergency data laws despite criticism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28305309|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliament passes emergency Data Retention Bill|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28352673|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No additional powers were granted by the legislation, but it did make clear that the requirements also apply to foreign companies, based abroad, whose telephone and internet services are used in the UK.&lt;ref name=bbc-20140710&gt;{{cite news|title=Emergency phone and internet data laws to be passed|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237111|accessdate=7 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New data bill contains 'sweeping surveillance powers that affect everyone in UK'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/new-data-bill-contains-sweeping-surveillance-powers-that-affect-everyone-in-the-uk-9605381.html|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=The Independent|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data being retained does not include the content of messages and telephone calls, just [[metadata]] describing when and who the users contacted by email, telephone, or text message. In circumstances when the [[Home Secretary]] issues a warrant for intercepting the content of private messages, the Act clarifies the law with which internet services providers must comply.&lt;ref name=bbc-20140710 /&gt;

Provisions were included in the Act to "increase transparency and oversight"; the [[BBC]] reported that this included the following:&lt;ref name=bbc-20140710 /&gt;
* The creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to scrutinise the impact of the law on [[privacy]] and [[Civil liberties in the United Kingdom|civil liberties]]. 
* Annual government transparency reports on how these powers are used. 
* The appointment of a senior former diplomat to lead discussions with the US government and internet firms to establish a new international agreement for sharing data between legal jurisdictions. 
* A restriction on the number of public bodies, including [[Royal Mail]], able to ask for communications data under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]] (RIPA). 
* Inclusion of a termination clause ensuring the powers under this Act expire at the end of 2016. 
* Statement that a wider review of the powers needed by government should be undertaken during the next parliament (after the general election in May 2015).

In July 2015, the High Court issued an order that parts of the Act were unlawful, and to be disapplied, suspended until 31 March 2016, thereby giving the government a deadline to come up with alternative legislation which is compatible with EU law.&lt;ref name=Judiciary2015-07-17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/david-davis-and-others-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department/|title=David Davis and others -v- Secretary of State for the Home Department|date=17 July 2015|publisher=judiciary.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs win surveillance powers legal challenge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33564442|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=BBC|date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Part 1, Chapter 2 requires schools and colleges to obtain consent of one parent of a child under 18 before acquiring and processing the child's biometric information, gives the child rights to stop the processing of their biometric information regardless of any parental consent, and requires that if any parent of the child objects to the processing of biometric information, it must be discontinued.
* Part 6 extends the existing [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] and amends the role of the [[Information Commissioner]], including widening the rules on applying for and receiving datasets from public authorities for re-use. And, while the Information Commissioner was already independent of Government in making regulatory decisions, the Act takes steps to further enhance the day-to-day corporate and administrative independence of the Commissioner.

== Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ==
{{Main article |Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000}}

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIP or RIPA) is significant piece of legislation that granted and regulated the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation. Activities covered by the Act include the interception of the content of telephone, internet, and postal communications; collection of information about, but not the content of, telephone, Internet, and postal communications (type of communication, caller and called telephone numbers, Internet addresses, domain names, postal addresses, date, time, and duration); use of agents, informants, undercover officers; electronic surveillance of private buildings and vehicles; following people; and gaining access to encrypted data.&lt;ref name=RIPA2000&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/introduction "Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000"], 2000 Chapter 23, UK Government Legislation. Retrieved 28 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

RIPA allows certain public bodies:&lt;ref name=RIPA2000/&gt;
* to demand that an [[ISP]] provide access to a customer's communications in secret;
* to engage in bulk collection of communications in transit;
* to demand ISPs fit equipment to facilitate surveillance;
* to [[Key disclosure law|demand that someone hand over encryption keys or passwords to protected information]];
* to monitor people's Internet activities;
* to prevent the existence of interception warrants and any data collected from being revealed in court.

The powers granted by RIPA can be invoked by government officials on the grounds of national security, for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime or serious crime, preventing disorder, protecting public safety or health, in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or charge payable to a government department, or in an emergency, preventing or mitigating death, injury, or any damage to a person's physical or mental health. Some of the powers granted by the Act are available to a relatively short list of from 5 to 12 government bodies, while others are available to longer lists of over 40 bodies.&lt;ref name=RIPA2000/&gt;

The 2000 Act received Royal Assent on 28 July 2000 and Commencement Orders bringing provisions within this Act into force were issued between 2002 and 2012. Where prior legislation exists, the 2000 Act works in conjunction with that legislation, in particular the [[Intelligence Services Act 1994]], the Police Act 1997, and the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/introduction#commencementAppliedContent "Commencement Orders bringing provisions within this Act into force"], Statutory Instruments, Investigatory Powers Tribunal.

=== Safeguards ===
RIPA and the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] require a formal warrant before private data may be gathered by the government. Warrants authorising interception of the content of electronic communications can only be issued by a democratically elected Member of Parliament, usually the [[Home Secretary]], or another [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE ANDREW MARR SHOW INTERVIEW: THERESA MAY, MP HOME SECRETARY|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/2311201402.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher=BBC|date=23 November 2014|quote=Well I guess what he's talking about is the fact that for certain aspects and certain of the more intrusive measures that our security service and police have available to them – i.e. Intercept, intercepting people's telephones and some other intrusive measures – the decision is taken by the Secretary of State, predominantly me. A significant part of my job is looking at these warrants and signing these warrants. I think it's ... Some people argue that should be to judges....I think it's very important that actually those decisions are being taken by somebody who is democratically accountable to the public. I think that's an important part of our system. I think it's a strength of our system.}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIPA imposes constraints to ensure the activities authorised meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), in particular that they are necessary and proportional. The Intelligence and Security Committee reported that GCHQ applies these standards to all of its work, not just activities governed by RIPA, to act as a check over all of its activities being necessary and proportional as required by the ECHR.&lt;ref name=ISC2015March /&gt;{{rp|84–86}}

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act established the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]] to provide judicial oversight and hear complaints about surveillance activities by intelligence agencies and other public bodies.&lt;ref name=RIPA2000/&gt; The Tribunal replaced the Interception of Communications Tribunal, the Security Service Tribunal, and the Intelligence Services Tribunal on 2 October 2000.

A series of [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|media reports in 2013]] revealed bulk collection and surveillance capabilities involving [[GCHQ]] in the United Kingdom such as [[Tempora]] and its component programmes [[Mastering the Internet]] and [[Global Telecoms Exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mastering the internet: how GCHQ set out to spy on the world wide web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-mastering-the-internet|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tempora programme involves a large-scale [[Data buffer|buffer]] for storing internet content for 3 days and [[metadata]] for 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ taps fibre-optic cables for secret access to world's communications|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 June 2013|location=London|first1=Ewen|last1=MacAskill|first2=Julian|last2=Borger|first3=Nick|last3=Hopkins|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other [[Global surveillance by category#GCHQ operations|GCHQ operations]] were revealed, including hacking into telecoms equipment, access to fibre-optic cables and programmes operated jointly with the [[NSA]].

GCHQ was originally established after the First World War as the ''Government Code and Cypher School'' (GC&amp;CS) and was known under that name until 1946. During World War II, staff including [[Alan Turing]] worked on decoding the German [[Enigma machine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Gannon |title=Colossus: Bletchley Park’s Greatest Secret |publisher=Atlantic Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-84354-331-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other foreign systems. In 1940, GC&amp;CS was working on the diplomatic codes and ciphers of 26 countries, tackling over 150 diplomatic cryptosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Alvarez |chapter=Most Helpful and Cooperative: GC&amp;CS and the Development of American Diplomatic Cryptanalysis, 1941–1942 |title=Action This Day: Bletchley Park from the Breaking of the Enigma Code to the Birth of the Modern Computer |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Smith |editor2-first=Ralph| editor2-last=Erskine |publisher=Bantam Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0593049105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the bilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]] in 1948. It was later broadened to include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as co-operation with several "third-party" nations. This became the cornerstone of Western intelligence gathering and the "[[Special Relationship]]" between the UK and the USA.&lt;ref name="timecoldwar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adam White|title=How a Secret Spy Pact Helped Win the Cold War|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2000262,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ECHELON]] is a code name often used for this global signals intelligence collection and analysis network.

=== Legislation and governance ===
GCHQ was placed on a statutory footing for the first time by the [[Intelligence Services Act 1994]]. Activities that involve interception of communications were legislated for under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]]; this kind of interception can only be carried out after a warrant has been issued by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], usually the Home Secretary. The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] requires the intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, respect citizens' rights as enumerated in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=GCHQlaw /&gt;&lt;ref name=refBBC141206 /&gt;

The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] nominates cross-party [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] to an [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] (ISC). The remit of the Committee includes oversight of intelligence and security activities and reports are made directly to Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.independent.gov.uk/|title=The Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament#Report on Privacy and Security, March 2015|special report]] on Privacy and Security, published by the ISC in March 2015, found that although GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not conduct mass surveillance. It did identify past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency.&lt;ref name=BBC20150314 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISC2015March /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian20150314 /&gt;

The UK also has an independent [[Intelligence Services Commissioner]] and Interception of Communications Commissioner, both of whom are former senior judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligencecommissioners.com/|title=Intelligence Commissioners|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual reports by the Interception of Communications Commissioner have found the use of interception powers by the intelligence agencies comply with existing legislation.&lt;ref name=ICC20150312 /&gt;

Judicial oversight of GCHQ's conduct is provided by the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]] (IPT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Functions – Key role|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=1|publisher=The Investigatory Powers Tribunal|accessdate=6 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206141009/http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=1|archivedate=6 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPT ruled in December 2014 that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit [[mass surveillance]] and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance.&lt;ref name=refBBC141206 /&gt;&lt;ref name=refGCHQ20141205 /&gt;&lt;ref name=refIPTList /&gt;

=== Reforms ===
The [[Justice and Security Act 2013]] included a range of reforms to the Intelligence and Security Committee to provide for further access and investigatory powers. ''The Telegraph'' reported that this included the following:&lt;ref name=Telegraph20121110 /&gt;
* The nine members of the committee are still nominated by the Prime Minister, but the House of Commons has the power veto the Prime Minister's suggestions. Previously, Parliament had no power to block such appointments.
* The panel now probes recent operations by the agencies. Before, its remit had only been for “resources, policy and administration” and it had seldom looked at specific operations.
* Officials acting for the committee are able to enter the premises of the intelligence agencies to inspect files and decide what the panel needs to see.
* Agencies are “required” to publish information unless handing over such details would compromise national security and they can obtain permission from the Prime Minister. Previously, the committee only had the power to “request” information.
* To signify the panel’s new status, its name was changed to the “Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament”.

== National databases ==
{{Main article |Government database#United Kingdom}}

Various government bodies maintain databases about citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. Under the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]], legal provisions exist that control and restrict the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases.

;Fingerprints and DNA
The [[British Police]] hold records of 5.5&amp;nbsp;million [[fingerprint]]s and over 3.4&amp;nbsp;million [[DNA]] samples on the [[UK National DNA Database|National DNA Database]]. There is increasing use of roadside fingerprinting, using new police powers to check identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6170070.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Motorists to give fingerprints |date=22 November 2006 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were raised in 2010 over the unregulated use of [[biometrics in schools]], affecting young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/The-issue-Biometric-identification-6054225/|title=The issue – Biometric identification|work=Times Educational Supplement|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=18 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017093418/http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/The-issue-Biometric-identification-6054225/|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the government introduced legal duties on schools, if they wish to use biometric information about pupils, in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of biometric information of children in schools|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protection-of-biometric-information-of-children-in-schools|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=11 May 2015|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Vehicle tracking system|Vehicle tracking]]
{{Main article|Automatic number plate recognition in the United Kingdom}}

Across the country efforts have been increasingly under way to track road vehicle movements, initially using a nationwide network of roadside cameras connected to [[automatic number plate recognition]] systems. These have tracked, recorded, and stored the details of journeys undertaken on major roads and through city centres. This information is stored for two years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/apr/24/database-state-surveillance "Paying billions for our database state"], Henry Porter and Afua Hirsch, Liberty Central Blog, ''The Guardian'', 24 April 2009.

Retrieved 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the future, mandatory onboard [[Telematics|vehicle telematics]] systems have been suggested, to facilitate [[road charging]] (''see [[vehicle excise duty]]'').

;Public transport
In London, the [[Oyster card]] payment system can track the movement of individual people through the public transport system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scullion |first=Aaron |title=Smart cards track commuters |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3121652.stm |date=25 September 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; although an anonymous option is available.

;Overseas travel
In February 2009 it emerged that the government was planning a database to track and store records of all international travel into and out of the UK. The database would retain record of names, addresses, telephone numbers, seat bookings, travel itineraries and credit card details, which would be kept for 'no more than 10 years'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government compiles travel records database |author=Robert Dex |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-compiles-travel-records-database-1604187.html |work=The Independent |agency=The Press Association |date=8 February 2009 |accessdate=18 September 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, passport exit checks began at UK borders and data will be stored on all travellers as they leave the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Passport exit checks begin at UK ports and borders|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32205970|accessdate=12 May 2015|publisher=BBC|date=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Paper:  Exit checks fact sheet|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exit-checks-on-passengers-leaving-the-uk/exit-checks-fact-sheet|publisher=UK Border Force and Home Office|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CCTV networks ==
[[File:Security cameras 7 count birmingham new street station.jpg|thumb|A bank of seven [[closed-circuit television]] cameras monitoring people exiting [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]], a major British railway station.]]

The combination of [[CCTV]] and facial recognition could be considered a form of mass surveillance, but has not been widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automatic Face Recognition in UK Airports|url=http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number6.9/face-recognition-uk|publisher=European Digital Rights|accessdate=1 December 2013|date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of system has been trialled at airports to compare faces with biometric passports, but such an application is comparable to existing identification checks at borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using e-passport gates|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/customs-travel/Enteringtheuk/e-passport-gates/|publisher=UK Border Agency|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the [[City of Westminster]] trialled microphones fitted next to CCTV cameras. Westminster council explained that the microphones were part of an initiative to tackle urban noise and would not "be used to snoop", but comments from a council spokesman appeared to imply they could capture an audio stream alongside the video stream, rather than simply reporting noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4196075/Council-plans-to-listen-in-on-street-life.html "Council plans to listen in on street life"], David Derbyshire, ''The Telegraph'' (UK), 4 May 2005. Retrieved 17 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The trials were discontinued in 2008 with no further plans for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westminster pulls CCTV microphones|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1940474/westminster-pulls-cctv-microphones|publisher=V3|accessdate=1 December 2013|date=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|CodeofPractice}}
In 2013, the [[Home Office]] published the [[Surveillance Camera Code of Practice]] for the use of surveillance cameras, including automatic number plate recognition systems, by local and government authorities. The aim of the code is to help ensure CCTV use is "characterised as surveillance by consent, and such consent on the part of the community must be informed consent and not assumed by a system operator. Surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to [[policing by consent]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance Camera Code of Practice|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204775/Surveillance_Camera_Code_of_Practice_WEB.pdf|publisher=UK Government Home Office|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=5|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of cameras ===
The vast majority of CCTV cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.&lt;ref name=refBBW1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Privacy: How local authorities spent £515m on CCTV in four years|url=http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/files/priceofprivacy/Price_of_privacy_2012.pdf|publisher=Big Brother Watch|accessdate=4 February 2015|date=February 2012|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''CCTV Image'' magazine estimated the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom was 1.85&amp;nbsp;million in 2011. The estimate was based on extrapolating from a comprehensive survey of public and private cameras within the Cheshire Constabulary jurisdiction. This works out as an average of one camera for every 32 people in the UK, although the density of cameras varies greatly from place to place. The Cheshire report also claims that the average person on a typical day would be seen by 70 CCTV cameras.&lt;ref name=Guardian2011/&gt;

The Cheshire figure is regarded as more dependable than a previous study by Michael McCahill and Clive Norris of ''UrbanEye'' published in 2002.&lt;ref name=Guardian2011&gt;{{cite news|title=You're being watched: there's one CCTV camera for every 32 people in UK - Research shows 1.85m machines across Britain, most of them indoors and privately operated|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/02/cctv-cameras-watching-surveillance|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2011|quote=Cheshire's deputy chief constable, Graeme Gerrard, said the data undermined more sensational estimates, such as the widely-repeated but dubious claim that the average Briton passes under 300 cameras a day.  Another questionable estimate that received widespread coverage – including in Home Office literature – was of 4.2m cameras in the UK. The methodology behind this claim was also dubious as it derived from a 2002 study that extrapolated from the number of cameras spotted on two streets in Wandsworth in London.|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=In the press: How the media is reporting the 1.85 million cameras story|url=http://www.securitynewsdesk.com/in-the-press-how-the-media-is-reporting-the-1-85-million-cameras-story/|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Security News Desk|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbaneye.net/results/ue_wp6.pdf|title=CCTV in London|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a small sample in [[Putney]] High Street, McCahill and Norris extrapolated the number of surveillance cameras in [[London|Greater London]] to be around 500,000 and the total number of cameras in the UK to be around 4,200,000. According to their estimate the UK has one camera for every 14 people. Although it has been acknowledged for several years that the methodology behind this figure is flawed,&lt;ref name=C42008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/factcheck+how+many+cctv+cameras/2291167|title=FactCheck: how many CCTV cameras?|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been widely quoted. Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the police and local government operated cameras in the [[City of London]], which was about 650 in 2011.&lt;ref name=refBBW1 /&gt;

The ''CCTV User Group'' estimated that there were around 1.5&amp;nbsp;million private and local government CCTV cameras in city centres, stations, airports, and major retail areas in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|title=How many cameras are there?|publisher=CCTV User Group |date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not include the smaller surveillance systems such as those that may be found in local corner shops and is therefore broadly in line with the Cheshire report.

Research conducted by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research and based on a survey of all Scottish local authorities, identified that there were over 2,200 public space CCTV cameras in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Bannister, J., Mackenzie, S. and Norris, P. [http://www.sccjr.ac.uk/pubs/Public-Space-CCTV-in-Scotland--Results-of-a-National-Survey-of-Scotlands-Local-Authorities/182 Public Space CCTV in Scotland](2009), Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research (Research Report)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pomeranians''' ({{lang-de|Pomoranen}}; {{lang-csb|Pòmòrzónie}}; {{lang-pl|Pomorzanie}}) were a group of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[tribe]]s who lived along the shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] between the mouths of the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] Rivers (the latter [[Farther Pomerania]] and [[Pomerelia]]). They spoke the [[Pomeranian language]] belonging to the [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] branch of the [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language family]].

The name ''Pomerania'' comes from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''po more'', which means "Land at the Sea".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pommersches-landesmuseum.de/kulturreferat-fuer-pommern/aufgaben/aufgaben.html ''Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie „Land am Meer“.''] (Pommersches Landesmuseum, German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Pomeranian tribes formed after the 6th century, when as a result of the Slavic migration, groups of Slavs populated the area, parts of which were formerly inhabited for some time by [[Germanic tribes]], such as the [[Goths]] and the [[Rugians]] etc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

From the late 10th century, the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] dukes of [[Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland]] tried to incorporate the Pomeranians into their realm and they succeeded several times. The Pomeranians were nevertheless always able to regain their independence. In the course of the 12th century, the non-Christian Pomeranians faced continuous pressure from their expanding Christian neighbours [[Denmark]], [[Poland]], and the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] dukes of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1121 they were again subdued by the Polish duke [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]], who had Pomerania [[Christianization|Christianized]] by the German missionary [[Otto of Bamberg]].

At the same time the Pomeranian Prince [[Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania|Wartislaw I]] conquered the former [[Lutici]] lands west of the Oder. After his successors from the [[House of Pomerania|House of Griffins]] were defeated by the Saxons at the 1164 [[Battle of Verchen]], they accepted the overlordship of Duke [[Henry the Lion]]. The Pomeranian lands were eventually divided, with the Western parts entering the Holy Roman Empire as the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] in 1181, and the Eastern part consisting of [[Pomerelia]] under the [[Samborides]] came under the influence of Poland and, from 1309 onwards, the [[Teutonic Order]].

After the [[Germanization]] of Pomerania resulting from the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]], many Pomeranians were slowly and gradually assimilated and discontinued the use of their Slavic language and culture. The direct descendants of Pomeranians include:
* [[Kashubians]], who speak the [[Kashubian language]]
* [[Slovincians]]
* [[Kociewiacy]]
* [[Borowiacy]]
* [[West Pomerania|Western Pomeranians]], who speak [[Low German Language|Low German]] or [[Standard German]]
* [[Farther_Pomerania|Eastern Pomeranians]], who were [[Expulsion of Germans from Poland|expelled from Pomerania in 1945]] and settled in various parts of Germany and speak either local dialects or [[Standard German]]

'''Radio Forces Françaises de Berlin''' (Radio FFB) was a broadcaster catering to the [[France|French]] [[French Forces in Berlin|military contingent]] in the [[History_of_Berlin#West and East Germany (1945–1990)|French Sector]] of [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M0UyAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Radio+Forces+Fran%C3%A7aises+de+Berlin%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22FFB%22 ''German radio and television: organization and economic basis''], Hans Brack, European Broadcasting Union, 1968, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in the Quartier Napoléon near [[Tegel Airport]] in the French sector.&lt;ref name="WRTH 1991"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PctNAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Radio+forces+fran%C3%A7aises+de+Berlin&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Quarter+Napoleon ''World Radio TV Handbook''], Volumes 45-46, O. Lund Johansen, 1991, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
Radio broadcasts began on 8 May 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=63wfAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Radio+FFB+berlin+ortf&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=FFB+ ''Rundfunk: Faszination Hörfunk''], Klaus Breitkopf, Hans-Joachim Manger, Rolf Nusser, Hüthig, 2007, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; FFB began broadcasting on 93.6&amp;nbsp;MHz FM in 1959.&lt;ref name="WRTH 1991"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most programmes were from the French national broadcaster [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]] (later [[ORTF]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QrZNAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Radio+FFB+berlin+ortf&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=FFB+ ''World Radio TV Handbook''], Volume 29, Billboard Publications, 1975, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; This was initially a mixture of [[France Inter]], [[France Culture]] and [[France Musique]], but by the 1980s, only France Inter programmes were being broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CNigAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22FFB%22+Radio+%22Berlin%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22FFB%22+ ''750 Years Berlin 1987: Information''], Presse und Informationsamt des Landes Berlin, 1987, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 1963, the French-language programmes were supplemented with [[German language|German-language]] broadcasts to listeners in the [[Berlin]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=60doAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22FFB%22+Radio+%22Berlin%22+mai+1957&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22September+1963%22 ''Berlin im Kalten Krieg: Schauplätze und Ereignisse''], Klaus Behling, Christian Behling, K. Homilius, 2008, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; Consisting of hour-long programmes aired between 1800 and 1900 local time, these were later produced by the German service of [[Radio France Internationale]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fl4sAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Radio+forces+fran%C3%A7aises+de+Berlin+FFB&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22de+18+%C3%A0+19+h%22 ''Documents: Revues des Questions Allemandes''], Volume 42, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; There were also locally produced short bulletins for members of the French garrison in Berlin.

The departure of the Allies from Berlin in 1994 signalled the end of the FFB radio service. The 93.6&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency has been used ever since by [[Radio France Internationale]], meaning that from July 1995, French radio broadcasts could still be received in [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] on 93.6&amp;nbsp;MHz and 106.0&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KXxJzHGJas0C&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22FFB%22%20Radio%20%22Berlin%22%20%221994%22&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=%22FFB%22%20Radio%20%22Berlin%22%20%221994%22&amp;f=true ''Radiogeschichten: Zeitreise und Exkursionen in die Berliner RadioWelten''], Die Radionauten, BoD, 2005, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV==
In 1980, a TV station, Télévision Française à Berlin, was established, for which, like the radio station, programming was acquired from the French domestic channels, [[TF1]] and Antenne 2 (now [[France 2]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9IgOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Television+Fran%C3%A7aise+%C3%A0+Berlin+%22TFB%22&amp;dq=Television+Fran%C3%A7aise+%C3%A0+Berlin+%22TFB%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdjemkxabLAhXnQpoKHSHwDP0Q6AEIMDAB ''Berlin Handbuch: das Lexikon der Bundeshauptstadt''], Horst Ulrich, Berlin (Germany). Presse- und Informationsamt, FAB Verlag, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984, the international French-language channel TV5 (now [[TV5MONDE]]) was carried.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BwbwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Radio+forces+fran%C3%A7aises+de+Berlin&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=FFB ''Outlook, Berlin''], Udo Wetzlaugk, Christian Koziol, Berlin Information Centre, 1985, page 85&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to programming from TF1 and Antenne 2, it also carried programming from FR3 (now [[France 3]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n4b8nr-I4TgC&amp;dq=Berlin+%22TFB%22+Fran%C3%A7aise+television&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22TF1%22+ ''Medienstadt Berlin''], Projekt Medien- und Kommunikationsatlas Berlin, Vistas, 1988, pages 300-302&lt;/ref&gt; The service was available in West Berlin via [[cable television|cable]], but only in the French Sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hgwcAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=franz%C3%B6sischen++in+Berlin+radio+%22FFB%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+%22SSVC%22 ''Medienlandschaft im Umbruch: Medien- und Kommunikationsatlas Berlin''], Günter Bentele, Otfried Jarren, Ulrich Kratzsch, Vistas Verlag, 1990, page 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of broadcasts==

Following the withdrawal of French forces from the reunified Berlin, FFB radio and TFB television broadcasts ceased in June 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YAwiAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22FFB%22+Radio+%22Berlin%22+%221994%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22FFB%22++ ''Radio und Musik von und für Soldaten: Kriegs- und Nachkriegsjahre : 1939-1960''], Günter Grull, Herbst, 2000, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Registry of World Record Size Shells''''' is a [[Conchology|conchological]] work listing the largest (and in some cases smallest) verified [[mollusc shell|shell]] specimens of various [[mollusc]] [[taxon|taxa]]. A successor to the earlier ''World Size Records'' of [[Robert Jacob Lewis Wagner|Robert J. L. Wagner]] and [[R. Tucker Abbott]], it has been published on a semi-regular basis since 1997, changing ownership and publisher a number of times. Originally planned for release every two years, new editions are now published annually. Since 2008 the entire registry has been available online in the form of a searchable [[Online database|database]]. The registry is continuously expanded and now contains more than 22,000 listings and 85,000 supporting images.&lt;ref name=WRS&gt;[http://www.wrs-shells.com/ Registry of World Record Size Shells]. wrs-shells.com. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQ6rzSI--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quiquandon2011&gt;Quiquandon, P.

Certain families of attractive shells (such as [[Conidae|cones]], [[Cypraeidae|cowries]], [[Marginellidae|marginellas]], and [[Muricidae|murex]]) are particularly favoured by collectors. World record size shells (commonly indicated by the acronym 'WRS') of species in the most popular families are much sought after by some shell collectors, and can thus command high prices.{{refn|group=nb|name=value|The value of some WRS shells can exceed US$10,000.&lt;ref name=Hursh2012 /&gt;}} Collections of such shells are exhibited at a number of specialist museums, including the [[Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, K.

==Overview==

===Scope===
Throughout its history the registry has covered four [[Class (biology)|classes]] of molluscs: [[bivalve]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[gastropod]]s, and [[scaphopod]]s. [[Chiton]]s have been excluded because their shells are formed from eight articulated plates and therefore the size of a fixed specimen depends in large part on the preservation method used.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;[http://www.wrs-shells.com/wrs_rules_en.php WRS Rules]. wrs-shells.com. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdUIhUwQ--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Smallest adult sizes have been listed beginning with a few specimens of [[Cypraeidae]] and [[Strombidae]] in the first edition,&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; and they now additionally encompass a third family: [[Marginellidae]].&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; Separate records for [[Sinistral and dextral|sinistral]] (left-handed) shells and obviously [[wikt:rostrate|rostrate]] [[Cowry|cowries]] (family [[Cypraeidae]]) are also included.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; Terrestrial and [[Freshwater mollusc|freshwater species]], as well as fossils of [[extant taxa]], are not covered by the registry.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

===Content===
[[File:Doopvontschelp grootste ter wereld.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A single valve of ''[[Tridacna gigas]]'', the largest extant bivalve in terms of mass, and the second-longest species listed in the registry]]
The bulk of the publication—which apart from the cover is unillustrated—comprises a list of taxa and their corresponding world record sizes. Each specimen in the registry is listed alphabetically under its recognised [[scientific name]]. This is usually a [[binomial name|binomen]] (species name), but [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)#Other nomenclature uses|varieties]] and [[Form (zoology)|forms]] are also included (the latter two are used informally and are not regulated by the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]''). In addition to the shell size, each specimen is listed with its location, owner or repository, and the year it was collected, acquired, or registered (whichever is known, listed in decreasing order of preference).&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

Each print edition has an appendix with an alphabetical listing of entry totals for all private collectors and repositories having ownership of specimens in the registry. In the first edition, the most individual entries belonged to Victor Dan, with 369, closely followed by co-author Don Pisor at 325.&lt;ref name=1st /&gt; This title subsequently went to Tennessee physician and world-renowned collector Pete Stimpson, who for a time held over 2,000 entries in the registry,&lt;!--2005 edition--&gt;&lt;ref name=Hursh2012&gt;Hursh, K.

McClung Museum of Natural History &amp; Culture. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OzExaLoW--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction of having the most WRS entries now belongs to Havelet Marine, which counted 3,244 specimens in the 2008 edition, compared to Stimpson's 1,963.

===Measurements===
The registry's rules specify that specimens "should be measured with [[vernier calipers|vernier type calipers]] and should reflect the greatest measurable dimension of the shell in any direction including any processes of hard shell material produced by the animal (i.e. [[Sculpture (mollusc)|spines, wings, keels]], [[siphonal canal]]s, etc.) and not including attachments, [[barnacle]]s, [[coralline algae]], or any other encrusting organisms. Long, hair-like [[periostracum]] is not to be included."&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

Shell sizes are given in millimetres and recorded to the nearest {{convert|0.1|mm|in}}, as is standard in [[conchology]]. To account for human error and environmental effects, new records are only accepted if they exceed the standing record by at least {{convert|0.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. This 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm margin also applies to smallest adult sizes exceeding {{convert|10.0|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

Entries for specimens that tie the standing record can also be submitted. Though not included in the registry, they are kept on file in the event that the current record holder is shown to be misidentified or smaller than originally claimed.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

===Size verification===
For inclusion in the registry, size records must be verified either by a recognised second party ("a professional [[malacologist]], a reputable shell dealer, or an advanced collector who is recognized as a specialist in the applicable family") or through photographic evidence (three images, showing the shell being measured with calipers and its [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal and ventral]] aspects).&lt;ref name=Quiquandon2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; Entries may be submitted by regular mail or e-mail; a submission form is included at the back of each print edition. These requirements mean that in some cases older or even current malacological literature may include size records which exceed those found in the registry.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García, E.F. (28 September 2009). [http://www.jaxshells.org/ms19.pdf Book Review: ''Marine Shells of Northeast Florida''.] ''[[The Nautilus (journal)|The Nautilus]]'' '''123'''(3): 220–222. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OzGbjsWL--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the registry, shells were sometimes officially measured for world record size status at [[Conchologists of America]] conventions, as in 1999 when the measurements were carried out by senior author Kim Hutsell.&lt;ref&gt;Scheu, L. (11 March 1999). [http://www.listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9903B&amp;L=conch-l&amp;P=R2036 World Record Size Shells and Measuring]. CONCH-L archives. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQ094X8--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
Beginning in the mid-20th century, several attempts were made to produce a list of the largest shell specimens. Perhaps the earliest of these was the '''''Lost Operculum Club List of Champions''''', initiated in 1950 by [[John Q. Burch]] (1894–1974) of the [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Conchological Club of Southern California]].&lt;ref name=1968list&gt;[Anonymous] (1968). [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/32159046 Lost Operculum Club List]. ''The Echo'' 1968: 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; This project was overseen by [[Bertram C. Draper]] (1904–2000) between 1966 and 1987, and bore [[#List of publications|four major print publications]] during this time.&lt;ref name=GrovesMcLean2011 /&gt; The list was limited in scope compared to later efforts, encompassing only marine species of the [[Eastern Pacific]], from [[Alaska]] to [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;&lt;ref name=GrovesMcLean2011&gt;Groves, L.T. &amp; J.H. McLean (2001). [http://research.nhm.org/dataimages/draper/Draper.pdf Bertram C. Draper 1904–2000.] ''[[The Festivus]]'' '''33'''(6): 63–65. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQIw380--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/42431432/A-BRIEF-HISTORY-OF-THE-CONCHOLOGICAL-CLUB-OF-SOUTHERN A Brief History of the Conchological Club of Southern California.] Docstoc. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQLSTJ4--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct predecessor to the ''Registry of World Record Size Shells'' was '''''World Size Records''''', compiled by renowned [[malacologist]]s [[Robert Jacob Lewis Wagner|Robert J. L. Wagner]] (1905–1992) and [[R. Tucker Abbott]] (1919–1995). These record sizes originally appeared in 1964, in the first edition of ''[[Van Nostrand's Standard Catalog of Shells]]'', not as a separate list but interspersed among other species-specific information that made up the bulk of the work. An updated list was published as part of the book's second edition, in 1967. The next update appeared in the work's third edition, which was renamed ''[[Wagner and Abbott's Standard Catalog of Shells]]''. Unlike previous editions, this third and final installment of the catalog was a [[ring binder]] with loose-leaf content, intended as a continually updated resource. To match the newly retitled work, the list's name was modified to '''''Wagner and Abbott's World Size Records'''''. In this final incarnation, the list appeared as a series of four supplements: the first two were loose-leaf publications that appeared in 1978 and 1982, and these were followed by hole-punched [[paperback]] titles in 1985 and 1990.&lt;ref name=Allen2005&gt;Allen, L. (3 January 2005). [http://www.listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0501a&amp;L=conch-l&amp;D=0&amp;P=2434 WRS Book (World Record Size Shells)]. CONCH-L archives. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQWlbg6--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Registry of World Record Size Shells''===
Following the deaths of Wagner and Abbott, Barbara Haviland continued to compile data for world records. In 1997 Kim Hutsell acquired the rights from Cynthia Abbott to ''World Size Records'' to continue the project as a stand-alone book, those rights were subsequently sold to Don Pisor. The first edition therefore incorporated many of the earlier entries, as well as additional data compiled for ''World Size Records'' by Barbara Haviland.&lt;ref name=1st /&gt; The format of the new publication differed from ''World Size Records'' in several important ways. Significantly, the minimum size threshold was lowered from {{convert|2.5|cm|in}} to {{convert|1|cm|in}}. In another change, the registry listed taxa alphabetically by species name within families, instead of within genera as they had been previously.{{refn|group=nb|name=layout|This format would later be dropped for the fourth edition (2005) in favour of alphabetical ordering of species within genera and of genera within families, only to be reinstated for the fifth edition (2008).}} This system allows for easy comparison between closely related genera, is more resilient to the frequent taxonomic changes that occur at the genus level, and gets around the issue that many shell dealers prefer to [[Lumpers and splitters|lump]] numerous genera for the sake of simplicity.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; R. Tucker Abbott had himself intended to use this arrangement in the fifth edition of his ''World Size Records'', but died before he could see his plans through.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; Another difference was the presentation of sizes in millimetres to the nearest tenth instead of centimetres to the nearest hundredth, moving the publication in line with standard usage in conchology. Finally, references were added for each specimen to aid in identification. The opening paragraph of the first edition set out the project's goals and invited submissions:&lt;ref name=1st /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the importance of maximum shell size and its role in the overall scheme of Conchology and Malacology is debatable, it remains one point of continual interest among collectors and researchers. The purpose of the Registry of World Record Size Shells is to provide a single publication containing a list of the largest known specimens for as many shelled molluscan species as possible in a format designed for ease of use. Undoubtedly, specimens may exist, hidden in museums, universities and private collections, which exceed some of the sizes listed herein. It is the sincere hope of the editors that information concerning such specimens be shared with others by submitting accurate and verifiable records to the Registry of World Record Size Shells.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kim C. Hutsell, Linda L. Hutsell and Don Pisor released the first three editions in 1997, 1999, and 2001. These were published by the Hutsell's company, Snail's Pace Productions, and distributed by Pisor's Marine Shells, both based in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. The first edition went on sale at the 1997 [[Conchologists of America]] (COA) convention in [[Captiva Island]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; 

The text of the fourth edition was completed by Kim and Linda Hutsell and originally planned for release at the 2003 COA convention in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref name=Allen2005 /&gt; but was greatly delayed and only came out in 2005. The fifth edition appeared three years later. With the departure of the first two authors, the titles of the fourth and fifth editions were shortened to '''''Pisor's Registry of World Record Size Shells'''''. These also marked a switch from Snail's Pace Productions to a new main publisher, ConchBooks of [[Hackenheim]], [[Germany]].{{refn|group=nb|name=publishers|The fourth edition (2005) is identified on its front cover as "A Publication of Snail's Pace Productions and ConchBooks". Its [[title page]] gives Pisor as the author, Conchology, Inc. as the compiler, and ConchBooks as the editor. The fifth edition (2008) has "A Publication of ConchBooks and Pisor Marine Enterprise, Inc." on the cover, with the title page listing Pisor as the author, Conchology, Inc. as the compiler, both ConchBooks and Pisor Marine Enterprise as the editors, and crediting Guido T. Poppe for reworking the book.}} They were compiled with the help of Conchology, Inc., with the company's founder, [[Guido T. Poppe]], providing an introduction for the fifth edition.

On 2 April 2008, the copyrights to the registry were transferred from Pisor to Jean-Pierre Barbier of Topseashells and Philippe Quiquandon of Shell's Passion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topseashells.com/wrs.php Transfer of World Record Size Shells Registry].

==Reviews==

===First edition===
The first edition of the ''Registry of World Record Size Shells'' was reviewed for [[Conchologists of America]] (COA) by [[malacologist]] [[Gary Rosenberg]] of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] and [[conchologist]] [[Gene Everson]].&lt;ref name=COA&gt;Rosenberg, G. &amp; G. Everson (1997). [http://www.conchologistsofamerica.org/articles/reviews/9709.asp Book Reviews: Registry of World Record Size Shells by Kim C. Hutsell, Linda L. Hutsell and Donald L. Pisor]. Conchologists of America. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQtKMo7--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg spoke favourably of the changes made since ''World Size Records'', namely the lowering of the minimum size for inclusion, listing sizes in millimetres, ordering species alphabetically within families irrespective of genus, and adding a reference field for identification purposes. He also welcomed the inclusion of separate entries for [[infraspecific taxa]] such as [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)#Other nomenclature uses|varieties]], and [[Form (zoology)|forms]], noting that these "might someday prove to be full species, and maximum sizes might provide evidence as to their status".&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Rosenberg identified a minor inconsistency in the grouping of [[cephalopod]]s ([[Argonautidae]] and [[Nautilidae]]) and [[scaphopod]]s ([[Dentaliidae]]) with [[gastropod]]s while listing [[bivalve]]s separately, opining that "a single alphabetic sequence would be preferable".&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; Rosenberg also found "an unusual number of typographical errors", which he attributed to a rush to have the work ready for the 1997 COA convention. Other issues identified by Rosenberg included the listing of synonyms (e.g. ''[[Oliva sericea]]'' and its synonym ''[[Oliva textilina]]'') and different combinations of the same species (e.g. ''[[Ancilla lienardi]]'' and ''[[Eburna lienardi]]''). While suggesting that errors of the second type would be easier to catch if [[Author citation (zoology)|author citations]] were included, Rosenberg conceded that this might not be practical due to space limitations. Rosenberg also noted entries where the cited location fell well outside the species's natural range (e.g. a supposed West African specimen of the East African ''[[Ancilla ventricosa]]'').&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Comparing around a quarter of the size records from the first edition against shells in the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Rosenberg found that the latter had larger specimens in some 10% of cases.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; What Rosenberg considered "[o]f greatest concern", however, were discrepancies between the record sizes listed in the registry and larger specimens found in contemporary monographic works, and this even extended to [[type specimen]]s in some cases.{{refn|group=nb|name=smaller|The first edition listed the world record size for ''[[Perotrochus midas]]'' as 77.4&amp;nbsp;mm, but the 118.3&amp;nbsp;mm [[holotype]] and an even larger 127.5&amp;nbsp;mm specimen had both been cited in the comprehensive monograph of Anseeuw &amp; Goto (1996).&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;}} The problem seemed to be particularly pronounced in the [[Pleurotomariidae]]—a family highly prized by shell collectors—where nine out of sixteen species had larger shells listed in the standard work on the family, that of Anseeuw &amp; Goto (1996). Similar issues were found with the record sizes of [[Terebridae]].{{refn|group=nb|name=smaller2|An extreme example was ''[[Terebra funiculata]]'', with the registry listing a 32.5&amp;nbsp;mm record as compared to the 69&amp;nbsp;mm maximum given in Bratcher &amp; Cernohorsky (1987).&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;}} Rosenberg concluded: "The Registry would be much more authoritative if it included record sizes from the literature, and I recommend this be done in future editions."&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Gene Everson echoed Rosenberg in highlighting the changes from ''World Size Records'' as major improvements. In particular he praised the format and exhaustiveness of the publication, writing that, despite having almost double the entries of its predecessor, the registry was much easier to handle compared with the "heavy and bulky" ''Standard Catalog of Shells''. He added that the authors' choice of [[coil binding]] made it easier to keep the registry open at the desired page.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Everson questioned some of the publication choices for the reference field, such as the conspicuous omission of "the definitive work on New Zealand shells", ''[[New Zealand Mollusca]]'' by [[Arthur William Baden Powell]]. He continued: "Many other landmark works by highly respected malacologists are omitted, while articles in periodicals frequently written by amateurs, such as ''[[La Conchliglia]]'' and ''[[American Conchologist]]'', are [not]. It would seem the included 49 references were just those used by the authors for this edition." He suggested that future editions should clearly set out what types of references are acceptable. Summarising, Everson wrote:&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is meant to be a useful, working and evolving tool and should not be nitpicked on details that are not relevant to its purpose. The authors are not producing a treatise on each family with hot-off-the-press reclassifications. I suspect they are following [[Kay Cunningham Vaught|Vaught]]'s classification which has been out for a few years, and is by no means perfect or up-to-date, but is readily available and inexpensive, and thus a good choice. But if so, this standard should be identified in the introduction, so that one knows where to find a shell. Also, typos are found in almost every book, and this is no exception, but they do not lessen the useful information, which is the main reason why we will buy this book. Two thumbs up!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later editions===
A review of the 11th edition criticised the lack of [[pagination]] and therefore of an index, as well as the lack of page headings indicating families.&lt;ref name=mdm&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6OdKD4oFH Registry of World Record Size Shells - 2014].

'''Spejbl and Hurvínek Theatre''' ('''S+H''') is a [[puppet theatre]] located in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. Founded in 1930 by puppeteer [[Josef Skupa]], Spejbl and Hurvínek was the first professional puppet theatre established in [[Czechoslovakia]] and the present-day Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=pdm&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Spejbl &amp; Hurvínek Prague theatre head, puppeteer Štáchová dies |url=http://praguemonitor.com/2017/03/23/spejbl-hurv%C3%ADnek-prague-theatre-head-puppeteer-%C5%A1t%C3%A1chov%C3%A1-dies |work=[[Prague Daily Monitor]] |publisher= |date=2017-03-23 |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Štáchová]], a puppeteer who played the well known roles of Manicka and Mrs Katerina in the company, served as the head of Spejbl and Hurvínek from 1996 until her death in 2017&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt;, following [[Miloš Kirschner]] (1956/1966-1996) and founder [[Josef Skupa]] (1930-1956). In 2008, a court awarded Štáchová the right to use the popular [[Spejbl and Hurvínek]] puppet characters after an eight-year legal dispute, which allowed the S+H Theatre to continue its programs.&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt;

'''Superrock KYOI''' was a [[short-wave]] [[radio station]] located at [[Saipan]] island in the Pacific region from 1982 to 1989. The station broadcast [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] to [[China]], [[Japan]], [[USSR]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and other countries.

==History==
The idea for Superrock KYOI was first proposed in 1980, due to the popularity of shortwave radio in Japan, which led to the idea of using the medium of shortwave to satisfy Japanese teenagers' and young adults' appetite for Western pop and rock music, as the Western concept of Top-40 or Album Rock radio formats did not exist in Japan at the time. The station began transmitting December 17, 1982. Initial frequencies were 11.9, 15.19, 15.405, and 9.67 [[MHz]]. To promote a new standard of broadcasting, Superrock KYOI had a carefully selected name: "Super" having a very strong, positive meaning in Japan, and "YOI" meaning "good" in Japanese. With the slogan "Super Rock" and the promise of "rock and roll from [[Los Angeles, California|L.A.]]" (although the station's headquarters were located in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]), it was an instant hit not only in the intended target area of Japan, but also, unexpectedly, with listeners worldwide. Enthusiasm did not extend to advertisers in either Japan or the United States, however, as the station found it very hard to sell time, and by late 1985 was soliciting donations from listeners to help keep the station on the air. This strategy ultimately did not produce the needed cash flow and KYOI was put up for sale a few months later.

In December 1986, the Herald Broadcasting division of the [[Christian Science Monitor]] Syndicate Inc. purchased KYOI. Although the station's Top 40/CHR format was initially retained, it was increasingly interrupted over the next few years by news and religious programming.  The station also began referring to itself as "All Hit KYOI" during this time. Broadcasts of music programs were completely terminated in 1989 with the station's callsign changing to KHBI and the format changing to full-time religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=26977&amp;Callsign=KHBI|title=Call Sign History|date=1989-08-24|accessdate=2009-04-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115094447/http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=26977&amp;Callsign=KHBI|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 HBS sold the station to [[Radio Free Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shortwave.org/news/news9810.htm|title=Herald Broadcasting Sells Saipan Station|date=1998-07-02|accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
Superrock KYOI was located at Agingan point of Saipan island. Both studio and transmitter facilities were co-sited in the same building, a {{convert|2,000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} concrete structure designed to withstand hurricane winds of 150 miles per hour and earthquakes of magnitude 3 on the Richter scale. The entire plant was self-sufficient, with its own 450-kilowatt diesel generator and a 2,500-gallon water catchment system with filtering unit and compression [[tank]]. The station had a powerful transmitter, a [[Continental Electronics]] 418-D-2, 100-kilowatt high level plate modulated, with an automatic servo system, allowing pre-tuning of channels in use. Three tubes sat in tanks of distilled water that boiled off into steam and then condensed back into water to be returned to the system.

The antenna system consisted of a complex and elaborate array, composed of 16 [[dipole]]s phased together directed towards an azimuth of 340 degrees true. The program of broadcasting consisted of continuous top 40 [[rock music]] controlled primarily by a computer audio sequencing system, with automated song title and station identification announcements inserted as required. The same computer system was also used to change frequency 4 times daily, completely eliminating operator error. The music was run from a program automation system, which held up to seven days of twenty-four-hour programming. A time clock was incorporated allowing station IDs and frequency change announcements to be aired at predetermined times. Music, commercials and jingles were all called up from a series of carts also by the computer system.

From its two {{convert|170|ft|m|sing=on}} towers, the latest in [[rock music]] was beamed to a primarily young Japanese audience of 18- to 30-year-olds from one end of Japan to the other. Among major advertisers supporting the station and its programs were [[Seiko]], [[Sony]], and [[Continental Micronesia|Air Micronesia]].

==Staff==
The main creator of station  was [[Lawrence Berger]]; other owners were Fred Zeder, and Adrian Perry. The main operator of the KYOI station was the Marcom company&lt;!-- not Canadian Forces Maritime Command --&gt;. Technical facilities on [[Saipan]] employed just six staff, working as operators, antenna [[rigger (industry)|rigger]]s and other devices which were needed to keep the station on the air around the clock. On-air announcements and station IDs were done in both English and Japanese and time checks were always given in [[Japan Standard Time]].

All programs of Superrock KYOI were prepared in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] by the [[Drake-Chenault]] Company, and then air-freighted to Saipan. All programming was prerecorded or voice-tracked; the station employed no live announcers although song title and artist information were given in prerecorded announcements. KYOI retained a representative in Japan to advise the programmer of the latest in [[J-pop|Japanese pop music]] trends. However, the music format consisted chiefly of Western pop and rock, with very few J-pop singles played; the playlist included a flavoring of oldies dating back to the 1960s in addition to current and recent hit records. On-air features included a weekly Top 30 countdown (presented in both English and Japanese), "Music World" music news briefs, and a [[modern rock]] music feature prepared by [[KROQ]]-FM in Los Angeles. Sales of airtime were made in Japan, and bills paid from Honolulu with most business being conducted by telephone and [[Telegraphy#Telex|telex]].

KYOI received thousands of letters and reception reports, and acknowledged all reports with cards postmarked "Saipan CM". The station also hoped to encourage interest in Saipan as a vacation spot.
