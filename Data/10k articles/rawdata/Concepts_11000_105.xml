Princeton physicist [[Gerard O'Neill|Gerard K. O'Neill]]'s 1981 book, '''''2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future''''' was an attempt to predict the technological and social state of humanity 100 years in the future. O'Neill's positive attitude towards both technology and human potential distinguished this book from gloomy predictions of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]] by contemporary scientists. [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] wrote in 1968 in ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', "in the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death". The [[Club of Rome]]'s 1972 ''[[Limits to Growth]]'' predicted a catastrophic end to the Industrial Revolution within 100 years from resource exhaustion and pollution.

O'Neill's contrary view had two main components. First, he analyzed the previous attempts to predict the future of society—including many catastrophes that had not materialized. Second, he extrapolated historical trends under the assumption that the obstacles identified by other authors would be overcome by five technological "Drivers of Change". He extrapolated an average American family income in 2081 of $1 million/year. Two developments based on his own research were responsible for much of his optimism. In ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space]]'' O'Neill described solar power satellites that provide unlimited clean energy, making it far easier for humanity to reach and exceed present developed-world living standards. Overpopulation pressures would be relieved as billions of people eventually emigrate to colonies in free space. These colonies would offer an Earth-like environment but with vastly higher productivity for industry and agriculture. These colonies and satellites would be constructed from asteroid or lunar materials launched into the desired orbits cheaply by the [[Mass Driver 1|mass drivers]] O'Neill's group developed.

== Part I: The Art of Prophecy ==
Previous futurist authors he cites:
* [[Edward Bellamy]]
* [[J.D. Bernal]]
* [[McGeorge Bundy]]
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]
* [[George Darwin]]
* [[J. B. S. Haldane]]
* [[Robert Heilbroner]]
* [[Aldous Huxley]]
* [[Rudyard Kipling]]
* [[Thomas More]]
* [[George Orwell]]
* [[George Thompson (author)|George Thompson]]
* [[Konstantin Tsiolkovski]]
* [[Jules Verne]]
* [[H.G. Wells]]
* [[Eugene Zamiatin]]

Arthur C. Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' included a long list of predictions, many of which O'Neill endorsed. Two of his maxims that O'Neill quotes &lt;ref&gt;[[#ONeill81|O'Neill 1981]]: 27&lt;/ref&gt; seem to sum up O'Neill's attitude, as well:
* "anything that is theoretically possible will be achieved in practice, no matter what the technical difficulties, if it is desired greatly enough"
* "We can never run out of energy or matter, but we can all too easily run out of brains."

== Part II: The Drivers of Change ==
Sections are included on the five key "Drivers of Change" believed by O'Neill to be the focus of future development:
* [[Automation]]
* [[Colonization of space|Space Colonies]]
* [[Communications]]
* [[Computers]]
* [[Energy]]

O'Neill applied basic physics to understand the limits of possible change, using the history of the technology to extrapolate likely progress. He applied the history of computing to reason about how people and institutions will shape and be shaped by the likely changes. He predicted that future computers must run at a very low-voltage because of heat. The main basis of his technology extrapolation for computers is [[Moore's Law]], one of the greatest successes of [[Trend estimation]] in predicting human progress.

His predicted the social aspects of the future of computers. He identified computers as the most certain of his five "drivers of change", because their adoption could be driven primarily by individual or local decisions, while the other four such as space colonies depended on large-scale decision-making. He observed the success of minicomputers, calculators, and the first home computers, and predicted that every home would have a computer in a hundred years. With the aid of speculations by computer pioneers such as [[John von Neumann]] and the writers of "tracts" such as [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', O'Neill also predicted that privacy would be under siege from computers in 2081.

O'Neill predicted that [[software engineering]] issues and the intractability of [[artificial intelligence]] problems would require massive programming efforts and very powerful processors to achieve truly usable computers. His prediction was based on the difficulties and failures of computer use he had observed in 1981, including a candid horror story of his own [[Princeton University]] library's attempt to computerize its operations. His computers of the future, represented by the robot butler his visitor to Earth encounters in 2081, included speaker-independent [[speech recognition]] and [[natural language processing]]. O'Neill correctly pointed out the huge difference between computers and human brains, and stated that, while a more human-like artificial brain is a worthy goal, computers will be vastly improved descendants of today's rather than truly intelligent and creative artificial brains.

== Part III: The World in 2081 ==

This section was written as a series of dispatches home from "Eric C. Rawson", a native of a distant space colony called "Fox Cluster". By analogy with American religious colonists such as the Puritans and Mormons, O'Neill suggests that such a colony might have been founded by a group of pacifists who chose to live about twice as far from the Sun as Pluto in order to avoid involvement in Earth's wars. His calculations indicate that colonies at this distance could have Earth-level sunlight using a mirror the same weight as the colony itself. Eric pays a visit to the Earth of 2081 to take care of family business and explore a world that is nearly as foreign to him as it is to us.

After each dispatch, O'Neill added a section that described his reasoning for each situation the visitor described, such as riding a "floater" train going thousands of miles per hour in vacuum, interacting with a household robot or visiting a fully enclosed Pennsylvania city with a tropical climate in midwinter. Each section was written from his perspective as a physicist. For example, his description of "Honolulu, Pennsylvania" included multiple roof layers that could be retracted in good weather. The city enjoyed an artificial tropical climate all year because of internal climate controls and advanced insulation. He also proposed magnetically levitated "floater" trains moving in very-low-pressure tunnels that would replace airplanes on heavily traveled routes.

==Part IV: Wild Cards==
This section explores, not the most probable outcomes, but "the limits of the possible": how likely some scenarios O'Neill considered less probable are, and what they might mean. These included nuclear annihilation, attaining immortality, and contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. For this last case, he presents a thought experiment about how a hypothetical alien civilization, the "Primans", could explore the galaxy with self-replicating robots, monitoring every planetary system in the Galaxy without betraying their own position, and destroying intelligent life (by building giant mirrors to incinerate the planet) if they felt threatened. This experiment seems to prove that conflict or even surprise contact with an intelligent alien life form—that staple of science fiction—is highly unlikely.

Bioprinting covers a broad range of [[biomaterial]]s.

==Process==
3D bioprinting generally follows three steps, pre-bioprinting, bioprinting, and post-bioprinting.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafiee|first=Ashkan|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|date=2016-03-01|title=Printing Technologies for Medical Applications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471491416000149|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|volume=22|issue=3|pages=254–265|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ozbolat|first=Ibrahim T.|date=2015-07-01|title=Bioprinting scale-up tissue and organ constructs for transplantation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779915000967|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=7|pages=395–400|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-bioprinting ===
Pre-bioprinting is the process of creating a model that the printer will later create and choosing the materials that will be used. One of the first steps is to obtain a biopsy of the organ. Common technologies used for bioprinting are [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). To print with a layer-by-layer approach, tomographic reconstruction is done on the images. The now-2D images are then sent to the printer to be made. Once the image is created, certain cells are isolated and multiplied.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These cells are then mixed with a special liquefied material that provides oxygen and other nutrients to keep them alive. In some processes, the cells are encapsulated in cellular spheroids 500μm in diameter. This aggregation of cells does not require a scaffold, and are required for placing in the tubular-like tissue fusion for processes such as extrusion.&lt;ref name="ChuaBio14"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhK3CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Bioprinting: Principles and Applications|author1=Chua, C.K.|author2=Yeong, W.Y.|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co|year=2015|isbn=9789814612104|location=Singapore|pages=296|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}

=== Bioprinting ===
In the second step, the liquid mixture of cells, matrix, and nutrients known as [[bioinks]] are placed in a printer cartridge and deposited using the patients' medical scans.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/01/3d-printed-organs-regenerative-medicine_n_6698606.html|title=How 3D Printing Could End The Deadly Shortage Of Donor Organs|date=1 March 2015|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc|author =Cooper-White, M.|work=Huffpost Science|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a bioprinted pre-tissue is transferred to an incubator, this cell-based pre-tissue matures into a tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Daniel J.|date=2016-01-01|title=Could 3D bioprinted tissues offer future hope for microtia treatment?|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa29537|journal=International Journal of Surgery|language=en-gb|volume=32|pages=43–44|doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.06.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D  bioprinting for fabricating biological constructs typically involves dispensing cells onto a biocompatible scaffold using a successive layer-by-layer approach to generate tissue-like three-dimensional structures.&lt;ref name="harmon2013"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://bioengineering.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Bioengineering/The_Big_Picture/scientificamerican0413-54.pdf |format=PDF |title=A sweet solution for replacing organs |journal=Scientific American |author=Harmon, K. |volume=308 |issue=4 |pages=54–55 |year=2013 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0413-54 |accessdate=17 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217174416/https://bioengineering.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Bioengineering/The_Big_Picture/scientificamerican0413-54.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial organs such as livers and kidneys made by 3D bioprinting have been shown to lack crucial elements that affect the body such as working blood vessels, tubules for collecting urine, and the growth of billions of cells required for these organs. Without these components the body has no way to get the essential nutrients and oxygen deep within their interiors.&lt;ref name="harmon2013" /&gt; Given that every tissue in the body is naturally composed of different cell types, many technologies for printing these cells vary in their ability to ensure stability and viability of the cells during the manufacturing process. Some of the methods that are used for 3D bioprinting of cells are [[photolithography]], magnetic bioprinting, [[stereolithography]], and direct cell extrusion.&lt;ref name="ChuaBio14" /&gt;{{rp|196}}

=== Post-bioprinting ===
The post-bioprinting process is necessary to create a stable structure from the biological material. If this process is not well-maintained, the mechanical integrity and function of the 3D printed object is at risk.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To maintain the object, both mechanical and chemical stimulations are needed. These stimulations send signals to the cells to control the remodeling and growth of tissues. In addition, in recent development, bioreactor technologies&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; have allowed the rapid maturation of tissues, vascularization of tissues and the ability to survive transplants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bioreactors work in either providing convective nutrient transport, creating microgravity environments, changing the pressure causing solution to flow through the cells, or add compression for dynamic or static loading. Each type of bioreactor is ideal for different types of tissue, for example compression bioreactors are ideal for cartilage tissue.&lt;ref name="ChuaBio14" /&gt;{{rp|198}}

== Bioprinting approach ==
Researchers in the field have developed approaches to produce living organs that are constructed with the appropriate biological and mechanical properties. 3D bioprinting is based on three main approaches: Biomimicry, autonomous self-assembly and mini-tissue building blocks.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n8/full/nbt.2958.html|title=3D bioprinting of tissues and organs|last=Murphy|first=Sean|authorlink=|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|authorlink2=|date=August 5, 2014|website=Nature Biotechnology|publisher=|doi=10.1038/nbt.2958|pmid=25093879|volume=32|pages=773–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biomimicry===
The first approach of bioprinting is called biomimicry. The main goal of this approach is to create fabricated structures that are identical to the natural structure that are found in the tissues and organs in the human body. Biomimicry requires duplication of the shape, framework, and the microenvironment of the organs and tissues.&lt;ref name=Yoo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1678889578|title=Bioprinting: 3D printing comes to life|last=Yoo|first=James|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|year=2015|website=Manufacturing Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of biomimicry in bioprinting involves creating both identical cellular and extracellular parts of organs. For this approach to be successful, the tissues must be replicated on a micro scale. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the microenvironment, the nature of the biological forces in this microenvironment, the precise organization of functional and supporting cell types, solubility factors, and the composition of extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

===Autonomous self-assembly===
The second approach of bioprinting is autonomous self-assembly. This approach relies on the physical process of embryonic organ development as a model to replicate the tissues of interest.&lt;ref name=Yoo/&gt; When cells are in their early development, they create their own extracellular matrix building block, the proper cell signaling, and independent arrangement and patterning to provide the required biological functions and micro-architecture.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt; Autonomous self-assembly demands specific information about the developmental techniques of the tissues and organs of the embryo.&lt;ref name=Yoo/&gt; There is a "scaffold-free" model that uses self-assembling spheroids that subjects to fusion and cell arrangement to resemble evolving tissues. Autonomous self-assembly depends on the cell as the fundamental driver of histogenesis, guiding the building blocks, structural and functional properties of these tissues. It demands a deeper understanding of how embryonic tissues mechanisms develop as well as the microenvironment surrounded to create the bioprinted tissues.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

===Mini-tissue===
The third approach of bioprinting is a combination of both the biomimicry and self-assembly approaches, which is called mini tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-12|title=Novel techniques of engineering 3D vasculature tissue for surgical procedures|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002961018307621|journal=The American Journal of Surgery|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2018.06.004|issn=0002-9610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organs and tissues are built from very small functional components. Mini-tissue approach takes these small pieces and manufacture and arrange them into larger framework.&lt;ref name=Yoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

== Printers ==
Akin to ordinary ink printers, bioprinters have three major components to them. These are the hardware used, the type of bio-ink, and the material it is printed on (biomaterials).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
"Bio-ink is a material made from living cells that behaves much like a liquid, allowing people to "print" it in order to create a desired shape. To make bio-ink, scientists create a slurry of cells that can be loaded into a cartridge and inserted into a specially designed printer, along with another cartridge containing a gel known as bio-paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cAqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417 | title=Basic Dental Materials | publisher=JP Medical Ltd | author=John J Manappallil | year=2015 | isbn=9789352500482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In bioprinting, there are three major types of printers that have been used. These are inkjet, laser-assisted, and extrusion printers. Inkjet printers are mainly used in bioprinting for fast and large-scale products.

==Impact==
3D bioprinting contributes to significant advances in the medical field of [[tissue engineering]] by allowing for research to be done on innovative materials called [[biomaterials]]. Biomaterials are the materials adapted and used for printing three-dimensional objects. Some of the most notable bioengineered substances are usually stronger than the average bodily materials, including soft tissue and bone. These constituents can act as future substitutes, even improvements, for the original body materials. [[Alginate]], for example, is an anionic polymer with many biomedical implications including feasibility, strong biocompatibility, low toxicity, and stronger structural ability in comparison to some of the body's structural material.&lt;ref name="asme"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/creating-valve-tissue-using-3d-bioprinting |title=Creating Valve Tissue Using 3-D Bioprinting |author =Crawford, M. |work=ASME.org |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |date=May 2013 |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic hydrogels are also commonplace, including PV-based gels. The combination of acid with a UV-initiated PV-based cross-linker has been evaluated by the Wake Forest Institute of Medicine and determined to be a suitable biomaterial.&lt;ref name="MurphyEval12"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluation of hydrogels for bio-printing applications |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A |author1=Murphy, S.V. |author2=Skardal, A. |author3=Atala, A. |volume=101A |issue=1 |pages=272–84 |year=2013 |doi=10.1002/jbm.a.34326 |pmid=22941807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers are also exploring other options such as printing micro-channels that can maximize the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from neighboring tissues&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt; In addition, the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] aims to print mini organs such as hearts, livers, and lungs as the potential to test new drugs more accurately and perhaps eliminate the need for testing in animals.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

'''Abu al-ʿAlaʾ al-Maʿarri''' ([[Arabic]] {{rtl-lang|ar| أبو العلاء المعري}} ''{{transl|ar|Abū al-ʿAlāʾ al-Maʿarrī}}'', full name {{rtl-lang|ar|أبو العلاء أحمد بن عبد الله بن سليمان التنوخي المعري}} ''{{transl|ar|Abū al-ʿAlāʾ Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Sulaimān al-Tanūẖī al-Maʿarrī}}''; December 973 – May 1057)&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Maarri|title=al-Ma'arri {{!}} Biography {{!}} Britannica.com|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221090622/https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Maarri|archive-date=21 February 2018|dead-url=no|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a blind Arab [[philosopher]], [[poet]], and [[writer]]. Al-Maʿarri held and expressed an [[irreligious]] [[worldview]] which was met with controversy, but in spite of it, he is regarded as one of the greatest [[Arabic poetry|classical Arabic poets]].

Born in the city of [[Maarrat al-Nu'man|Maʿarra]] during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]], he studied in nearby [[Aleppo]], then in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and [[Antioch]]. Producing popular poems in [[Baghdad]], he nevertheless refused to sell his texts. In 1010, he returned to Syria after his mother began declining in health, and continued writing which gained him local respect.

Described as a "[[Pessimism#Philosophical pessimism|pessimistic]] [[freethinker]]", Al-Maʿarri was a controversial [[rationalist]] of his time, citing [[reason]] as the chief source of [[truth]]. He was pessimistic about life, describing himself as "a double prisoner" of [[blindness]] and [[Social isolation|isolation]]. He [[Criticism of religion|attacked the dogmas of religion]], [[Criticism of Islam|criticized]] and [[Apostasy in Islam|rejected Islam]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, and became a [[Deism|Deist]]. He was equally critical and sarcastic about [[Criticism of Judaism|Judaism]], [[Criticism of Christianity|Christianity]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. He advocated [[social justice]] and lived a [[Recluse|secluded]], [[ascetic]] lifestyle. He became a [[vegan]], entreating: "do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals / Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught /
for their young".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm "I No Longer Steal from Nature"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127200338/http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm |date=2016-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Maʿarri held an [[Antinatalism|antinatalist thought]], in line with his general pessimism, suggesting that children should not be born to spare them of the pains and [[suffering]] of life.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

Al-Maʿarri wrote three main works that were popular in his time. Among his works are ''The Tinder Spark'', ''Unnecessary Necessity'', and ''The Epistle of Forgiveness'' (''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran]]'') which may be considered a precursor to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Al-Maʿarri never married and died at the age of 83 in the city where he was born, Maarrat al-Nuʿman. In 2013, a statue of al-Maʿarri located in his Syrian home town was beheaded by jihadists from the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name=statue /&gt;

==Life==
Abu al-ʿAlaʾ was born in [[Maʿarra]], modern [[Maarrat al-Nu'man]], Syria, near the city of [[Aleppo]], in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the third Islamic caliphate, during the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Al-Ma'arri – Visionary Free Thinker, The Genius of Disability, The Essay |website=BBC Radio 3|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wmklk|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the ''Banu Sulayman'', a notable family of Maʿarra, belonging to the larger [[Tanukhids|Tanukh tribe]].&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1940 {{rtl-lang|ar|أبو العلاء المعري: نسبه وأخباره وشعره ومعتقده، تأليف أحمد تيمور باشا، ص.3، ط}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Miguel Asín Palacios, ''Islam and the Divine comedy'', Routledge, 1968, {{ISBN|978-0-7146-1995-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hbHv0Hi-VbsC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=al+maarri p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his ancestors was probably the first [[qadi]] of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the ''Banu Sulayman'' had also been noted as good poets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 11th Century poet who pissed off al-Qaeda {{!}} All About History|url = http://www.historyanswers.co.uk/medieval-renaissance/al-maarri-the-11th-century-poet-that-pissed-off-al-qaeda/|website = historyanswers.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost his eyesight at the age of four due to [[smallpox]]. His later pessimism may be explained by his virtual blindness. Later in his life, he regarded himself as "a double prisoner" which referred to both this blindness and the general isolation that he felt during his life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Philip Khuri Hitti, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6FklfLSxpIkC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=al+ma%27arri#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20ma'arri&amp;f=false Islam, a Way of Life]'', page 147. University of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his teachers in Aleppo were companions from the circle of [[Ibn Khalawayh]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE, when al-Maʿarri was still a child.&lt;ref name="al-Maarri"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Epistle of Forgiveness: Hypocrites, Heretics, and Other Sinners|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iiegAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=epistle+of+forgiveness|publisher = NYU Press|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9780814768969|first = Abu l-Ala|last = al-Maarri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his ''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran|Risālat al-ghufrān]]''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_JY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA932&amp;dq=al-ma+arri+biography|publisher = Brill Archive|date = 1954-01-01|first = Sir Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|last = Gibb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qifti]] reports that when on his way to [[Tripoli]], al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near [[Latakia]] where he listened to debates about [[Hellenistic philosophy]], which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as [[Ibn al-Adim]] deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1004–05 al-Maʿarri learned that his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an [[elegy]] where he praised his father.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Years later he would travel to [[Baghdad]] where he became well received in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He remained in Maʿarra for the rest of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Samuel Margoliouth|D. S. Margoliouth]], [https://archive.org/stream/journalroyalasi69irelgoog#page/n323/mode/1up Abu 'l-ʿAla al-Maʿarri's correspondence on vegetarianism], ''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'', 1902, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Abu-L-Ala al-Maarri Facts|url = http://biography.yourdictionary.com/abu-l-ala-al-maarri|website = biography.yourdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle, in his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Al-Maʿarri never married and died in May 1057 in his home town.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Opposition to religion===
Al-Maʿarri was a [[philosophical skepticism|sceptic]] in his beliefs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35745962|title = Museum of Lost Objects: The unacceptable poet - BBC News|website = BBC News|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; who denounced superstition and dogmatism in religion. This, along with his general negative view on life, has made him described as a [[pessimism|pessimistic]] [[Freethought|freethinker]]. One of the recurring themes of his philosophy was the right of [[reason]] against the claims of custom, tradition, and authority.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Al Ma'arri|url = http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm|website = humanistictexts.org|accessdate = 2015-07-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161127200338/http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm|archivedate = 2016-11-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Maʿarri taught that religion was a "fable invented by the ancients", worthless except for those who exploit the credulous masses.&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Do not suppose the statements of the prophets to be true; they are all fabrications. Men lived comfortably till they came and spoiled life. The sacred books are only such a set of idle tales as any age could have and indeed did actually produce.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 2'', page 190. Kessinger Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al-Maʿarri criticized many of the dogmas of [[Islam]], such as the [[Hajj]], which he called "a pagan's journey".&lt;ref name="Nicholson319"&gt;Nicholson, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', 319.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected claims of any [[divine revelation]] and his creed was that of a philosopher and ascetic, for whom [[reason]] provides a moral guide, and [[virtue]] is its own reward.&lt;ref name="Nicholson317"&gt;Nicholson, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholson323"&gt;Nicholson, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[religious skepticism|religious scepticism]] and positively [[antireligious]] views extended beyond Islam and included both [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], as well. Al-Maʿarri remarked that [[monk]]s in their [[cloister]]s or devotees in their mosques were blindly following the beliefs of their locality: if they were born among [[Magi]]ans or [[Sabians]] they would have become Magians or Sabians.&lt;ref&gt;Reynold A. Nicholson ''Adapted from Studies in Islamic Poetry'' Cambridge University Press, 1921, Cambridge, England. pp. 1–32&lt;/ref&gt; Encapsulating his view on organized religion, he once stated: "The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asceticism and veganism===
Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly desires and living secluded from others while producing his works. He opposed all forms of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Baghdad, while being well received, he decided not to sell his texts, which made it difficult for him to live.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in [[India]] during his time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In al-Maʿarri's later years, he became a [[vegan]], neither consuming meat nor any other animal products. He wrote:
{{poemquote|Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up,
And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals,
Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught
for their young, not noble ladies.
And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs;
for injustice is the worst of crimes.
And spare the honey which the bees get industriously
from the flowers of fragrant plants;
For they did not store it that it might belong to others,
Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts.
I washed my hands of all this; and wish that I
Perceived my way before my hair went gray!&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;}}

=== Antinatalism ===
Al-Maʿarri's fundamental [[pessimism]] is expressed in his antinatalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life.&lt;ref name="statue"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Syrian rebels have taken iconoclasm to new depths, with shrines, statues and even a tree destroyed – but to what end?|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/syrian-rebels-have-taken-iconoclasm-to-new-depths-with-shrines-statues-and-even-a-tree-destroyed--but-to-what-end-9021017.html|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[elegy]] composed by him over the loss of a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life:
{{poemquote|Soften your tread. Methinks the earth's surface is but bodies of the dead,
Walk slowly in the air, so you do not trample on the remains of God's servants.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;}}
Even on al-Maʿarri's [[epitaph]], he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Modern views==
Al-Maʿarri is controversial even today as he was sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the [[al-Nusra Front]], a branch of [[al-Qaeda]], beheaded a statue of al-Maʿarri during the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from the fact that he was a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the [[Assad family]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[France24]], "[http://observers.france24.com/content/20130214-jihadists-behead-statue-syrian-poet-abul-ala-al-maari Jihadists behead statue of Syrian poet Abul Ala al-Maari]", 14 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, al-Maʿarri is sometimes referred to as one of the greatest classical Arab poets. Some have drawn connections between him and the Roman poet [[Lucretius]], calling them progressive for their time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Works ==
{{listen |filename=Poem by Abu 'ala al-Ma'arri ("I no longer steal from nature") read in Arabic.ogg|title=Poem from Luzūmīyāt, read in Arabic|description=The restrictive rhyme and meter can be heard in the start of poem 197&lt;ref&gt;[[Reynold Nicholson]], [https://archive.org/stream/studiesinislamic00nichuoft#page/134/mode/2up Studies in Islamic Poetry and Mysticism], 1921, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early [[Diwan (poetry)|collection]] of his poems appeared as ''The Tinder Spark'' (''Saqṭ al-zand''; {{rtl-lang|ar|سقط الزند}}). The collection of poems included praise of notable people of Aleppo and the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] ruler [[Sa'd al-Dawla]]. It gained great popularity and established his reputation as a poet. A few poems in the collection were about armour.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

A second, more original collection appeared under the title ''Unnecessary Necessity'' (''Luzūm mā lam yalzam'' {{rtl-lang|ar|  لزوم ما لا يلزم أو اللزوميات }}), also simply ''Luzūmīyāt'' or ''Necessities''. The title refers to how al-Maʿarri saw the business of living and alludes to the unnecessary complexity of the rhyme scheme used.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

His third famous work is a work of prose known as ''The Epistle of Forgiveness'' (''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran]]'' {{rtl-lang|ar|رسالة الغفران}}).
The work was written as a direct response to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom al-Maʿarri mocks for his religious views.&lt;ref name="al-Maarri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Epistle of Forgiveness: Volume Two: Hypocrites, Heretics, and Other Sinners|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780814768969|publisher = NYU Press|date = 2014|location = New York|isbn = 9780814768969|first = Abu l-Ala|last = al-Maarri|first2 = Geert Jan Van|last2 = Gelder|first3 = Gregor|last3 = Schoeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, the poet visits [[Jannah|paradise]] and meets the [[Arabic poetry|Arab poets]] of the [[Jahiliyyah|pagan period]], contrary to Muslim doctrine which holds that only those who believe in God can find [[Salvation#Islam|salvation]].
Because of the aspect of [[Bangsian fantasy|conversing with the deceased]] in paradise, the ''Resalat Al-Ghufran'' has been compared to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of Dante&lt;ref&gt;William Montgomery Watt and Pierre Cachia, ''A History of Islamic Spain'', 2nd edition, Edinburgh University Press, 1996, pp. 125–126, {{ISBN|0-7486-0847-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which came hundreds of years after. The work has also been noted to be similar to Ibn Shuhayd's ''Risala al-tawabi' wa al-zawabi'', though there is no evidence that al-Maʿarri was inspired by Ibn Shahayd nor is there any evidence that Dante was inspired by al-Maʿarri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Encyclopedia of Islamic Philosophy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iX-8BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT364&amp;lpg=PT364&amp;dq=al+qifti+al-ma+arri|publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing|date = 2015-07-16|isbn = 9781472569462|first = Oliver|last = Leaman}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algeria]] reportedly banned ''The Epistle of Forgiveness'' from the International Book Fair held in [[Algiers]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''Paragraphs and Periods'' (''Al-Fuṣūl wa al-ghāyāt'') is a collection of homilies. The work has also been called a [[parody]] of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

Ali Ahusan Ihusan is considered by many as one of the many Islamic extremist elements who facilitated the coup of 7 February 2011 in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dhivehisitee.com/parliament/islamic-extremism-maldives-alive-killing/|title = Islamic extremism in the Maldives: alive and killing - Dhivehi Sitee|date = 2012-10-19|website = Dhivehi Sitee|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for creating one of the promotional websites supporting the mass protest held on 23 December 2011 in Maldives which was supported by many Islamists of the Maldives. This mass protest played an important role in overthrowing President [[Mohamed Nasheed]]'s Government on 7 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC]]|date=7 February 2011|title= Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed resigns amid unrest|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16922570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Minivan News]]|year=2011|title=Protests proceed peacefully as a majority defends Islam]|url=http://minivannews.com/politics/protests-proceed-peacefully-as-a-majority-defends-islam-29826|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128090357/http://minivannews.com/politics/protests-proceed-peacefully-as-a-majority-defends-islam-29826|archive-date=28 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Haveeru Daily]]|last=Ahmed|first=F.|date=14 December 2011|title=Police summon protest website developer|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39233|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022211026/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39233|archive-date=22 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Haveeru Daily]]|date= 23 December 2011|title= LIVE: Maldivians gather in Male for 'religious' protests (archived copy)|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352  |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111204729/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352 |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested for 24 hours by [[Maldives Police Service]] after the publication of the website which openly issued death threats to anyone who is against the doctrine of Islam ([[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic Fundamentalism]]) he followed.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://english.sun.mv/675|title = Criminal Court orders release of Ahsan and custody of Hilath|website = Sun Online|access-date = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his lawyer, Mohamed Shaheem Ali Saeed, a Maldivian Islamic scholar infamous for his illicit relations with women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/raajje-tv-runs-footage-of-sheikh-shaheem-and-alleges-sex-scandal-30504|title=Raajje TV runs footage of Sheikh Shaheem and alleges sex scandal {{!}} Minivan News – Archive|website=minivannewsarchive.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitated his release.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Maldives Police Service later stated that they wanted to clarify as to who instructed him to develop the website and as to who published the information on it. On the following day after Ali Ahusan's release, Ali Ahusan modified the page himself  by putting a message on its homepage saying, "we'll come out against you with machetes if you protest."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Haveeru Daily]]'' 23 December 2011| LIVE: Maldivians gather in [[Male']] for 'religious' protests {{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111204729/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352 |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However he was neither arrested or questioned regarding this.

In 2009 he created an Islamic fundamentalist online [[blog]] called ''[[Dhiislam]]'' and it later became a registered online news website for [[Islamic]] news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Naseer|first=I.|date=7 April 2011|title=Dhiislam got registered as a online News|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/102142|work=[[Haveeru Daily]]|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022211038/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/102142|archive-date=22 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he started to print a magazine spreading fundamentalist and extremist doctrine of Islam by the name of Dhiislam. Moreover, he is responsible for publishing the weekly Islamist magazine ''[[Hidhaayathuge Ali]]'' for which he received funding during the term of his lawyer, [[Mohamed Shaheem Ali Saeed]], as the [[Ministry of Islamic Affairs (Maldives)|minister of Islamic Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Risan|first=A.|date=29 August 2012|title=The Islam Ministry has handed over the rights of publishing Islamic weekly magazine to Dhiislam|work=Haveery Daily|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/126389|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022211030/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/126389|archive-date=22 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background of the verse ==
There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent.&lt;ref name="arabic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamawakened.com/|title=Main Menu|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslims, such as [[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminist]] groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for [[Islam and domestic violence|domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="issue" /&gt;

In the Prophet's [[Farewell Sermon|farewell sermon]] as recorded in al-Tabari's History,&lt;ref&gt;al-Tabari, ''History of Al-Tabari, Vol. IX: The Last Years of the Prophet'' tr. Poonawala, I.K. (Albany, NY, 1990) pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly in a ''hadith'' collected by Abu Dawud,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnah.com/abudawud/11/185 sunnah.com] Sunan Abu Dawud 10:1900&lt;/ref&gt; he instructed husbands to beat their wives, but not severely (فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ ''fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih''; literal translation: "beat them, a beating without severity") if their wives commit an immorality or adultery in the husband's absence; according to the cited farewell address sermon in al-Tabari's history, for a wife to allow someone a husband dislikes to "tread" on his bed means to commit sexual indecencies in the absence of the husband. This is obtained not only from the context of the sermon and the hadith cited, but also from the cited Cliff Note 772 in Vol. IX of Al-Tabari's history. Ibn 'Abbas, a companion of the Prophet, is recorded in the Tafsir of al-Tabari for verse 4:34 as saying that beating without severity is using a ''[[siwak]]'' (small tooth cleaning twig) or a similar object.&lt;ref&gt;Tafseer al-Tabari for 4:34 [http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=4&amp;tAyahNo=34&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1 al-tafsir.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are sources that say that [[Muhammad]] himself never hit a woman and forbade it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.systemoflife.com/dawah/character-of-prophet/330-ther-mercy-of-prophet-pbuh-on-women-|title=The Mercy of Prophet PBUH on Women|author=Created on Monday, 08 August 2011 22:48|date=2011-08-08|publisher=Systemoflife.com|accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hadith collected by Abu Dawud, Muhammad told men not to hit their wives on the face.&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2137 cited in Philips, A.A.B. &amp; Jones, J. ''Polygamy in Islam 2nd edition''. International Islamic Publish House (Riyad, 2005) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah. The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated, "hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark."

{{Quote|'''It was narrated that:''' Sulaiman bin Amr bin Ahwas said: “My father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of Allah. He praised and glorified Allah, and reminded and exhorted (the people). Then he said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ”  '''Grade''': '''Sahih''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/urn/1319250|title=Hadith - The Chapters on Marriage - Sunan Ibn Majah - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=sunnah.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}{{Quote|text=`A’isha said: the Messenger of Allah (saws ) never struck a servant or a woman.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sunan Abu Dawood]]'', hadith 4786 / Book 43, Hadith 14 / Book 42, Hadith 4768&lt;/ref&gt;}}In his [[Arabic-English Lexicon|''Arabic-English Lexicon'']], [[Edward William Lane]] notes various definitions for the Arabic word "''Lahada''” such as "''Lahada'' means push, which appears in the first hadith and is rendered as "he struck" in the English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume7/00000204.pdf|title=Lane's Lexicon, p.2676|last=|first=|date=|website=Study Quran|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse:

{{Quote|The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards [[God in Islam|God]], not the husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_251_300/does_the_quran_allow_beating_of.htm|title=DOES THE QUR'AN ALLOW BEATING OF WOMEN?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.irfi.org|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background on the roles of men and women in Islam===
{{Main article|Gender roles in Islam|Women in Islam}}
The Qur'an states that men are the guardians of women, and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives. Women, however, are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property, provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband, provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles.&lt;ref name="hash"&gt;Iman Hashim, ''Reconciling Islam and feminism'', Gender &amp; Development, 1999, vol. 7, issue 1, p 7, {{ISSN|1355-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they are responsible for educating the children, as God has given the one preference over the other. Man is also considered to be the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], [[Tadabbur-i-Qur'an]], 2nd ed., vol. 2, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands. Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity. Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system.&lt;ref name="jsoc"&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], ''[[Mizan]]'', Chapter:The Social Law of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. (Qu'ran 2:228)&lt;ref name=versemen&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Baqarah 2:228|url=http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/2/228/default.htm|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For both men and women, ''zulm''- known in English as actions of 'cruelty' against someone- is explicitly prohibited.&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

====Equality of genders throughout the Qur'an====
The equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text. The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~msaiupui/statuswomen.html|title=Status of Women in Islam|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iupui.edu|publisher=[[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922031909/http://www.iupui.edu/~msaiupui/statuswomen.html|archive-date=2018-09-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings (24:2), and that both men and women are seen as equals under God, and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven (4:124).

{{Quote|text=The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes(Qur’an 24:2)&lt;ref name=verse2&gt;{{cite web|title=An-nur 24:2|url=http://islamawakened.com/quran/24/2/default.htm|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Male and female relationships in the times of the Prophet====

In her book ''Qur'an and Women'', scholar [[Amina Wadud]] writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet.  During this time, women did not have access to the technology that women today have; giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge.  For this reason, Wadud writes, "The Qur'an establishes his [the husband's] responsibility as ''qiwamah'': seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|title=Qur'an and Woman|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet.

Scholar [[Ayesha Chaudhry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-next-frontier-for-muslim-women-finding-their-sovereignty-in/|title=The next frontier for Muslim women: Finding their sovereignty in religion|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=2018-09-22|quote=Contemporary female Muslim scholars – such as Ayesha Chaudhry, Amina Wadud, Asma Barlas, Ziba Mir-Hosseini and Asma Lamrabet...}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that many Muslims have this fundamentally flawed way of examining the text, writing that "Despite the potential for such verses [4:34] to have multiple plain-sense meanings, living Muslim communities place these interpretations in conversation with the pre-colonial Islamic tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaudhry|first1=Ayesha|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples from the Prophet====
The late [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabataba'i]] (1903-1981 AD) provides the following exegesis on 4:34 from both [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'ite]] sources in his [[Mizan]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ash’ath ibn ‘Abdil-Malik from [[al-Hasan]] that he said: “A woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband that he had slapped her. The Messenger of Allah said: “Retribution”. Then Allah revealed the verse, “Men are maintainers of women… (4:34); so the woman returned without retribution [ad-Durr 'l-munthur, as-Suyuti]. [as-Suyuti] has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too.  Some of them say that the Messenger of Allah said: “I wanted one thing (retribution), but Allah decided otherwise"...there were some instances where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from it, but it was only in his administrative order, not in matters of the law ordained by him for his people, otherwise it would have been an invalid nullification...the Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud: "How can you embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with?".  It is narrated also in [[al-Kafi]] through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Ja’far (Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]) that he said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “What! Does one of you hit his wife, and then attempt to embrace her?".  Countless such statements are found in the traditions; and one may understand from them the Islamic views on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir al-Mizan, by al-Allamah as-Sayyid Muhammad Husayn at-Tabataba-i, translated by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi. V. 8, p.217,220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Al-Tabari]] (839-923 AD) wrote that, "The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives, or against a slave, nor against any person at all." In fact, when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives, rather than beat him, Al-Tabari accounts that he instead, "stayed away from his wives for 29 nights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mernissi|first1=Fatimea|title=The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam|date=1991|publisher=Perseus Books|location=Cambridge|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates and discussion about the text==
In response to ''nushûz'', admonishment, leaving wives in their beds and ''idribihunna'' are permitted. Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] (see [[An-Nisa, 34#Interpretation of the word "nushûz"|''nushûz'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Saleem Shahzad, ''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novtitl2y1.html Can a Husband force his Wife to wear the Hijab?]'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance - Monthly Islamic Journal]], 11(11), November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 1: Authority of men and its reasons===
This allots men authority over women due to following reasons:
1: Because God has given some more strength than others.
2: Because men spent from their property to support women i.e., 
clothing, residence, and sustenance.The word ''qawwamun''  is also used at Al-Quran 4:134. Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness.

====1: God has favoured some over others====
One of the reason men being ''qawwamun'' over women is that God has favoured some over others.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

====2: Men are responsible of maintenance of women====
Second reason of men being ''qawwamun'' over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideislam.wisc.edu/2010/09/controlling-women-is-not-part-of-islam/|title=Controlling women is not part of Islam|last=|first=|date=2010-09-22|work=Inside Islam|access-date=2018-09-22|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2: Characters of pious women===
The verse declares that pious women are:
1: Obedient
2: Guarding the unseen as God prescribes.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

====1: Obedient or ''Qanitat''====
The verse commands women to be ''qanitat''. The term has been used in {{Cite Quran|33|35|s=ns}} to refer to men and women alike, who are obedient to God. Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband, while others assert that it means obedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|title=Qur'an and Women|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some "scholars" agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife, and her first loyalty is to God.&lt;ref name = Kecia&gt;{{Cite book

====2: Guarding the unseen====
''Hafizat'' is derived from ''hafaz'' meaning to guard. The subjective form is ''hafiz'' meaning a person who guards and ''hafizah'' meaning she who guards (feminine). ''Hafizat'' is plural of ''hafizah'' (both being feminine).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

===Part 3: Rebellious women and advice===
And those whose rebellion (''nushûz'') is feared. It is advised
1: to admonish them
2: to leave them alone in beds
3: to beat them

* the term "''nushûz''" (نُشُوز) is translated as "disloyalty and ill-conduct" by Yusuf Ali, "rebellion" by [[Marmaduke Pickthall|Pickthall]] and "desertion" by [[M. H. Shakir|Shakir]]. Other scholars{{Who|date=September 2018}} have drawn on hadiths{{Which|date=September 2018}} to interpret the meaning of the word.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====1: to admonish them ====
The first response to ''nushuz'' is ''wā'z'' (‘وَعَظ’), meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour.&lt;ref name="jsoc"/&gt; There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Ammar" /&gt;

====2: to leave them alone in beds ====

According to tafsir ibn kathir, a well known commentary of Quran. He describes in his exegesis.

{{quote|The Sunan and Musnad compilers recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said, "O Allah's Messenger! What is the right that the wife of one of us has on him'' The Prophet saido feed her when you eat, cloth her when you buy clothes for yourself, refrain from striking her face or cursing her, and to not abandon her, except in the house.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=672&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Should the ''nushuz'' continue, the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife. Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action.&lt;ref name="Ammar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ammar|first=Nawal H.|date=May 2007|title=Wife Battery in Islam: A Comprehensive Understanding of Interpretations|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801207300658|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=13|issue=5|pages=519–523|doi=10.1177/1077801207300658|pmid=17478676|via=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====3:  to beat them (''iḍribūhunna'' and ''daraba'')====
According to tafsir ibn Kathir.

{{quote|Muslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet said;
(Fear Allah regarding women, for they are your assistants. You have the right on them that they do not allow any person whom you dislike to step on your mat. However, if they do that, you are allowed to discipline them lightly. They have a right on you that you provide them with their provision and clothes, in a reasonable manner.) Ibn `Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=672&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term ''iḍribūhunna'' (usually translated, 'beat them') in 4:34 comes from the root ''ḍaraba'' (Arabic: ضرب).&lt;ref&gt;ضرب defined in Lane, E.W. (1863-93) ''An Arabic English Lexicon'' Reprinted in Beirut: Librarie du Liban, 1968, p.1777 [http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume5/00000062.pdf View on studyquran.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used many times in the Quran to mean: to hit, to travel the earth, to set up, to condemn and to give examples. Thus scholars interpret ''iḍribūhunna'' in different ways. Whereas many interpret it to mean "to strike", others hold that the term means "to separate".&lt;ref name="Ammar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-29/koran-434-islam-domestic-violence/10112916|title='A licence to treat his wife badly': Why women fear Koran 4.34|date=2018-08-29|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an action is to be administered only if neither the husband nor the wife are willing to divorce.&lt;ref name="shaf" /&gt; In the context of this verse, iḍribūhunna has also been interpreted to mean "go to bed with them",&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qur'an: a Contemporary Translation by Ahmed Ali, Princeton University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; the Arabic root word "''daraba''" being taken from the prosaic example "the stud-camel covered the she-camel".&lt;ref&gt;Raghib, ''Al-Mufridat fi Gharib Al-Qur'an''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''daraba'' is translated by Yusuf Ali as "beat," but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Qur'an to convey different meanings. The phrase, "''Daraba Allah mathalan''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|11|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; translates to, "Allah ''gives'' or ''sets'' an example."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/252662926|title=Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective|last=Amina|first=Wadud|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780198029434|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=76|oclc=252662926}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this word might be compared to the way "to strike" is used in English, which can mean, "to strike a pose," or "to strike a bargain," not just referring to the physical act of hitting something. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/873805718|title=Domestic violence and the Islamic tradition : ethics, law and the Muslim discourse on gender|last=Chaudhry|first=Ayesha|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=|isbn=9780191669897|edition=1st|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=13|oclc=873805718}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''daraba'' is also intentional, because a different Arabic word exists, "''daraba''" which is translated to, "to strike repeatedly or intensely."&lt;ref name="Darraba"&gt;{{cite book|title=Qur'an and Woman|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown]] resumes the situation:&lt;blockquote&gt;If a wife exhibited egregious disobedience (nushuz) such as uncharacteristically insulting behavior, leaving the house against the husband's will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex (without medical grounds), the husband should first admonish her to be conscious of God and proper etiquette. If she did not desist from her behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done. In effect,  any  physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executed.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 276-277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many jurists interpret ''iḍribūhunna'' as "more or less symbolic."&lt;ref name="asad"&gt;[[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One such authority is the earliest [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]], [[Ibn Abbas]].[http://www.themodernreligion.com/women/w_abuse_badawi.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Others,{{Who|date=September 2018}} however, argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an "energetic demonstration" of the love of the husband. But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife.&lt;ref name="shaf" /&gt;

The 2007 translation ''[[The Sublime Quran]]'' by Laleh Bakhtiar translates ''iḍribūhunna'' not as 'beat them' but as 'go away from them'. The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shari‘ah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context. The Prophet never beat his wives, and his example from the [[Sunnah]] informs the interpretation of this verse. This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses, such as 4:101 which contains word ''darabtum'' (derivation from ''daraba''), demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word ''daraba'' to have meaning 'going' or 'moving'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Islamic scholar Tahir-ul-Qadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran "''Irfan-ul-Quran''": "(...)and (if they still do not improve) turn away from them, striking a temporary parting.(...)".&lt;ref name="irfan-ul-quran.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Minhaj Internet Bureau |url=http://www.irfan-ul-quran.com/quran/english/contents/sura/cols/0/ar/1/ur/1/ra/1/en/1/sid/4/ |title=an-Nisā’ (Women) |publisher=Irfan-ul-Quran |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is further supported by the fact that the word "''darabtum''" is used in the same chapter (specifically, in {{Cite Quran|4|94|s=ns}}), which means to "go abroad" in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word ("''daraba''") as "''idribuhunna''" in 4:34.&lt;ref name="4:94"&gt;Osama Abdallah. [http://www.islamawareness.net/Wife/beating1.html ''Systematic comparison with 4:94''] Islamawareness.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Woman in the Shade of Islam'' by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman al-Sheha stated that a man may "beat" his wife only if it occurs without "hurting, breaking a bone, leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face, at any cost."

A widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that, as a last resort, men can "scourge" their wives.&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

Some jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Qur'an, it is still discountenanced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] comments that "Whenever the Prophet (peace be on him) permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet (peace be on him) directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body." "Towards Understanding the Qur'an" Translation by Zafar I. Ansari from "Tafheem Al-Qur'an" (specifically, commentary on 4:34) by Syed Abul-A'ala Mawdudi, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The medieval jurist ash-[[Shafi'i]], founder of one of the main schools of ''[[fiqh]]'', commented on this verse that "hitting is permitted, but not hitting is preferable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[S]ome of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i) are of the opinion that it is just barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify this opinion by the Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem." [[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] scholar [[Reza Aslan]], stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men."&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

The Islamic prophet Mohammed himself, according to Islamic tradition, never once struck a woman in argument. This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text.&lt;ref name="issue"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|last=Nomani|first=Asra Q.|date=October 22, 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922033032/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261_2.html?noredirect=on|archive-date=2018-09-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim feminist writer Asra Q. Nomani has argued, {{quote|Indeed, Muslim scholars and leaders have long been doing what I call "the 4:34 dance" -- they reject outright violence against women but accept a level of aggression that fits contemporary definitions of domestic violence.&lt;ref  name=issue/&gt;}}Feminist writer Amina Wadud writes in her book, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Inside the Gender Jihad: Women's Reform in Islam&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/muslim/diff-verse.html|title=Understanding a Difficult Verse, Qur'an 4:34 {{!}} Muslim Sexual Ethics {{!}} The Feminist Sexual Ethics Project {{!}} Brandeis University|website=www.brandeis.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|No community will ever be exactly like another.  Therefore no community can be a duplicate of that original community.  The Quran never states that as a goal.

Nada Ibrahim of the [[University of South Australia]] states that three words—''qawwamuna'', ''nushuzahunna'', and ''wadribuhunna''—are mistranslated due to the lack of equivalent English alternatives. She explains that in particular, English language Qur'an commentators have not agreed to merely one translation of the word ''wadribuhunna'' and that "A clear disagreement exists among English-language Qur’an commentators on how best to translate this word. All translations give an explicit negative connotation, and – when read out of context – further exacerbates any misunderstanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-islam-actually-says-about-domestic-violence-77245|title=Explainer: what Islam actually says about domestic violence|last=Ibrahim|first=Nada|date=2017-06-12|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915054520/https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-islam-actually-says-about-domestic-violence-77245|archive-date=2018-09-15|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 4: When they obey ===
In quran’s Commentary exegisis of this part of verse is as following:

{{quote|(but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance),) meaning, when the wife obeys her husband in all that Allah has allowed, then no means of annoyance from the husband are allowed against his wife. Therefore, in this case, the husband does not have the right to beat her or shun her bed. Allah's statement,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=671&lt;/ref&gt;}}
==== 1: not to seek ways against them   ====
In this part of verse God says that if women obey then man are not allowed to make excuses against them..

=== Part 5: Glorification of God ===
Ibn Kathir in the commentary of this part of verse says

{{quote|Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.) reminds men that if they transgress against their wives without justification, then Allah, the Ever Most High, Most Great, is their Protector, and He will exert revenge on those who transgress against their wives and deal with them unjustly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=671&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== 1: Exalted ====
It means that God is exalted.
==== 2: Great ====
It means that God is great.

'''Aníbal López (A-1 53167)''', full name Aníbal Asdrúbal López Juarez (April 13, 1964 &amp;ndash; September 26, 2014) was an [[artist]] and a native of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/en/artist/a-1-53167-22887/profile.html Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career creating [[figurative art]] influenced by [[expressionism]]. He has worked in several media, including acrylic and oil on canvas, photography, and video. In the 1990s he and other Guatemalan artists such as [[Regina José Galindo]] began creating art "actions" or [[live art]], a combination of [[street art]], [[performance art]], [[minimalism]], and [[conceptual art]]. A-1 53167 is the code name (his Guatemalan ID card number) that Aníbal López has used since 1997 to sign many of his art actions as a way to show how he questions codes of information regarding identity.The effect is to erase an ethnic-specific sense of belonging and perhaps to resist the impulse of art consumers to categorize him in preconceived categories such as indigenous, [[Maya peoples|Mayan]], or Guatemalan.

==Actions==
Aníbal López, or A-1 53167, creates street interventions that combine the rationalist detachment of [[conceptual art]] with the political bravado of Latin American guerrilla fighters. In "El Préstamo" ("The Loan"), a gun-toting A-1 53167 staged an armed robbery by attacking an unwitting passer-by. The stolen money was used to fund an exhibition at the "Contexto" art space, thus transforming the victim into an art sponsor and the spectator into an accomplice in the event.&lt;ref name="kunstaspekte.de"&gt;http://www.kunstaspekte.de/index.php?tid=9324&amp;action=termin Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gasart.it"&gt;http://www.gasart.it/gallery/en/006/opere_9.html Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 at the 49th [[Venice Biennale]], he exhibited photographs from a 2000 action in which he scattered the contents of ten large bags of coal across the main boulevard in the center of Guatemala City where a military parade was to take place.&lt;ref name="gasart.it"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/n.paradoxa/venice.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515022114/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/n.paradoxa/venice.htm |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }} Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mutualart.com/ArtistHistory/A_1_53167/6512769A884B362C?Promo=C35E0524722A8338 Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The action was intended to remind the military of the crimes and massacres it committed against the country's citizens during the 36-year civil war when more than 200 000 civilians were killed - mostly members of the indigenous Maya Indian community. The military committed human rights abuses including some acts that have been judged to be genocide, as documented by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Rigoberta Menchú]] and others. In an interview with Biennale organizers, the artist stated, "There is a close relationship namely, between the coal, the massacres, and the military, because this material can always be found in the mass graves. In most cases, houses and corpses are burned. I knew that the coal would be cleared away before the parade. I scattered it at about two o'clock in the morning, and at seven o'clock it had already been removed. But there were still traces left. I wanted the military to walk over these traces, and to be able to take photos of the marching army. Since I work with signs that have somehow established themselves, in this case the coal that points to the massacres and the mass graves, I refer with the action to existing problems, without becoming too obvious. It wasn't my intention for the spectators to perceive these signs, but rather that the military itself should notice them."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universes-in-universe.de/car/venezia/bien49/plat1/e-a1-53167-int.htm Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At the opening of his Berlin exhibition in 2004, he presented another action, this time aimed at the art world. He arranged for six security guards to prevent the public from any contact with the art, the objects, and other people, all under a prohibition sign that said "Do it right".&lt;ref name="kunstaspekte.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prometeogallery.com"&gt;http://www.prometeogallery.com/eventsdetnew.asp?lang=en&amp;num=7 Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For "One Ton Of Books Dumped On Reform Avenue," a dump truck stopped in the middle of [[Guatemala City]]'s Avenida La Reforma, a major artery, dumped its load of used books, and drove away. Local traffic was disrupted and had to maneuver around the pile of seeming rubbish. Pedestrians joined the fracas, moving into the boulevard to pick through the abandoned books, taking anything that interested them. The action was memorialized in a video.&lt;ref name="stewarthomesociety.org"&gt;http://stewarthomesociety.org/blog/?p=1269 Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Lopez paid smugglers to transport empty boxes into Brazil, resulting in the action, "Sculpture Composed of 500 Boxes of Contraband Transported from Paraguay to Brazil," also memorialized in a video.&lt;ref name="stewarthomesociety.org"/&gt;

In "Roll of 120m x 4m Black Plastic Hanging From The Incienso Bridge" (2003), Lopez attached a long ribbon of plastic to a bridge, where it then floated in the air above a valley.&lt;ref name="stewarthomesociety.org"/&gt;

He is represented by Prometeogallery, [[Milan]], [[Italy]], and The 9.99 Gallery, [[Guatemala City]].

'''Astrochicken''' is the name given to a [[thought experiment]] expounded by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]]. In his book ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a manned craft could. He attributed the general idea to [[John von Neumann]], based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled ''The General and Logical Theory of Automata''. Dyson expanded on von Neumann's [[Automata theory|automata theories]] and added a biological component to them.

Astrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram [[spacecraft]] unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, [[artificial intelligence]] and modern microelectronics&amp;mdash;a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an [[ion drive]] engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet's vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by [[bombardier beetle]]s. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.

The term "astrochicken" does not occur in Dyson's earliest essays regarding [[Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes|von Neumann-inspired automata]]. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in [[Adelaide, Australia]] on the subject of space exploration with [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc121802.html|title=Cambridge Conference Correspondence|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audience member called out "Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken." and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.

Today, Dyson's Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist [[Rodney Brooks]] has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of [[NASA]] for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. Physicist and noted author [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his work ''Hyperspace'', "Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets".

As a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson's theories, such as the [[Dyson sphere]] and the [[Dyson tree]], have become popular in the scientific and [[science fiction]] communities. The more whimsically named "Astrochicken" has not achieved this same level of fame.

==Truncated antenna==
The [[chlorophyll]] (Chl) antenna size in green algae is minimized, or truncated, to maximize photobiological solar conversion efficiency and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The truncated Chl antenna size minimizes absorption and wasteful dissipation of sunlight by individual cells, resulting in better light utilization efficiency and greater photosynthetic productivity by the green alga mass culture.&lt;ref name="KirstGarcia-Cerdan2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirst|first1=H.|last2=Garcia-Cerdan|first2=J.

==History==
In 1939  [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the algae he was studying, ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54456,00.html Algae: Power Plant of the Future?]&lt;/ref&gt; He never discovered the cause of this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts to discover it. In the late 1990s, [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that if the algae culture medium is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chlamydomonas moewusii]]'' is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="YangGuarnieri2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Shihui|last2=Guarnieri|first2=Michael T|last3=Smolinski|first3=Sharon|last4=Ghirardi|first4=Maria|last5=Pienkos|first5=Philip T|title=De novo transcriptomic analysis of hydrogen production in the green alga Chlamydomonas moewusii through RNA-Seq|journal=Biotechnology for Biofuels|volume=6|issue=1|year=2013|pages=118|issn=1754-6834|doi=10.1186/1754-6834-6-118|pmid=23971877|pmc=3846465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
It would take about 25,000 square kilometre algal farming to produce biohydrogen equivalent to the energy provided by gasoline in the US alone.  This area represents approximately 10% of the area devoted to growing soya in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/energy-fuels/mg18925401.600-growing-hydrogen-for-the-cars-of-tomorrow.html Growing hydrogen for the cars of tomorrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioreactor design issues==
* Restriction of photosynthetic hydrogen production by accumulation of a [[proton gradient]].
* Competitive inhibition of photosynthetic hydrogen production by carbon dioxide.
* Requirement for bicarbonate binding at [[photosystem II]] (PSII) for [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficient photosynthetic activity]].
* Competitive drainage of electrons by oxygen in algal hydrogen production.
* Economics must reach competitive price to other sources of energy and the economics are dependent on several parameters.
* A major technical obstacle is the efficiency in converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in molecular hydrogen.

Attempts are in progress to solve these problems via [[bioengineering]].

The [[conservation ethic]] is based on the findings of conservation biology.

== Origins ==

The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in La Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and [[Michael E. Soulé]] with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including [[Kurt Benirschke]], Sir [[Otto Frankel]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], and [[Jared Diamond]]. The meeting was prompted by the concern over [[tropical deforestation]], disappearing species, eroding [[genetic diversity]] within species.&lt;ref&gt;J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. Kat Williams . 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference and proceedings that resulted&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80/&gt; sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soulé, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance [[conservation genetics]] as a new field at the time. [[Jared Diamond]], who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and [[Thomas Lovejoy]], who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at [[World Wildlife Fund]], felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term  ''conservation biology'', complementing Frankel's conception and coining of "conservation genetics",  to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soulé and Wilcox wrote conceived the agenda for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6–9, 1978, titled ''First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology'', in which the program described "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and [[National Environmental Policy Act|policy]].  The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, [[conservation behavior]] and conservation physiology.&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooke |first1=S.

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of [[biodiversity loss]], species [[extinction]]s, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to [[Sustainability|sustain]] the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession [[advocate]] for a global response to [[Holocene extinction|the current biodiversity crisis]] based on [[morals]], [[ethics]], and scientific [[reason]]. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.&lt;ref name="Soule86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;

=== Natural resource conservation ===

Conscious efforts to conserve and protect ''global'' biodiversity are a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|title=Biodiversity protection and preservation|website=www.ffem.fr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018140452/http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hardin G |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–8 |date=December 1968 |pmid=5699198 |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175825/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection.

From this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; For example, the Alaskan [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] peoples and the [[Haida people|Haida]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of [[sockeye salmon]]. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Mason, Rachel and Judith Ramos. (2004).

The Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary clinics.

Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings. There are examples in the [[Tao]], [[Shinto]], [[Hindu]], [[Islamic]] and [[Buddhist]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Primack 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Primack | first =Richard B. | title = A Primer of Conservation Biology, 3rd ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year= 2004 | pages = 320pp. | isbn = 0-87893-728-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture [[land degradation]]: "What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, E., and H.

Wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised.&lt;ref name="Evans97"&gt;{{cite book |author=Evans, David |title=A history of nature conservation in Britain |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-14491-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as early as AD 680 a [[wildlife sanctuary]] was founded on the [[Farne Islands]] by [[St Cuthbert]] in response to his religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;

=== Early naturalists ===

[[File:White Gerfalcons.jpg|thumb|right|upright|White [[gyrfalcon]]s drawn by [[John James Audubon]] ]]

[[Natural history]] was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in [[Germany]], 250 in [[Great Britain]], 250 in the [[United States]], and 300 in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Farber00"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Finding order in nature: the naturalist tradition from Linnaeus to E.

Before Charles Darwin set sail on HMS ''Beagle'', most people in the world, including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology|last=Mader|first=Sylvia|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-0-07-802426-9|location=New York, NY|page=262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species' ancestors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist.

By the early 19th century [[biogeography]] was ignited through the efforts of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/biology/macisaac/55-437/intro.htm|title=Introduction to Conservation Biology and Biogeography|website=web2.uwindsor.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors.&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt; Although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and [[Environmental organization|conservation organizations]], their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt;

=== Conservation movement ===
{{Main article|Conservation movement}}

The modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period particularly in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cloyd"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cloyd | first = E.

Scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first1=Greg |last1=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=978-1-139-43460-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

The term ''conservation'' came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as [[timber]], fish, game, [[topsoil]], [[pasture]]land, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of [[forest]]s ([[forestry]]), [[wildlife]] ([[wildlife refuge]]), parkland, [[wilderness]], and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. This period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies.

[[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892, and the [[New York Zoological Society]] was set up in 1895. A series of [[National Park|national forests and preserves]] were established by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] from 1901 to 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-and-conservation.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation - Theodore Roosevelt National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223142405/http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-02-23 |title=Environmental timeline 1890–1920 |website=runet.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1916 National Parks Act, included a 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir, which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Davis96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Peter |title=Museums and the natural environment: the role of natural history museums in biological conservation |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7185-1548-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Canadians|Canadian]] civil servants, including [[Charles Gordon Hewitt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/HEWI1885.htm |title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: Charles Gordon Hewitt |website=people.wku.edu |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Harkin]] spearheaded the movement toward [[wildlife conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;For a review and introduction to the history of wildlife conservation and preservation in Canada, see {{cite book |author=Foster, Janet |title=Working for wildlife: the beginning of preservation in Canada |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1997 |isbn=0-8020-7969-5 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8KLFOFGXvYQC&amp;dq=Janet+Foster+working+for+wildlife&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global conservation efforts ===

In the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in [[big cat]] conservation in [[South America]] led by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Rabinowitz, ''Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve'', Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., [[Carl E. Akeley]], [[Archie Carr]] and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carr, Marjorie Harris |author2=Carr, Archie Fairly |title=A naturalist in Florida: a celebration of Eden |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05589-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm|title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: (Henry) Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|website=www.wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- The timings of these two sentences contradict each other. --&gt; Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the [[Virunga Mountains]] and observed the [[mountain gorilla]] in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading [[Albert I of Belgium]] to act in defense of the [[mountain gorilla]] and establish [[Albert National Park]] (since renamed [[Virunga National Park]]) in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, C., 1923. ''In Brightest Africa'' New York, Doubleday. 188-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the [[Endangered Species Act]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. § 136, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA) of Canada, [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s developed in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531-|title=16 U.S. Code § 1531 - Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1966) and [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+42USC4321|title=US Government Publishing Office - FDsys - Browse Publications|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul R. |last1=Krausman |first2=A. J. T. |last2=Johnsingh |year=1990 |title=Conservation and Wildlife Education in India |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=342–7 |jstor=3782224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the [[urban wildlife|urban conservation]] movement. A local organization was established in [[Birmingham]], [[UK]], a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a [[grassroots movement]], its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] originated in 1985.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

By 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227072411/http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently many countries began programmes of [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] and the [[Society for the Environment]].

Since 2000, the concept of [[landscape scale conservation]] has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.

Ecology has clarified the workings of the [[biosphere]]; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The [[Human overpopulation|burgeoning human population]] and associated [[agriculture]], [[industry]], and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gore, Albert |title=Earth in the balance: ecology and the human spirit |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1992 |isbn=0-395-57821-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring extinction rates ===
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right}}

Extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists measure and apply [[statistical measure]]s of [[fossil record]]s,&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regan |first1=Helen M. |last2=Lupia |first2=Richard |last3=Drinnan |first3=Andrew N. |last4=Burgman |first4=Mark A. |title=The Currency and Tempo of Extinction |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2001 |pmid=18707231 |doi=10.1086/317005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rates of [[habitat loss]], and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKenzie |first1=Darryl I. |last2=Nichols |first2=James D. |last3=Hines |first3=James E. |last4=Knutson |first4=Melinda G. |last5=Franklin |first5=Alan B. |title=Estimating Site Occupancy, Colonization, and Local Extinction When a Species Is Detected Imperfectly |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |issue=8 |year=2003 |pages=2200–2207 |jstor=3450043 |doi=10.1890/02-3090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain such estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balmford |first1=Andrew |last2=Green |first2=Rhys E. |last3=Jenkins |first3=Martin |title=Measuring the changing state of nature |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=326–30 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00067-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur|first1=R.H.|author-link1= Robert MacArthur|last2=Wilson|first2=E.O.|author-link2= E. O. Wilson|title=[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]] |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2001 |isbn=0-691-08836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current [[background extinction rate]] is estimated to be one species every few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raup DM |title=A kill curve for Phanerozoic marine species |journal=Paleobiology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=1991 |pmid=11538288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)&lt;ref name="Wilson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edward O. | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; to how many have received a [[Binomial nomenclature|species binomial]] (estimated range: 1.5-8 million).&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond simply noting its existence.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of [[vertebrate]]s, 5% of [[invertebrate]]s and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as [[endangered]] or [[threatened]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630054235/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from [[critically endangered]] or threatened for the purpose of these statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Better knowledge is being constructed by [[The Plant List]] for actual numbers of species.

=== Systematic conservation planning ===

Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Margules CR, Pressey RL |title=Systematic conservation planning |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6783 |pages=243–53 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10821285 |doi=10.1038/35012251 |url=http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225013400/http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
# Identify conservation goals for the planning region
# Review existing conservation areas
# Select additional conservation areas
# Implement conservation actions
# Maintain the required values of conservation areas

Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for [[Grant (money)|grant proposals]] or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf Amphibian Conservation Action Plan] is one example. See also: {{cite journal |vauthors=Chan KM, Shaw MR, Cameron DR, Underwood EC, Daily GC |title=Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Services |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e379 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17076586 |pmc=1629036 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of [[Geographic Information Systems]] to assist in the decision making process.

=== Conservation physiology: a mechanistic approach to conservation ===

Conservation physiology was defined by [[Steven J. Cooke]] and colleagues as: 'An integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes, plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations, restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support tools, and manage natural resources.'&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"/&gt;  Conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines.

=== Conservation biology as a profession ===

The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[economics]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[anthropology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt; Within biology, [[conservation genetics]] and [[evolution]] are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.

Is conservation biology an [[Objectivity (science)|objective science]] when biologists [[advocate]] for an inherent [[Ecosystem valuation|value in nature]]? Do conservationists introduce [[bias]] when they support policies using qualitative description, such as [[Habitat degradation|habitat ''degradation'']], or ''healthy'' [[ecosystem]]s? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of [[science]], [[reason]], [[logic]], and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] in their conservation management plans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt; This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.

There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manolis JC, Chan KM, Finkelstein ME, Stephens S, Nelson CR, Grant JB, Dombeck MP |title=Leadership: A new frontier in conservation science |journal=Conserv. Biol. |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an [[adaptive management]] approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopoldleadership.org/content/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217231043/http://leopoldleadership.org/content|archive-date=2007-02-17|title=Aldo Leopold Leadership Program|publisher=Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===

Conservation may be classified as either [[in-situ conservation]], which is protecting an endangered species in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], or [[ex-situ conservation]], which occurs outside the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Medicinal plants conservation and enterprise development |journal=Medicinal Plants - International Journal of Phytomedicines and Related Industries |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=79–95 |doi=10.5958/j.0975-4261.1.2.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a [[Environmentalism|preservationist]] method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans.{{quote|text=|sign=|source=|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence the diversity of tetrapods will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."}}

=== Ethics and values ===
{{See also|Conservation (ethic)|Land ethic}}

Conservation biologists are [[interdisciplinary]] researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states&lt;ref name="Chan08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Kai M. A. |title=Value and Advocacy in Conservation Biology: Crisis Discipline or Discipline in Crisis? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18254846 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00869.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.

A conservationist may be inspired by the ''resource conservation ethic'',&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|15}} which seeks to identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt;{{Rp|13}} In contrast, some conservation biologists argue that nature has an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that is independent of [[anthropocentric]] usefulness or [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|3,12,16–17}} Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. [[Aldo Leopold]] was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=== Conservation priorities ===

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Vié09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Vié  | first1 = J.

Concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes, such as migration, and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species, including genetic, population and ecosystem diversity.&lt;ref name="Molnar04"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Molnar |first = J. |last2 = Marvier |first2 = M. |last3 = Kareiva |first3 = P. |title = The sum is greater than the parts |journal = Conservation Biology |volume = 18 |issue = 6 |pages = 1670–1 |year = 2004 |url = http://www.environmental-expert.com/Files%5C8392%5Carticles%5C9961%5CTheSumIsGreaterthantheParts.pdf |doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x |ref = harv }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive, systematic, and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity. While the [[conservation status]] of species is employed extensively in conservation management,&lt;ref name="Vié09" /&gt; some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Gaston10"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1182818 | last=Gaston | first=K.J. | title=Valuing common species | journal=Science | volume=327 | issue=5962 | pages=154–155 | year=2010 | isbn= | pmid=20056880 | ref=harv|bibcode = 2010Sci...327..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearns10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kearns |first1=Carol Ann |year=2010 |title=Conservation of Biodiversity |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=7 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/conservation-of-biodiversity-13235087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of [[sustainability|sustaining biodiversity]],&lt;ref name="CREOcare"&gt;Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "[http://creo.amnh.org/care.html Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?]". URL accessed July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving ''[[biodiversity hotspots]]'', some scientists (e.g)&lt;ref name="Luck03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luck |first1=Gary W. |last2=Daily |first2=Gretchen C. |last3=Ehrlich |first3=Paul R. |title=Population diversity and ecosystem services |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=331–6 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00100-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conservation organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], argue that it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in ''biodiversity coldspots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Will R. |last2=Brandon |first2=Katrina |last3=Brooks |first3=Thomas M. |last4=Costanza |first4=Robert |last5=da Fonesca |first5=Gustavo A. B. |last6=Portela |first6=Rosimeiry |title=Global Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=10 |year=2007 |pages=868–73 |doi=10.1641/B571009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Molnar J, Marvier M, Karieva P |title=The sum is greater than the parts |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1670–1 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Norman |last2=Mittermeier |first2=Russell A. |last3=Mittermeier |first3=Cristina G. |last4=da Fonseca |first4=Gustavo A.

Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity.

=== Strategic species concepts ===

==== Keystone species ====
{{Main article|Keystone species}}

Some species, called a ''keystone species'' form a central supporting hub unique to their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/keystone-species/|title=keystone species|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=National Geographic Society|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') through its interaction with [[sea otter]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[kelp]]. [[Kelp bed]]s grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the [[food chain]]. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to [[overhunting]], sea urchin populations [[urchin barren|grazed unrestricted]] on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas''. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this was later questioned by Turvey and Risley,&lt;ref name=pmid17148336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turvey |first1=S.T |last2=Risley |first2=C.L |title=Modelling the extinction of Steller's sea cow |journal=Biology Letters |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=94–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17148336 |pmc=1617197 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that hunting alone would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.

==== Indicator species ====
{{Main article|Indicator species}}

An ''indicator species'' has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as [[amphibian]]s with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to [[wetland]]s, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a ''[[Miner's canary|miner's canary]]''. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest [[silviculture]] treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a [[pesticide]] may impart on the health of an ecosystem.

Government regulators, consultants, or [[NGO]]s regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landres PB, Verner J, Thomas JW |title=Ecological Uses of Vertebrate Indicator Species: A Critique |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=316–28 |year=1988 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/2007_rule/1988_12_Landres%20et%20al%201988.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997&lt;ref name="Meffe97"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carroll, C.

==== Umbrella and flagship species ====
{{Main article|Umbrella species|Flagship species}}

An example of an ''umbrella species'' is the [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]], because of its lengthy [[Insect migration|migrations]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value. The monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as ''flagship species'', which are species, such as the [[giant panda]], the [[blue whale]], the [[tiger]], the [[mountain gorilla]] and the monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes threatens other species of chief concern.&lt;ref&gt;Fedriani JM, García L, Sanchéz M, Calderon J, and C Ramo. 2017.

=== Status of oceans and reefs ===
{{See also|Ocean|Coral reef|Marine pollution|Marine conservation}}

Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. ''[[Coral bleaching]]'' is caused by a mixture of [[environmental stress]]es, including increases in ocean temperatures and [[Ocean acidification|acidity]], causing both the release of [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] and death of corals.&lt;ref name="ausSOE01"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia state of the environment 2001: independent report to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, VIC, Australia |year=2001 |isbn=0-643-06745-0 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/report/pubs/part03b.pdf |author=Australian State of the Environment Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years.

The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic [[natural resource]]s. A concern is that the majority of all [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species will not be able to [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[acclimate]] in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society. 2005.

The prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "[...] 90% of all of the large (average approximately ≥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean"&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving [[multi-cellular organism]]s with only [[microbes]] left to dominate [[marine ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

=== Groups other than vertebrates ===

The greatest bulk of [[biomass]] on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |title=The Little Things That Run the world (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates) |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=344–6 |jstor=2386020 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1987.tb00055.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samways |first1=Michael J. |title=Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=258–82 |doi=10.1007/BF00056672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Society, National Geographic. "Honeybee." National Geographic. National Geographic, n.d.

However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 [[beekeeper]]s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. [[Pest (organism)|Pests]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[global warming]] are all being considered as possible causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holden |first1=C. |title=Ecology: Report Warns of Looming Pollination Crisis in North America |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |page=397 |year=2006 |pmid=17053115 |doi=10.1126/science.314.5798.397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stokstad |first1=E. |title=Entomology: The Case of the Empty Hives |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5827 |pages=970–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17510336 |doi=10.1126/science.316.5827.970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation biology of parasites ===
{{Main article|Conservation biology of parasites}}

A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.

'''''Contemptus mundi''''', the "contempt of the [[world (theology)|world]]" and worldly concerns, is a theme in the intellectual life of both [[Classical Antiquity]] and of [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi]&lt;/ref&gt; both in its mystical vein and its ambivalence towards secular life, that figures largely in the Western world's [[history of ideas]]. In inculcating a turn of mind that would lead to a state of serenity untrammeled by distracting material appetites and feverish emotional connections, which the Greek philosophers called ''[[ataraxia]]'', it drew upon the assumptions of [[Stoicism]] and a [[neoplatonism]] that was distrustful of deceptive and spurious appearances. In the familiar rhetorical polarity in Hellenic philosophy between the active and the contemplative life, which Christians, who expressly rejected "the World, [[Flesh (theology)|the Flesh]] and the Devil",&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is late (the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' but the triad draws on "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world." (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt; might exemplify as the way of [[Martha]] and the way of [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]], ''contemptus mundi'' assumed that only the contemplative life was of lasting value and the world an empty shell, a [[vanity]].

==In classical antiquity==
In the classical canon, [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', essays on achieving [[Stoicism|Stoic]] stability of emotions, with rhetorical subjects such as "Contempt of death", was taken up definitively by [[Boethius]] in his ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|Consolations of Philosophy]]'', during the troubled closing phase of [[Late Antiquity]]. The Latin tradition of dispraise of the public world adapted by Christian moralists, focused especially on the [[Fortuna|fickleness of Fortune]], and the evils exposed in the Latin [[satire]] became a mainstay of Christian penitential literature.

==In the Patristic tradition==
Among early Christians, [[Eucherius of Lyon]], an aristocratic and high-ranking ecclesiastic in the fifth-century Christian Church of Gaul, wrote to his kinsman a widely read letter ''de contemptu mundi'', an expression of the despair for the present and future of the world in [[End time|its last throes]]. Contempt for the world provided intellectual underpinnings for the retreat into [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]]: when [[Saint Florentina]], of the prominent Christian family of Hispania, founded her convent, her rule written by her brother [[Leander of Seville]] explicitly cited contempt for the world: ''Regula sive Libellus de institutione virginum et de contemptu mundi ad Florentinam sororem''.

==Medieval ''contemptus mundi''==
The medieval ''[[Trope (literature)|trope]]'' of ''contemptus mundi'', drawing upon these converging traditions, pagan philosophy and Christian [[Asceticism|ascetic theology]],&lt;ref&gt;Noted by John V. Fleming, "The best line in Ovid and the woest", in Robert G. Benson, Susan Janet Ridyard, eds. ''New Readings of Chaucer's Poetry'', 2003:56.&lt;/ref&gt; was fundamental to a medieval education.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bultot, "La Cartula et l'enseignement du mépris du monde dans les écoles et les universités médiévale", ''Studi Medievali'' ser. iii '''8''' (1967:787-834); Bultot's full-length study ''La doctrine du mépris du monde: Christianisme et valeur humaine: I.  [[Peter Damian|Pierre Damien]]'' (1963) was criticised in Francesco Lazzari, "S. Pierre Damien]et le 'contemptus mundi' à propos d'un livre récent", ''Revue d'ascétique et de mystique'' '''40''' (1964:185-96).&lt;/ref&gt; A classic Christian expression is [[Bernard of Cluny]]'s bitter 12th-century satire ''[[De contemptu mundi]]'', founded in a deep sense of the transitory nature of secular joys and the abiding  permanency of the spiritual life. His text made one of the ''[[Auctores octo morales]]'', the "eight moral authors" that formed the central texts of medieval pedagogy.

In the early 12th century, when [[Adelard of Bath]] (c. 1080 - 1152) allegorized two contrasting figures to dispute ''De eodem et diverso''; they were ''Philosophia'' and ''Philocosmia'', "love of wisdom" and the "love of the world".&lt;ref&gt;It is noteworthy that while Fleming's interpretation comes from his view that ''contemptus mundi'' was an embedded practice in the study of medieval literature, Bridget K. Balint in her ''Ordering Chaos: The Self and the Cosmos in Twelfth-Century Latin Prosimetrum'' (2009) argues that Adelard in fact does not despise the world per se, see p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Adelard's contemporary, [[Henry of Huntington]], in the dedicatory letter to his ''Historia Anglorum'' referred in passing to "those who taught the contempt of the world in schools".&lt;ref&gt;Adelard ("very elegant but also commonplace") and Henry of Huntinton are both noted in Fleming 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An aspect of contempt for this world reflects upon the ephemerality of all life, expressed in the literary rhetorical question of ''[[ubi sunt]]''. Even as worldly a pope as [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] could write an essay "On the Misery of the Human Condition",  ''De miseria humanae conditionis'', which [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is reputed to have rendered in English, in a translation now lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Companion''.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme had political ramifications within the Roman Church, as it was inextricably bound up with questions of  [[apostolic poverty]]&lt;ref&gt;Jan G. J. van den Eijnden discusses the controversial wealth of the Church in [[Thomas Aquinas]]' day, ''Poverty on the Way to God: Thomas Aquinas on evangelical poverty'' 1994:8 ff ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was roundly condemned, in the instance of the [[Humiliati]], as [[Heresy|heretical]].

The waning of the dominant attitude of ''contemptus mundi'' that had informed elite culture, a development that gathered impetus during the second half of the 14th century, was a precursor to the emergence of the modern secular ethos, encouraging men to study material things with greater lucidity than before, as [[Georges Duby]] has observed, noting the turn taken in painting and sculpture toward the [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] delineation of aspects of material life.&lt;ref&gt;Duby, "Preface" in ''A History of Private Life: II.Revelations of the Medieval World'' (1988:x).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern culture==
The theme of ''contemptus mundi'' continued to inform European poetry into the [[Early Modern]] period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Facts on File Companion to British Poetry before 1600'', Volume 1 (2008) ''s.v.'' "Contemptus mundi"; the theme is the subject of Mary Evelina McSorley, ''The 'Contemptus mundi' motif in Elizabethan Poetry'', 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contemptus mundi'' is a running theme in the poetry of [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]],&lt;ref&gt;William L. Furstenburg, ''Contemptus mundi in William Drummond of Hawthornden'', 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and Burton's ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' and the devotional verse of [[Jeremy Taylor]] would serve as further examples. The recurrence of [[bubonic plague]] offered a concrete visitation of the frailty of this life for devotional texts, as early as [[John Donne]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest B. Gilman, ''Plague Writing in Early Modern England'', 2009:201&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times ''contemptus mundi'' has been criticized as a ''pastoral of fear'' by the historian [[Jean Delumeau]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions]&lt;/ref&gt; and M. B. Pranger found the ''trope'' "Speaking of God after Auschwitz" to function as a "modern form of ''contemptus mundi''".&lt;ref&gt;Pranger, ''The Artificiality of Christianity: Essays on the Poetics of Monasticism'' 2003:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cruelty''' is indifference to [[suffering]] or [[pleasure]] in inflicting suffering. [[Sadomasochism|Sadism]] can also be related to this form of action or concept. Cruel ways of inflicting suffering may involve [[violence]], but affirmative violence is not necessary for an act to be cruel. For example, if a person is drowning and begging for help and another person is able to help with no cost or risk, but is merely watching with disinterest or perhaps mischievous amusement, that person is being cruel—rather than violent.

[[George Eliot]] stated that "cruelty, like every other [[vice]], requires no motive outside itself; it only requires opportunity."&lt;ref name="brainyquote1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/cruelty.html#z9RzI1eSJFMuWO4h.99 |title=Cruelty Quotes |publisher=BrainyQuote |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] stated that "the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell."&lt;ref name="brainyquote1"/&gt; [[G. K. Chesterton|Gilbert K. Chesterton]] stated that "cruelty is, perhaps, the worst kind of sin. Intellectual cruelty is certainly the worst kind of cruelty."&lt;ref name="brainyquote1"/&gt;

The word has [[metaphor]]ical uses, for example "[[Emyn Muil|The cliffs]] remained cruel." (i.e. unclimbable when they desperately needed to be climbed) in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Usage in law==
The term ''cruelty'' is often used in [[law]] and [[criminology]] with regard to the treatment of animals, children, spouses, and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?typed=cruelty%20&amp;type=1 |title=Cruelty |publisher=Law.com |accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[cruelty to animals]] is discussed, it often refers to ''unnecessary suffering.''

[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] arises in the study of the [[Lorenz Oscillator]], a dynamical system.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''dynamical system''' is a system in which a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] describes the [[time]] dependence of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in a [[Manifold|geometrical space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock [[pendulum]], [[fluid dynamics|the flow of water in a pipe]], and [[population dynamics|the number of fish each springtime in a lake]].

At any given time, a dynamical system has a [[State (controls)|state]] given by a [[tuple]] of [[real numbers]] (a [[vector space|vector]]) that can be represented by a point in an appropriate [[state space]] (a geometrical [[manifold]]). The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state.  Often the function is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], that is, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strogatz |first=S. H. |year=2001 |title=Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: with Applications to Physics, Biology and Chemistry |location= |publisher=Perseus }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Katok |first2=B. |last2=Hasselblatt |title=Introduction to the Modern Theory of Dynamical Systems |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-34187-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some systems are [[stochastic system|stochastic]], in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.

In [[physics]], a '''dynamical system''' is described as a "particle or ensemble of particles whose state varies over time and thus obeys differential equations involving time derivatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/dynamical-systems|publisher=Springer Nature|accessdate= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a prediction about the system’s future behavior, an analytical solution of such equations or their integration over time through computer simulation is realized.

The study of dynamical systems is the focus of [[dynamical systems theory]], which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as mathematics, physics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=P.|last2=et.al.|title=Dynamics of Self-Adjusting Systems With Noise|journal=Chaos 15|date=2005|doi=10.1063/1.1953147|bibcode=2005Chaos..15c3902M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gintautas|first1=V.|last2=et.al.|title=Resonant forcing of select degrees of freedom of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics|journal=J.

Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of [[chaos theory]], [[logistic map]] dynamics, [[bifurcation theory]], the [[self-assembly]] process, and the [[edge of chaos]] concept.

==Overview==
The concept of a dynamical system has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]].  There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is an implicit relation that gives the state of the system for only a short time into the future.  (The relation is either a [[differential equation]], [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]] or other [[Time scale calculus|time scale]].)  To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times&amp;mdash;each advancing time a small step.  The iteration procedure is referred to as ''solving the system'' or ''integrating the system''. If the system can be solved, given an initial point it is possible to determine all its future positions, a collection of points known as a ''[[trajectory]]'' or ''[[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]''.

Before the advent of [[computers]], finding an orbit required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could be accomplished only for a small class of dynamical systems.  Numerical methods implemented on electronic computing machines have simplified the task of determining the orbits of a dynamical system.

For simple dynamical systems, knowing the trajectory is often sufficient, but most dynamical systems are too complicated to be understood in terms of individual trajectories.  The difficulties arise because:
* The systems studied may only be known approximately&amp;mdash;the parameters of the system may not be known precisely or terms may be missing from the equations.  The approximations used bring into question the validity or relevance of numerical solutions.  To address these questions several notions of stability have been introduced in the study of dynamical systems, such as [[Lyapunov stability]] or [[structural stability]].  The stability of the dynamical system implies that there is a class of models or initial conditions for which the trajectories would be equivalent. The operation for comparing orbits to establish their [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]] changes with the different notions of stability.
* The type of trajectory may be more important than one particular trajectory.  Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may wander through many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class.  Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the qualitative study of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. [[Linear dynamical system]]s and [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem|systems that have two numbers describing a state]] are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.
* The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation points]] where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes.  For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the [[Turbulence|transition to turbulence of a fluid]].
* The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random.  In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories.  The averages are well defined for [[ergodic theory|ergodic systems]] and a more detailed understanding has been worked out for [[Anosov diffeomorphism|hyperbolic systems]]. Understanding the probabilistic aspects of dynamical systems has helped establish the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]] and of [[chaos theory|chaos]].

==History==

Many people regard [[Henri Poincaré]] as the founder of dynamical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Philip. "Poincaré, celestial mechanics, dynamical-systems theory and "chaos"." ''Physics Reports'' 193.3 (1990): 137-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré published two now classical monographs, "New Methods of Celestial Mechanics" (1892–1899) and "Lectures on Celestial Mechanics" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]], which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.

[[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamic system.

In 1913, [[George David Birkhoff]] proved Poincaré's "[[Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem|Last Geometric Theorem]]", a special case of the [[three-body problem]], a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his ''[http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll9/ Dynamical Systems]''Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the [[ergodic theorem]]. Combining insights from [[physics]] on the [[ergodic hypothesis]] with [[measure theory]], this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of [[statistical mechanics]]. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.

[[Stephen Smale]] made significant advances as well.  His first contribution is the [[Horseshoe map|Smale horseshoe]] that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems.  He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.

[[Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky]] developed [[Sharkovsky's theorem]] on the periods of [[discrete dynamical system]]s in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the [[real line]] has a [[periodic point]] of period&amp;nbsp;3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.

==Basic definitions==
{{Main|Dynamical system (definition)}}
A dynamical system is a [[manifold]] ''M'' called the phase (or state) space endowed with a family of smooth evolution functions Φ&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; that for any element of ''t'' ∈ ''T'', the time, map a point of the [[phase space]] back into the phase space.  The notion of smoothness changes with applications and the type of manifold.  There are several choices for the set&amp;nbsp;''T''.  When ''T'' is taken to be the reals, the dynamical system is called a ''[[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]''; and if ''T'' is restricted to the non-negative reals, then the dynamical system is a ''semi-flow''. When ''T'' is taken to be the integers, it is a ''cascade'' or a ''map''; and the restriction to the non-negative integers is a ''semi-cascade''.

=== Examples ===
The evolution function Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is often the solution of a ''differential equation of motion''

:  &lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = v(x). &lt;/math&gt;

The equation gives the time derivative, represented by the dot, of a trajectory ''x''(''t'') on the phase space starting at some point&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[vector field]] ''v''(''x'') is a smooth function that at every point of the phase space ''M'' provides the velocity vector of the dynamical system at that point. (These vectors are not vectors in the phase space&amp;nbsp;''M'', but in the [[tangent space]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;M'' of the point&amp;nbsp;''x''.)  Given a smooth Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;, an autonomous vector field can be derived from it.

There is no need for higher order derivatives in the equation, nor for time dependence in ''v''(''x'') because these can be eliminated by considering systems of higher dimensions.  Other types of [[differential equations]] can be used to define the evolution rule:

: &lt;math&gt; G(x, \dot{x}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is an example of an equation that arises from the modeling of mechanical systems with complicated constraints.

The differential equations determining the evolution function Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; are often [[ordinary differential equation]]s; in this case the phase space ''M'' is a finite dimensional manifold.  Many of the concepts in dynamical systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds&amp;mdash;those that are locally [[Banach space]]s&amp;mdash;in which case the differential equations are [[partial differential equation]]s.  In the late 20th century the dynamical system perspective to partial differential equations started gaining popularity.

==Linear dynamical systems==
{{Main|Linear dynamical system}}
Linear dynamical systems can be solved in terms of simple functions and the behavior of all orbits classified.  In a linear system the phase space is the ''N''-dimensional Euclidean space, so any point in phase space can be represented by a vector with ''N'' numbers.  The analysis of linear systems is possible because they satisfy a [[superposition principle]]: if ''u''(''t'') and ''w''(''t'') satisfy the differential equation for the vector field (but not necessarily the initial condition), then so will ''u''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''w''(''t'').

===Flows===
For a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], the vector field Φ(''x'') is an [[affine transformation|affine]] function of the position in the phase space, that is,
:  &lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = \phi(x) = A x + b,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''A'' a matrix, ''b'' a vector of numbers and ''x'' the position vector.  The solution to this system can be found by using the superposition principle (linearity).
The case ''b''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 with ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is just a straight line in the direction of&amp;nbsp;''b'':

: &lt;math&gt;\Phi^t(x_1) = x_1 + b t. &lt;/math&gt;

When ''b'' is zero and ''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 the origin is an equilibrium (or singular) point of the flow, that is, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then the orbit remains there.
For other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the [[matrix exponential|exponential of a matrix]]: for an initial point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

:  &lt;math&gt;\Phi^t(x_0) = e^{t A} x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

When ''b'' = 0, the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A'' determine the structure of the phase space.  From the eigenvalues and the [[eigenvector]]s of ''A'' it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin.

The distance between two different initial conditions in the case ''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 will change exponentially in most cases, either converging exponentially fast towards a point, or diverging exponentially fast.  Linear systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the case of divergence. For nonlinear systems this is one of the (necessary but not sufficient) conditions for [[chaos theory|chaotic behavior]].

{{-}}

===Maps===
A [[Discrete-time dynamical system|discrete-time]], [[Affine transformation|affine]] dynamical system has the form of a [[matrix difference equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} =  A x_n + b, &lt;/math&gt;
with ''A'' a matrix and ''b'' a vector.  As in the continuous case, the change of coordinates ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;1&lt;/sup&gt;''b'' removes the term ''b'' from the equation. In the new [[coordinate system]], the origin is a fixed point of the map and the solutions are of the linear system ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
The solutions for the map are no longer curves, but points that hop in the phase space.  The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of points that map into themselves under the action of the map.

As in the continuous case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ''A'' determine the structure of phase space.  For example, if ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is an eigenvector of ''A'', with a real eigenvalue smaller than one, then the straight lines given by the points along ''α''&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''α''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R''', is an invariant curve of the map. Points in this straight line run into the fixed point.

There are also many [[List of chaotic maps|other discrete dynamical systems]].

==Local dynamics==
The qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative):   a ''singular point'' of the vector field (a point where&amp;nbsp;''v''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a ''periodic orbit'' is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop.  It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.

===Rectification===
A flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple.  If ''y'' is a point where the vector field ''v''(''y'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around ''y'' where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude.  This is known as the rectification theorem.

The ''rectification theorem'' says that away from [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]] the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line.  The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space ''M'' the dynamical system is ''integrable''.  In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space.  There may be singular points in the vector field (where ''v''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.

===Near periodic orbits===
In general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used.  Poincaré developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the orbit γ and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to ''v''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  These points are a [[Poincaré section]]  ''S''(''γ'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the [[Poincaré map]] ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S'', for points starting in ''S'' and returning to&amp;nbsp;''S''.  Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincaré section is a fixed point of the Poincaré map ''F''. By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The Taylor series of the map is ''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''J''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;O(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so a change of coordinates ''h'' can only be expected to simplify ''F'' to its linear part

: &lt;math&gt; h^{-1} \circ F \circ h(x) = J \cdot x.&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the conjugation equation.  Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems.  Poincaré first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition.  If ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt; are the eigenvalues of ''J'' they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others.  As terms of the form ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ndash; ∑ (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function ''h'', the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.

===Conjugation results===
The results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of ''J'' and the degree of smoothness required from ''h''.  As ''J'' does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers.  When the eigenvalues of ''J'' are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''F'' is called ''[[Hyperbolic fixed point|hyperbolic]]'' and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called ''elliptic''.

In the hyperbolic case, the [[Hartman–Grobman theorem]] gives the conditions for the existence of a continuous function that maps the neighborhood of the fixed point of the map to the linear map ''J''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''. The hyperbolic case is also ''structurally stable''.  Small changes in the vector field will only produce small changes in the Poincaré map and these small changes will reflect in small changes in the position of the eigenvalues of ''J'' in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.

The [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM)]] theorem gives the behavior near an elliptic point.

==Bifurcation theory==
{{Main|Bifurcation theory}}
When the evolution map Φ&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; (or the [[vector field]] it is derived from) depends on a parameter μ, the structure of the phase space will also depend on this parameter. Small changes may produce no qualitative changes in the [[phase space]] until a special value ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is reached.  At this point the phase space changes qualitatively and the dynamical system is said to have gone through a bifurcation.

Bifurcation theory considers a structure in phase space (typically a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], a periodic orbit, or an invariant [[torus]]) and studies its behavior as a function of the parameter&amp;nbsp;''μ''. At the bifurcation point the structure may change its stability, split into new structures, or merge with other structures.  By using Taylor series approximations of the maps and an understanding of the differences that may be eliminated by a change of coordinates, it is possible to catalog the bifurcations of dynamical systems.

The bifurcations of a hyperbolic fixed point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of a system family ''F&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be characterized by the [[eigenvalues]] of the first derivative of the system ''DF''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of ''DF&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. For more information, see the main article on [[Bifurcation theory]].

Some bifurcations can lead to very complicated structures in phase space. For example, the [[Ruelle&amp;ndash;Takens scenario]] describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a [[strange attractor]]. In another example, [[Bifurcation diagram|Feigenbaum period-doubling]] describes how a stable periodic orbit goes through a series of [[period-doubling bifurcation]]s.

==Ergodic systems==
{{Main|Ergodic theory}}
In many dynamical systems, it is possible to choose the coordinates of the system so that the volume (really a ν-dimensional volume) in phase space is invariant.  This happens for mechanical systems derived from Newton's laws as long as the coordinates are the position and the momentum and the volume is measured in units of (position)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(momentum).  The flow takes points of a subset ''A'' into the points Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'') and invariance of the phase space means that
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{vol} (A) = \mathrm{vol} ( \Phi^t(A) ). &lt;/math&gt;
In the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]], given a coordinate it is possible to derive the appropriate (generalized) momentum such that the associated volume is preserved by the flow.  The volume is said to be computed by the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville measure]].

In a Hamiltonian system, not all possible configurations of position and momentum can be reached from an initial condition. Because of energy conservation, only the states with the same energy as the initial condition are accessible.  The states with the same energy form an energy shell Ω, a sub-manifold of the phase space. The volume of the energy shell, computed using the Liouville measure, is preserved under evolution.

For systems where the volume is preserved by the flow, Poincaré discovered the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|recurrence theorem]]: Assume the phase space has a finite Liouville volume and let ''F'' be a phase space volume-preserving map and ''A'' a subset of the phase space.  Then almost every point of ''A'' returns to ''A'' infinitely often.  The Poincaré recurrence theorem was used by [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]] to object to [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s derivation of the increase in entropy in a dynamical system of colliding atoms.

One of the questions raised by Boltzmann's work was the possible equality between time averages and space averages, what he called the [[ergodic hypothesis]].  The hypothesis states that the length of time a typical trajectory spends in a region ''A'' is vol(''A'')/vol(Ω).

The ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of [[statistical mechanics]] and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems.  [[Bernard Koopman|Koopman]] approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of [[functional analysis]].  An observable ''a'' is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height).  The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/sup&gt;.  This introduces an operator ''U''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[transfer operator]],

: &lt;math&gt; (U^t a)(x) = a(\Phi^{-t}(x)). &lt;/math&gt;

By studying the spectral properties of the linear operator ''U'' it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of&amp;nbsp;Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involving&amp;nbsp;''U''.

The Liouville measure restricted to the energy surface Ω is the basis for the averages computed in [[Statistical mechanics|equilibrium statistical mechanics]].  An average in time along a trajectory is equivalent to an average in space computed with the  [[Statistical mechanics#Canonical ensemble|Boltzmann factor exp(&amp;minus;β''H'')]].  This idea has been generalized by Sinai, Bowen, and Ruelle (SRB) to a larger class of dynamical systems that includes dissipative systems. [[SRB measure]]s replace the Boltzmann factor and they are defined on attractors of chaotic systems.

===Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos===
{{Main|Chaos theory}}
Simple nonlinear dynamical systems and even piecewise linear systems can exhibit a completely unpredictable behavior, which might seem to be random, despite the fact that they are fundamentally deterministic. This seemingly unpredictable behavior has been called ''[[chaos theory|chaos]]''. [[Anosov diffeomorphism|Hyperbolic systems]] are precisely defined dynamical systems that exhibit the properties ascribed to chaotic systems.  In hyperbolic systems the tangent space perpendicular to a trajectory can be well separated into two parts: one with the points that converge towards the orbit (the ''stable manifold'') and another of the points that diverge from the orbit (the ''unstable manifold'').

This branch of [[mathematics]] deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a [[steady state]] in the long term, and if so, what are the possible [[attractor]]s?" or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

Note that the chaotic behavior of complex systems is not the issue. [[Meteorology]] has been known for years to involve complex&amp;mdash;even chaotic&amp;mdash;behavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The [[logistic map]] is only a second-degree polynomial; the [[horseshoe map]] is piecewise linear.

=== Geometrical definition ===
A dynamical system is the tuple &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathcal{M}, f , \mathcal{T}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; a manifold (locally a Banach space or Euclidean space), &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; the domain for time (non-negative reals, the integers, ...) and ''f'' an evolution rule ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;) such that ''f&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] of the manifold to itself. So, f is a mapping of the time-domain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; into the space of diffeomorphisms of the manifold to itself. In other terms, ''f''(''t'') is a diffeomorphism, for every time ''t'' in the domain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; .

=== Measure theoretical definition ===
{{main|Measure-preserving dynamical system}}
A dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a [[sigma-algebra]], the quadruplet (''X'', Σ, μ, τ). Here, ''X'' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], and Σ is a [[sigma-algebra]] on ''X'', so that the pair (''X'', Σ) is a measurable space. μ is a finite [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the sigma-algebra, so that the triplet (''X'', Σ, μ) is a [[measure space|probability space]]. A map τ: ''X'' → ''X'' is said to be [[measurable function|Σ-measurable]] if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has &lt;math&gt;\tau^{-1}\sigma \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. A map τ is said to '''preserve the measure''' if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has &lt;math&gt;\mu(\tau^{-1}\sigma ) = \mu(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;. Combining the above, a map τ is said to be a '''measure-preserving transformation of ''X'' ''', if it is a map from ''X'' to itself, it is Σ-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The quadruple (''X'', Σ, μ, τ), for such a τ, is then defined to be a '''dynamical system'''.

The map τ embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the [[iterated function|iterates]] &lt;math&gt;\tau^n=\tau \circ \tau \circ \cdots\circ\tau&lt;/math&gt; for integer ''n'' are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map τ is understood to be a finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.

Internal strain within a metal is either [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]].  In the case of elastic strain this is observed as a distortion of the [[crystal lattice]], in the case of plastic strain this is observed by the presence of dislocations –the displacement of part of the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. Such strain effects can result in unwanted cracking of the material, as is the case with residual plastic strain. In other cases deliberate introduction of plastic strain results in a strengthening of the material and other performance enhancing behaviors, for example in the manufacture of [[Semiconductor|semi-conductors]] and [[solar cell]]s.

== Fundamentals ==
As an illustration, if you hang a weight on a spring it extends in direct proportion to the load.  That is the same effect that occurs in the elastic deformation part of the standard tensile test.

This is normally written as:  applied stress = [[Young's modulus|Young’s modulus]]  *  strain

That is: σ        =           Y                 *    e

Commonly known as:  [[Hooke’s Law]].

Where stress is a force ( a vector property) divided by the cross sectional area. Strain is the displacement (also a vector quantity) per unit length and is also a vector quantity.  A vector quantity requires three numbers to define its direction.  It can be represented then by a number with one subscript, Ui, where i takes the numbers 1 to 3.  Such a quantity can be referred to as a tensor of rank 1.  The rank refers to the number of subscripts.  The strains e can be formally written as a differential or gradient.  So that, if u1 was the extension in the x direction, we would write the strain as δu1/δx.   
We also know that when we stretch something it gets thinner in the direction normal to the stretch direction.  This is the [[Poisson effect]] and the ratio extension /contraction is the [[Poisson ratio]].

== Illustration of Poisson effect ==
{{Missing information|images|date=May 2018}}

This coupling of the different strains caused in a sample by the application of a stress classifies strain as a tensor property. In fact it is a second rank tensor because it consists of a 3 x 3 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and hence each element will need two suffixes to locate any one of its components in the matrix, i.e. eij.  The physical significance of this will be apparent later.

We set up a co-ordinate system based on some reference axes in the sample.  A convenient one for the case illustrated above is included in the figure.  It is a right handed system when reading the axes in the sequence x y z.   If we start at a point on the positive x axis and rotate towards the positive y axis in a clockwise direction then positive  z axis would point in the direction of movement of a right handed screw.

To keep it as clear as possible which reference axes we are using it is conventional often to refer to these axes as 1 2 and 3.  This is to allow easy identification of the strain terms as depicted in the tenor 3x3 matrix. The directions 1 2 and 3 are synonymous with the x y and z directions.

In a sample strained in tension ([[Tension (physics)|uni-axial tension]]) as in the above figure, the z axis has been strained in the positive sense, i.e. it becomes longer.  The strain term for this deformation is e33. The applied force is acting in the z direction.  The first subscript refers to the axis that is being strained and the second to the direction it is being strained.  Thus the first subscript 3 refers to the strain is occurring along the z axis and the second subscript to the fact that the strain is in the direction of the z axis.  Likewise for the strains e11 and e 22.   The strains e 11,  e 22 and e 33 are known as tensile or normal strains.
The force along z can also be resolved onto inclined planes causing these planes to shear resulting in [[shear strain]]s. It will also cause the crystal to rotate (called a rigid body rotation).  To illustrate this I include a more general deformation, as shown next.

Illustration of tensile and shear strains plus rotation in x z plane.
x y z right handed axis system, u1 u2 u3 displacements in x y z directions.
The figure shows only deformation, that is change of length and direction, in the x z plane for clarity. The tensile strains e11 and e 33 are shown plus the two strains e 13 and e 31.  Note  the differential form of these latter strains as shown in the figure.  Let us consider for now that there is no rotation. Then e 13 and e 31 represent the shear components alone and are in fact equal. The first of the subscript in both of e 13 and e31 signifies the plane that is sheared and the second component the axis defining the direction of shear.  Hence the first shear component e13 describes the shear of the plane normal to the x axis and in the z direction whilst the second, e31 defines the shear of the plane normal to the z axis in the x direction. 
Simple (mechanical) shear versus physics
Now some of you may say, ‘surely shear of a plane distorts a crystal’ as shown in the left sketch below.

Simple shear. (Engineering) Shear  (Physics)
Well this is true and is how engineers express it.  As shown in the right hand figure, the shear strain as used in engineering is twice that used by physicists.  Engineering strain measures the total strain in the xz  plane and is often given the symbol γ.  On the other hand,  e31, which remember  =  δu3/δx and in this case where there is no rotation, is simply the average of the strains on the z and x faces i.e. ε31 = ½(e31+e13). Note I have changed the symbol from e31 to ε31.  The symbol e31 refers to the strains as measured and may contain a rotational component. The symbol ε31 refers specifically to the shear strain component included in the e31 term.   You may need to note this when involved in discussion with engineers.  For consistency the Greek symbol ε is used instead of e for the tensile strains as well.
Tensors in Strain
Tensors: Geometric entities introduced into mathematics and physics to extend the notion of scalars, (geometric) vectors, and matrices. Many physical quantities are naturally regarded not as vectors themselves, but as correspondences between one set of vectors and another.

== Techniques for measuring strain ==
There is a wide variety of strain measurement techniques, depending on the resolution and precision required.  Larger scale methods include the use of [[strain gauge]]s.  For higher precision [[Raman scattering|Raman Spectroscopy]] and recently emerging techniques such as [[EBSD]] are used.
Traditional measurement of residual strain in metals is through x-ray diffraction.  Unfortunately this has major shortcomings in today’s applications and material’s development environment:
* Probe size (width) is too large for nano-scale material structures.
* Probe size (depth) is typically too large for nano-scale material structures.
Result: Diffraction volume is too large and individual grains (crystal lattices) cannot be observed or measured accurately.

The advanced application of the alternative diffraction technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) overcomes these limitations.  Software applications such as [http://www.vantagesoftwareinc.com/wp/products/ CrossCourt3] have enabled practical measurement at the nanoscale quite possible.

== Electron backscatter diffraction ==
The technique of [[Electron backscatter diffraction|EBSD]] produces patterns from the metal’s [[crystallography]] that consist of a well-defined geometric arrangement of bright bands edged by sharp lines.  These are known as Kikuchi bands and Kikuchi lines respectively. Elastic strain changes the width of these bands, and the angles between them plus a general rotation of the entire pattern.   The total result is a distortion that involves dilation of the crystal lattice (or unit cell) as a result of tensile and compressive strains, shear strains and rotation.  A complete description of internal elastic strain requires that all these crystallographic parameters be measured.  This is a benefit of advanced or high accuracy EBSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Angus J.|last2=Britton|first2=T.

The '''Fei–Ranis model of economic growth''' is a dualism model in [[Development economics|developmental economics]] or [[welfare economics]] that has been developed by [[John C. H. Fei]] and [[Gustav Ranis]] and can be understood as an extension of the [[Dual Sector model|Lewis model]]. It is also known as the Surplus Labor model. It recognizes the presence of a [[dual economy]] comprising both the modern and the primitive sector and takes the economic situation of unemployment and underemployment of resources into account, unlike many other growth models that consider underdeveloped countries to be homogenous in nature.&lt;ref name="Economnics4Development Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economnics4Development Website|url=http://www.economics4development.com/surplus_labor_model.htm|work=Surplus Labor Model of Economic Development|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the primitive sector consists of the existing agricultural sector in the economy, and the modern sector is the rapidly emerging but small industrial sector.&lt;ref name="Growth and Development: With Special Reference to Developing Economies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thirlwall|first=A.P|title=Growth and Development: With Special Reference to Developing Economies|year=2006|location=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1-4039-9600-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the sectors co-exist in the economy, wherein lies the crux of the development problem. Development can be brought about only by a complete shift in the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial economy, such that there is augmentation of industrial output. This is done by transfer of labor from the agricultural sector to the industrial one, showing that underdeveloped countries do not suffer from constraints of labor supply. At the same time, growth in the agricultural sector must not be negligible and its output should be sufficient to support the whole economy with food and raw materials. Like in the [[Harrod–Domar model]],  saving and investment become the driving forces when it comes to economic development of underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref name="Economnics4Development Website" /&gt;

== Basics of the model ==
[[File:Phases.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Depiction of Phase1, Phase2 and Phase3 of the dual economy model using average output.]]

One of the biggest drawbacks of the [[Dual Sector model|Lewis model]] was the undermining of the role of agriculture in boosting the growth of the industrial sector. In addition to that, he did not acknowledge that the increase in [[Workforce productivity|productivity of labor]] should take place prior to the labor shift between the two sectors. However, these two ideas were taken into account in the Fei–Ranis dual economy model of three growth stages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt; They further argue that the model lacks in the proper application of concentrated analysis to the change that takes place with agricultural development&lt;ref name=Developmentafrique.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranis-Fei model vs. Lewis Model|url=http://developmentafrique.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/RANISFEI.pdf|work=Developmentafrique.com|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Phase 1 of the Fei–Ranis model, the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of the agricultural labor work-force is infinite and as a result, suffers from disguised unemployment. Also, the [[marginal product of labor]] is zero. This phase is similar to the Lewis model.In Phase 2 of the model, the agricultural sector sees a rise in productivity and this leads to increased industrial growth such that a base for the next phase is prepared. In Phase 2, agricultural surplus may exist as the increasing average product (AP), higher than the marginal product (MP) and not equal to the subsistence level of wages.&lt;ref name="The Ranis-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment"&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Economic Review|jstor=1809172|work=The Ranis-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment | volume=53|pages=448–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the help of the figure on the left, we see that

:: &lt;math&gt;\text{Phase 1}: AL (\text{from figure}) = MP = 0 \text{ and }AB (\text{from figure}) = AP \,&lt;/math&gt;

According to Fei and Ranis, AD amount of labor (see figure) can be shifted from the agricultural sector without any fall in output. Hence, it represents [[Surplus labour|surplus labor]].

&lt;math&gt;\text{Phase2}: AP &gt; MP \,&lt;/math&gt;

After AD, MP begins to rise, and industrial labor rises from zero to a value equal to AD. AP of agricultural labor is shown by BYZ and we see that this curve falls downward after AD. This fall in AP can be attributed to the fact that as agricultural laborers shift to the industrial sector, the [[real wage]] of industrial laborers decreases due to shortage of food supply, since less laborers are now working in the food sector. The decrease in the [[real wage]] level decreases the level of profits, and the size of [[Economic surplus|surplus]] that could have been re-invested for more industrialization. However, as long as surplus exists, growth rate can still be increased without a fall in the rate of industrialization. This re-investment of surplus can be graphically visualized as the shifting of MP curve outwards. In Phase2 the level of disguised unemployment is given by AK.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt; This allows the agricultural sector to give up a part of its labor-force until

:: &lt;math&gt; MP = \text{Real wages} = AB = \text{Constant institutional wages (CIW)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Phase 3 begins from '''the point of commercialization''' which is at K in the Figure. This is the point where the economy becomes completely commercialized in the absence of disguised unemployment. The supply curve of labor in Phase 3 is steeper and both the sectors start bidding equally for labor.
:: &lt;math&gt; \text{Phase3}: \text{MP} &gt; \text{CIW} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of labor that is shifted and the time that this shifting takes depends upon:
# The growth of surplus generated within the agricultural sector, and the growth of industrial capital stock dependent on the growth of industrial profits;
# The nature of the industry's technical progress and its associated bias;
# Growth rate of population.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

So, the three fundamental ideas used in this model are:
# Agricultural growth and industrial growth are both equally important;
# Agricultural growth and industrial growth are balanced;
# Only if the rate at which labor is shifted from the agricultural to the industrial sector is greater than the rate of growth of population will the economy be able to lift itself up from the [[Malthusian trap|Malthusian population trap]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

This shifting of labor can take place by the landlords' investment activities and by the government's [[Fiscal policy|fiscal]] measures. However, the cost of shifting labor in terms of both private and [[social cost]] may be high, for example transportation cost or the cost of carrying out construction of buildings. In addition to that, per capita agricultural consumption can increase, or there can exist a wide gap between the wages of the urban and the rural people. These three occurrences- high cost, high consumption and high gap in wages, are called as '''leakages''', and leakages prevent the creation of agricultural surplus. In fact, surplus generation might be prevented due to a [[Backward bending supply curve of labour|backward-sloping supply curve of labor]] as well, which happens when high income-levels are not consumed. This would mean that the [[Workforce productivity|productivity of laborers]] with rise in income will not rise. However, the case of [[Backward bending supply curve of labour|backward-sloping curves]] is mostly unpractical.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

== Connectivity between sectors ==
Fei and Ranis emphasized strongly on the industry-agriculture interdependency and said that a robust connectivity between the two would encourage and speedup development. If agricultural laborers look for industrial employment, and industrialists  employ more workers by use of larger capital good stock and labor-intensive technology, this connectivity can work between the industrial and agricultural sector. Also, if the surplus owner invests in that section of industrial sector that is close to soil and is in known surroundings, he will most probably choose that productivity out of which future savings can be channelized. They took the example of Japan's dualistic economy in the 19th century and said that connectivity between the two sectors of Japan was heightened due the presence of a decentralized rural industry which was often linked to urban production. According to them, economic progress is achieved in dualistic economies of underdeveloped countries through the work of a small number of entrepreneurs who have access to land and decision-making powers and use industrial capital and consumer goods for agricultural practices.

=== Agricultural sector ===
[[File:Land Labour Graph.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Land-Labor Production Function]]

In (A), land is measured on the vertical axis, and labor on the horizontal axis. Ou and Ov represent two ridge lines, and the production [[contour line]]s are depicted by M, M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The area enclosed by the ridge lines defines the region of factor substitutability, or the region where factors can easily be substituted. Let us understand the repercussions of this. If te amount of labor is the total labor in the agricultural sector, the intersection of the ridge line Ov with the production curve M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at point s renders M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; perfectly horizontal below Ov. The horizontal behavior of the production line implies that outside the region of factor substitutability, output stops and labor becomes redundant once land is fixed and labor is increased.&lt;ref name="Paper on Labor Surplus Economies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ranis|first=Gustav|title=Paper on Labor Surplus Economies|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~granis/papers/cdp0900.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Ot is the total land in the agricultural sector, ts amount of labor can be employed without it becoming redundant, and es represents the redundant agricultural labor force. This led Fei and Ranis to develop the concept of '''Labor Utilization Ratio''', which they define as the units of labor that can be productively employed (without redundancy) per unit of land. In the left-side figure, labor utilization ratio
:: &lt;math&gt; R = \frac{ts}{Ot} &lt;/math&gt;
which is graphically equal to the inverted slope of the ridge line Ov.

Fei and Ranis also built the concept of ''' endowment ratio''', which is a measure of the relative availability of the two factors of production. In the figure, if Ot represents agricultural land and tE represents agricultural labor, then the endowment ratio is given by
:: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{tE}{Ot}&lt;/math&gt;
which is equal to the inverted slope of OE.
The actual point of endowment is given by E.

Finally, Fei and Ranis developed the concept of '''non-redundancy coefficient''' T which is measured by
:: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{ts}{te} &lt;/math&gt;

These three concepts helped them in formulating a relationship between T, R and S. If ::&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{ts}{te},&lt;/math&gt;
then
:: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{ts/Ot}{te/Ot} = \frac{R}{S}, \text{ or }T = \frac{R}{S} \,&lt;/math&gt;
''This mathematical relation proves that the non-redundancy coefficient is directly proportional to labor utilization ratio and is inversely proportional to the endowment ratio.''

(B) displays the total physical productivity of labor (TPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) curve. The curve increases at a decreasing rate, as more units of labor are added to a fixed amount of land. At point ''N'', the curve shapes horizontally and this point N conforms to the point G in (C, which shows the [[Marginal product of labor|marginal productivity of labor]] (MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) curve, and with point s on the ridge line Ov in (A).

=== Industrial sector ===

[[File:Capital labour.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Capital-Labor Production Function]]

Like in the agricultural sector, Fei and Ranis assume constant returns to scale in the industrial sector. However, the main factors of production are capital and labor. In the graph (A) right hand side, the [[production function]]s have been plotted taking labor on the horizontal axis and capital on the vertical axis. The expansion path of the industrial sector is given by the line OA&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As capital increases from K&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and labor increases from L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the industrial output represented by the production contour A&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases accordingly.

According to this model, the prime labor supply source of the industrial sector is the agricultural sector, due to redundancy in the agricultural labor force. (B) shows the labor supply curve for the industrial sector S. PP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the straight line part of the curve and is a measure of the redundant agricultural labor force on a graph with industrial labor force on the horizontal axis and output/[[real wage]] on the vertical axis. Due to the redundant agricultural labor force, the [[real wage]]s remain constant but once the curve starts sloping upwards from point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the upward sloping indicates that additional labor would be supplied only with a corresponding rise in the [[real wage]]s level.

MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curves corresponding to their respective capital and labor levels have been drawn as M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. When capital stock rises from K&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Marginal product of labor|marginal physical productivity of labor]] rises from M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. When capital stock is K&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve cuts the labor supply curve at equilibrium point Po. At this point, the total [[real wage]] income is W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and is represented by the shaded area POL&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. λ is the equilibrium profit and is represented by the shaded area qPP&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the laborers have extremely low income-levels, they barely save from that income and hence industrial profits (π&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) become the prime source of investment funds in the industrial sector.

:: &lt;math&gt;K_t=K_o + S_o + \Pi_o \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; gives the total supply of investment funds (given that rural savings are represented by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;)

Total industrial activity rises due to increase in the total supply of investment funds, leading to increased industrial employment.

== Agricultural surplus ==
[[:wikt:Agricultural surplus|Agricultural surplus]] in general terms can be understood as the produce from agriculture which exceeds the needs of the society for which it is being produced, and may be exported or stored for future use.

=== Generation of agricultural surplus ===

[[File:Agricultural surplus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Agricultural surplus in the dual economy of Fei and Ranis]]

To understand the formation of agricultural surplus,we must refer to graph (B) of the agricultural sector. The figure on the left is a reproduced version of a section of the previous graph, with certain additions to better explain the concept of agricultural surplus.
We first derive the average physical productivity of the total agricultural labor force (APP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). Fei and Ranis hypothesize that it is equal to the [[real wage]] and this hypothesis is known as the constant institutional wage hypothesis. It is also equal in value to the ratio of total agricultural output to the total agricultural population.  Using this relation, we can obtain APP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MP/OP. This is graphically equal to the slope of line OM, and is represented by  the line WW in (C).

Observe point Y, somewhere to the left of P on the graph. If a section of the redundant agricultural labor force (PQ) is removed from the total agricultural labor force (OP) and absorbed into the industrial sector, then the labor force remaining in the industrial sector is represented by the point Y. Now, the output produced by the remaining labor force is represented by YZ and the [[real income]] of this labor force is given by XY. The difference of the two terms yields the total agricultural surplus of the economy. It is important to understand that this surplus is produced by the reallocation of labor such that it is absorbed by the industrial sector. This can be seen as deployment of hidden rural savings for the expansion of the industrial sector. Hence, we can understand the contribution of the agricultural sector to the expansion of industrial sector by this allocation of redundant labor force and the agricultural surplus that results from it.

=== Agricultural surplus as wage fund ===

[[File:WageFund.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Integration of agricultural and industrial sectors to explain use of agricultural surplus as wage fund in a dual economy.]]

Agricultural surplus plays a major role as a wage fund. Its importance can be better explained with the help of the graph on the right, which is an integration of the industrial sector graph with an inverted agricultural sector graph, such that the origin of the agricultural sector falls on the upper-right corner. This inversion of the origin changes the way the graph is now perceived. While the labor force values are read from the left of 0, the output values are read vertically downwards from O. The sole reason for this inversion is for the sake of convenience. The point of commercialization as explained before (See Section on [[Fei–Ranis model of economic growth#Basics of the model|Basics of the model]]) is observed at point R, where the tangent to the line ORX runs parallel to OX.

Before a section of the redundant labor force is absorbed into the industrial sector, the entire labor OA is present in the agricultural sector. Once AG amount of labor force (say) is absorbed, it represented by OG' in the industrial sector, and the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is then OG. But how is the quantity of labor absorbed into the industrial sector determined? (A) shows the supply curve of labor SS' and several demand curves for labor df, d'f' and d"f". When the demand for labor is df, the intersection of the demand-supply curves gives the equilibrium employment point G'. Hence OG represents the amount of labor absorbed into the industrial sector. In that case, the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is OG. This OG amount of labor produces an output of GF, out of which GJ amount of labor is consumed by the agricultural sector and JF is the agricultural surplus for that level of employment. Simultaneously, the unproductive labor force from the agricultural sector turns productive once it is absorbed by the industrial sector, and produces an output of OG'Pd as shown in the graph, earning a total wage income of OG'PS.

The agricultural surplus JF created is needed for consumption by the same workers who left for the industrial sector. Hence, agriculture successfully provides not only the manpower for production activities elsewhere, but also the wage fund required for the process.

=== Significance of agriculture in the Fei–Ranis model ===
The Lewis model is criticised on the grounds that it neglects agriculture. Fei–Ranis model goes a step beyond and states that agriculture has a very major role to play in the expansion of the industrial sector. In fact, it says that the rate of growth of the industrial sector depends on the amount of total agricultural surplus and on the amount of profits that are earned in the industrial sector. So, larger the amount of surplus and the amount of surplus put into productive investment and larger the amount of industrial profits earned, the larger will be the rate of growth of the industrial economy. As the model focuses on the shifting of the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial sector, Fei and Ranis believe that the ideal shifting takes place when the investment funds from surplus and industrial profits are sufficiently large so as to purchase industrial capital goods like plants and machinery. These capital goods are needed for the creation of employment opportunities. Hence, the condition put by Fei and Ranis for a successful transformation is that

Rate of increase of capital stock &amp; rate of employment opportunities &gt; Rate of population growth

== The indispensability of labor reallocation ==

As an underdeveloped country goes through its development process, labor is reallocated from the agricultural to the industrial sector. More the rate of reallocation, faster is the growth of that economy. The economic rationale behind this idea of labor reallocation is that of faster economic development. The essence of labor reallocation lies in [[Engel's law|Engel's Law]], which states that the proportion of income being spent on food decreases with increase in the income-level of an individual, even if there is a rise in the actual expenditure on food. For example, if 90 per cent of the entire population of the concerned economy is involved in agriculture, that leaves just 10 per cent of the population in the industrial sector. As the productivity of agriculture increases, it becomes possible for just 35 per cent of population to maintain a satisfactory food supply for the rest of the population. As a result, the industrial sector now has 65 per cent of the population under it. This is extremely desirable for the economy, as the growth of industrial goods is subject to the rate of per capita income, while the growth of agricultural goods is subject only to the rate of population growth, and so a bigger labor supply to the industrial sector would be welcome under the given conditions. In fact, this labor reallocation becomes necessary with time since consumers begin to want more of industrial goods than agricultural goods in relative terms.

However, Fei and Ranis were quick to mention that the necessity of labor reallocation must be linked more to the need to produce more capital investment goods as opposed to the thought of industrial consumer goods following the discourse of [[Engel's law|Engel's Law]]. This is because the assumption that the demand for industrial goods is high seems unrealistic, since the [[real wage]] in the agricultural sector is extremely low and that hinders the demand for industrial goods. In addition to that, low and mostly constant wage rates will render the wage rates in the industrial sector low and constant. This implies that demand for industrial goods will not rise at a rate as suggested by the use of [[Engel's law|Engel's Law]].

Since the growth process will observes a slow-paced increase in the consumer purchasing power, the [[Dual economy|dualistic economies]] follow the path of '''natural austerity''', which is characterized by more demand and hence importance of capital good industries as compared to consumer good ones. However, investment in capital goods comes with a long gestation period, which drives the private entrepreneurs away. This suggests that in order to enable growth, the government must step in and play a major role, especially in the initial few stages of growth. Additionally, the government also works on the social and economic overheads by the construction of roads, railways, bridges, educational institutions, health care facilities and so on.

== Growth without development ==

[[File:Realwage laboremployment.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Graph showing growth without development]]

In the Fei-Ranis model, it is possible that as technological progress takes place and there is a shift to labor-saving production techniques, growth of the economy takes place with increase in profits but no economic development takes place. This can be explained well with the help of graph in this section.

The graph displays two MPL lines plotted with real wage and MPL on the vertical axis and employment of labor on the horizontal axis. OW denotes the subsistence wage level, which is the minimum wage level at which a worker (and his family) would survive. The line WW' running parallel to the X-axis is considered to be infinitely elastics since supply of labor is assumed to be unlimited at the subsistence-wage level. The square area OWEN represents the wage bill and DWE represents the surplus or the profits collected. This surplus or profit can increase if the MPL curve changes.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

If the MPL curve changes from MPL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to MPL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to a change in production technique, such that it becomes labor-saving or [[Capital intensity|capital-intensive]], then the surplus or profit collected would increase. This increase can be seen by comparing DWE with D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;WE since D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;WE since is greater in area compared to DWE. However, there is no new point of equilibrium and as E continues to be the point of equilibrium,there is no increase in the level of labor employment, or in wages for that matter. Hence, labor employment continues as ON and wages as OW. The only change that accompanies the change in production technique is the one in surplus or profits.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

This makes for a good example of a process of growth without development, since growth takes place with increase in profits but development is at a standstill since employment and wages of laborers remain the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

== Reactions to the model ==

[[File:Food Leisure.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Food-Leisure Graph]]

'''Fei–Ranis model of economic growth''' has been criticized on '''multiple''' grounds, although if the model is accepted, then it will have a significant theoretical and policy implications on the underdeveloped countries' efforts towards development and on the persisting controversial statements regarding the balanced vs. unbalanced growth debate.&lt;ref name="On the Empirical Relevancy of the Rans-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment" /&gt;

* It has been asserted that Fei and Ranis did not have a clear understanding of the sluggish economic situation prevailing in the developing countries. If they had thoroughly scrutinized the existing nature and causes of it, they would have found that the existing agricultural backwardness was due to the institutional structure, primarily the system of [[feudalism]] that prevailed.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice" /&gt;
* Fei and Ranis say, "It has been argued that money is not a simple substitute for [[physical capital]] in an aggregate [[production function]]. There are reasons to believe that the relationship between money and [[physical capital]] could be complementary to one another at some stage of economic development, to the extent that credit policies could play an important part in easing bottlenecks on the growth of agriculture and industry." This indicates that in the process of development they neglect the role of money and prices. They fail to differ between wage labor and household labor, which is a significant distinction for evaluating prices of dualistic development in an underdeveloped economy.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice" /&gt;
* Fei and Ranis assume that MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero during the early phases of economic development, which has been criticized by Harry T.Oshima and some others on the grounds that MPP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of labor is zero only if the agricultural population is very large, and if it is very large, some of that labor will shift to cities in search of jobs. In the short run, this section of labor that has shifted to the cities remains unemployed, but over the long run it is either absorbed by the informal sector, or it returns to the villages and attempts to bring more marginal land into cultivation. They have also neglected seasonal unemployment, which occurs due to seasonal change in labor demand and is not permanent.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Misra, Puri|first=S.K, V.K|title=Economics of Development and Planning|year=2010|publisher=Himalaya Publishing House|location=Mumbai, India|isbn=978-81-8488-829-4|pages=270–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To understand this better, we refer to the graph in this section, which shows Food on the vertical axis and Leisure on the horizontal axis. OS represents the subsistence level of food consumption, or the minimum level of food consumed by agricultural labor that is necessary for their survival. I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; between the two commodities of food and leisure (of the agriculturists). The origin falls on G, such that OG represents maximum labor and labor input would be measured from the right to the left.
The [[Production-possibility frontier|transformation curve]] SAG falls from A, which indicates that more leisure is being used to same units of land. At A, the marginal transformation between food and leisure and MPL = 0 and the indifference curve I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is also tangent to the [[Production-possibility frontier|transformation curve]] at this point. This is the point of leisure satiation.

Consider a case where a laborer shifts from the agricultural to the industrial sector. In that case, the land left behind would be divided between the remaining laborers and as a result, the [[Production-possibility frontier|transformation curve]] would shift from SAG to RTG. Like at point A, MPL at point T would be 0 and APL would continue to be the same as that at A (assuming constant returns to scale). If we consider MPL = 0 as the point where agriculturalists live on the subsistence level, then the curve RTG must be flat at point T in order to maintain the same level of output. However, that would imply leisure satiation or leisure as an [[inferior good]], which are two extreme cases. It can be surmised then that under normal cases, the output would decline with shift of labor to industrial sector, although the per capita output would remain the same. This is because, a fall in the per capita output would mean fall in consumption in a way that it would be lesser than the subsistence level, and the level of labor input per head would either rise or fall.

Berry and Soligo in their 1968 paper have criticized this model for its MPL=0 assumption, and for the assumption that the transfer of labor from the agricultural sector leaves the output in that sector unchanged in Phase 1. They show that the output changes, and may fall under various [[land tenure]] systems, unless the following situations arise:&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Subrata|first=Ghatak|title=Introduction to Developmental Economics|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-09722-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Leisure falls under the [[inferior good]] category
2. Leisure satiation is present.
3. There is perfect substitutability between food and leisure, and the [[marginal rate of substitution]] is constant for all real income levels.

Now if MPL&gt;0 then leisure satiation option becomes invalid, and if MPL=0 then the option of food and leisure as perfect substitutes becomes invalid. Therefore, the only remaining viable option is leisure as an [[inferior good]].

* While mentioning the important role of high agricultural productivity and the creation of surplus for economic development, they have failed to mention the need for capital as well. Although it is important to create surplus, it is equally important to maintain it through technical progress, which is possible through [[capital accumulation]], but the Fei-Ranis model considers only labor and output as [[factors of production]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;
* The question of whether MPL = 0 is that of an empirical one. The underdeveloped countries mostly exhibit seasonality in food production, which suggests that especially during favorable climatic conditions, say that of harvesting or sowing, MPL would definitely be greater than zero.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;
* Fei and Ranis assume a close model and hence there is no presence of foreign trade in the economy, which is very unrealistic as food or raw materials can not be imported. If we take the example of Japan again, the country imported cheap farm products from other countries and this made better the country's terms of trade.&lt;ref name="Economics of Development and Planning, Theory and Practice" /&gt; Later they relaxed the assumption and said that the presence of a foreign sector was allowed as long as it was a "facilitator" and not the main driving force.&lt;ref name="On the Empirical Relevancy of the Rans-Fei Model of Economic Development: Comment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=J.

* The reluctant expansionary growth in the industrial sector of underdeveloped countries can be attributed to the lagging growth in the productivity of subsistence agriculture. This suggests that increase in surplus becomes more important a determinant as compared to re-investment of surplus, an idea that was utilized by  Jorgenson in his 1961 model that centered around the necessity of surplus generation and surplus persistence.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;
* [[Economic stagnation|Stagnation]] has not been taken into consideration, and no distinction is made between labor through family and labor through wages. There is also no explanation of the process of self-sustained growth, or of the investment function. There is complete negligence of terms of trade between agriculture and industry, foreign exchange, money and price.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Developmental Economics" /&gt;

In [[topology]], a '''formal ball''' is an extension of the notion of [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] to allow unbounded and negative radius.  The concept of formal ball was introduced by Weihrauch and Schreiber in 1981 and the negative radius case (the '''generalized formal ball''') by Tsuiki and Hattori in 2008.

Specifically, if &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; the nonnegative real numbers, then an element of &lt;math&gt;B^+(X,d)=X\times\mathbb{R}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is a formal ball.  Elements of &lt;math&gt;B(X,d)=X\times\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are known as generalized formal balls.

Formal balls possess a partial order &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;(x,r)\leq(y,s)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq r-s&lt;/math&gt;, identical to that defined by set inclusion.

Generalized formal balls are interesting because this partial order works just as well for &lt;math&gt;B(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; as for &lt;math&gt;B^+(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, even though a generalized formal ball with negative radius does not correspond to a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Formal balls possess the [[Lawson topology]] and the [[Martin topology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2754">In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''fundamental theorem of [[linear programming]]''' states, in a weak formulation, that the [[maxima and minima]] of a [[linear function]] over a [[convex polygon]]al region occur at the region's corners. Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the [[line segment]] between them.

==Statement==
Consider the optimization problem 

:&lt;math&gt;\min c^T x \text{ subject to } x \in P&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;P = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : Ax \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded polyhedron (and thus a polytope) and &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution to the problem, then &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is either an extreme point (vertex) of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, or lies on a face &lt;math&gt;F \subset P&lt;/math&gt; of optimal solutions.

==Proof==
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that &lt;math&gt;x^\ast \in \mathrm{int}(P)&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon}(x^\ast) \subset P&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c}{||c||} \in P&lt;/math&gt; and 

:&lt;math&gt;c^T\left( x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c}{||c||}\right) = c^T x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c^T c}{||c||} = c^T x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} ||c|| &lt; c^T x^\ast.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is not an optimal solution, a contradiction. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; must live on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is not a vertex itself, it must be the convex combination of vertices of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_t&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;x^\ast = \sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Observe that 

:&lt;math&gt;0=c^{T}\left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}x_{i}\right)-x^{\ast}\right)=c^{T}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}(x_{i}-x^{\ast})\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}(c^{T}x_{i}-c^{T}x^{\ast}).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution, all terms in the sum are nonnegative. Since the sum is equal to zero, we must have that each individual term is equal to zero.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;c^{T}x^{\ast}=c^{T}x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, so every &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is also optimal, and therefore all points on the face whose vertices are &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_t&lt;/math&gt;, are optimal solutions.

==History==
The term gynocentrism has been in use since at least 1897 when it appeared in The Open Court stating that Continental Europeans view Americans "as suffering rather from gynocentrism than anthropocentrism."&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Court'', Volume 11 (Open Court Publishing Company, 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, author George A. Birmingham stated that "American social life seems to me gynocentric. It is arranged with a view to the convenience and delight of women. Men come in where and how they can."&lt;ref&gt;George A. Birmingham, ''From Dublin to Chicago: Some Notes on a Tour in America'' (George H. Doran Company, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[second-wave feminism]] in the 1970s, the term gynocentrism has been used to describe [[difference feminism]], which displayed a shift towards understanding and accepting gender differences, in contrast to [[equality feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Linda J. (1997), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EcgSDuc2bWQC&amp;pg=PT147 Gynocentrism: women's oppression, women's identity, and women's standpoint]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Nicholson | editor-first = Linda J. | title = The second wave: a reader in feminist theory (Volume 1) | pages = 147&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415917612 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Massachusetts philosopher Christa Hodapp, in modern men's movements gynocentrism is described as a continuation of the [[courtly love]] conventions of medieval times, wherein women were valued as a quasi-[[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic class]], and males were seen as a lower serving class. This [[antifeminism|antifeminist]] viewpoint describes [[feminism]] as the perpetuation of oppressive medieval conventions such as [[Domnei|devotional chivalry]] and [[Romance (love)#Popularization of love|romanticized relationships]], rather than as a movement towards liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Christa Hodapp, ''Men's Rights, Gender, and Social Media'', Lexington Books (September 5, 2017) {{ISBN|1498526160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious studies professors Paul Nathanson and [[Katherine K. Young]] claim that feminist calls for equality or equity are a subterfuge for gynocentrism.&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.116"&gt;Nathanson, Paul; [[Katherine K. Young|Young, Katherine K.]] (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&amp;pg=PT116 Women's rights v. human rights: the case of entitlements]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Nathanson | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Young | editor-first2 = Katherine K. | editor-link2 = Katherine K.

==Etymology==
The term ''gynocentrism'' is derived from [[ancient Greek]], γυνή and κέντρον. Γυνή can be translated as ''woman'' or ''female'',&lt;ref name="Kraus"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kraus | first = Ludwig A. | title = Kritisch-etymologisches medicinisches Lexikon'' (Dritte Auflage) | publisher = Deuerlich &amp; Dieterich | location = Göttingen, Germany | year = 1844 | oclc = 491993305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Liddell | first1 = Henry G. | last2 = Scott | first2 = Robert | author-link1 = Henry Liddell | author-link2 = Robert Scott (philologist) | title = A Greek-English lexicon / a new edition revised and augmented throughout / by Sir Henry Stuart Jones; with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie and with the co-operation of many scholars | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1940 | oclc = 630078019}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also as ''wife''.&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; In ancient Greek compounds with γυνή, the stem γυναικ- is normally used.&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; This stem can be spotted in the genitive case γυναικός,&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt; and in the older form of the nominative case γύναιξ.&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt; In ancient Greek, no compounds are known to exist with γυνή that start with γυνο- or γυνω-.&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt;

The ancient Greek word κέντρον can be translated as ''sharp point'',&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; ''sting (of bees and wasps)'',&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; ''point of a spear''&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt;  and ''stationary point of a pair of compasses'',&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; with the meaning ''centre of a circle'' related to the latter.&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; The meaning ''centre/middle point (of a circle)'' is preserved in the Latin word ''centrum'',&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Short"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Charlton T. | last2 = Short | first2 = Charles | author-link1 = Charlton Thomas Lewis | title = A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1879 | oclc = 223667500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saalfeld1884"&gt;{{cite book | last = Saalfeld | first = Günther Alexander Ernst Adolf | title = Tensaurus Italograecus : ausführliches historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der Griechischen Lehn- und Fremdwörter im Lateinischen | publisher = Druck und Verlag von Carl Gerold's Sohn, Buchhändler der Kaiserl.

==Criticism==
Nathanson and Young state that ideologically, the overriding focus of gynocentrism is to prioritize females hierarchically, and as a result may be interpreted as [[misandry]] (hatred of and prejudice towards men). Feminist calls for equality or even equity are often, according to them, a subterfuge for gynocentrism.&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.116"/&gt;

They define gynocentrism as a worldview based on the implicit or explicit belief that the world revolves around women, a cultural theme that they claim has become 'de rigueur' behind the scenes in law courts and government bureaucracies, resulting in systemic discrimination against men.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson, Paul; [[Katherine K. Young|Young, Katherine K.]] (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&amp;pg=PT309 Misandry v. equality]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Nathanson | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Young | editor-first2 = Katherine K. | editor-link2 = Katherine K. Young | title = Legalizing misandry: from public shame to systemic discrimination against men | page = 309 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal Ithaca | isbn = 9780773559998 | ref = harv | postscript = .| year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They further state that gynocentrism is a form of [[essentialism]] – as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women- to the extent that it focuses on the innate ''virtues'' of women and the innate ''vices'' of men.&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.58"&gt;Nathanson, Paul; [[Katherine K. Young|Young, Katherine K.]] (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&amp;pg=PT58 Misandry v. equality]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Nathanson | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Young | editor-first2 = Katherine K. | editor-link2 = Katherine K. Young | title = Martyrs v. murderers: the Montreal massacre | page = 58 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal Ithaca | isbn = 9780773559998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors make discriminations between ''individual'' gynocentric acts and events, such as [[Mother's Day]], and the more general concept of a ''gynocentric culture'' which refers to a larger collection of culture traits that have major significance in the way people’s lives were lived.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Peter (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GU9VBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8 Introduction to gynocentrism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Peter | title = Gynocentrism: From Feudalism to Modern Disney Princesses | page = 8 | publisher = [[Amazon (company)|Amazon Digital]] | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781520327327 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self published inline|certain=y|date=November 2017}}

Some [[post-modern]] feminists such as [[Nancy Fraser]] question the assumption of a stable concept of 'woman' which underlies all gynocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;La Caze, Marguerite (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CdfgMEV3f6oC&amp;pg=PT161 Splitting the difference: between Young and Fraser on identity politics]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Burns | editor-first = Lynda | title = Feminist alliances | pages = 160–161 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam New York | isbn = 9789042017283 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathanson and Young make a comparable claim that gynocentrism is a form of essentialism as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women, to the extent that it focuses on the innate virtues of women. Nathanson and Young add that "This worldview is explicitly misandric too, because it not only ignores the needs and problems of men, but also attacks men."&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.58"/&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has argued that gynocentrism is anti-intellectual and holds an antagonistic view of traditional scientific and creative disciplines, dismissing many important discoveries and artistic works as masculine. Sommers also writes that the presumption of objectivity ascribed to many gynocentrist theories has stifled feminist discourse and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christina Hoff Sommers|Hoff Sommers, Christina]] (1995), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&amp;pg=PA64 Transforming the academy]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Hoff Sommers | editor-first = Christina | editor-link = Christina Hoff Sommers | title = Who stole feminism?: How women have betrayed women | pages = 64–73 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | isbn = 9780684801568 | ref = harv | postscript = .| title-link = Who Stole Feminism? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist writer [[Lynda Burns]] emphasises that gynocentrism calls for a celebration of women's positive differences—of women's history, myths, arts and music—as opposed to an assimilationist model privileging similarity to men.&lt;ref&gt;La Caze, Marguerite (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CdfgMEV3f6oC&amp;pg=PT153 Splitting the difference: between Young and Fraser on identity politics]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Burns | editor-first = Lynda | title = Feminist alliances | page = 153 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam New York | isbn = 9789042017283 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However observed in practice, the preeminence of women associated with gynocentric narratives is often seen as absolute: interpersonally, culturally, historically, politically, or in broader social contexts such as popular entertainment. As such, it can shade into what [[Rosalind Coward]] called "womanism...a sort of popularized version of feminism which acclaims everything women do and disparages men".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ros Coward|Coward, Rosalind]] (2000), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PTfaNLyXS0wC&amp;pg=PT19 Introduction]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Coward | editor-first = Rosalind | editor-link = Ros Coward | title = Sacred cows: is feminism relevant to the new millennium | page = 11 | publisher = HarperCollins | location = London | isbn = 9780006548201 | ref = harv | postscript = .| year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Men Going Their Own Way]] (MGTOW) community describes themselves as a backlash against the misandry of gynocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences''''' is a 1988 book by [[mathematician]] [[John Allen Paulos]] about "[[numeracy|innumeracy]]," a term he embraced to describe the mathematical equivalent of [[illiteracy]]: incompetence with numbers rather than words. Innumeracy is a problem with many otherwise educated and knowledgeable people. While many people would be ashamed to admit they are illiterate, there is very little shame in saying "I'm a people person, not a numbers person." Or "I always hated math".&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Elizabeth|title=Why do Americans Stink in Math?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/magazine/why-do-americans-stink-at-math.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=2014-07-14|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cundiff|first1=Elizabeth|title=Innumeracy|url=http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/peer2peer/vol1/iss1/5/|website=Missouri University of Science and Technology Scholars' Mine|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sketch guy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Carl|title=Americans are Bad at Math|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/your-money/americans-are-bad-at-math-but-its-not-too-late-to-fix.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0|date=2014-08-04|website=New York Times|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos speaks mainly of the common misconceptions in regard to numbers. He looks at real-world examples in stock scams, psychics, astrology, sports records, elections, sex discrimination, UFOs, insurance and law, lotteries and drug testing.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt; Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way. The book sheds light on the link between innumeracy and pseudoscience. For example, the fortune telling psychic's few correct and general observations are remembered over the many incorrect guesses. He also stresses the problem between the actual number of occurrences of various risks and popular perceptions of those risks happening.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt; The problems of innumeracy come at a great cost to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gina Donaldson, Jenny Field, Dave Harries, Clare, Tope, Helen Taylor|title=Becoming a Primary Mathematics Specialist Teacher|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHkJMtgVNp0C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=costs+of+innumeracy+to+society&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X0BkMeVj9g&amp;sig=I1sCzWCDZnUkhf0xoyhxInZvMxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijgeaa4u7OAhVDxCYKHR2wAkwQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=costs%20of%20innumeracy%20to%20society&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics include [[probability]] and [[coincidence]], innumeracy in [[pseudoscience]], [[statistics]] and trade-offs in society. For example, the danger of getting killed in a car accident is much greater than terrorism and this danger should be reflected in how we allocate our limited resources.

==Background==

[[John Allen Paulos]] (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of mathematics at Temple University in Pennsylvania.  He is a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of mathematical literacy. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical innumeracy; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability and logic. He has received awards in:
2013 JPBM ([[Joint Policy Board for Mathematics]]) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Award for Communicating Mathematics|url=http://math.mit.edu/mathcomm/archives/john-allen-paulos-to-receive-math-communications-award/|publisher=JPBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2003 AAAS ([[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAAS|url=http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/public/public2003.shtml|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reasons for writing the book he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Innumeracy, an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance, plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens. The same people who cringe when words such as “imply” and “infer” are confused react without a trace of embarrassment to even the most egregious of numerical solecisms. I remember once listening to someone at a party drone on about the difference between “continually” and “continuously.” Later that evening we were watching the news, and the TV weathercaster announced that there was a 50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday, and concluded that there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend. The remark went right by the self-styled grammarian, and even after I explained the mistake to him, he wasn’t nearly as indignant as he would have been had the weathercaster left a dangling participle.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chapters==
# Examples and Principles. This chapter goes over how peoples lack of clarity of very large numbers lead to misconceptions. He argues for [[scientific notation]] being a clearer way to work with larger numbers. The ability to put numbers large and small in the correct context is key to understanding them in an intelligent way. He gives examples in some jokes, [[Rubik's cube]], nuclear weapons, travel at the speed of light, the number of 3 scoop combinations at Baskin-Robbins, dice rolls, the chance of getting AIDS and the chance of breathing the same molecule of breath as Julius Caesar.
# Probability and Coincidence. Underestimates of the frequency of coincidences is an example of innumeracy. People underestimate that an unlikely event is likely, given a large population sample. He gives examples in stock market newsletter scams, choosing a spouse, [[coincidence]] and the law, [[coin toss]] and the [[Hot-hand fallacy]] in sports.
# Pseudoscience. Here the author takes on how non-falsifiable statements play in with pseudoscience. For example ''Whatever God wills happens''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; can not be proven false so is not part of science. He touches examples in [[Freud]], [[Marx]], [[parapsychology]], dream prediction, [[astrology]], [[UFO's]], fraudulent medical treatments, [[Conditional probability]], [[blackjack]], drug testing and [[numerology]].
# What is Innumeracy? Here the author critiques public math education, the need for estimation in the math curriculum, math and humor(Paulos suggests that mathematicians have a particular sense of humor),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; innumeracy and the tendency to personalize excessively versus a statistical analysis, selective filtering of data to draw incorrect conclusions, decisions and framing of questions, various misconceptions about math being cold, impersonal or constraining and public safety risks.
# Statistics, Trade-Offs, and Society. This chapter addresses trade-offs in public policy, the [[prisoners dilemma]], [[type I and type II errors]] in statistics, when a true [[hypothesis]] is thought to be untrue or when a false hypothesis is thought to be true. Polling [[confidence interval]] is addressed, along with the [[law of large numbers]], [[Correlation does not imply causation]] and other statistical mistakes.

==Analysis==

''Innumeracy'' made the New York Times best seller the year it came out in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Communications Award|url=http://www.ams.org/images/JPBM-CA-citation-samples.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the New York Times best seller for 18 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Communications Award|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201305/rnoti-p610.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a slightly revised addition in 2001.&lt;ref name="Complete-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/maths/paulosja.htm|title=Innumeracy|website=Complete Review|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received favorable reviews in the New York Times "He takes us a couple of steps closer to numeracy, and it is all in all an enlightening place to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lehmann-Haupt|first1=Christopher|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/23/books/books-of-the-times-dangers-of-being-a-nation-of-number-numbskulls.html|website=New York Times|date=1989-01-23|title=Innumeracy|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Tribune wrote "Despite the title, which suggests yet another learned report documenting the sorry state of America's educational system, what Paulos provides is a readable romp across a varied mathematical landscape.
It serves as an excellent antidote to tedious classroom lectures on the difference between inverse and direct proportions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vann|first1=John|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-03-05/business/8903240201_1_mathematics-innumeracy-trillion|website=Chicago Tribune|date=1989-03-05|title=Innumeracy|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LA Times review noted ""Paulos is very good at explaining all of this, though sometimes with a hectoring, bitter tone, for which he apologizes at the very end."&lt;ref name="Complete-review" /&gt; The Christian Science Monitor review said "Should you read ''Innumeracy'' if you enjoy reading math problems and reasoning them out? Yes, it's fun. Should you read it if you think you hate math and are turned off by math problems? Yes, you may even get turned on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wales|first1=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">The [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] in [[scalar-tensor theory]] can be expressed in the '''Jordan frame''' in which the scalar field or some function of it multiplies the [[Ricci scalar]],  or in the '''Einstein frame''' in which Ricci scalar is not multiplied by the scalar field.  There exist various transformations between these frames.  Despite the fact that these frames have been around for some time there is currently  heated debate about whether either,  both,  or neither frame is a 'physical' frame which can be compared to observations and experiment.

==Equations and physical interpretation==
If we perform the [[Weyl rescaling]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}=\Phi^{-2/(d-2)} g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, then the Riemann and Ricci tensors are modified as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-\tilde{g}}=\Phi^{-d/(d-2)}\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{R}=\Phi^{2/(d-2)}\left[ R + \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2}\frac{\Box \Phi}{\Phi} -\frac{3(d-1)}{(d-2)}\left(\frac{\nabla\Phi}{\Phi}\right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;
As an example consider the transformation of a simple [[Scalar–tensor theory|Scalar-tensor]] action with an arbitrary set of matter fields &lt;math&gt;\psi_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; coupled minimally to the curved background
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int d^dx \sqrt{-\tilde{g}} \Phi \tilde{R} + S_\mathrm{m}[\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu},\psi_\mathrm{m}] =\int d^dx \sqrt{-g} \left[ R + \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2}\frac{\Box \Phi}{\Phi} - \frac{3(d-1)}{(d-2)}\left( \nabla\left(\ln \Phi \right) \right)^2\right] + S_\mathrm{m}[\Phi^{-2/(d-2)} g_{\mu\nu},\psi_\mathrm{m}]&lt;/math&gt;
The tilde fields then correspond to quantities in the Jordan frame and the fields without the tilde correspond to fields in the Einstein frame. See that the matter action &lt;math&gt;S_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; changes only in the rescaling of the metric.

The Jordan and Einstein frames are constructed to render certain parts of physical equations simpler which also gives the frames and the fields appearing in them particular physical interpretations. For instance, in the Einstein frame, the equations for the gravitational field will be of the form
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu}= \mathrm{other \; fields}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
I.e., they can be interpreted as the usual [[Einstein equations]] with particular sources on the right-hand side. Similarly, in the [[Newtonian limit]] one would recover the Poisson equation for the Newtonian potential with separate source terms.

However, by transforming in the Einstein frame the matter fields are now not coupled simply to the background but also to the field &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; which now acts as an effective potential. Specifically, an isolated test particle will experience a universal four-acceleration
:&lt;math&gt;a^\mu= \frac{-1}{d-2} \frac{\Phi_{,\nu}}{\Phi}(g^{\mu \nu} + u^\mu u^\nu),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the particle four-velocity. I.e., no particle will be in free-fall in the Einstein frame.

On the other hand, in the Jordan frame, all the matter fields &lt;math&gt;\psi_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; are coupled minimally to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; and isolated test particles will move on geodesics with respect to the metric &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that if we were to reconstruct the Riemann curvature tensor by measurements of geodesic deviation, we would in fact obtain the curvature tensor in the Jordan frame. When, on the other hand, we deduce on the presence of matter sources from gravitational lensing from the usual relativistic theory, we obtain the distribution of the matter sources in the sense of the Einstein frame.

==Models==
Jordan frame gravity can be used to calculate type IV singular bouncing cosmological evolution, to derive the type IV singularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1504.06866|title=Bouncing cosmology with future singularity from modified gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=2|pages=024016|date=27 June 2015|author=S.D.

The '''Koopman–von Neumann mechanics''' is a description of classical mechanics in terms of [[Hilbert space]], introduced by [[Bernard Koopman]] and [[John von Neumann]] in 1931 and 1932.&lt;ref name=Koopman1931&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koopman | first1 = B.

As Koopman and von Neumann demonstrated, a [[Hilbert space]] of [[Complex number|complex]], [[Square-integrable function|square integrable]] wavefunctions can be defined in which classical mechanics can be formulated as an operatorial theory similar to [[quantum mechanics]].

==History==
[[Statistical mechanics]] describes macroscopic systems in terms of [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensembles]], such as the macroscopic properties of an [[ideal gas]].  Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics arising from the study of statistical mechanics.

===Ergodic theory===
The origins of Koopman–von Neumann (KvN) theory are tightly connected with the rise{{when|date=October 2016}} of [[ergodic theory]] as an independent branch of mathematics, in particular with [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann's]] [[ergodic hypothesis]].

In 1931 Koopman and [[André Weil]] independently observed that the phase space of the classical system can be converted into a Hilbert space by postulating a natural integration rule over the points of the phase space as the definition of the scalar product, and that this transformation allows drawing of interesting conclusions about the evolution of physical observables from [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|Stone's theorem]], which had been proved shortly before. This finding inspired von Neumann to apply the novel formalism to the ergodic problem. Already in 1932 he completed the operator reformulation of quantum mechanics currently known as Koopman–von Neumann theory. Subsequently, he published several seminal results in modern ergodic theory including the proof of his [[Ergodic theory#Mean ergodic theorem|mean ergodic theorem]]''.

==Definition and dynamics==

===Derivation starting from the Liouville equation===
In the approach of Koopman and von Neumann ('''KvN'''), dynamics in [[phase space]] is described by a (classical) probability density, recovered from an underlying wavefunction – the Koopman–von Neumann wavefunction – as the square of its absolute value (more precisely, as the amplitude multiplied with its own [[complex conjugate]]). This stands in analogy to the [[Born rule]] in quantum mechanics. In the KvN framework, observables are represented by commuting self-adjoint operators acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of KvN wavefunctions. The commutativity physically implies that all observables are simultaneously measurable. Contrast this with quantum mechanics, where observables need not commute, which underlines the [[uncertainty principle]], [[Kochen–Specker theorem]], and [[Bell inequalities]].&lt;ref name=Landau1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = L. J. | title = On the violation of Bell's inequality in quantum theory | doi = 10.1016/0375-9601(87)90075-2 | journal = Physics Letters A | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 54–56| year = 1987 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1987PhLA..120...54L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KvN wavefunction is postulated to evolve according to exactly the same [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville equation]] as the classical probability density. From this postulate it can be shown that indeed probability density dynamics is recovered.

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{L} = - i\frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i\frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; H(x,p) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical Hamiltonian]].
The same dynamical equation is postulated for the KvN wavefunction
:&lt;math&gt;i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi (x, p, t) = \hat{L} \psi (x, p, t),&lt;/math&gt;
thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(x, p, t) = \left[- \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right] \psi(x, p, t),&lt;/math&gt;
and for its complex conjugate
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi^*(x, p, t) = \left[- \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right] \psi^*(x, p, t).&lt;/math&gt;
From
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x, p, t) = \psi^*(x, p, t) \psi(x, p, t)&lt;/math&gt;
follows using the [[Product rule#Higher partial derivatives|product rule]] that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho(x, p, t) = \left[- \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right] \rho(x, p, t)&lt;/math&gt;
which proves that probability density dynamics can be recovered from the KvN wavefunction.

;Remark:
The last step of this derivation relies on the classical Liouville operator containing only first-order derivatives in the coordinate and momentum; this is not the case in quantum mechanics where the [[Schrödinger equation]] contains second-order derivatives.

===Derivation starting from operator axioms===
Conversely, it is possible to start from operator postulates, similar to the [[Operator (physics)#Operators in quantum mechanics|Hilbert space axioms of quantum mechanics]], and derive the equation of motion by specifying how expectation values evolve.&lt;ref name=Bondar2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bondar | first1 = D. | last2 = Cabrera | first2 = R. | last3 = Lompay | first3 = R. | last4 = Ivanov | first4 = M. | last5 = Rabitz | first5 = H. | title = Operational Dynamic Modeling Transcending Quantum and Classical Mechanics | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.190403 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 109 | issue = 19 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23215365| pmc = |arxiv = 1105.4014 |bibcode = 2012PhRvL.109s0403B | pages=190403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant axioms are that as in quantum mechanics (i) the states of a system are represented by normalized vectors of a complex Hilbert space, and the observables are given by [[self-adjoint operator]]s acting on that space, (ii) the expectation value of an observable is obtained in the manner as the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)#Formalism in quantum mechanics|expectation value in quantum mechanics]], (iii) the probabilities of measuring certain values of some observables are calculated by the [[Born rule]], and (iv) the state space of a composite system is the [[tensor product]] of the subsystem's spaces.

&lt;div style="clear:both;width:75%;" class="NavFrame expanded"&gt;
&lt;div class="NavHead" style="background-color:#CCCCFF; text-align:left; font-size:larger;"&gt;{{anchor|sec_formulation}}Mathematical form of the operator axioms&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;"&gt;
The above axioms (i) to (iv), with the [[inner product]] written in the [[bra–ket notation]], are
:(i) &lt;math&gt; \langle \psi(t) | \psi(t) \rangle = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:(ii) The expectation value of an observable &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\langle A (t)\rangle =  \langle \Psi (t)| \hat{A} | \Psi(t) \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
:(iii)  The probability that a measurement of an observable &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; \left|\langle A | \Psi(t)\rangle \right|^2 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \hat{A} |A\rangle = A |A \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. (This axiom is an analogue of the [[Born rule]] in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Brumer2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brumer | first1 = P. | last2 = Gong | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.73.052109 | title = Born rule in quantum and classical mechanics | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 052109 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = quant-ph/0604178 |bibcode = 2006PhRvA..73e2109B | hdl = 1807/16870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
:(iv) (see [[Tensor product of Hilbert spaces#Definition|Tensor product of Hilbert spaces]]).
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These axioms allow us to recover the formalism of both classical and quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Bondar2012/&gt; Specifically, under the assumption that the classical position and momentum operators [[Commutative property|commute]], the Liouville equation for the KvN wavefunction is recovered from averaged [[Newton's laws of motion]]. However, if the coordinate and momentum obey the [[canonical commutation relation]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] of quantum mechanics is obtained.

&lt;div style="clear:both;width:75%;" class="NavFrame expanded"&gt;
&lt;div class="NavHead" style="background-color:#CCCCFF; text-align:left; font-size:larger;"&gt;{{anchor|sec_KvN_from_Newton}}Classical mechanics from the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]] (derivation)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;"&gt;
We begin from the following equations for expectation values of the coordinate ''x'' and momentum ''p''
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle x \rangle = \langle p \rangle, \qquad \frac{d}{dt} \langle p \rangle =\langle -U'(x) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
aka, [[Newton's laws of motion]] averaged over ensemble. With the help of the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]], they can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{x} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle, \\
\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi(t) \rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Notice a close resemblance with [[Ehrenfest theorem]]s in quantum mechanics. Applications of the [[product rule]] leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{x} | \Psi \rangle + \langle \Psi | \hat{x} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi | \hat{p}/m | \Psi \rangle, \\
	\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{p} | \Psi \rangle  + \langle \Psi | \hat{p} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp; = \langle \Psi | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi \rangle,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
into which we substitute a consequence of [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|Stone's theorem]] &lt;math&gt; i | d\Psi(t)/dt \rangle = \hat{L} | \Psi(t) \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
im \langle \Psi(t) | [\hat{L}, \hat{x} ] | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t)| \hat{p} |\Psi(t)\rangle,  \\
i \langle \Psi(t) | [\hat{L}, \hat{p}] | \Psi(t)\rangle &amp;= - \langle \Psi(t)| U'(\hat{x}) |\Psi(t)\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since these identities must be valid for any initial state, the averaging can be dropped and the  system of commutator equations for the unknown &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}&lt;/math&gt; is derived
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
	im  [\hat{L}, \hat{x}] =  \hat{p} , \qquad i [\hat{L}, \hat{p}] = -U'(\hat{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|commutator eqs for L}}}}
'''Assume that the coordinate and momentum commute &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''' This assumption physically means that the classical particle's coordinate and momentum can be measured simultaneously, implying absence of the [[uncertainty principle]].

The solution &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be simply of the form &lt;math&gt;\hat{L} = L(\hat{x}, \hat{p})&lt;/math&gt; because it would imply the contractions &lt;math&gt; im  [L(\hat{x}, \hat{p}), \hat{x}] =  0 = \hat{p} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i [L(\hat{x}, \hat{p}), \hat{p}] = 0 = -U'(\hat{x}) &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we must utilize additional operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_p&lt;/math&gt; obeying
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
	[ \hat{x}, \hat{\lambda}_x ] = [ \hat{p}, \hat{\lambda}_p ] = i, \quad [\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = [ \hat{x}, \hat{\lambda}_p ] =  [ \hat{p}, \hat{\lambda}_x ] = [ \hat{\lambda}_x, \hat{\lambda}_p ] = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|KvN algebra}}}}
The need to employ these auxiliary operators arises because all classical observables commute. Now we seek &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}&lt;/math&gt; in the form &lt;math&gt;\hat{L} = L(\hat{x}, \hat{\lambda}_x, \hat{p}, \hat{\lambda}_p)&lt;/math&gt;. Utilizing {{EquationNote|KvN algebra}}, the {{EquationNote|commutator eqs for L}} can be converted into the following differential equations
:&lt;ref name=Bondar2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Transtrum2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Transtrum | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Van Huele | first2 = J. F. O.

:&lt;math&gt;
m L'_{\lambda_x} (x, \lambda_x, p, \lambda_p) = p, \qquad L'_{\lambda_p} (x, \lambda_x, p, \lambda_p) = -U'(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
Whence, we conclude that the classical KvN wave function &lt;math&gt;|\Psi(t)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; evolves according to the  [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger-like]] equation of motion
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
	i\frac{d}{dt} |\Psi(t)\rangle = \hat{L} |\Psi(t)\rangle,
\qquad \hat{L} = \frac{\hat{p}}{m} \hat{\lambda}_x  - U'(\hat{x}) \hat{\lambda}_p.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|KvN dynamical eq}}}}

Let us explicitly show that {{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq}} is equivalent to the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|classical Liouville mechanics]].

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt; commute, they share the common [[eigenvectors]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\hat{x} |x,p\rangle = x |x,p\rangle, \quad \hat{p} |x,p\rangle = p |x,p\rangle , \quad
A(\hat{x}, \hat{p}) |x,p\rangle = A(x,p) |x,p\rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|xp eigenvec}}}}
with the [[Self-adjoint operator#Resolution of the identity|resolution of the identity]]
&lt;math&gt;
1 = \int dx dp \, |x,p\rangle \langle x,p|.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then, one obtains from equation ({{EquationNote|KvN algebra}})
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle x,p| \hat{\lambda}_x | \Psi \rangle =  -i \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \langle x,p | \Psi \rangle, \qquad
\langle x,p| \hat{\lambda}_p | \Psi \rangle =  -i \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \langle x,p | \Psi \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;
Projecting equation ({{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq}}) onto &lt;math&gt;\langle x,p|&lt;/math&gt;, we get the equation of motion for the KvN wave function in the xp-representation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial t} + \frac{p}{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} -  U'(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right]  \langle x,p | \Psi(t) \rangle = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|KvN dynamical eq in xp}}}}
The quantity &lt;math&gt;\langle x,\, p |\Psi(t) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the probability amplitude for a classical particle to be at point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. According to the [[#sec_formulation|axioms above]], the probability density is given by
&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,p;t) = \left| \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle \right|^2&lt;/math&gt;. Utilizing the identity
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \rho(x,p;t) = \langle \Psi(t) | x, p \rangle \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle
+ \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle \left( \frac{\partial }{\partial t}  \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle \right)^*
&lt;/math&gt;
as well as ({{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq in xp}}), we recover the classical Liouville equation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial t} + \frac{p}{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} -  U'(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial p}  \right]  \rho(x,p;t) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Liouville eq}}}}

Moreover, according to the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]] and ({{EquationNote|xp eigenvec}}),
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle A \rangle  &amp;=  \langle \Psi (t)| A(\hat{x}, \hat{p}) | \Psi(t) \rangle
= \int dxdp \, \langle \Psi (t)| x,p\rangle A(x, p) \langle x,p | \Psi(t) \rangle \\
&amp; = \int dxdp \,  A(x, p) \langle \Psi (t)| x,p\rangle \langle x,p | \Psi(t) \rangle
= \int dxdp \,  A(x, p) \rho(x,p;t).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the rule for calculating averages of observable &lt;math&gt; A(x,p) &lt;/math&gt; in classical statistical mechanics has been recovered from the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]] with the additional assumption &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ] = 0&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the phase of a classical wave function does not contribute to observable averages. Contrary to quantum mechanics, the phase of a KvN wave function is physically irrelevant.

&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;"&gt;
As in the [[#sec_KvN_from_Newton|derivation of classical mechanics]], we begin from the following equations for averages of coordinate ''x'' and momentum ''p''
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle x \rangle = \langle p \rangle, \qquad \frac{d}{dt} \langle p \rangle =\langle -U'(x) \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;
With the help of the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]], they can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{x} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle, \\
\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi(t) \rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
These are the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]s in quantum mechanics. Applications of the [[product rule]] leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{x} | \Psi \rangle + \langle \Psi | \hat{x} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi | \hat{p}/m | \Psi \rangle, \\
	\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{p} | \Psi \rangle  + \langle \Psi | \hat{p} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp; = \langle \Psi | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi \rangle,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
into which we substitute a consequence of [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|Stone's theorem]]
:&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar | d \Psi(t)/dt \rangle = \hat{H} | \Psi(t) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; was introduced as a normalization constant to balance dimensionality. Since these identities must be valid for any initial state, the averaging can be dropped and the system of commutator equations for the unknown quantum generator of motion &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; are derived
:&lt;math&gt;
im [\hat{H}, \hat{x}] = \hbar \hat{p}, \qquad i [\hat{H}, \hat{p}] = -\hbar U'(\hat{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;
Contrary to the case of [[#sec_KvN_from_Newton|classical mechanics]], we '''assume that observables of the coordinate and momentum obey the [[canonical commutation relation]]''' &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;. Setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = H(\hat{x}, \hat{p})&lt;/math&gt;, the commutator equations can be converted into the differential equations

:&lt;math&gt;
m H'_p (x,p) = p, \qquad H'_x (x,p) = U'(x),
&lt;/math&gt;
whose solution is the familiar [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|quantum Hamiltonian]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + U(\hat{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;
Whence, the [[Schrödinger equation]] was derived from the Ehrenfest theorems by assuming the canonical commutation relation between the coordinate and momentum. This derivation as well as the [[#sec_KvN_from_Newton|derivation of classical KvN mechanics]] shows that the difference between quantum and classical mechanics essentially boils down to the value of the commutator &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Measurements===
In the Hilbert space and operator formulation of classical mechanics, the Koopman von Neumann–wavefunction takes the form of a superposition of eigenstates, and measurement collapses the KvN wavefunction to the eigenstate which is associated the measurement result, in analogy to the [[wave function collapse]] of quantum mechanics.

However, it can be shown that for Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics ''non-selective measurements'' leave the KvN wavefunction unchanged.&lt;ref name=DaniloMauro2002/&gt;

==KvN vs Liouville mechanics==

The KvN dynamical equation ({{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq in xp}}) and [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|Liouville equation]] ({{EquationNote|Liouville eq}}) are [[first-order partial differential equation|first-order linear partial differential equations]]. One recovers [[Newton's laws of motion]] by applying the [[method of characteristics]] to either of these equations. Hence, the key difference between KvN and Liouville mechanics lies in weighting individual trajectories: Arbitrary weights, underlying the classical wave function, can be utilized in the KvN mechanics, while only positive weights, representing the probability density, are permitted in the Liouville mechanics (see [[#fig_KvN_vs_Liouville|this scheme]]).

[[File:KvN vs Liouville mechanics.pdf|thumb|350px|center|{{anchor|fig_KvN_vs_Liouville}}The essential distinction between KvN and Liouville mechanics lies in weighting (coloring) individual trajectories: Any weights can be utilized in KvN mechanics, while only positive weights are allowed in Liouville mechanics. Particles move along Newtonian trajectories in both cases. ([[#animation_KvN_for_Morse|Regarding a dynamical example, see below.]])]]

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal revenue''' (R') is the additional revenue that will be generated by increasing product sales by one unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials"&gt;Bradley R. chiller, "Essentials of Economics", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory"&gt;Edwin Mansfield, "Micro-Economics Theory and Applications, 3rd Edition", New York and London:W.W. Norton and Company, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics  Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg"&gt;Tirole, Jean,  "The Theory of Industrial Organization", Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary"&gt;John Black, "Oxford Dictionary of Economics", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be described as the [[total revenue|unit revenue]] the last item sold has generated for the firm.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;  In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan &amp; Sheffrin (2003), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because a firm in a [[perfect competition|competitive market]] will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; However, a [[monopoly]] determines the entire [[industry]]'s sales.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;  As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  Therefore, the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold, since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  The marginal revenue (the increase in [[total revenue]]) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. 

A firms profits will be maximized when marginal revenue (MR) equals [[Marginal cost|marginal cost (MC)]]. If &lt;math&gt;MR &gt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should increase output for more profits, if &lt;math&gt;MR &lt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should decrease output for additional profits. A firm should choose the output level which is profit maximizing under perfect competition theory &lt;math&gt;MR = MC&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/432989728|title=Managerial economics : a strategic approach|last=David.|first=Prentice,|last2=1962-|first2=Waschik, Robert G.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415495172|location=|pages=33|oclc=432989728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Marginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small.  More formally, define the revenue function to be the following
:&lt;math&gt;R(q)=P(q)\cdot q &lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[product rule]], marginal revenue is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;R'(q)=P(q) + P'(q)\cdot q&lt;/math&gt;.

For a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)=0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a [[monopoly]], the price decreases with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;).

==Marginal revenue curve==

The marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve - changes in income, change in the prices of complements and substitutes, change in populations. These factors can cause the R curve to shift and rotate.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S Price 2002. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between marginal revenue and elasticity==
The relationship between marginal revenue and the [[price elasticity of demand|elasticity of demand]] by the firm's customers can be derived as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R' = \frac{dR}{dQ} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle + \left( \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \right) Q &lt;/math&gt;
:as &lt;math&gt; \langle R \rangle = P &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle \left[ 1 + \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \frac{Q}{\langle R \rangle} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle (1 + 1 / e_{\langle R \rangle})&lt;/math&gt;

where e is the [[price elasticity of demand]]. If demand is inelastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1) then R' will be negative, because to sell a marginal (infinitesimal) unit the firm would have to lower the selling price so much that it would lose more revenue on the pre-existing units than it would gain on the incremental unit. If demand is elastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1) R' will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price.

==Marginal revenue and rule-of-thumb pricing==
Profit maximization requires that a firm produces where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. Fortunately, the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form” or rule of thumb.

:R' = C' 
:R' = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt; + &lt;R&gt;/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
:(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative of the inverse of elasticity of demand.&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"/&gt; Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as:
:&lt;R&gt; = C'/(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus if e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is - 2 and mc is $5.00 then price is $10.00.

(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner.&lt;ref name="Perloff"&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lerner index is a measure of market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost.  The index varies from zero to 1. The greater the difference between price and marginal cost the closer the index value is to 1. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic.&lt;ref name="Perloff"/&gt;

'''Example'''
If a company can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then the marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9.

'''Masculinity''' (also called '''manhood''' or '''manliness''') is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men.

==Overview==
Masculine qualities and roles are considered typical of, appropriate for, and expected of boys and men. The concept of masculinity varies historically and culturally; although the [[dandy]] was seen as a 19th-century ideal of masculinity, he is considered [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] by modern standards.&lt;ref name = "Reeser"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reeser | first = Todd W. | title = Masculinities in theory: an introduction | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4051-6859-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YMnn8Zf0heoC | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}} Masculine norms, as described in [[Ronald F. Levant]]'s ''Masculinity Reconstructed'', are "avoidance of [[femininity]]; restricted emotions; sex disconnected from intimacy; pursuit of achievement and status; self-reliance; [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[aggression]], and [[homophobia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levant |first1=Ronald F. |last2=Kopecky |first2=Gini |title=Masculinity reconstructed: changing the rules of manhood—at work, in relationships, and in family life | publisher = Dutton |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0452275416}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=February 2018}}{{Where|date=February 2018}} These norms reinforce [[gender role]]s by associating attributes and characteristics with one gender.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | last = Dornan | first = Jennifer | title = Blood from the moon: gender ideology and the rise of ancient Maya social complexity | journal = [[Gender &amp; History]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 459&amp;ndash;475 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.0953-5233.2004.00348.x | date = August 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0953-5233.2004.00348.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic study of masculinity received increased attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the number of courses on the subject in the United States rising from 30 to over 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |last=Bradley |first=Rolla M. |date=2008|title=Masculinity and self perception of men identified as informal leaders |publisher= [[University of the Incarnate Word]] | url = https://athenaeum.uiw.edu/uiw_etds/190/|oclc=1004500685}} [https://search.proquest.com/openview/bb91cf3b301335a7d97da0d80aed98a6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y View online preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked investigation of the intersection of  masculinity with other axes of social discrimination and concepts from other fields, such as the [[social construction of gender difference]]&lt;ref name="Flood 2007 Viii"&gt;{{cite book | last = Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities |page=viii | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC | isbn = 9780415333436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (prevalent in a number of [[philosophical]] and [[sociological]] theories).

Both males and females can exhibit masculine traits and behavior. Those exhibiting both masculine and [[feminine]] characteristics are considered [[androgynous]], and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = [[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York London | year = 2006 | origyear = 1990 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Laurie | first = Timothy | title = The ethics of nobody I know: gender and the politics of description | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–78 | publisher = [[Emerald Group Publishing|Emerald]] | doi = 10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/6262250/The_Ethics_of_Nobody_I_Know_Gender_and_the_Politics_of_Description Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since what constitutes masculinity has varied by time and place, according to [[Raewyn Connell]], it is more appropriate to discuss "masculinities" than a single overarching concept.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|185}} Study of the history of masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women's and (later) gender history. Before women's history was examined, there was a "strict gendering of the public/private divide"; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tosh, John (1999), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Br8JCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Introduction: masculinity and domesticity]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tosh | editor-first = John | title = A man's place: masculinity and the middle-class home in Victorian England |page=2 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780300077797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although women's historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men, a significant portion of the male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women's history began to analyze gender and women to deepen the female experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davis | first = Natalie Z. | title = "Women's history" in transition: the European case | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 83–103 | publisher = Feminist Studies, Inc. | doi = 10.2307/3177729 | jstor = 3177729  | date = Spring–Summer 1976 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3177729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Scott's seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Scott | first = Joan W. | title = Gender: a useful category of historical analysis | journal = [[The American Historical Review]] | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1075 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | jstor = 1864376 | date = December 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott, gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu's definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bourdieu | first = Pierre | title = Masculine domination | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780745622651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A flurry of work in women's history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a "high level of generality" in "broad surveys of cultural norms". The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|28}}John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steedman, Carolyn (1992), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EzD4fdELEioC&amp;pg=PA614 Culture, cultural studies and the historians]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Grossberg | editor-first1 = Lawrence | editor-last2 = Nelson | editor-first2 = Cary | editor-last3 = Treichler | editor-first3 = Paula | title = Cultural studies | page = 617 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 9780415903455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Ancient}}Antiquity===
[[File:Odysseus sehnt sich nach Ithaka (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of Odysseus leaning on a ship|[[Odysseus]], hero of the ''Odyssey'']]
Ancient literature dates back to about 3000 BC, with explicit expectations for men in the form of laws and implied masculine ideals in myths of gods and heroes. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] of 1000 BC, King David of Israel told his son, "I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Bible Gateway passage: 1 Kings 2:2 - King James Version |url= https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+2:2&amp;version=KJV | website = biblegateway.com |publisher=Bible Gateway |access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after David's death. Throughout history, men have met exacting cultural standards. Kate Cooper wrote about ancient concepts of femininity, "Wherever a woman is mentioned a man's character is being judged – and along with it what he stands for."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Kate (1996), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19 Private lives, public meanings]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Cooper | editor-first = Kate | title = The virgin and the bride: idealized womanhood in late antiquity | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 | page = 19 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 9780674939509 | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (about 1750 BC):
*Rule 3: "If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death."
*Rule 128: "If a man takes a woman to wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammurabi | author-link = Hammurabi | others = L.W.

Scholars cite [[integrity]] and [[social equality|equality]] as masculine values in male-male relationships&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bassi | first = Karen | title = Acting like men: gender, drama, and nostalgia in Ancient Greece | journal = [[Classical Philology (journal)|Classical Philology]] | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–92 | publisher = [[Chicago University Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/449528 | date = January 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/449528 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virility in male-female relationships. Legends of ancient heroes include the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The stories demonstrate qualities in the hero which inspire [[respect]], such as wisdom and courage: knowing things other men do not know and taking risks other men would not dare.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Medieval and Victorian eras ===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Beowulf, holding a sword, blocks a dragon's fire with his shield.|Beowulf fighting the dragon]]

[[Jeffrey Richards]] describes a European "medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richards | first = Jeffrey | title = From Christianity to Paganism: The New Middle Ages and the Values of 'Medieval' Masculinity | journal = Cultural Values | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–234 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14797589909367162 | date = 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14797589909367162 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courage, respect for women of all classes and generosity characterize the portrayal of men in literary history. The [[Anglo-Saxon]]s [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and [[Beowulf]] are examples of medieval masculine ideals. According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]) that ''Beowulf'' is a tale of medieval [[heroism]] overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf "cut[s] men off from women, other men, passion and the household".&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, David (1993), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC&amp;pg=PA11 The armor of the man-monster in Beowulf]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Rosen | editor-first = David | title = The changing fictions of masculinity | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana | page = 11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC | isbn = 9780252063091 | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian era, [[Victorian masculinity|masculinity]] underwent a transformation from traditional heroism. Scottish philosopher [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in 1831: "The old ideal of Manhood has grown obsolete, and the new is still invisible to us, and we grope after it in darkness, one clutching this phantom, another that; [[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Werterism]], [[Byron]]ism, even [[Beau Brummell|Brummelism]], each has its day".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, James Eli (1995), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f7gwHwyxZJ4C&amp;pg=PA1 Introduction]", in {{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=James Eli | title = Dandies and desert saints: styles of Victorian masculinity |page=1 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, New York | isbn = 9780801482083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxing was professionalized in America and Europe in the 19th century, and emphasized the physical and confrontational aspects of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher David Thrasher, ''Fight Sports and American Masculinity: Salvation in Violence from 1607 to the Present'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Bare-knuckle fighting without gloves represented "the manly art" in 19th century America.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott J. Gorn, ''The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Modern times}} Twentieth century to present ===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a traditional family consisted of the father as  [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]] and the mother as [[homemaker]]. Despite women's increasing participation in the paid labor force and contributions to family income, men's identities remained centered on their working lives and specifically their economic contributions. Central to adult men's identities is the provider role, as masculinity is often measured by the size of one's paycheck/economic contribution to the family.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, R. 1974. Measuring masculinity by the size of a paycheck. In: J. Pleck &amp; J. Sawyer (Eds.) ''Men and masculinity'' (pp. 96 – 100). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity is also secured by denying any semblance of softness, emotion, femininity, or any characteristic associated with women and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2012). ''Dude, you're a fag : masculinity and sexuality in high school.'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overwhelmingly, the construction of masculinity most valued in the latter part of the twentieth century to today is one that is independent, sexually assertive, and athletic, among other normative markers of manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaufman, ed. 1987. ''Beyond patriarchy : essays by men on pleasure, power, and change''. New York : Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, Nick T., Patrick C. McKenry, &amp; Beth Skilken Catlett. 2004. "Athlete Aggression on the Rink and off the Ice Athlete Violence and Aggression in Hockey and Interpersonal Relationships." ''Men and Masculinities'' 6:291-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. 2007. "The Girl Hunt: Urban Nightlife and the Performance of Masculinity as Collective Activity." ''Symbolic Interaction'' ''30''(2), 221-243. doi:10.1525/si.2007.30.2.221&lt;/ref&gt; Social theorist [[Erving Goffman]]'s seminal work on stigma management presents a list of traits prescribed as categorically masculine for contemporary men:&lt;blockquote&gt;In an important sense there is only one complete unblushing male in America: a young, married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual Protestant father of college education, fully employed, or good complexion, weight and height, and a recent record in sports.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. ''Stigma: Notes On The Management Of Spoiled Identity''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:128&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some evidence of masculinities undergoing shifts in the contemporary social landscape. Characteristic of present-day masculinity is men's willingness to counter stereotypes. Regardless of age or nationality, men more frequently rank good health, a harmonious family life and a good relationship with their spouse or partner as important to their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=26 August 2008 |title=Research and insights from Indiana University |url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/tips/page/normal/8690.html |location= |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |access-date=13 March 2017}}

In many cultures, displaying characteristics not typical of one's gender may be a social problem. In [[sociology]], this labeling is known as [[gender role|gender assumptions]] and is part of [[socialization]] to meet the [[mores]] of a society. Non-standard behavior may be considered indicative of [[homosexuality]], despite the fact that gender expression, [[gender identity]] and [[sexual orientation]] are widely accepted as distinct concepts.&lt;ref name=nacua&gt;{{cite web  |title=Gender identity and expression issues at colleges and universities| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140323020027/http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html | archive-date = 23 March 2014 |url= http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2007 |work=[[National Association of College and University Attorneys]] NACUAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=February 2018}}{{Where|date=February 2018}} When sexuality is defined in terms of object choice (as in early [[sexology]] studies), male homosexuality is interpreted as [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name=chrysler&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | author-link = Associated Press | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081211035529/http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp | archive-date = 11 December 2008 |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp |title=Chrysler TV ad criticized for using gay stereotypes |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | publisher = Here Press |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social disapproval of excessive masculinity may be expressed as "machismo"&lt;ref name = "Britannica"/&gt; or by [[neologism]]s such as "[[testosterone poisoning]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Alda | first = Alan | author-link =Alan Alda | title = What every woman should know about men | url = http://asylumnation.com/asylum/_r/showthread/threadid_15480/index.html | work = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]] | location = New York | date = October 1975 | access-date = 6 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity is debated. Although [[social conditioning]] is believed to play a role, [[psychologist]]s and [[psychoanalysts]] such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] believed that aspects of "feminine" and "masculine" identity are [[subconscious]]ly present in all human males.{{efn|See [[innate bisexuality]] and [[anima and animus]] for more information.}}

The historical development of gender roles is addressed by [[behavioural genetics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human ecology]], [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. All human cultures seem to encourage gender roles in literature, costume and song; examples may include the epics of [[Homer]], the [[Hengist and Horsa]] tales and the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] commentaries of [[Confucius]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the [[Bushido|bushidō]] of ''[[Hagakure]]''.

===Nature versus nurture===
{{main|Nature versus nurture}}

The sources of [[gender identity]] are debated. Some believe that masculinity is linked to the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with [[human penis|male genitalia]].&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Proponents of this view argue that women can become men [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormonally]] and [[Sex reassignment surgery|physically]],&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} and many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Sara | title = Third wave feminist linguistics and the analysis of sexism | journal = Discourse Analysis Online | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | publisher = [[Sheffield Hallam University]] | date = 2003 | url = http://extra.shu.ac.uk/daol/articles/closed/2003/001/mills2003001-paper.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the nurture side of the debate, it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source. Although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|17–21}} Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

In contrast to earlier perspectives of the nature versus nurture debate, contemporary social scientists suggest masculinity to stem from both nature ''and'' nurture, as both biological predispositions and social factors intersect to give rise to masculine gender identities.&lt;ref name="footnote.co"&gt;''Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2014. "Where Does Gender Come From?" Footnote.'' http://footnote.co/where-does-gender-come-from/&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that innate differences between the sexes are compounded and/or exaggerated by the influences of social factors.&lt;ref name="footnote.co"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Amy S. 2012.

Ed. by H. Crowley and S. Himmelweit. Polity/Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social construction of masculinity===
Social scientists conceptualize masculinity (and femininity) as a performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler|Butler, Judith]] (2006) [1990]. ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]]''. New York London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinities"&gt;[[Raewyn Connell|Connell, R.W.]] (2005). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC ''Masculinities''] (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Candace, and Don H. Zimmerman. 1987. “Doing Gender.” ''Gender &amp; Society'' 1:125–151&lt;/ref&gt; Gender performances may not necessarily be intentional and people may not even be aware of the extent to which they are performing gender, as one outcome of lifelong gender socialization is the feeling that one's gender is "natural" or biologically-ordained.

The social construction of gender also conceptualizes gender as a continuum. Theorists suggest one is not simply masculine or feminine, but instead may display components of both masculinity and femininity to different degrees and in particular contexts.

Masculine performance varies over the life course, but also from one context to another. For instance, the sports world may elicit more traditionally normative masculinities in participants than would other settings.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A. 1992. ''Power at Play: Sports and the Problem of Masculinity''. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who exhibit a tough and aggressive masculinity on the sports field may display a softer masculinity in familial contexts. Masculinities vary by social class as well. Studies suggest working class constructions of masculinity to be more normative than are those from middle class men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Edward W. 2008. “Rednecks,” “Rutters,” and `Rithmetic: Social Class, Masculinity, and Schooling in a Rural Context." ''Gender &amp; Society'' 22 (6): 728-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Karin A. 1996. ''Puberty, Sexuality, and the Self: Boys and Girls at Adolescence''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; As these contexts and comparisons illustrate, theorists suggest a multiplicity of masculinities, not simply one single construction of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Masculinities"/&gt;

==Hegemonic masculinity==
{{Main|Hegemonic masculinity}}

Traditional avenues for men to gain honor were providing for their families and exercising leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last= George | first = Annie | title = Reinventing honorable masculinity: discourses from a working-class Indian community | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 35&amp;ndash;52 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X04270379 |date= July 2006 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X04270379 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raewyn Connell]] has labeled traditional male roles and privileges [[hegemonic masculinity]], encouraged in men and discouraged in women: "Hegemonic masculinity can be defined as the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of [[patriarchy]], which guarantees the dominant position of men and the subordination of women".&lt;ref name="Connell_2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | date = 2005 | edition = 2nd | location = Cambridge | publisher = Polity  | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Connell (1987) placed emphasis on heterosexuality and its influence on the construction of gender. From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).&lt;ref&gt;Kostas, M.

==Precarious manhood==
Researchers have argued that the "precariousness" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82–86 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721411402669 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Precarious" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved. In many cultures, boys endure painful initiation rituals to become men. Manhood may also be lost, as when a man is derided for not "being a man". Researchers have found that men respond to threats to their manhood by engaging in stereotypically-masculine behaviors and beliefs, such as supporting hierarchy, espousing homophobic beliefs, supporting aggression and choosing physical tasks over intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vandello | first1 = Joseph A. | last2 = Bosson | first2 = Jennifer K. | last3 = Cohen | first3 = Dov | last4 = Burnaford | first4 = Rochelle M. | last5 = Weaver | first5 = Jonathan R. | title = Precarious manhood | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 1325–1339 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0012453 | date = December 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0012453 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Winegard and Geary wrote that the precariousness of manhood involves social status (prestige or dominance), and manhood may be more (or less) precarious due to the avenues men have for achieving status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Winegard | first1 = Bo M. | last2 = Winegard | first2 = Ben | last3 =  Geary | first3 = David C. | title = Eastwood’s brawn and Einstein’s brain: an evolutionary account of dominance, prestige, and precarious manhood | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–48 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0036594 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0036594 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who identify with creative pursuits, such as poetry or painting, may not experience manhood as precarious but may respond to threats to their intelligence or creativity. However, men who identify with traditionally-masculine pursuits (such as football or the military) may see masculinity as precarious. According to Winegard, Winegard, and Geary, this is functional; poetry and painting do not require traditionally-masculine traits, and attacks on those traits should not induce anxiety. {{Dubious|date=August 2015}} Football and the military require traditionally-masculine traits, such as pain tolerance, endurance, muscularity and courage, and attacks on those traits induce anxiety and may trigger retaliatory impulses and behavior. This suggests that nature-versus-nurture debates about masculinity may be simplistic. Although men evolved to pursue prestige and dominance (status), how they pursue status depends on their talents, traits and available possibilities. In modern societies, more avenues to status may exist than in traditional societies and this may mitigate the precariousness of manhood (or of traditional manhood); however, it will probably not mitigate the intensity of male-male competition.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Women who participate in sports, especially male-dominated sports, are sometimes derided as being masculine. Even though most sports emphasize stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength, competition, and aggression, women who participate in sports are still expected to conform to strictly feminine gender norms. This is known as the "female/athlete paradox". Although traditional gender norms are gradually changing, female athletes, especially those that participate in male-dominated sports such as boxing, weight lifting, American football, ice hockey, and motor sports, are still often viewed as deviating from the boundaries of femininity and may suffer repercussions such as discrimination or mistreatment from administrators, harassment by fans, and decreased media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paloian|first1=Andrea|title=The Female/Athlete Paradox: Managing Traditional Views of Masculinity and Femininity|url=https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2012/fall/female|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence points to the negative impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5&amp;nbsp;million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from [[heart disease]]. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from [[cardiovascular disease]] than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]] because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Galdas | first1 = Paul M. | last2 = Cheater | first2 = Francine M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Paul | title = Men and health help-seeking behaviour: Literature review | journal = [[Journal of Advanced Nursing]] | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 616–623 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | pmid = 15737222 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Joseph Pleck argues that a hierarchy of masculinity exists largely as a [[dichotomy]] of homosexual and heterosexual males: "Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are "real men" and have power, and males who are not".&lt;ref name=nomas.org&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleck|first=Joseph|title=Understanding patriarchy and men's power|url=http://nomas.org/understanding-patriarchy-and-mens-power/ | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) |accessdate=11 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Kimmel]] adds that the [[Trope (literature)|trope]] "You're so gay" indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Kimmel | first1 = Michael S. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Summer | author-link1 = Michael Kimmel | title = Mars and Venus, Or, Planet Earth?: Women and Men in a New Millenium [sic] | publisher = Kansas State University | format = DVD | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57227710 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of women, themselves and other men, [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.

In the documentary ''The Butch Factor'', gay men (one of them [[transgender]]) were asked about their views of masculinity.

[[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave]] [[pro-feminism]] paid greater attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and [[hegemonic masculinity]]. This shift led to increased cooperation between the [[Men's liberation movement|men's liberation]] and [[gay liberation]] movements developing, in part, because masculinity was understood as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and in response to the universalization of "men" in previous men's movements.

==Criticism==
Two concerns over the study of the history of masculinity are that it would stabilize the historical process (rather than change it) and that a cultural overemphasis on the approach to masculinity lacks the reality of actual experience. According to John Tosh, masculinity has become a conceptual framework used by historians to enhance their cultural explorations instead of a specialty in its own right.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tosh, John (2011), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0E5ARiVe9YUC&amp;pg=PA17 The history of masculinity: an outdated concept?]", in {{cite book |editor-last1= Arnold |editor-first1= John H. |editor-last2= Brady |editor-first2= Sean | title = What is masculinity?: historical dynamics from antiquity to the contemporary world | pages = 17&amp;ndash;34 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781137305602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This draws attention from reality to representation and meaning, not only in the realm of masculinity; culture was becoming "the bottom line, the real historical reality".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tosh critiques Martin Francis' work of in this light because popular culture, rather than the experience of family life, is the basis for Francis' argument.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Francis | first = Martin | title = A flight from commitment? Domesticity, adventure and the masculine imaginary in Britain after the Second World War | journal = [[Gender &amp; History]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–185 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | date = April 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis uses contemporary literature and film to demonstrate that masculinity was restless, shying away from domesticity and commitment, during the late 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Francis wrote that this flight from commitment was "most likely to take place at the level of fantasy (individual and collective)". In focusing on culture, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which films such as ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]'' represented the era’s masculine fantasies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Michael Roper’s call to focus on the subjectivity of masculinity addresses this cultural bias, because broad understanding is set aside for an examination "of what the relationship of the codes of masculinity is to actual men, to existential matters, to persons and to their psychic make-up" (Tosh's human experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Roper|first = Michael | title = Slipping out of view: subjectivity and emotion in gender history | journal = [[History Workshop Journal]] | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–72 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tosh, the culture of masculinity has outlived its usefulness because it cannot fulfill the initial aim of this history (to discover how manhood was conditioned and experienced) and he urged "questions of behaviour and agency".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His work on Victorian masculinity uses individual experience in letters and sketches to illustrate broader cultural and social customs, such as birthing or Christmas traditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Stefan Dudink believes that the methodological approach (trying to categorize masculinity as a phenomenon) undermined its [[Historiography|historiographic]] development.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink |first = Stefan | title = The trouble with men: Problems in the history of 'masculinity' | journal = [[European Journal of Cultural Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–431 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/136754949800100307 | date = September 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/136754949800100307 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abigail Solomou-Godeau’s work on post-revolutionary French art addresses a strong, constant patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Solomon-Godeau | first = Abigail | title = Male trouble: a crisis in representation | publisher = Thames and Hudson | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780500280379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh’s overall assessment is that a shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; back to the history of masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians to live up to the "social expectation" of their work,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink’s; the latter called for an "outflanking movement" towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the [[Low Countries]], Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a lens through which to view conflict and nation-building).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink|first = Stefan | title = Multipurpose masculinities: gender and power in low countries histories of masculinity | journal = [[BMGN: Low Countries Historical Review]] | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–18 | publisher = Royal Netherlands Historical Society | doi = 10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | date = March 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Francis' work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because "men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination"; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media images of boys and young men may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. According to men's-rights activists, the media does not address men's-rights issues and men are often portrayed negatively in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Farrell | first1 = Warren | last2 = Sterba | first2 = James P. | author-link1 = Warren Farrell | title = Does feminism discriminate against men? | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195312829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jackson called hegemonic masculinity "economically exploitative" and "socially oppressive": "The form of oppression varies from patriarchal controls over women's bodies and reproductive rights, through ideologies of domesticity, femininity and compulsory heterosexuality, to social definitions of the value of work, the nature of skill and the differential remuneration of 'productive' and 'reproductive' labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Jackson | first = Peter | title = The cultural politics of masculinity: towards a social geography | journal = [[Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–213 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.2307/622614 | jstor = 622614 | date = April 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/622614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological research===
According to a paper submitted by Tracy Tylka to the [[American Psychological Association]], "Instead of seeing a decrease in [[objectification]] of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes.

In 1987 Eisler and Skidmore studied masculinity, creating the idea of "masculine stress" and finding three elements of masculinity which often result in emotional stress:
* The emphasis on prevailing in situations requiring body and fitness
* Being perceived as emotional
* The need for adequacy in sexual matters and financial status

Because of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, men with spinal-cord injuries must adapt their self-identity to the losses associated with such injuries; this may "lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hutchinson | first1 = Susan L. | last2 = Kleiber | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Heroic masculinity following spinal cord injury: Implications for therapeutic recreation practice and research | journal = Therapeutic Recreation Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | publisher = Sagamore Journals | date = January 2000 | url = http://js.sagamorepub.com/trj/article/view/1110 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising.

[[Deindustrialization]] and the replacement of [[Smokestack industry|smokestack industries]] by technology have allowed more women to enter the labor force, reducing its emphasis on physical strength.&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002"&gt;{{citation | last = Beynon| first = John | contribution = Masculinities and the notion of 'crisis' | editor-last = Beynon| editor-first = John | title = Masculinities and culture | pages = 75–97 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia| year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-335-19988-4 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86–89}}

The crisis has also been attributed to the questioning of male dominance and rights granted to men solely on the basis of sex following the [[feminist movement]].&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt;{{rp|83–86}} British sociologist John MacInnes wrote that "masculinity has always been in one crisis or another", suggesting that the crises arise from the "fundamental incompatibility between the core principle of modernity that all human beings are essentially equal (regardless of their sex) and the core tenet of patriarchy that men are naturally superior to women and thus destined to rule over them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacInnes | first = John | authorlink = | title = The end of masculinity: the confusion of sexual genesis and sexual difference in modern society | year = 1998 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0-335-19659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Beynon, masculinity and men are often conflated and it is unclear whether masculinity, men or both are in crisis.  He writes that the "crisis" is not a recent phenomenon, illustrating several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women's movement and [[post-industrial society]]), suggesting that due to masculinity's fluid nature "crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself".&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt; Film scholar [[Leon Hunt]] also writes: "Whenever masculinity's 'crisis' actually started, it certainly seems to have been in place by the 1970s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Leon | year = 1998 | title = British low culture: from safari suits to sexploitation | publisher = Routledge | location = London, New York | page = 73 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3dvtQEetWrsC&amp;pg=PA73 | isbn = 978-0-415-15182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Herbivore men}}
In 2008, the word "herbivore men" became popular in Japan and was reported worldwide. Herbivore men refers to young Japanese men who naturally detach themselves from masculinity. [[Masahiro Morioka]] characterizes them as men 1) having gentle nature, 2) not bound by manliness, 3) not aggressive when it comes to romance, 4) viewing women as equals, and 5) hating emotional pain. Herbivore men are severely criticized by men who love masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Morioka | first = Masahiro | title = A phenomenological study of "Herbivore Men" | journal = The Review of Life Studies | volume = 4 | pages = 1–20 | date = September 2013 | url = http://www.lifestudies.org/press/review.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.lifestudies.org/press/rls0401.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Observational learning}}
'''Modeling''' is:
# a method used in certain techniques of [[psychotherapy]] whereby the client learns by imitation alone, without any specific verbal direction by the therapist (See [[Cognitive behavior therapy]]) and
# a general process in which persons serve as models for others, exhibiting the behavior to be imitated by the others&lt;ref&gt;VandenBoss, Gary (2006) ''APA Dictionary of Psychology''. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westen 2006"&gt;Westen, D.; Burton, L. &amp; Kowalski, R. (2006) Psychology: Australian and New Zealand Edition. Milton, QLD. John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; This process is most commonly discussed with respect to children in [[developmental psychology]].

Confusingly, the word refers both to the behavior of the learner and the teacher.

Modeling is an important component of [[neurolinguistic programming]] (NLP), which field has further developed specialized techniques involving modeling. (See [[Neurolinguistic programming|NLP modeling]].)

As the name implies, in the modeling the client learns new skills by imitating another person, such as a parent or therapist, who performs the behavior to be acquired. A younger client may be exposed to behaviors or roles in peers who act as assistants to therapist &amp; then be encouraged to imitate &amp; practice the desired new responses. For example, modeling may be used to promote the learning of simple skills such as self-feeding for a profoundly intellectually disabled child, or more complex skills such as being more effective in social situations for a shy withdrawn adolescent.

==Albert Bandura==

The concept of behavioral modeling was most memorably introduced by [[Albert Bandura]] in his famous 1961 [[Bobo doll experiment|Bobo Doll Experiment]]. In this study, 72 children from ages three to five were divided into groups to watch an adult confederate interact with an assortment of toys in the experiment room, including an inflated Bobo doll. For children assigned the non-aggressive condition, the confederate ignored the doll. For children assigned the aggressive condition, the confederate spent the majority of the time physically aggressing the doll and shouting at it.

After the confederate left the room, the children were given the opportunity to individually interact with similar toys. Children who observed the non-aggressive confederate's behavior played quietly with the toys and rarely initiated violence toward the Bobo doll. Children who watched the aggressive confederate were more likely to imitate the confederate's behavior by hitting, kicking, and shouting at the Bobo doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1961|title=Transmission of Aggression Through Imitation of Aggressive Models|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3706/7acd33ad2ba2ed384baada06e7d74b800399.pdf|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=63|pages=575–582|via=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors influencing behavioral modeling ==

=== Psychological factors ===
Bandura proposed that four components contribute to behavioral modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brewer|first=Keri R.|date=1998|title=Observational Learning Effectiveness as a Function of Model Characteristics: Investigating the Importance of Social Power|url=|journal=Journal of Social Behavior and Personality|volume=26|pages=1–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grusec|first=Joan E.|date=1992|title=Social Learning Theory and Developmental Psychology: The Legacies of Robert Sears and Albert Bandura|url=|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=28|pages=776–786|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Attention.''' The observer must watch and pay attention the behavior being modeled.
# '''Retention.''' The observer must remember the behavior well enough to recreate it.
# '''Reproduction.''' The observer must physically recreate the actions they observed in step 1.
# '''Reinforcement.''' The observer's modeled behavior must be rewarded

=== Neurological factors ===
The [[mirror neuron system]], located in the frontal lobe of the brain, is a network of neurons that become active when an animal either performs a behavior or observes that behavior being performed by another. For example, the same mirror neurons will become active when a monkey grasps an object as when it watches another monkey do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Hyeonjin|last=Jeon|date=28 February 2018|title=From Neurons to Social Beings: Short Review of the Mirror Neuron System Research and Its Socio-Psychological and Psychiatric Implications|pmc=5810456|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience|volume=16|pages=18–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the significance of mirror neurons is still up for debate in the scientific community, there are many who believe them to be the primary biological component in imitative learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iacobono|first=Marco|date=2009|title=Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons|url=https://www-annualreviews-org.erl.lib.byu.edu/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163604|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=60|pages=653–670|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar-Szakacs|first=Istvan|date=22 February 2005|title=Grasping the Intentions of Others with One's Own Mirror Neuron System|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030079|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12170">The terms [[monism]] and dualism are used to describe two different theories of the relationship between [[international law]] and national law. Many states, perhaps most, are partly monist and partly dualist in their actual application of international law in their national systems.

== Monism ==

Monists accept that the internal and international legal systems form a unity. Both national legal rules and international rules that a state has accepted, for example by way of a treaty, determine whether actions are legal or illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], International publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In most so-called "monist" states, a distinction between international law in the form of treaties, and other international law, e.g., customary international law or [[jus cogens]], is made; such states may thus be partly monist and partly dualist.
State sovereignty as well.
In a pure monist state, international law does not need to be translated into national law.  It is just incorporated and has effect automatically in national or domestic laws. The act of ratifying an international treaty immediately incorporates the law into national law; and customary international law is treated as part of national law as well. International law can be directly applied by a national judge, and can be directly invoked by citizens, just as if it were national law. A judge can declare a national rule invalid if it contradicts international rules because, in some states, the latter have priority. In other states, like in Germany, treaties have the same effect as legislation, and by the principle of ''[[List of Latin legal terms#L|Lex posterior derogat priori]]'' ("''Later law removes the earlier''"), only take precedence over national legislation enacted prior to their ratification. In its most pure form, monism dictates that national law that contradicts international law is null and void, even if it post-dates international law, and even if it is [[constitutional]] in nature.
From a [[human rights]] point of view, for example, this has some advantages. Suppose a country has accepted a human rights treaty - the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] for instance - but some of its national laws limit the [[freedom of the press]]. A citizen of that country, who is being prosecuted by his state for violating this national law, can invoke the human rights treaty in a national courtroom and can ask the judge to apply this treaty and to decide that the national law is invalid. He or she does not have to wait for national law that translates international law. His or her government can, after all, be negligent or even unwilling to translate. The treaty was perhaps only accepted for political reasons, in order to please donor-countries for example.{{Clarify|reason=Not clear what "donor-countries" is referring to|date=March 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"So when someone in The Netherlands feels his human rights are being violated he can go to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] judge and the judge must apply the law of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]]. He must apply international law even if it is not in conformity with Dutch law".&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Wiarda, in [[Antonio Cassese]], International Law in a Divided World, Clarendon Press, [[Oxford]], 1992, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Dualism ==

Dualists emphasize the difference between national and international law, and require the translation of the latter into the former. Without this translation, international law does not exist as law. International law has to be national law as well, or it is no law at all. If a state accepts a treaty but does not adapt its national law in order to conform to the treaty or does not create a national law explicitly incorporating the treaty, then it violates international law. But one cannot claim that the treaty has become part of national law. Citizens cannot rely on it and judges cannot apply it. National laws that contradict it remain in force. According to dualists, national judges never apply international law, only international law that has been translated into national law.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"International law as such can confer no rights cognisable in the municipal courts. It is only insofar as the rules of international law are recognized as included in the rules of municipal law that they are allowed in municipal courts to give rise to rights and obligations".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Atkin, Baron Atkin]], in M. Akehurst, Modern Introduction to International Law, Harper Collins, [[London]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The supremacy of international law is a rule in dualist systems as it is in monist systems. Sir [[Hersch Lauterpacht]] pointed out the Court's determination to discourage the evasion of international obligations, and its repeated affirmation of:

{{quote|the self-evident principle of international law that a State cannot invoke its municipal law as the reason for the non-fulfillment of its international obligations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=piU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;ots=Og6Yhjh177&amp;pg=PA262#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Development of International Law by the International Court''], Hersch Lauterpacht (ed), Cambridge University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0-521-46332-7}}, page 262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If international law is not directly applicable, as is the case in dualist systems, then it must be translated into national law, and existing national law that contradicts international law must be "translated away". It must be modified or eliminated in order to conform to international law.
Again, from a human rights point of view, if a human rights treaty is accepted for purely political reasons, and states do not intend to fully translate it into national law or to take a monist view on international law, then the implementation of the treaty is very uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Cassese]], International Law in a Divided World, Clarendon Press, [[Oxford]], 1992, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The problem of "lex posterior" ===

In dualist systems, international law must be translated into national law, and existing national law that contradicts international law must be "translated away". It must be modified or eliminated in order to conform to international law. However, the need for translation in dualist system causes a problem with regard to national laws voted after the act of translation. 
In a monist system, a national law that is voted after an international law has been accepted and that contradicts the international law, becomes automatically null and void at the moment it is voted. The international rule continues to prevail. In a dualist system, however, the original international law has been translated into national law - if all went well - but this national law can then be overridden by another national law on the principle of "[[lex posterior derogat legi priori]]", the later law replaces the earlier one. This means that the country - willingly or unwillingly - violates international law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], Internationaal publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; A dualist system requires continuous screening of all subsequent national law for possible incompatibility with earlier international law.

== Examples ==

In some countries, such as the UK for instance, the dualist view is predominant. International law is only part of British national law once it is accepted in national law. A treaty

:"has no effect in municipal law until an [[Act of Parliament]] is passed to give effect to it.

In other countries this distinction tends to be blurred. In the vast majority of democratic countries outside the Commonwealth, the legislature, or part of the legislature, participates in the process of [[ratification]], so that ratification becomes a legislative act, and the treaty becomes effective in international law and in municipal law simultaneously. For instance, the [[Constitution of the United States]] provides that the President

:'shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur'.

Treaties ratified in accordance with the Constitution automatically become part of the municipal law of the USA".&lt;ref&gt;M. Akehurst, Modern Introduction to International Law, Harper Collins, [[London]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States of America has a "mixed" monist-dualist system; international law applies directly in US courts in some instances but not others.  US Constitution, art. VI, does indeed say that treaties are part of the Supreme Law of the Land, as suggested by the quote above; however, its Supreme Court, as late as the recent case of ''[[Medellín v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Medellín v. Texas|volume=552|page=491|pin=|year=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has restated that some treaties are not "self-executing."  Such treaties must be implemented by statute before their provisions may be given effect by national and sub-national courts.  Similarly with regard to customary international law, its Supreme Court stated, in the case of the Pacquete Habana (1900), that "international law is part of our law."  However, it also said that international law would not be applied if there is a controlling legislative, executive, or judicial act to the contrary...&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Concepts of Public International Law - Monism &amp; Dualism", ed. Marko Novakovic, Belgrade 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A matter of national legal tradition ==

International law does not determine which point of view is to be preferred, monism or dualism. Every state decides for itself, according to its legal traditions. International law only requires that its rules are respected, and states are free to decide on the manner in which they want to respect these rules and make them binding on its citizens and agencies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[T]he transformation of international norms into domestic law is not necessary from the point of view of international law…the necessity of transformation is a question of national, not of international law".&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Cassese]], International Law in a Divided World, Clarendon Press, [[Oxford]], 1992, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both a monist state and a dualist state can comply with international law. All one can say is that a monist state is less at risk of violating international rules, because its judges can apply international law directly.&lt;ref name="Kooijmans_83"&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], Internationaal publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Negligence or unwillingness to implement international law in national law can only pose a problem in dualist states. 
States are free to choose the way in which they want to respect international law, but they are always accountable if they fail to adapt their national legal system in a way that they can respect international law. Either they adopt a constitution that implements a monist system so that international law can be applied directly and without transformation, or they do not. But then they have to translate all international law in national law. 
In a monist state we rely only on the judges and not on the legislators, but judges can also make mistakes. If a judge in a monist states makes mistakes when applying international law, then the country violates international law just as much as a dualist country that, for one reason or another, does not allow its judges to apply international law directly and fails to translate or fails to translate correctly and effectively.&lt;ref name="Kooijmans_83"/&gt; One reason for preferring dualism is precisely the fear that national judges are not familiar with international law - a highly complex field of law - and hence are liable to make mistakes.

'''''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991''''' is a book written by [[Jeff Goodwin]].&lt;ref name="Voice of Russia - 31Dec2011 - 2011: Year of worldwide protests "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/12/31/63180970/|title=2011: Year of worldwide protests |last=Russell-Sluchansky |first=Carmen|date=31 December 2011|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]]|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It analyzes revolutions through the state-centered perspective.

==Comparing Revolutionary Movements==
In ''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991'', 
Goodwin offers another comparative study on revolutions focusing on the second half of the twentieth century from 1914 to 1991.  According to 
Goodwin, “revolutionary movements are not simply or exclusively a response to economic exploitation or inequality, but also and more directly a response to political oppression and violence, typically brutal and indiscriminate”. This idea is Goodwin’s main thesis throughout the book and he further expands on it. Goodwin believes that understanding revolutions is “worthwhile  not only because of the enormous importance of these movements for the national societies in which they occurred,  but also for their effects on the configuration of power and beliefs in other societies and thus on the international balance of power as well".&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Jeff Goodwin]]|title=No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=4 June 2001|isbn=978-0521629485}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparative study on revolutions is worthwhile because it is different from all the others that exist. First, Goodwin uses a unique set of revolutions and revolutionary movements to analyze, making this analysis interesting and very instructive. Second, Goodwin analyzes not only those revolutions that were successful; he also includes failed revolutionary movements that did not succeed. By analyzing these failed revolutions, Goodwin is able to analyze the reasons why some revolutions occur and others simply deteriorate. Goodwin’s goal for his analysis on revolutions is “to discover the general causal mechanics that do the most to explain the origins and trajectory of several important revolutionary movements".&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Before beginning to analyze revolutions Goodwin’s guess is that, “the diverse political fortunes of the revolutionary movements in peripheral societies during this era were not fortuitous nor randomly distributed, but were the result of general causal mechanisms” &lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"/&gt;{{rp|8}}
(2001:8).

===Defining Terms===
Goodwin offers a definition of several important key terms that he will use throughout his analysis. To commence, he acknowledges that there are two different definitions for revolutions. For the first definition, the term revolution can “refer to any and all instances in which a state or political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extra constitutional, and/or violent fashion” (Goodwin 2009:9) With this interpretation, there needs to be a mobilization of people against the state. The second definition states that “revolutions entail not only mass mobilization and regime change, but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic, and/or cultural change during or soon after the struggle for state power” (Goodwin 2001:8). Goodwin chooses the concept from the concept of the first revolution since it is more general and includes many more revolutionary movements.

Goodwin also defines other important terms that will be essential to his theory. Political context is defined as, “the ways in which a national society, or some component of it, is governed and regulated by, has access to, and otherwise relates to the national state as well as to the larger state system” (Goodwin 2001: 14). To Goodwin, political concept is the single most important factor that explains the formation and fate of revolutionary movements. Lastly he defines peripheral state as “a state whose power and projects are more or less strictly determine or at least very tightly constrained by a much more powerful ‘core’ or ‘metropolitan’ state within the state system” (Goodwin 2001:14). Throughout his theory, Goodwin will use these terms in order to further his argument and it is essential to define them correctly.

===Theoretical Approaches to Revolutionary Movements===
Before Goodwin offers his own theory on revolutions, he first discusses two other popular theories, the modernization theory and the Marxist theory. The “modernization theory links revolutions to the transitions from traditional to modern societies, that is, to the very process of modernization itself” (Goodwin 2001:17). Those who believe in the Marxist theory, “view revolutions as occurring in ‘transitional’ societies- only in this case transition which is seen as the result of class struggle, is from one economic mode of production to another” (Goodwin 2001:19-20).  Goodwin believes that both of these theories, although not completely wrong, fail to completely analyze the political concept in which they are made. In addition to that there is a lot of disagreement in these theories that makes them less reliable.

The State-Centered Perspective
When studying revolutions, Goodwin places the focus on states, also known as the state-centered perspective. He focuses on the state because of two main reasons. The first is that any successful revolution will cause the breakdown or incapacitation of the state. The second reason is that “strong revolutionary movements, even if they ultimately fail to seize state power, will emerge only in opposition to states that are configured and that act in certain ways” (Goodwin 2001: 25) There are two reasons why the development of revolutionary movements is dependent on the state. Primarily, people will not support revolutionary movements unless they feel that the state is at fault for their everyday problems. The second reason is that individuals will not join revolutionary movements if they feel that doing so will only lead to more violence from the state. This second reason introduces another idea of people not joining revolutions unless they feel they have no other way out, which is exactly the title of the book. 
	
	Goodwin concludes in No Other Way Out that certain states lead to revolutions while others do not. According to him the formation of revolutionary movement in the periphery has been mainly caused by the “subset of violence and exclusionary authoritarian states that are also organizational incoherent and military weak” (Goodwin 2001: 26). Although there are many more factors that lead to revolutions, Goodwin’s main focus is on the state itself. The state itself is at the center of his analysis since according to him the state-centered perspective is the most powerful tool when analyzing revolutions

Four Types of State- Centered Analysis
	There are four approaches to the state-centered analysis which are the state- autonomy, the state-capacity, the political-opportunity, and the state-constructionism. All four of these approaches emphasize a set of causal mechanisms which are “those processes whereby states shape, enable, or constrain economic, associational, cultural, and even social-psychological phenomena” (Goodwin 2001: 36).  The state-autonomy perspective emphasizes on the autonomy of the state officials from the dominant social class. This dominant class includes politicians and military officials, among others, and they sometimes develop interests that are opposing to those interests of the popular will. The state-capacity approach focuses on the material and organizational capacity of the state officials’ political agenda. The political-opportunity approach on the other hand “emphasizes how the apparent tolerance, or responsiveness of states or “polities” influences the ability of mobilized social groups to act collectively and/or to influence state policies” (Goodwin 2001: 38).  Lastly, the state-constructionism approach focuses on how the states share and alter the identities, goals, and ideas of actors in civil society.

Analytic Strengths of State-Centered Approaches to Revolution 
	Goodwin argues that his statist approach is imperative when solving key problems of the study of revolutions. This state-centered analysis has much strength that makes it the best tools for analyzing revolutions. Revolutions are phenomenons that are fairly modern and have occurred with much more frequency in the twentieth century. Many have asked themselves why revolutions became more frequent in the twentieth century and the state-centered perspective answers this question. The answer is that revolutions need states to occur and this international state system that is present now thus makes revolutions much more frequent. This is not the only question that this statist perspective is able to answer. The state-centered perspective is able to answer why radical movements are concerned with destroying and seizing state power. Following this is also the question as to why it is necessary for the state to break down. This statist perspective also solves the question of why, when, and where revolutions occur. Lastly through this method analysts can figure out why some groups are able to attract much support and others are not. Through the state-centered perspectives all of these questions are answered in the analysis of revolutions.

	Goodwin believes that there are certain characteristics from states that make revolutionary movement more likely to develop. The first characteristic is that the state not only protects but also sponsors unpopular economic and social arrangements as well as cultural institutions. Another main characteristic is the repression and exclusion of mobilized groups from state power or resources. States where revolutions are more likely to develop also are indiscriminate and violent towards mobilized oppositional groups and figures. States that have weak policing capacities and infrastructural power are also more likely to produce revolutions. Lastly states that are characterized by a, “corrupt and arbitrary personalistic rule that alienates, weakens, or divides counterrevolutionary elites,” are more likely to develop revolutionary movements (Goodwin 2001: 49).

Critiques and Limitations of State-Centered Approaches 
	Goodwin acknowledges that there are many criticisms to his state-centered perspective on revolutions, but he argues that these critiques make unrealistic assumptions and they are completely unreliable. One of these critiques is that societies affect states just as much as states affect societies. Goodwin argues how even though states are not the only things that affect revolutions, and there are certainly other factors, they do tend to be at the center of the whole process and that is why they are at the center of the analysis. Another criticism states that in reality state officials are not the autonomous actors and they in fact are just being driven by the dominant class, challenging the state-autonomy approach. Again Goodwin disagrees with this claim as well as the other two critiques. One being that the state-centered analysis ignores the purpose and cultural dimensions of social action and the last one being that the distinction between states and societies is indefensible and should be eliminated. Although Goodwin disagrees with the critiques to the statist perspective he chooses to analyze revolutions, he does in fact acknowledge that there are certain limitation to this approach. Even though some limitations do exist, Goodwin argues that there are certain solutions to these. The main limitation in the state-centered perspective is that it fails to theorize sources that are not political or from the state. However even though this may be the case Goodwin argues that the state-centered perspective is still the best method for analyzing revolutions.

The Case of The Cuban Revolution 
The Cuban Revolution is a clear example that not only shows the strengths of the 
state-centered perspective, it also shows its limitations. Goodwin explains how in Cuba there were two main reasons as to why Cuba was susceptible to a radical revolution. The first reason was the weakness of Cuba’s clases economicas and the second was its strength of it clases populares or popular sectors. The Cuban state was also characterized by its “mediated sovereignty” and a “near-chronic crisis of political authority” (Goodwin 2001:60). Although the state had a lot to do in the Cuban revolution, this event was also marked by the mobilization of the masses. This is one of the reasons why the state-centered perspective is limited; it fails to analyze certain aspects of the revolution that were very important. On the other hand Goodwin argues that the Cuban revolution needs to be analyzed in different forms in order to fully explain it since no one theory alone can fully analyze any revolution.

The Formation of Revolutionary Movements in Southeast Asia
	Southeast Asia circa 1950 was a very important time in history in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia was defined during this time by seven regional similarities. This region was defined by Western conquest and colonial rule, it had an integration of local economics into the capitalist world system, and it was marked by its development of widespread social grievances and social protests. In addition to these similarities, this region was defined by its formation of reformist and revolutionary parties and movements, the Japanese occupation and privations of World War II, the formation of anti-Japanese resistance movements, and lastly it was defined by the Western colonial powers’ attempt to reassert their dominance over Southeast Asia after the war.

	After World War II, many dominating countries wanted to assert back their power on Southeast Asia, yet they were greeted by resistance. By the year 1950 there were several mass-based Communist movements that were challenging colonial and neocolonial regions in Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines. By contrast, the Indonesian struggle, which is seen by Goodwin as a political revolution, had already been won by non-Communist “populist” nationalists. Indonesian is a rare case and there are many explanations for what caused this anti-communism ideology. One main factor is the Japanese rule in Indonesia that ultimately brought many Indonesians into the middle class and liberated many popular non-communist nationalist leaders, thus spreading the dislike for communism.  This anti-communism ideology was not caused solely by economic, class, or cultural factors; it was the cause of circumstances “of a highly contingent character” (Goodwin 2001:89). In order to fully analyze the situation in Southeast Asia Goodwin goes on to use the state-centered perspective come up with answers and patterns to these revolutionary movements in Southeast Asia.
	

The Only Domino: The Vietnamese Revolution in Comparative Perspective
	In Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, many colonial regions were in the process of revolutionary movements. The outcome was of course very different in every region and Goodwin states that in order to analyze these different outcomes the state-centered perspective is the best tool to do so. Goodwin argues that “two political variables, against a general backdrop of colonial rule, widespread socioeconomic problems, and Japanese occupation, determined whether strong Communist-led national movements would form and take power in Southeast Asia” (2001:130-131). The formation and fate of the communist party therefore depended one two variables. One was “whether the Japanese relied upon Europeans or existing indigenous elites on the one hand, or sponsored populist nationalists on the other” (Goodwin 2001:131). The second variable is whether the rule of Western powers was inclusionary and reformist. Goodwin creates a figure that clearly shows the steps and outcomes of every possibility thus providing a generalization to the events in Southeast Asia.

Conclusion 
	The state-centered perspective is the strongest and most efficient tool when analyzing revolutions. States are ultimately an important factor that in all the cases determines the fate of the revolutionary movement and it also explains why revolutionary movements have different outcomes in different situations. According to Goodwin, “states powerfully determine the precise ways in which a range of other factors may contribute to both the mobilization and impact of revolutionary movements. He goes on to argue that, “a state-centered approach, in sum, is important not just or even mainly because of the importance of state breakdowns or political opportunities for seizures of power by preexisting movements, but also because the very formation and strength of revolutionary movements vis-a-vis other political challengers are strongly shaped by the ways in which political authorities rule and respond to challengers” (Goodwin 2001:133). State power, and its use, constructs the possibilities and outcomes for revolutionary movements, and that is why they must be at the center of the study of revolutions.

'''''Nous''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|n|aʊ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|n|uː|s}}), sometimes equated to [[intellect]] or [[intelligence]], is a term from classical [[philosophy]] for the faculty of the human [[mind]] necessary for understanding what is [[truth|true]] or [[reality|real]]. English words such as "[[understanding]]" are sometimes used, but three commonly used philosophical terms come directly from classical languages: [[wiktionary:νοῦς|''νοῦς'']] or [[wiktionary:νόος|''νόος'']] (from [[Ancient Greek|Ancient Greek)]], ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellēctus]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:intellegentia|intellegentia]]'' (from [[Latin]]). To describe the activity of this faculty, the word "intellection" is sometimes used in philosophical contexts, as well as the Greek words ''noēsis'' and ''noeîn'' (''[[wiktionary:νόησις|νόησις]]'', [[wiktionary:νοεῖν|''νοεῖν'']]). This activity is understood in a similar way (at least in some contexts) to the modern concept of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]].

In philosophy, common English translations include "understanding" and "mind"; or sometimes  "[[thought]]" or "[[reason]]" (in the sense of that which reasons, not the activity of reasoning).&lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often described as something equivalent to [[perception]] except that it works within the mind ("the [[mind's eye]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature|last=Rorty|first=Richard|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1979}} page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the basic meaning is something like "awareness".&lt;ref&gt;"This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call noesis, which is literally translated by "understanding" or intellect," and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by "awareness," an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness." {{citation|chapter=Progress or Return|title=An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss| editor=Hilail Gilden |publication-place= Detroit|publisher=Wayne State UP|year=1989|last=Strauss|first=Leo}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In colloquial [[British English]], ''nous'' also denotes "[[good sense]]", which is close to one everyday meaning it had in [[Ancient Greece]].

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|250px|upright=2.0|This diagram shows the medieval understanding of [[celestial spheres|spheres]] of the [[cosmos]], derived from [[Aristotle]], and as per the standard explanation by [[Ptolemy]]. It came to be understood that at least the outermost sphere (marked "[[Primum Mobile|Primũ Mobile]]") has its own intellect, intelligence or ''nous'' - a cosmic equivalent to the human mind.]]
In [[Aristotle]]'s influential works, the term was carefully distinguished from sense perception, imagination, and reason, although these terms are closely inter-related. The term was apparently already singled out by earlier philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], whose works are largely lost. In post-Aristotelian discussions, the exact boundaries between perception, understanding of perception, and reasoning have not always agreed with the definitions of Aristotle, even though his terminology remains influential.

In the Aristotelian scheme, ''nous'' is the basic understanding or awareness that allows human beings to think rationally. For Aristotle, this was distinct from the processing of sensory perception, including the use of imagination and memory, which other animals can do. This therefore connects discussion of ''nous'' to discussion of how the human mind sets definitions in a consistent and communicable way, and whether people must be born with some innate potential to understand the same [[universals|universal]] [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] in the same logical ways. Deriving from this it was also sometimes argued, especially in classical and medieval philosophy, that the individual ''nous'' must require help of a spiritual and divine type. By this type of account, it came to be argued that the human understanding (''nous'') somehow stems from this cosmic ''nous'', which is however not just a recipient of order, but a creator of it. Such explanations were influential in the development of medieval accounts of [[God]], the [[immortality of the soul]], and even the [[Celestial spheres|motions of the stars]], in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, amongst both eclectic philosophers and authors representing all the major faiths of their times.

==Pre-Socratic usage==
[[File:Anger of achilles.jpg|thumb|right|The earliest surviving text that uses the word ''nous'' is the ''[[Iliad]]''. [[Agamemnon]] says to [[Achilles]]: "Do not thus, mighty though you are, godlike Achilles, seek to deceive me with your wit (''nous''); for you will not get by me nor persuade me."&lt;ref&gt;This is from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D130 I.130], the translation is by A.T. Murray, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In early Greek uses, [[Homer]] used ''nous'' to signify mental activities of both [[Human|mortal]]s and immortals, for example what they really have on their mind as opposed to what they say aloud. It was one of several words related to thought, thinking, and perceiving with the mind. In [[pre-Socratic philosophy]], it became increasingly distinguished as a source of knowledge and reasoning opposed to mere sense perception or thinking influenced by the body such as emotion. For example, [[Heraclitus]] complained that "much learning does not teach ''nous''".&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{citation |title=Nous|last=Long|first=A.A.|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/A075.htm| year=1998|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some Greek authors, a faculty of intelligence known as a "higher mind" came to be considered as a property of the [[cosmos]] as a whole.

The work of [[Parmenides]] set the scene for Greek philosophy to come and the concept of ''nous'' was central to his radical proposals. He claimed that reality as the senses perceive it is not a world of truth at all, because sense perception is so unreliable, and what is perceived is so uncertain and changeable. Instead he argued for a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] wherein ''nous'' and related words (the verb for thinking which describes its mental perceiving activity, ''noein'', and the unchanging and eternal objects of this perception, ''noēta'') describe a form of perception which is not physical, but intellectual only, distinct from sense perception and the objects of sense perception.
[[File:Anaxagoras Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anaxagoras]]]]
[[Anaxagoras]], born about 500 BC, is the first person who is definitely known to have explained the concept of a ''nous'' (mind), which arranged all other things in the cosmos in their proper order, started them in a rotating motion, and continuing to control them to some extent, having an especially strong connection with living things. (However Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher, [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae]], who had taken a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.4.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+1.984b 984b].&lt;/ref&gt;) Amongst the pre-Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar ordering human-like principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example, [[Empedocles]], like [[Hesiod]] much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of [[love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter X.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pythagoras]] and Heraclitus, attributed the cosmos with "reason" (''[[logos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anaxagoras the [[cosmos]] is made of infinitely divisible matter, every bit of which can inherently become anything, except Mind (''nous''), which is also matter, but which can only be found separated from this general mixture, or else mixed into living things, or in other words in the Greek terminology of the time, things with a soul (''psychē'').&lt;ref name=KirkRavenXII&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter XII.&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxagoras wrote:
{{quote|All other things partake in a portion of everything, while ''nous'' is infinite and self-ruled, and is mixed with nothing, but is alone, itself by itself. For if it were not by itself, but were mixed with anything else, it would partake in all things if it were mixed with any; for in everything there is a portion of everything, as has been said by me in what goes before, and the things mixed with it would hinder it, so that it would have power over nothing in the same way that it has now being alone by itself. For it is the thinnest of all things and the purest, and it has all knowledge about everything and the greatest strength; and ''nous'' has power over all things, both greater and smaller, that have soul [''psychē''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/anaxagoras-nous.asp Anaxagoras, DK B 12], trans. by  J. Burnet&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Concerning [[cosmology]], Anaxagoras, like some Greek philosophers already before him, believed the cosmos was revolving, and had formed into its visible order as a result of such revolving causing a separating and mixing of different types of [[chemical element]]s. ''Nous'', in his system, originally caused this revolving motion to start, but it does not necessarily continue to play a role once the mechanical motion has started. His description was in other words (shockingly for the time) corporeal or mechanical, with the [[moon]] made of earth, the sun and stars made of red hot metal (beliefs Socrates was later accused of holding during his trial) and ''nous'' itself being a physical fine type of matter which also gathered and concentrated with the development of the cosmos. This ''nous'' (mind) is not incorporeal; it is the thinnest of all things. The distinction between ''nous'' and other things nevertheless causes his scheme to sometimes be described as a peculiar kind of dualism.&lt;ref name=KirkRavenXII/&gt;

Anaxagoras' concept of ''nous'' was distinct from later platonic and neoplatonic cosmologies in many ways, which were also influenced by [[Eleatics|Eleatic]], [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and other pre-Socratic ideas, as well as the Socratics themselves.

In some schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], a "higher mind" came to be considered a property of the cosmos as a whole that exists within all matter (known as buddhi or mahat). In [[Samkhya]], this faculty of intellect ([[buddhi]]) serves to differentiate matter ([[prakrti]]) from pure consciousness ([[purusha]]). The lower aspect of mind that corresponds to the senses is referred to as "[[Manas-vijnana|manas]]".

==Socratic philosophy==

===Xenophon===
[[Xenophon]], the less famous of the two students of Socrates whose written accounts of him have survived, recorded that he taught his students a kind of [[teleological]] justification of piety and respect for divine order in nature. This has been described as an [[teleological argument|"intelligent design" argument]] for the existence of God, in which nature has its own ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{citation|title=The Religion of Socrates| first=Mark |last= McPherran|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWfQx1CjZl0C&amp;pg=PA274|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press}}, pp. 273-275; and {{citation|title=Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity|first=David|last=Sedley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgRuJEfzUG8C|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press}}. It has been claimed that his report might be the earliest report of such an argument in {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&amp;pg=PA27|page=27|title=Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed| first=Sara |last=Ahbel-Rappe}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in his ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' 1.4.8, he describes Socrates asking a friend sceptical of religion, "Are you, then, of the opinion that intelligence (''nous'') alone exists nowhere and that you by some good chance seized hold of it, while—as you think—those surpassingly large and infinitely numerous things [all the earth and water] are in such orderly condition through some senselessness?" Later in the same discussion he compares the ''nous'', which directs each person's body, to the good sense (''[[phronēsis]]'') of the god, which is in everything, arranging things to its pleasure (1.4.17).&lt;ref&gt;The translation quoted is from Amy Bonnette. {{citation |last=Xenophon|title=Memorabilia|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato describes Socrates making the same argument in his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28d, using the same words ''nous'' and ''phronēsis''.&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Perseus Project]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Asection%3D28d 28d]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
{{Platonism}}
{{see also|Phaedo|Timaeus (dialogue)}}
[[Plato]] used the word ''nous'' in many ways that were not unusual in the everyday Greek of the time, and often simply meant "good sense" or "awareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kalkavage|chapter=Glossary|title=Plato's Timaeus|year=2001|publisher=Focus Publishing}}. In ancient Greek the word was used for phrases such as "keep in mind" and "to my mind".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in some of his [[Platonic dialogue]]s it is described by key characters in a higher sense, which was apparently already common. In his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28c he has Socrates say that "all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (''nous'') is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right." and later states that the ensuing discussion "confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (''nous'') always rules the universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D28 28c] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30d]. Translation by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', Plato gives the [[etymology]] of [[Athena]]'s name, the goddess of wisdom, from ''Atheonóa'' (Ἀθεονόα) meaning "god's (''theos'') mind (''nous'')". In his ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato's teacher Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic ''nous'' as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' [[materialism|materialist]] understanding of [[Causality|causation]]. Socrates said that Anaxagoras would "give voice and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our talking with each other, and should fail to mention the real causes, which are, that the Athenians decided that it was best to condemn me".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler translation of the ''Phaedo'' as on the Perseus webpage: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D97 97]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D98 98].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Socrates seems to suggest that he also failed to develop a fully satisfactory [[teleological]] and [[dualism (philosophy)|dualistic]] understanding of a mind of nature, whose aims represent [[the Good]], which all parts of nature aim at.

Concerning the ''nous'' that is the source of understanding of individuals, Plato is widely understood to have used ideas from [[Parmenides]] in addition to Anaxagoras. Like Parmenides, Plato argued that relying on sense perception can never lead to true knowledge, only opinion. Instead, Plato's more philosophical characters argue that ''nous'' must somehow perceive truth directly in the ways gods and [[Daimon#In classical and Hellenistic philosophy|daimons]] perceive. What our mind sees directly in order to really understand things must not be the constantly changing material things, but unchanging entities that exist in a different way, the so-called "[[theory of forms|forms]]" or "[[idea]]s". However he knew that contemporary philosophers often argued (as in modern science) that ''nous'' and perception are just two aspects of one physical activity, and that perception is the source of knowledge and understanding (not the other way around).

Just exactly how Plato believed that the ''nous'' of people lets them come to understand things in any way that improves upon sense perception and the kind of thinking which animals have, is a subject of long running discussion and debate. On the one hand, in the ''Republic'' Plato's Socrates, in the [[Analogy of the sun]] and [[Allegory of the Cave]] describes people as being able to perceive more clearly because of something from outside themselves, something like when the sun shines, helping eyesight. The source of this illumination for the intellect is referred to as the [[Form of the Good]]. On the other hand, in the ''[[Meno]]'' for example, Plato's Socrates explains the theory of ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'' whereby people are born with ideas already in their soul, which they somehow remember from [[reincarnation|previous lives]]. Both theories were to become highly influential.

As in Xenophon, Plato's Socrates frequently describes the soul in a political way, with ruling parts, and parts that are by nature meant to be ruled. ''Nous'' is associated with the rational (''logistikon'') part of the individual human soul, which by nature should rule. In his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', in the so-called "[[analogy of the divided line]]", it has a special function within this rational part. Plato tended to treat ''nous'' as the only immortal part of the [[soul]].

Concerning the cosmos, in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', the title character also tells a "likely story" in which ''nous'' is responsible for the creative work of the [[demiurge]] or maker who brought rational order to our universe. This craftsman imitated what he perceived in the world of eternal [[substantial form|Forms]]. In the ''[[Philebus]]'' Socrates argues that ''nous'' in individual humans must share in a cosmic ''nous'', in the same way that human bodies are made up of small parts of the elements found in the rest of the universe. And this ''nous'' must be in the ''[[genos]]'' of being a cause of all particular things as particular things.&lt;ref&gt;''Philebus'' on the Perseus Project: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D23 23b]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30e]. Translation is by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{see also|Dianoia|Active Intellect}}
{{The Works of Aristotle}}
Like Plato, Aristotle saw the ''nous'' or [[intellect]] of an individual as somehow similar to sense perception but also distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Glo Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Aristotle's Ethics, Glossary of terms].&lt;/ref&gt; Sense perception in [[actuality|action]] provides images to the ''nous'', via the "''[[Common sense#Aristotelian common sense|sensus communis]]''" and imagination, without which thought could not occur. But other animals have ''sensus communis'' and imagination, whereas none of them have ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' Book III, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotelians divide perception of forms into the animal-like one which perceives ''species sensibilis'' or ''sensible forms'', and ''species intelligibilis'' that are perceived in a different way by the ''nous''.

Like Plato, Aristotle linked ''nous'' to ''logos'' (reason) as uniquely human, but he also distinguished ''nous'' from ''logos'', thereby distinguishing the faculty for setting definitions from the faculty that uses them to reason with.&lt;ref&gt;"Intelligence (''nous'') apprehend each definition (''horos'' meaning "boundary"), which cannot be proved by reasoning". ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1142a&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnw%3D  1142a], Rackham translation.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Nicomachean ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|Book VI]] Aristotle divides the soul (''psychē'') into two parts, one which has reason and one which does not, but then divides the part which has reason into the reasoning (''logistikos'') part itself which is lower, and the higher "knowing" (''epistēmonikos'') part which contemplates general principles (''archai''). ''Nous'', he states, is the source of the first principles or sources (''archai'') of definitions, and it develops naturally as people gain experience.&lt;ref&gt;This is also discussed by him in the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; This he explains after first comparing the four other [[truth]] revealing capacities of soul: technical [[know how]] (''[[techne|technē]]''), [[logic]]ally [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] [[knowledge]] (''[[episteme|epistēmē]]'', sometimes translated as "scientific knowledge"), practical wisdom (''[[phronesis|phronēsis]]''), and lastly [[theory|theoretical]] [[wisdom]] (''[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]''), which is defined by Aristotle as the combination of ''nous'' and ''epistēmē''. All of these others apart from ''nous'' are types of reason (''logos'').
{{quote|And intellect [''nous''] is directed at what is ultimate on both sides, since it is intellect and not reason [''logos''] that is directed at both the first terms [''horoi''] and the ultimate particulars, on the one side at the changeless first terms in demonstrations, and on the other side, in thinking about action, at the other sort of premise, the variable particular; for these particulars are the sources [''archai''] from which one discerns that for the sake of which an action is, since the universals are derived from the particulars. Hence intellect is both a beginning and an end, since the demonstrations that are derived from these particulars are also about these. And of these one must have perception, and this perception is intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|VI]].xi.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1143a&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnou%3Dn 1143a]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1143b&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnou%3Dn 1143b].

[[Aristotle]]'s philosophical works continue many of the same Socratic themes as his teacher Plato. Amongst the new proposals he made was a way of explaining causality, and ''nous'' is an important part of his explanation. As mentioned above, Plato criticized Anaxagoras' materialism, or understanding that the intellect of nature only set the cosmos in motion, but is no longer seen as the cause of physical events. Aristotle explained that the changes of things can be described in terms of [[four causes]] at the same time. Two of these four causes are similar to the materialist understanding: each thing has a material which causes it to be how it is, and some other thing which set in motion or initiated some process of change. But at the same time according to Aristotle each thing is also caused by the natural forms they are tending to become, and the natural ends or aims, which somehow exist in nature as causes, even in cases where human plans and aims are not involved. These latter two causes (the "formal" and "final"), are concepts no longer used in modern science, and encompass the continuous effect of the intelligent ordering principle of nature itself. Aristotle's special description of causality is especially apparent in the natural development of living things. It leads to a method whereby Aristotle analyses causation and motion in terms of the [[Potentiality and actuality|potentialities and actualities]] of all things, whereby all matter possesses various possibilities or potentialities of form and end, and these possibilities become more fully real as their potential forms become actual or active reality (something they will do on their own, by nature, unless stopped because of other natural things happening). For example, a stone has in its nature the potentiality of falling to the earth and it will do so, and actualize this natural tendency, if nothing is in the way.

Aristotle analyzed thinking in the same way. For him, the possibility of understanding rests on the relationship between [[intellect]] and [[sense]] [[perception]]. Aristotle's remarks on the concept of what came to be called the "[[active intellect]]" and "[[passive intellect]]" (along with various other terms) are amongst "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{citation |title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are derived from a single passage in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[On the Soul|''De Anima'']], Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'', Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25 translated by Joe Sachs,'' Aristotle's On the Soul and On Memory and Recollection'', Green Lion Books&lt;/ref&gt; with some key Greek words shown in square brackets.
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material [''[[matter|hulē]]''] for each kind [''[[genos]]''] (this is what is in [[potentiality|potency]] all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul [''[[psyche (psychology)|psychē]]''] too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect [''nous''] by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition [''[[hexis]]''] like [[light]] too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors [''to phōs poiei ta [[dunamis|dunamei]] onta chrōmata [[energeia]]i chrōmata''].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a [[being-at-work]] [''energeia''], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] [''epistēmē''], in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does" according to his distinction between potentiality and actuality.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; Aristotle says that the passive intellect receives the [[intelligible form]]s of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colours into actual colours. As Davidson remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage is often read together with ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle makes ''nous'' as an actuality a central subject within a discussion of the cause of being and the cosmos. In that book, Aristotle equates active ''nous'', when people think and their ''nous'' becomes what they think about, with the "[[unmoved mover]]" of the universe, and [[God]]: "For the actuality of thought (''nous'') is life, and God is that actuality; and the essential actuality of God is life most good and eternal."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Metaphysics'' [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052&amp;layout=&amp;loc=12.1072b 1072b].&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander of Aphrodisias, for example, equated this active intellect which is God with the one explained in ''De Anima'', while Themistius thought they could not be simply equated. (See below.)

Like Plato before him, Aristotle believes Anaxagoras' cosmic ''nous'' implies and requires the cosmos to have intentions or ends: "Anaxagoras makes the Good a principle as causing motion; for Mind (''nous'') moves things, but moves them for some end, and therefore there must be some other Good—unless it is as we say; for on our view the art of medicine is in a sense health."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D12%3Asection%3D1075b 1075]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the philosophy of Aristotle the soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]) of a body is what makes it alive, and is its actualized form; thus, every living thing, including plant life, has a soul. The mind or intellect (''nous'') can be described variously as a power, faculty, part, or aspect of the human soul. It should be noted that for Aristotle soul and ''nous'' are not the same. He did not rule out the possibility that ''nous'' might survive without the rest of the soul, as in Plato, but he specifically says that this immortal ''nous'' does not include any memories or anything else specific to an individual's life. In his ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' Aristotle specifically says that while other parts of the soul come from the parents, physically, the human ''nous'', must come from outside, into the body, because it is divine or godly, and it has nothing in common with the ''energeia'' of the body.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Generation of Animals]]'' II.iii.736b.&lt;/ref&gt; This was yet another passage which Alexander of Aphrodisias would link to those mentioned above from ''De Anima'' and the ''Metaphysics'' in order to understand Aristotle's intentions.

===Post Aristotelian classical theories===
Until the early modern era, much of the discussion which has survived today concerning ''nous'' or intellect, in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, concerned how to correctly interpret Aristotle and Plato. However, at least during the classical period, materialist philosophies, more similar to modern science, such as [[Epicureanism]], were still relatively common also. The Epicureans believed that the bodily senses themselves were not the cause of error, but the interpretations can be. The term ''[[Proslepsis|prolepsis]]'' was used by Epicureans to describe the way the mind forms general concepts from sense perceptions.

To the [[Stoics]], more like Heraclitus than Anaxagoras, order in the cosmos comes from an entity called [[logos]], the [[Cosmos|cosmic]] [[reason]]. But as in Anaxagoras this cosmic reason, like human reason but higher, is connected to the reason of individual humans. The Stoics however, did not invoke incorporeal causation, but attempted to explain physics and human thinking in terms of matter and forces. As in Aristotelianism, they explained the interpretation of sense data requiring the mind to be stamped or formed with ideas, and that people have shared conceptions that help them make sense of things (''[[koine ennoia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nous'' for them is soul "somehow disposed" (''pôs echon''), the soul being somehow disposed ''[[pneuma]]'', which is fire or air or a mixture. As in Plato, they treated ''nous'' as the ruling part of the soul.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;

[[Plutarch]] criticized the Stoic idea of ''nous'' being corporeal, and agreed with Plato that the soul is more divine than the body while ''nous'' (mind) is more divine than the soul.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt; The mix of soul and body produces [[pleasure]] and [[pain]]; the conjunction of mind and soul produces [[reason]] which is the cause or the source of [[virtue]] and [[vice]]. (From: “On the Face in the Moon”) &lt;ref&gt;[[Lacus Curtius]] online text: On the Face in the Moon [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/The_Face_in_the_Moon*/D.html#28 par. 28]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albinus (philosopher)|Albinus]] was one of the earliest authors to equate Aristotle's ''nous'' as [[primum movens|prime mover]] of the Universe, with Plato's [[Form of the Good]].&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;

====Alexander of Aphrodisias====
{{Main article|Alexander of Aphrodisias}}
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] was a [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] (Aristotelian) and his ''On the Soul'' (referred to as ''De anima'' in its traditional Latin title), explained that by his interpretation of Aristotle, potential intellect in man, that which has no nature but receives one from the active intellect, is material, and also called the "material intellect" (''nous hulikos'') and it is inseparable from the body, being "only a disposition" of it.&lt;ref&gt;''De anima'' 84, cited in Davidson, page 9, who translated the quoted words.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued strongly against the doctrine of immortality.&lt;ref name=EB-alex&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Alexander of Aphrodisias |volume=1 |page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, he identified the active intellect (''nous poietikos''), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, not with anything from within people, but with the divine creator itself.&lt;ref name=EB-alex/&gt; In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] against the [[Thomists]] and the [[Averroists]].&lt;ref name=EB-alex/&gt; For him, the only possible human immortality is an immortality of a detached human thought, more specifically when the ''nous'' has as the object of its thought the active intellect itself, or another incorporeal intelligible form.&lt;ref name="Davidson p.43"&gt;Davidson p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was also responsible for influencing the development of several more technical terms concerning the intellect, which became very influential amongst the great Islamic philosophers, [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]].
*The intellect ''in habitu'' is a stage in which the human intellect has taken possession of a repertoire of thoughts, and so is potentially able to think those thoughts, but is not yet thinking these thoughts.
*The intellect from outside, which became the "acquired intellect" in Islamic philosophy, describes the incorporeal active intellect which comes from outside man, and becomes an object of thought, making the material intellect actual and active. This term may have come from a particularly expressive translation of Alexander into Arabic. Plotinus also used such a term.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, in Al-Farabi and Avicenna, the term took on a new meaning, distinguishing it from the active intellect in any simple sense - an ultimate stage of the human intellect where a kind of close relationship (a "conjunction") is made between a person's active intellect and the transcendental ''nous'' itself.

====Themistius====
{{Main article|Themistius}}
[[Themistius]], another influential commentator on this matter, understood Aristotle differently, stating that the passive or material intellect does "not employ a bodily organ for its activity, is wholly unmixed with the body, impassive, and separate [from matter]".&lt;ref&gt;Translation and citation by Davidson again, from Themistius' paraphrase of Aristotle's ''[[De Anima]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the human potential intellect, and not only the active intellect, is an incorporeal substance, or a disposition of incorporeal substance. For Themistius, the human soul becomes immortal "as soon as the active intellect intertwines with it at the outset of human thought".&lt;ref name="Davidson p.43"/&gt;

This understanding of the intellect was also very influential for [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]], and "virtually all Islamic and Jewish philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, concerning the active intellect, like Alexander and Plotinus, he saw this as a transcendent being existing above and outside man. Differently from Alexander, he did not equate this being with the first cause of the Universe itself, but something lower.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However he equated it with Plato's [[Idea of the Good]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plotinus and neoplatonism==
{{Main article|Plotinus|Neoplatonism|Porphyry (philosopher)|Proclus}}
Of the later Greek and Roman writers [[Plotinus]], the initiator of [[neoplatonism]], is particularly significant. Like Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius, he saw himself as a commentator explaining the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. But in his ''[[Enneads]]'' he went further than those authors, often working from passages which had been presented more tentatively, possibly inspired partly by earlier authors such as the [[neopythagorean]] [[Numenius of Apamea]]. Neoplatonism provided a major inspiration to discussion concerning the intellect in late classical and medieval philosophy, theology and cosmology.

In neoplatonism there exists several levels or ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]]'' of being, including the natural and visible world as a lower part.
*The [[Monism|Monad]] or "the One" sometimes also described as "[[the Good]]", based on the concept as it is found in Plato. This is the ''[[dunamis]]'' or possibility of existence. It causes the other levels by [[emanation]].
*The ''Nous'' (usually translated as "Intellect", or "Intelligence" in this context, or sometimes "mind" or "reason") is described as God, or more precisely an image of God, often referred to as the ''[[Demiurge]]''. It thinks its own contents, which are thoughts, equated to the Platonic ideas or [[Theory of Forms|forms]] (''eide''). The thinking of this Intellect is the highest ''activity'' of life. The ''actualization'' (''[[energeia]]'') of this thinking is the being of the forms. This Intellect is the first principle or foundation of existence. The One is prior to it, but not in the sense that a normal cause is prior to an effect, but instead Intellect is called an [[emanation]] of the One. The One is the possibility of this foundation of existence.
*[[Soul]] (''psychē''). The soul is also an ''energeia'': it acts upon or ''actualizes'' its own thoughts and creates "a separate, material cosmos that is the living image of the spiritual or noetic [[Cosmos]] contained as a unified thought within the Intelligence". So it is the soul which perceives things in nature physically, which it understands to be reality. Soul in Plotinus plays a role similar to the potential intellect in Aristotelian terminology.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;
*Lowest is matter.
This was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the [[Unmoved Mover]] as ''energeia''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}} and {{citation |chapter=Plotinus|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/|last=Gerson|first=Lloyd}}. The direct quote above comes from Moore.&lt;/ref&gt; They also incorporated a theory of ''anamnesis'', or knowledge coming from the past lives of our immortal souls, like that found in some of Plato's dialogues.

Later [[Platonists]] distinguished a hierarchy of three separate manifestations of ''nous'', like Numenius of Apamea had.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of The Study in Philosophy'' (1969), Vol. 5, article on subject "Nous", article author: G.B. Kerferd&lt;/ref&gt; Notable later neoplatonists include [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Proclus]].

==Medieval ''nous'' in religion==&lt;!--Linked from 'Noetics'--&gt;
Greek philosophy had an influence on the major religions that defined the [[Middle Ages]], and one aspect of this was the concept of ''nous''.

===Gnosticism===
{{Gnosticism}}
{{Main article|Gnosticism|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}
Gnosticism was a [[late antiquity|late classical]] movement that incorporated ideas inspired by neoplatonism and neopythagoreanism, but which was more a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement than an accepted philosophical movement.

====Valentinus====
{{Main article|Valentinus (Gnostic)}}
In [[Valentinianism]], Nous is the first male [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]. Together with his conjugate female Aeon, Aletheia (truth), he emanates from the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Propator Bythos]] ({{lang|grc|Προπάτωρ Βυθος}} "Forefather Depths") and his co-eternal Ennoia ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt: ἔννοια|Ἔννοια]]}} "Thought") or Sigē ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:σιγή|Σιγή]]}} "Silence"); and these four form the primordial [[Tetractys|Tetrad]]. Like the other male Aeons he is sometimes regarded as [[androgyny|androgynous]], including in himself the female Aeon who is paired with him. He is the Only Begotten; and is styled the Father, the Beginning of All, inasmuch as from him are derived immediately or mediately the remaining Aeons who complete the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]] (eight), thence the Decad (ten), and thence the Dodecad (twelve); in all, thirty Aeons constitute the [[Pleroma]].

He alone is capable of knowing the Propator; but when he desired to impart like knowledge to the other Aeons, was withheld from so doing by Sigē. When [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] ("Wisdom"), youngest Aeon of the thirty, was brought into peril by her yearning after this knowledge, Nous was foremost of the Aeons in interceding for her. From him, or through him from the Propator, [[Valentinianism#Horos|Horos]] was sent to restore her. After her restoration, Nous, according to the providence of the Propator, produced another pair, [[Christ]] and the [[Holy Spirit]], "in order to give fixity and steadfastness ({{lang|grc|εις πήξιν και στηριγμόν}}) to the Pleroma." For this Christ teaches the Aeons to be content to know that the Propator is in himself incomprehensible, and can be perceived only through the Only Begotten (Nous).&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus]], ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis]]'', I. i. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'', vi. 29-31; [[Theodoret]], ''Haer. Fab.'' i. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Basilides====
{{Main article|Basilides}}
A similar conception of Nous appears in the later teaching of the [[Basilideans]], according to which he is the first begotten of the Unbegotten Father, and himself the parent of ''[[Logos]]'', from whom emanate successively ''[[Phronesis]]'', ''Sophia'', and ''[[potentiality and actuality|Dunamis]]''. But in this teaching, Nous is identified with Christ, is named [[Jesus]], is sent to save those that believe, and returns to Him who sent him, after a [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] which is apparent only, [[Simon of Cyrene]] being substituted for him on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Iren. I. xxiv. 4; Theod. ''H. E.'' i. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable, however, that Nous had a place in the original system of Basilides himself; for his ''Ogdoad'', "the great [[Archon]] of the universe, the ineffable"&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently made up of the five members named by [[Irenaeus]] (as above), together with two whom we find in [[Clement of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata|Strom]].'' iv. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dikaiosyne'' and ''Eirene'', added to the originating Father.

====Simon Magus====
{{Main article|Simon Magus}}
The antecedent of these systems is that of Simon,&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 12 ff.; Theod. I. i.&lt;/ref&gt; of whose six "roots" emanating from the Unbegotten Fire, ''Nous'' is first. The correspondence of these "roots" with the first six ''Aeons'' that Valentinus derives from ''Bythos'', is noted by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon says in his ''[[Simonians#The Great Declaration|Apophasis Megalē]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ap. Hipp. vi. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There are two offshoots of the entire ages, having neither beginning nor end.... Of these the one appears from above, the great power, the ''Nous'' of the universe, administering all things, male; the other from beneath, the great ''Epinoia'', female, bringing forth all things.}}
To Nous and ''Epinoia'' correspond Heaven and Earth, in the list given by Simon of the six material counterparts of his six emanations. The identity of this list with the six material objects alleged by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], i.&lt;/ref&gt; to be worshipped by the [[Persian people|Persians]], together with the supreme place given by Simon to Fire as the primordial power, leads us to look to [[history of Iran|Iran]] for the origin of these systems in one aspect. In another, they connect themselves with the teaching of [[Pythagoras]] and of Plato.

====''Gospel of Mary''====
{{Main article|Gospel of Mary}}
According to the ''Gospel of Mary'', Jesus himself articulates the essence of ''Nous'':
{{quote|"There where is the ''nous'', lies the treasure." Then I said to him: "Lord, when someone meets you in a Moment of Vision, is it through the soul [''psychē''] that they see, or is it through the spirit [''pneuma'']?" The Teacher answered: "It is neither through the soul nor the spirit, but the ''nous'' between the two which sees the vision..."|''The Gospel of Mary'', p. 10}}

===Medieval Islamic philosophy===
{{Main article|Islamic philosophy|Jewish philosophy|Averroism}}
During the [[Middle Ages]], philosophy itself was in many places seen as opposed to the prevailing monotheistic religions, [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]. The strongest philosophical tradition for some centuries was amongst Islamic philosophers, who later came to strongly influence the late medieval philosophers of western Christendom, and the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the Mediterranean area. While there were earlier Muslim philosophers such as [[Al Kindi]], chronologically the three most influential concerning the intellect were [[Al Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and finally [[Averroes]], a westerner who lived in Spain and was highly influential in the late Middle Ages amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers.

====Al Farabi====
{{Main article|Al Farabi}}
The exact precedents of Al Farabi's influential philosophical scheme, in which ''nous'' (Arabic ''[['aql|ʿaql]]'') plays an important role, are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the Middle Ages which he would have had access to. He was apparently innovative in at least some points. He was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism, neopythagoreanism, but exactly how is less clear. Plotinus, Themistius and Alexander of Aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences. However while these three all placed the active intellect "at or near the top of the hierarchy of being", Al Farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences. He is the first known person to have done this in a clear way.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.12-14. One possible inspiration mentioned in a commentary of Aristotle's ''[[De Anima]]'' attributed to [[John Philoponus]] is a philosopher named Marinus, who was probably a student of [[Proclus]]. He in any case designated the active intellect to be angelic or daimonic, rather than the creator itself.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of [[celestial spheres]], and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.18 and p.45, which states "Within the translunar region, Aristotle recognized no causal relationship in what we may call the vertical plane; he did not recognize a causality that runs down through the series of incorporeal movers. And in the horizontal plane, that is, from each intelligence to the corresponding sphere, he recognized causality only in respect to motion, not in respect to existence."&lt;/ref&gt; Al Farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme, in two levels. According to Davidson (p.&amp;nbsp;59):&lt;blockquote&gt;The lower of the two levels, labeled specifically as "[[prophecy]]" (''nubuwwa''), is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect, whereas the higher, which Alfarabi sometimes specifically names "[[revelation]]" (''w-ḥ-y''), comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This happens in the [[imagination]] (Arabic ''mutakhayyila''; Greek ''phantasia''), a faculty of the mind already described by Aristotle, which al Farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul (Arabic ''ʿaql''; Greek ''nous''). This faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions (''maḥsūsāt''), disassembles or recombines them, creates figurative or symbolic images (''muḥākāt'') of them which then appear in dreams, visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation (''rawiyya''). This is under the influence, according to Al Farabi, of the active intellect. Theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form, because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form. This rarely comes in a waking state, but more often in dreams. The lower type of prophecy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty, but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination, but also the condition of an "acquired intellect", where the human ''nous'' is in "conjunction" with the active intellect in the sense of God. Such a prophet is also a philosopher. When a philosopher-prophet has the necessary leadership qualities, he becomes philosopher-king.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Avicenna====
{{Main article|Avicenna}}
In terms of cosmology, according to Davidson (p.&amp;nbsp;82) "Avicenna's universe has a structure virtually identical with the structure of Alfarabi's" but there are differences in details. As in Al Farabi, there are several levels of intellect, intelligence or ''nous'', each of the higher ones being associated with a celestial sphere. Avicenna however details three different types of effect which each of these higher intellects has, each "thinks" both the necessary existence and the possible being of the intelligence one level higher. And each "emanates" downwards the body and soul of its own celestial sphere, and also the intellect at the next lowest level. The active intellect, as in Alfarabi, is the last in the chain. Avicenna sees active intellect as the cause not only of intelligible thought and the forms in the "sublunar" world we people live, but also the matter. (In other words, three effects.)&lt;ref name=Davidson4&gt;Davidson ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the workings of the human soul, Avicenna, like Al Farabi, sees the "material intellect" or potential intellect as something that is not material. He believed the soul was incorporeal, and the potential intellect was a disposition of it which was in the soul from birth. As in Al Farabi there are two further stages of potential for thinking, which are not yet actual thinking, first the mind acquires the most basic intelligible thoughts which we can not think in any other way, such as "the whole is greater than the part", then comes a second level of derivative intelligible thoughts which could be thought.&lt;ref name=Davidson4/&gt; Concerning the actualization of thought, Avicenna applies the term "to two different things, to actual human thought, irrespective of the intellectual progress a man has made, and to actual thought when human intellectual development is complete", as in Al Farabi.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

When reasoning in the sense of deriving conclusions from [[syllogisms]], Avicenna says people are using a physical "cogitative" faculty (''mufakkira, fikra'') of the soul, which can err. The human cogitative faculty is the same as the "compositive imaginative faculty (''mutakhayyila'') in reference to the animal soul".&lt;ref&gt;From ''Shifā': De Anima'' 45, translation by Davidson p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; But some people can use "insight" to avoid this step and derive conclusions directly by conjoining with the active intellect.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a thought has been learned in a soul, the physical faculties of sense perception and imagination become unnecessary, and as a person acquires more thoughts, their soul becomes less connected to their body.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.104&lt;/ref&gt; For Avicenna, different from the normal Aristotelian position, all of the soul is by nature immortal. But the level of intellectual development does affect the type of afterlife that the soul can have. Only a soul which has reached the highest type of conjunction with the active intellect can form a perfect conjunction with it after the death of the body, and this is a supreme ''[[eudaimonia]]''. Lesser intellectual achievement means a less happy or even painful afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.111-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning prophecy, Avicenna identifies a broader range of possibilities which fit into this model, which is still similar to that of Al Farabi.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Averroes====
{{Main article|Averroes|Averroism}}
Averroes came to be regarded even in Europe as "the Commentator" to "the Philosopher", Aristotle, and his study of the questions surrounding the ''nous'' were very influential amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers, with some aspects being quite controversial. According to Herbert Davidson, Averroes' doctrine concerning ''nous'' can be divided into two periods. In the first, neoplatonic emanationism, not found in the original works of Aristotle, was combined with a naturalistic explanation of the human material intellect. "It also insists on the material intellect's having an active intellect as a direct object of thought and conjoining with the active intellect, notions never expressed in the Aristotelian canon." It was this presentation which Jewish philosophers such as [[Moses Narboni]] and [[Gersonides]] understood to be Averroes'. In the later model of the universe, which was transmitted to Christian philosophers, Averroes "dismisses emanationism and explains the generation of living beings in the sublunar world naturalistically, all in the name of a more genuine Aristotelianism. Yet it abandons the earlier naturalistic conception of the human material intellect and transforms the material intellect into something wholly un-Aristotelian, a single transcendent entity serving all mankind. It nominally salvages human conjunction with the active intellect, but in words that have little content."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.356&lt;/ref&gt;

This position, that humankind shares one active intellect, was taken up by Parisian philosophers such as [[Siger of Brabant]], but also widely rejected by philosophers such as [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Ramon Lull]], and [[Duns Scotus]]. Despite being widely considered heretical, the position was later defended by many more European philosophers including [[John of Jandun]], who was the primary link bringing this doctrine from Paris to Bologna. After him this position continued to be defended and also rejected by various writers in northern Italy. In the 16th century it finally became a less common position after the renewal of an "Alexandrian" position based on that of Alexander of Aphrodisias, associated with [[Pietro Pomponazzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson ch.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The Christian [[New Testament]] makes mention of the ''nous'' or ''noos'', generally translated in modern English as "mind", but also showing a link to God's will or law:
*{{bibleverse||Romans|7:23|KJV}}, refers to the law (''nomos'') of God which is the law in the writer's ''nous'', as opposed to the law of sin which is in the body. 
*{{bibleverse||Romans|12:2|KJV}}, demands Christians should not conform to this world, but continuously be transformed by the renewing of their ''nous'', so as to be able to determine what God’s will is.
*{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|14:14|KJV}}-{{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|14:19|KJV}}. Discusses "[[speaking in tongues]]" and says that a person who speaks in tongues that they can not understand should prefer to also have understanding (''nous''), and it is better for the listeners also to be able to understand. 
*{{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:17|KJV}}-{{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:23|KJV}}. Discusses how non-Christians have a worthless ''nous'', while Christians should seek to renew the spirit (''pneuma'') of their ''nous''.
*{{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:2|KJV}}. Uses the term to refer to being troubled of mind.
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|17:9|KJV}}: "here is the ''nous'' which has wisdom".

In the writings of the [[Church Fathers|Christian fathers]] a sound or pure ''nous'' is considered essential to the cultivation of [[wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the many references to ''nous'' and the necessity of its purification in the writings of the [[Philokalia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophers influencing western Christianity====
While philosophical works were not commonly read or taught in the early Middle Ages in most of Europe, the works of authors like [[Boethius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] formed an important exception. Both were influenced by neoplatonism, and were amongst the older works that were still known in the time of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], and the beginnings of [[Scholasticism]].

In his early years Augustine was heavily influenced by [[Manichaeism]] and afterwards by the [[Neo-Platonism]] of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref name="Oxford:Platonism"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Cross, Frank L. |editor2=Livingstone, Elizabeth |chapter=Platonism| title = The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-19-280290-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conversion to Christianity and baptism (387), he developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Augustine the Theologian|last= TeSelle |first= Eugene |year= 1970 | location= London |pages= 347–349 | isbn= 0-223-97728-4}} March 2002 edition: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine]] used [[neoplatonism]] selectively. He used both the neoplatonic ''Nous'', and the Platonic [[Form of the Good]] (or ''"The Idea of the Good"'') as equivalent terms for the Christian God, or at least for one particular aspect of God. For example, God, ''nous'', can act directly upon matter, and not only through souls, and concerning the souls through which it works upon the world experienced by humanity, some are treated as [[angels]].&lt;ref name=Menn&gt;{{citation |title=Descartes and Augustine|last=Menn|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholasticism becomes more clearly defined much later, as the peculiar native type of philosophy in medieval catholic Europe. In this period, Aristotle became "the Philosopher", and scholastic philosophers, like their Jewish and Muslim contemporaries, studied the concept of the ''intellectus'' on the basis not only of Aristotle, but also late classical interpreters like Augustine and Boethius. A European tradition of new and direct interpretations of Aristotle developed which was eventually strong enough to argue with partial success against some of the interpretations of Aristotle from the Islamic world, most notably Averroes' doctrine of their being one "active intellect" for all humanity. Notable "[[Catholic]]" (as opposed to Averroist) Aristotelians included [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], the founder [[Thomism]], which exists to this day in various forms. Concerning the ''nous'', Thomism agrees with those Aristotelians who insist that the intellect is immaterial and separate from any bodily organs, but as per Christian doctrine, the whole of the human soul is immortal, not only the intellect.

====Eastern Orthodox====
The human ''nous'' in [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] is the "eye of the heart or soul" or the "mind of the heart".&lt;ref name="Neptic Monasticism"&gt;[http://www.greekorthodoxchurch.org/neptic_monasticism.html Neptic Monasticism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/patristic-theology-romanides-chapter-1-what-is-the-human-nous.aspx "What is the Human Nous?"] by [[John Romanides]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Before embarking on this study, the reader is asked to absorb a few Greek terms for which there is no English word that would not be imprecise or misleading. Chief among these is NOUS, which refers to the `eye of the heart' and is often translated as mind or intellect. Here we keep the Greek word NOUS throughout. The adjective related to it is NOETIC (noeros)." [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.06.htm#2k Orthodox Psychotherapy Section The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas] by Metropolitan [[Hierotheos (Vlachos)|Hierotheos Vlachos]] published by Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece (January 1, 2005) {{ISBN|978-960-7070-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997.

[[Saint]] [[Thalassius of Syria]] wrote that God created  beings "with a capacity to receive the Spirit and to attain knowledge of Himself; He has brought into existence the senses and sensory perception to serve such beings". Eastern Orthodox Christians hold that God did this by creating mankind with intelligence and [[:wikt:noetic|noetic]] faculties.&lt;ref&gt;G.E.H; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy). The [[Philokalia]], Vol. 4 Pg432
Nous the highest facility in man, through which - provided it is purified - he knows God or the [[logos|inner essences]] or principles (q.v.) of created things by means of [[noesis|direct apprehension]] or spiritual perception. Unlike the dianoia or reason (q.v.), from which it must be carefully distinguished, the intellect does not function by formulating abstract concepts and then arguing on this basis to a conclusion reached through deductive reasoning, but it understands divine truth by means of immediate experience, intuition or 'simple cognition' (the term used by St Isaac the Syrian). The intellect dwells in the 'depths of the soul'; it constitutes the innermost aspect of the heart (St Diadochos, 79, 88: in our translation, vol. i, pp.. 280, 287). The intellect is the organ of contemplation (q.v.), the 'eye of the heart' (Makarian Homilies).&lt;/ref&gt;

Human reasoning is not enough: there will always remain an "irrational residue" which escapes analysis and which can not be expressed in concepts: it is this unknowable depth of things, that which constitutes their true, indefinable essence that also reflects the origin of things in God. In Eastern Christianity it is by faith or intuitive truth that this component of an objects existence is grasped.&lt;ref name=lossky&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, by Vladimir Lossky SVS Press, 1997, pg 33 ({{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}). James Clarke &amp; Co Ltd, 1991, pg 71 ({{ISBN|0-227-67919-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Though God through his energies draws us to him, his essence remains inaccessible.&lt;ref name=lossky/&gt; The operation of faith being the means of [[free will]] by which mankind faces the future or unknown, these noetic operations contained in the concept of [[insight]] or ''noesis''.&lt;ref&gt;ANTHROPOLOGICAL TURN IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY:
AN ORTHODOX PERSPECTIVE by Sergey S. Horujy [synergia-isa.ru/english/download/lib/Eng12-ChicLect.doc] [http://www.hn.psu.edu/Academics/past_lectures.html#Sergei_Horujy_Literary_Scholar]&lt;/ref&gt; Faith (''pistis'') is therefore sometimes used interchangeably with ''noesis'' in [[Eastern Christianity]].

Angels have intelligence and ''nous'', whereas men have [[reason]], both ''logos'' and ''[[dianoia]]'', ''nous'' and [[sensory perception]]. This follows the idea that man is a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] and an expression of the whole creation or [[macrocosmos]]. The human ''nous'' was darkened after the [[Fall of Man]] (which was the result of the rebellion of reason against the ''nous''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b05.en.the_illness_and_cure_of_the_soul.02.htm#Fall "THE ILLNESS AND CURE OF THE SOUL"] Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos&lt;/ref&gt; but after the purification (healing or correction) of the ''nous'' (achieved through ascetic practices like [[hesychasm]]), the human ''nous'' (the "eye of the heart") will [[theoria|see God's uncreated Light]] (and feel God's uncreated love and beauty, at which point the nous will start the unceasing [[prayer of the heart]]) and become illuminated, allowing the person to become an orthodox theologian.&lt;ref name="Neptic Monasticism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrod.org/sn/sn4a.shtml The Relationship between Prayer and Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011114120/http://www.acrod.org/sn/sn4a.shtml |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://romanity.org/htm/rom.19.en.jesus_christ_the_life_of_the_world.01.htm "JESUS CHRIST - THE LIFE OF THE WORLD", John S. Romanides]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this belief, the soul is created in the image of God. Since God is [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]], Mankind is ''Nous'', [[reason]], both ''logos'' and ''dianoia'', and Spirit. The same is held true of the soul (or heart): it has ''nous'', word and spirit. To understand this better first an understanding of Saint [[Gregory Palamas]]'s teaching that man is a representation of the trinitarian mystery should be addressed. This holds that God is not meant in the sense that the [[Trinity]] should be understood [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphically]], but man is to be understood in a triune way.  Or, that the Trinitarian God is not to be interpreted from the point of view of individual man, but man is interpreted on the basis of the Trinitarian God. And this interpretation is revelatory not merely psychological and human. This means that it is only when a person is within the revelation, as all the saints lived, that he can grasp this understanding completely (see ''[[theoria]]''). The second presupposition is that mankind has and is composed of ''nous'', word and spirit like the trinitarian mode of being. Man's ''nous'', word and spirit are not [[hypostases]] or individual existences or realities, but activities or energies of the soul - whereas in the case with God or the Persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], each are indeed hypostases. So these three components of each individual man are 'inseparable from one another' but they do not have a personal character" when in speaking of the being or [[ontology]] that is mankind. The ''nous'' as the eye of the soul, which some Fathers also call the heart, is the centre of man and is where true (spiritual) knowledge is validated. This is seen as true knowledge which is "implanted in the ''nous'' as always co-existing with it".&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan [[Hierotheos Vlachos]] (2005), [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.03.htm#in1 ''Orthodox Psychotherapy''], Tr.  Esther E. Cunningham Williams (Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece), {{ISBN|978-960-7070-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern philosophy==
The so-called [[early modern philosophy|"early modern" philosophers]] of western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries established arguments which led to the establishment of [[modern science]] as a methodical approach to improve the welfare of [[human]]ity by learning to control nature. As such, speculation about [[metaphysics]], which cannot be used for anything practical, and which can never be confirmed against the reality we experience, started to be deliberately avoided, especially according to the so-called "[[empiricist]]" arguments of philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]]. The Latin motto "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses) has been described as the "guiding principle of empiricism" in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100234623|title=nihil in intellectu nisi prius in sensu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was in fact an old Aristotelian doctrine, which they took up, but as discussed above Aristotelians still believed that the senses on their own were not enough to explain the mind.)

These philosophers explain the intellect as something developed from experience of sensations, being interpreted by the brain in a physical way, and nothing else, which means that [[absolute knowledge]] is impossible. For Bacon, Hobbes and Locke, who wrote in both English and Latin, "''intellectus''" was translated as "understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Martinich|page=305|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|first=Aloysius|publisher=Blackwell|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from seeing it as secure way to perceive the truth about reality, Bacon, for example, actually named the ''intellectus'' in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and the [[wikt:proœmium|proœmium]] to his ''[[Great Instauration]]'', as a major source of wrong conclusions, because it is biased in many ways, for example towards over-generalizing. For this reason, modern science should be methodical, in order not to be misled by the weak human intellect. He felt that lesser known Greek philosophers such as [[Democritus]] "who did not suppose a mind or reason in the frame of things", have been arrogantly dismissed because of Aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein "the search of the physical causes hath been neglected, and passed in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Bacon ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft#page/90/mode/2up/search/democritus II.VII.7]&lt;/ref&gt; The intellect or understanding was the subject of Locke's ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nidditch|first=Peter|chapter=Foreword|page=xxii|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These philosophers also tended not to emphasize the distinction between reason and intellect, describing the peculiar universal or abstract definitions of human understanding as being man-made and resulting from reason itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Thomas|last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan) |chapter=II. Of Imagination|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;chapter=89820&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27}} and also see ''[[De Homine]]'' X.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume even questioned the distinctness or peculiarity of human understanding and reason, compared to other types of associative or imaginative thinking found in some other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.III.VII (footnote) Of the Nature of the Idea Or Belief|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55095&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#lf0213_footnote_nt018|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern science during this time, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] is sometimes described as more empiricist compared to Leibniz.

On the other hand, into modern times some philosophers have continued to propose that the human mind has an in-born ("''a priori''") ability to know the truth conclusively, and these philosophers have needed to argue that the human mind has direct and intuitive ideas about nature, and this means it can not be limited entirely to what can be known from sense perception. Amongst the early modern philosophers, some such as [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], tend to be distinguished from the empiricists as [[rationalists]], and to some extent at least some of them are called [[idealists]], and their writings on the intellect or understanding present various doubts about empiricism, and in some cases they argued for positions which appear more similar to those of medieval and classical philosophers.

The first in this series of modern rationalists, Descartes, is credited with defining a "[[mind-body problem]]" which is a major subject of discussion for university philosophy courses. According to the presentation his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation II: Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That It Is Better Known Than the Body|2nd ''Meditation'']], the human mind and body are different in kind, and while Descartes agrees with Hobbes for example that the human body works like a clockwork mechanism, and its workings include memory and imagination, the real human is the thinking being, a soul, which is not part of that mechanism. Descartes explicitly refused to divide this soul into its traditional parts such as intellect and reason, saying that these things were indivisible aspects of the soul. Descartes was therefore a [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]], but very much in opposition to traditional Aristotelian dualism. In his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body|6th ''Meditation'']] he deliberately uses traditional terms and states that his active faculty of giving ideas to his thought must be corporeal, because the things perceived are clearly external to his own thinking and corporeal, while his passive faculty must be incorporeal (unless God is deliberately deceiving us, and then in this case the active faculty would be from God). This is the opposite of the traditional explanation found for example in Alexander of Aphrodisias and discussed above, for whom the passive intellect is material, while the active intellect is not. One result is that in many Aristotelian conceptions of the ''nous'', for example that of [[Thomas Aquinas]], the senses are still a source of all the intellect's conceptions. However, with the strict separation of mind and body proposed by Descartes, it becomes possible to propose that there can be thought about objects never perceived with the body's senses, such as a [[chiliagon|thousand sided geometrical figure]]. [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] objected to this distinction between the imagination and the intellect in Descartes.&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also objected, and according to his own philosophical approach asserted that the "triangle in the mind comes from the triangle we have seen" and "[[essence]] in so far as it is distinguished from [[existence]] is nothing else than a union of names by means of the verb is". Descartes, in his reply to this objection insisted that this traditional distinction between essence and existence is "known to all".&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Blaise Pascal]], criticised him in similar words to those used by Plato's Socrates concerning Anaxagoras, discussed above, saying that "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i_cannot_forgive_descartes-in_all_his_philosophy/153298.html Think Exist on Blaise Pascal]. Retrieved 12 Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes argued that when the intellect does a job of helping people interpret what they perceive, not with the help of an intellect which enters from outside, but because each human mind comes into being with innate God-given ideas, more similar then, to Plato's theory of ''anamnesis'', only not requiring [[reincarnation]]. Apart from such examples as the geometrical definition of a triangle, another example is the idea of God, according to the 3rd ''Meditation''. Error, according to the 4th ''Meditation'', comes about because people make judgments about things which are not in the intellect or understanding. This is possible because the human [[will (philosophy)|will]], being free, is not limited like the human intellect.

Spinoza, though considered a Cartesian and a rationalist, rejected Cartesian dualism and idealism. In his "[[pantheistic]]" approach, explained for example in his ''Ethics'', God is the same as nature, the human intellect is just the same as the human will. The divine intellect of nature is quite different from human intellect, because it is finite, but Spinoza does accept that the human intellect is a part of the infinite divine intellect.

Leibniz, in comparison to the guiding principle of the empiricists described above, added some words ''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu'', '''''nisi intellectus ipsi''''' ("nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses" ''except the intellect itself'').&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Despite being at the forefront of modern science, and modernist philosophy, in his writings he still referred to the active and passive intellect, a divine intellect, and the immortality of the active intellect.

[[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], partly in reaction to Locke, also attempted to reintroduce an "immaterialism" into early modern philosophy (later referred to as "[[subjective idealism]]" by others). He argued that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects, not abstractions such as "[[matter]]", and that ideas depend on perceiving minds for their very existence. This belief later became immortalized in the dictum, ''[[esse est percipi]]'' ("to be is to be perceived"). As in classical and medieval philosophy, Berkeley believed understanding had to be explained by divine intervention, and that all our ideas are put in our mind by God.

Hume accepted some of Berkeley's corrections of Locke, but in answer insisted, as had Bacon and Hobbes, that absolute knowledge is not possible, and that all attempts to show how it could be possible have logical problems. Hume's writings remain highly influential on all philosophy afterwards, and are for example considered by Kant to have shaken him from an intellectual slumber.

Kant, a turning point in modern philosophy, agreed with some classical philosophers and Leibniz that the intellect itself, although it needed sensory experience for understanding to begin, needs something else in order to make sense of the incoming sense information. In his formulation the intellect (''Verstand'') has ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate principles which it has before thinking even starts. Kant represents the starting point of [[German idealism]] and a new phase of modernity, while empiricist philosophy has also continued beyond Hume to the present day.

==More recent modern philosophy and science==
One of the results of the early modern philosophy has been the increasing creation of specialist fields of science, in areas that were once considered part of philosophy, and [[infant cognitive development]] and [[perception]] now tend to be discussed now more within the sciences of [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]] than in philosophy.

Modern mainstream thinking on the mind is not dualist, and sees anything innate in the mind as being a result of [[nature and nurture|genetic and developmental]] factors which allow the mind to develop. Overall it accepts far less innate "knowledge" (or clear pre-dispositions to particular types of knowledge) than most of the classical and medieval theories derived from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Al Farabi.

Apart from discussions about the history of philosophical discussion on this subject, contemporary philosophical discussion concerning this point has continued concerning what the ethical implications are of the different alternatives still considered likely.

Classical conceptions of nous are still discussed seriously in theology. There is also still discussion of classical nous in non-mainstream metaphysics or spiritualism, such as [[Noetics]], promoted for example by the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]].

[[Image:Protector-Niven-cropped.jpg|thumb|Phssthpok, a Pak Protector eating Tree-of-Life root in the Library on the Pak homeworld]]
'''Pak Breeders''' and '''Pak Protectors''' are two developmental stages of [[fictional]] life in [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe.  The Pak first appeared in "The Adults," which appeared in ''Galaxy'' in 1967;  this story was expanded into the novel [[Protector (novel)|''Protector'']]  by Larry Niven (1973).  The Pak also appear in several of Niven's later novels, notably those set in the [[Ringworld]].

''[[Destroyer of Worlds (novel)|Destroyer of Worlds]]'' depicts a confrontation between the Pak and the [[Pierson's Puppeteers|Puppeteers]].

== Narrative purpose ==

Niven has written that he invented the Protectors as a [[thought experiment]] to explain the common effects of aging on humans and to create a fictional evolutionary explanation for humans' long lives after females have passed reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, Larry. ''N-Space''. Tor Science Fiction, 1990, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, most of the positive attributes of Protectors are based on negative human aging effects: swollen joints, decreased muscle-fat ratio, weakening heart, invariant diet, decreasing height, facial atrophy, leathery skin, hair loss, lack of sex drive, and tooth loss are all turned to advantage during the shift from Breeder to Protector.

== The Pak species ==

In ''Protector'', we learn that humans are descended from the Pak.  Pak Children and Breeders appear in Earth's [[fossil record]] as ''[[Homo habilis]]'';  the few Pak Protectors to make it to Earth apparently are not found in the fossil record.

The Pak species goes through three stages of development: Child, Breeder and Protector.

'''Pak Child'''  is analogous to a human child:  sexually immature and dependent upon adults for survival.

'''Pak Breeder''' is analogous to a human adult:  sexually mature, self-sufficient (in later writings) and provides immediate care for the children. To the Pak, the Breeder stage, though capable of space travel, is not deemed fully sentient; Breeders, to a large extent, rely on Protectors for long-term survival. [[Ringworld|Earlier Niven stories]] describe the breeder as "just intelligent enough to swing a club or throw a stone."

'''Pak Protector''' is not analogous to any human form.  It is described as a 'fighting machine,' with armor-like skin, super-human strength and super-human intelligence.  Niven's stories that focus on the Pak mostly concentrate on the unique Protector-stage.

Niven explained the evolution of the Pak as resulting from high radiation levels on their home world near the core of the [[galaxy]].  The high radiation near the star-dense core caused severe mutations that can destabilize the evolutionary process. As a result, the Pak evolved a mechanism to eliminate dangerous mutations from the population. That mechanism is the protector stage.

Protectors are highly sensitive to the smell of their close relatives and "weed out" those that smell wrong, which may indicate a potentially dangerous mutation. This weeding also suppressed positive mutations, essentially halting Pak evolution. Protectors are fully sentient, and are far more intelligent than ordinary humans.  This "superior" intelligence, however, serves only a Pak Protector's instincts to protect its bloodline at any costs. The Pak have no drive toward the collection of "abstract knowledge," have no concept of "art," and do not even possess enough of an "artistic impulse" to understand the purpose of making sketches and paintings for reasons not directly useful.

The change from Breeder to Protector is the result of a [[peramorphosis|peramorphic]] transformation brought about by the plant known as [[Tree-of-Life]].  As humans (and all [[primates]]) are descended from the Pak, Tree-of-Life can create a Protector-stage human.

== Tree-of-Life ==

:''See also [[tree of life]] for other meanings of the term.

[[Tree-of-Life]] is the mechanism by which a Breeder becomes a Protector. The term originally is used to refer to a specific plant which, when consumed, triggers the transformation. The term "Tree-of-Life virus" is used to describe the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] virus which actually governs the transition.

Niven took the name Tree-of-Life from the [[Book of Genesis]]; specifically to the fruit of the "Tree of Life" that could make Adam and Eve immortal (Genesis 3:22-24), which is quoted as the foreword to the novel [[Protector (novel)|''Protector'']], and also mentioned by Brennan within the novel.

Tree-of-Life (the plant) is a bush native to the Pak homeworld. When a Breeder reaches the proper age (early 40s for humans), the smell of the root becomes irresistible; the Breeder gorges on the Tree-of-Life root, infecting itself with the Tree-of-Life virus and transforming into a Protector. The age window for the metamorphosis is relatively narrow (between 42 and 50 Earth years). Tree-of-Life is common on the Pak world, so there is almost no risk of a Breeder living past this window without being exposed to the roots.

The transition from Breeder to Protector involves reconfiguration of the anatomy. Skin thickens, becoming similar to leather armor, strong enough to turn a copper knife. Joints swell until the creature becomes "a parody of the human form done in [[cantaloupe]]s and [[coconut]]s". This increases leverage available to muscles by increasing the force of the [[moment (physics)|moment arm]], the result being that a protector can lift ten times its own weight. Genitalia and gonads vanish, and a second two-chambered heart forms in the groin at the fusion of the [[femoral vein]]s. The arms lengthen. Fingernails turn into retractable claws. Teeth fall out and the lips and gums fuse, the mouth forming a horny beak (flat in protectors transformed from humans, non-flat in protectors transformed from Pak). All the breeder's hair falls out and the head acquires a bony ridge to protect the newly expanded [[skull|cranium]]. The expanded skull allows the brain to grow to an enormous size; the resulting mind, even starting from something as "unintelligent" as a chimpanzee, becomes far more intelligent than a typical human. Pak Protectors also acquire an extended lifespan, and can live tens of thousands of Earth years (a common element in Niven's stories).

Once the transformation is complete, a Pak Protector must periodically consume more Tree-of-Life root to maintain the virus in its body. Without the virus, a Protector will weaken and die as its DNA is degraded; the virus supplies replacement DNA.

The Tree-of-Life crop on Earth failed due to there being insufficient [[thallium oxide]] in the Earth's [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|soil]]; the plants grew but didn't support the virus. As a result, the Protectors that led the colony to Earth died of starvation when their store of roots ran out.

== Protector behavior ==

Pak Protectors have an innate need to protect close relatives.  When a Pak Protector has no bloodline to protect, it usually stops eating and starves;  some childless Protectors can adopt the entire Pak race as their family.

Niven states that Protectors on the crowded Pak homeworld would constantly war against each other to gain advantage for their family and that alliances would last only until one ally sees advantage in betrayal.  Human Protectors, and those on the Ringworld, seem to be less warlike and better able to work for the betterment of the entire species (or all of the Ringworld hominids) rather than just their bloodline, though this may simply be a function of how few protectors with families encounter each other.

Protectors typically die from starvation (from lack of will to live, e.g. if the Protector's bloodline has died out) or violence.  Although Protectors have a vastly extended lifetime, it is not infinite; during the original half million year journey to Earth some protector colonists did die from old age.

Because of their enormous intelligence and instinctive need to protect their family (or their species, etc.), Protectors are efficient, ruthless and quite amoral.  It is observed several times that this intelligence combined with instinct also compels action so completely that Protectors often have little "free will".  Niven uses this trait as a plot device several times as characters set up circumstances where Protector characters will react in a specific manner.  In ''Protector'', Jack Brennan (a human turned into a Protector) commits [[genocide]] by exterminating the [[Martian]] race ("Aliens were dangerous, or might be, and Pak were not interested in anything but Pak") and also releases a genetically modified Tree-of-Life virus on the colony world Home, turning everyone middle aged into a Protector (and killing all other humans on the planet) in order to create an army of childless Protectors with which to fight the invading Pak fleet. It is indicated throughout Niven's works that humans (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') that have turned into protectors are far more intelligent than their Pak (''[[Homo habilis]]'') counterparts (in much the way that humans are more intelligent than the primates they evolved from).

Niven explains much of Protector behavior in his Future History, by revealing in ''[[Ringworld's Children]]'' that the [[Amalgamated Regional Militia|ARM]] may be run by at least one Protector and that Boosterspice (which dramatically prolongs human lifespan) is derived from Tree-of-Life.

== The Pak and Humanity ==

In ''Protector,'' Niven explains that humans (and all of Earth's primates) are descended from a colony of Pak breeders that were stranded on Earth 2.5 million years ago. The protectors that built the colony ship died when their Tree-of-Life crops failed.  The original Pak Breeder population (known to us as ''[[Homo habilis]]'') bred and mutated wildly, evolving into modern humans as well as all other Earth [[primates]].  All Terran primates would transform into the Protector stage if exposed to Tree-of-Life root (or, more accurately, the symbiotic virus it contains).

In ''The Ringworld Engineers,'' the characters find evidence that the [[Ringworld]] was built by Pak Protectors (confirmed by the statements of a character in ''Ringworld's Children'' who claims to be one of the original builders) and populated by Pak breeders. The Pak Protectors dwindled in numbers until they were no longer able to maintain the genetic purity of the breeder forms and the breeders eventually evolved into all the other hominids of the Ringworld that one sees in Larry Niven's novels.

In ''[[Destroyer of Worlds (novel)|Destroyer of Worlds]]'' (co-written by Niven and [[Edward M. Lerner]]), a human world (and the [[Pierson's Puppeteers]] of the [[Fleet of Worlds]]) confronts a Pak Protector war fleet. The trailing edge of that Pak fleet, carrying the primary Pak Library, also figures prominently in ''[[Betrayer of Worlds]]'', by the same authors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5695">'''Pirate utopias''' were defined by [[anarchist]] writer [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], who coined the term in his 1995 book ''Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs &amp; European Renegadoes'' as secret islands once used for supply purposes by [[pirate]]s. Wilson's concept is largely based on speculation, although he admits to adding a bit of fantasy to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Lamborn Wilson |url=http://hermetic.com/bey/pirate-utopias/pirate-utopias.html |title=Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs &amp; European Renegadoes |publisher=[[Autonomedia]]|ISBN=1-57027-158-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wilson's view, these pirate enclaves were early forms of autonomous proto-[[anarchism|anarchist]] societies in that they operated beyond the reach of [[government]]s and embraced unrestricted [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

== On the Barbary Coast ==
Located on the [[Barbary Coast]] ([[Salé]], [[Algiers]] and [[Tunis]]), these bases were havens for renegade [[Muslim]] pirates from the 16th to the 18th century. The pirates, dubbed "[[Barbary Corsairs]]", ravaged European shipping operations and enslaved many thousands of captives. However, thousands of Europeans also converted to Islam, forming the "Renegados" and joining the pirate [[religious war|holy war]]. Wilson writes that these men and women were not only [[Apostasy|apostates]] and [[Treason|traitors]], as they were considered in their homelands, but their voluntary betrayal of [[Christendom]] can also be thought of as a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] of social resistance.  Wilson focuses on the Pirate [[Republic of Salé]], in 17th century Morocco, which may have had its own lingua franca. Like some other pirate states, it even used to pass treaties from time to time with some European countries, agreeing not to attack their fleets. Wilson/Bey's idea of [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s developed from his historical review of pirate utopias. When describing them Wilson says "We've certainly had to use our imagination more than a "real" historian would allow, erecting a lot of suppositions on a shaky framework of generalizations, and adding a touch of fantasy (and what [[Pirate studies|piratologist]] has ever been able to resist fantasy?). I can only say that I've satisfied my own curiosity at least to this extent: That something like a [[Renegado]] culture could have existed; that all the ingredients for it were present, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguous]], and [[Synchronicity|synchronic]]."

==Libertatia==
{{mainarticle|Libertatia}}
[[Libertatia]] (also known as Libertalia) was a possibly fictional anarchist colony founded in the late 17th century in [[Madagascar]] by [[pirate]]s under the leadership of Captain James Misson. Whether or not Libertatia actually existed is disputed. It is described in the book ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' by [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Captain Charles Johnson]], an otherwise unknown individual who may have been a [[pseudonym]] of [[Daniel Defoe]]. Much of the book is a mixture of fact and fiction, and it is possible the account of Libertatia is entirely fabricated.

According to Johnson's description, Libertatia lasted for about 25 years. The precise location is not known, however, most sources say it stretched from the [[Bay of Antongil]] to [[Mananjary, Fianarantsoa|Mananjary]], including [[Île Sainte Marie]] and [[Mahavelona|Foulpointe]]. [[Thomas Tew]], Misson, and an Italian Dominican priest named Caraccioli were involved in founding it.

== In literature and popular culture ==
''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'', a novel by American author [[William S. Burroughs]], revolves around a group of radical pirates who seek the freedom to live under the articles set out by [[Libertatia|Captain James Misson]].

The attempted establishment of a [[Republic of Pirates]] utopia (free from either British or Spanish rule) is a significant plot element in the [[Ubisoft]] video game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''.

In the movie ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End]]'' the main characters gather at "Shipwreck Cove", a city built out of wrecked ships and constructed platforms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za.ign.com/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/106716/feature/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-story-so-far|title=Pirates of the Caribbean: The Story So Far|author=|date=17 May 2017|website=ign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertalia is also a central plot element and setting in the video game ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]''. However, in this interpretation, Libertalia was founded by the pirate [[Henry Avery]] and others including Tew, [[Anne Bonny]] and [[Edward England]].

The 2015 video game ''[[Fallout 4]]'' features an area in the game called Libertalia. The area is a series of off-shore platforms (made of various debris) that has become home to a large gang of raiders.

The '''Program on Negotiation''' ('''PON''') is a university [[consortium]] dedicated to developing the theory and practice of [[negotiation]] and [[dispute resolution]]. As a community of scholars and practitioners, PON serves a unique role in the world negotiation community. Founded in 1983 as a special research project at [[Harvard Law School]], PON includes faculty, students, and staff from [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Tufts University]].

The Program on Negotiation publishes the quarterly ''Negotiation Journal'' and the monthly ''Negotiation Briefings'' newsletter, and distributes the annual ''Harvard Negotiation Law Review''. Throughout the year PON offers a number of courses and training opportunities ranging in length from one day to an entire semester.

== History ==

In 1979, co-authors of the bestseller ''[[Getting to Yes|Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In]]'', [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]], along with Bruce Patton founded the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]] (HNP), with a mission to improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation and dispute resolution, so that people could deal more constructively with conflicts ranging from the interpersonal to the international. Fisher began by asking the question of what kind of advice could be given to both sides of a dispute, and in researching this question he came in contact with various professors, including James Sebenius, [[Lawrence Susskind]], [[Frank Sander]], and [[Howard Raiffa]], who collaborated to form the Program on Negotiation.

The Program on Negotiation was founded in 1983 as the world's first teaching and research center dedicated to negotiation and dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/about/|title=Welcome to the Program on Negotiation (PON)|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[umbrella organization]] with founding members from both Harvard and MIT, it soon expanded to include Tufts University as one of its consortium schools. Since the beginning, the Program on Negotiation has been multi-disciplinary, with scholars from economics, government, law, business, psychology, anthropology, education, and the arts. Faculty have focused on a wide range of research topics, including deal-making, diplomatic negotiations, international negotiations, psychological aspects of negotiations, decision-making, issues relating to ethics and trust, and labor negotiations.

Chair of the Program on Negotiation since 1994, Professor Robert H. Mnookin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/faculty/robert-mnookin-chair-pon-executive-committee/|title=Robert Mnookin, Chair, PON Executive Committee|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Among his recent publications are the books, ''Beyond Winning: Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/beyond-winning-negotiating-to-create-value-in-deals-and-disputes/|title=Beyond Winning Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/bargaining-with-the-devil-when-to-negotiate-when-to-fight/|title=Bargaining with the Devil When to Negotiate, When to Fight|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

The Program on Negotiation is responsible for multiple publications, including books, special reports, the ''Negotiation Briefings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/category/publication/negotiation-briefings/|title=Negotiation Briefings Monthly Archives Archives - PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; newsletter and the quarterly ''Negotiation Journal'', a multidisciplinary international journal published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]] detailing the latest advances in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/publications/negotiation-journal/|title=Negotiation Journal|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; PON also regularly produces free reports that are available through their website, such as: "Teaching Negotiation: Understanding The Impact Of Role-Play Simulations",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/freemium/new-teaching-negotiation-understanding-the-impact-of-role-play-simulations/|title=NEW!

== Training ==

PON offers a number of training programs throughout the year on a variety of topics including negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, deal design, difficult conversations, and many more. PON seminars and courses are open to the public.

=== Author Sessions ===
The Program on Negotiation offers one day Author Sessions focused on recent book publications by PON faculty members as part of its Executive Education Series. Recent courses included: Deal-Making and Negotiauctions, Creating a World-class Negotiating Organization, Bargaining with the Devil, and Negotiating International Deals.

=== Executive Education ===
Executive Education courses last for three days, covering strategies for business leaders to handle both successful day-to-day management and long-term strategies for healthy workplace environments. Executives learn tactics for dealing with dirty tricks, threats, attacks, and stonewalls from the other side of the table.

=== Harvard Negotiation Institute ===
Harvard Negotiation Institute (HNI) classes are offered every June and September on the Harvard Law School campus and cover a broad range of negotiation and mediation skills, ranging from beginning to advanced techniques. Most of the courses offered are five-day classes. However, a 2-day Intensive Negotiation Workshop for Lawyers and Working Professionals is also offered. Recent course offerings included: a mediation workshop, Creating Value in Deals and Disputes, Tools for Preparing and Negotiating Effectively, Deal Design and Implementation, and Difficult Conversations.

=== PON Seminars ===
Open to participants from all disciplines and professional fields, the PON [[Seminars]] provide negotiation and [[mediation]] courses to the community. These semester-length courses are designed to increase public awareness and understanding of successful conflict resolution efforts.

Two courses are taught each year: Negotiation and Dispute Resolution in the fall, and Mediation and Conflict Management in the spring. Both courses provide participants with a conceptual framework and practical advice for professional and personal development in dispute resolution. Faculty is drawn from the PON community of scholars and practitioners of alternative dispute resolution.

The Program on Negotiation also hosts a variety of smaller workshops and intensive two-day courses in addition to their normal course offerings, including on-site training.

== Great Negotiator Award ==

The Program on Negotiation established the [[Great Negotiator Award]] in 2000 to honor individuals of extraordinary achievement in dispute resolution. The award is designed not only to honor the accomplishments of outstanding negotiators, but also to focus public attention on the important role of negotiation as society faces increasingly complex disputes in all sectors–public and private, technological and ethical, personal and professional. PON has recognized a diverse cast of distinguished negotiators from their respective fields: [[Juan Manuel Santos]], [[2016 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and President of [[Colombia]] (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/09/santos-receives-2017-great-negotiator-award/ |title= Santos receives 2017 Great Negotiator Award |publisher= news.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Martti Ahtisaari]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and former President of [[Finland]] (2010); [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]], the artists who created [[The Gates]] in [[Central Park]] (2008); [[Bruce Wasserstein]], Chairman and CEO of [[Lazard]], an international financial advisory and asset management firm (2007); [[Sadako Ogata]], former [[United Nations]] high commissioner for refugees (2005); [[Richard Holbrooke]], former United States ambassador to the United Nations (2004); [[Stuart Eizenstat]], former U.S. ambassador to the [[European Union]] (2003); Ambassador [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], the United Nations’ special envoy for [[Afghanistan]] (2002); [[Charlene Barshefsky]], U.S. trade representative in the second [[Clinton administration]] (2001); and former U.S. Senator [[George J.

In [[prospect theory]], the '''pseudocertainty effect''' is the tendency for people to perceive an outcome as certain while it is actually uncertain. It can be observed in multi-stage decision making, in which evaluation of the certainty of the outcome in a previous stage of decisions is disregarded when selecting an option in subsequent stages. Not to be confused with [[certainty effect]], the pseudocertainty effect was discovered from an attempt at providing a normative use of [[decision theory]] for the certainty effect by relaxing the cancellation rule.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|date=1981-01-30|title=The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/211/4481/453|journal=Science|language=en|volume=211|issue=4481|pages=453–458|doi=10.1126/science.7455683|issn=0036-8075|pmid=7455683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The pseudocertainty effect was illustrated by [[Daniel Kahneman]], who received the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on decision making and decision theory, in collaboration with [[Amos Tversky]]. The studies that they researched used real and hypothetical monetary gambles and were often used in undergraduate classrooms and laboratories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kahneman and Tversky illustrated the pseudocertainty effect by the following examples.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rizzo|first=James|date=2005-07-01|title=Newcomb's Problem for Decision Theory and Critical Theory|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08935690500122404|journal=Rethinking Marxism|volume=17|issue=3|pages=471–485|doi=10.1080/08935690500122404|issn=0893-5696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem 1 ===
Consider the following two stage game. In the first stage, there is a 75% chance to end the game without winning anything and a 25% chance to move into the second stage. If you reach the second stage, you have a choice between:

Which of the following options do you prefer?

*A. a sure win of $30
*B. 80% chance to win $45

Your choice must be made before the game starts, i.e., before the outcome of the first stage is known. Please indicate the option you prefer.

=== Problem 2 ===
Which of the following options do you prefer?

*C. 25% chance to win $30
*D. 20% chance to win $45

Also, this time the participants had to make their choice before the game starts.

== Significance ==
Each problem was answered by a different group of respondents. In problem 1, people preferred option A with a rate of 74% over option B with 26%. In problem 2, people preferred option D with a rate of 58% over option C with a rate of 42%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the discrepancy between the answers were surprising because the two problems were designed to have identical outcomes. The choices in problem 2 were designed to be compressed forms of the choices from the two stages of problem 1.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Brett K.|last2=Newell|first2=Ben R.|date=2009-09-01|title=Induction with uncertain categories: When do people consider the category alternatives?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/MC.37.6.730|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|language=en|volume=37|issue=6|pages=730–743|doi=10.3758/MC.37.6.730|issn=0090-502X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(25% chance to move on x 100% = 25%) chance to win $30

(25% chance to move on x 80% = 20%) chance to win $45

Kahneman and Tversky referred to this incidence as a result of what they called the "pseudocertainty effect". They concluded that when people make choices at later stages of problems they often do not realize that uncertainty at an earlier stage will affect the final outcome. This was clearly observed in the two stage problem shown above in which the problem moved onto the second stage only if the condition of the first stage was met.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the second problem, since individuals have no choice on options in the first stage, individuals tend to discard the first option when evaluating the overall probability of winning money, but just to consider the options in the second stage that individuals have a choice on. This is also known as cancellation, meaning that possible options are yielding to the same outcome thus ignoring decision process in that stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Retrocausality''' or '''Backwards causation''' is a concept of [[cause and effect]] where the effect precedes its cause in time,&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; so a later event in time can affect an earlier event in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Patrick|title=What's done is done…|journal=New Scientist|date=September 2006|volume=191|issue=2571|pages=36–39|doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(06)60613-1|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg19125710.900-whats-done-is-done-or-is-it.html|accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[quantum physics]], the distinction between cause and effect is not made at the most fundamental level, so [[T-symmetry|time-symmetric]] systems can be viewed as causal or retro-causal.&lt;ref name="Sheehan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheehan|first1=Daniel P.|title=Frontiers of Time: Retrocausation - Experiment and Theory; San Diego, California, 20-22 June 2006|date=2006|publisher=American Institute of Physics|location=Melville, New York|isbn=978-0735403611}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Philosophical considerations about the nature of time and causality often involve [[time travel]] and address the same issues as retrocausality, as do treatments of the subject in fiction, but the two terms are not universally synonymous.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Faye, Jan |title=Backward Causation |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-backwards/ |date=2001-08-27|accessdate=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason#Proposed proofs of universal validity}}
Philosophical efforts to understand causality extend back at least to [[Aristotle]]'s discussions of the [[four causes]]. It was long considered that an effect preceding its cause is an inherent self-[[contradiction]] because, as 18th century philosopher [[David Hume]] discussed, when examining two related events, the cause, by definition, is the one that precedes the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Tom L.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Alexander|title=Hume and the Problem of Causation|date=1981|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=9780195202366|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

In the 1950s, [[Michael Dummett]] wrote in opposition to such definitions, stating that there was no philosophical objection to effects preceding their causes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated27"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dummett|first1=A. E.|last2=Flew|first2=A.|title=Symposium: "Can An Effect Precede Its Cause?"|journal=Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume|date=11 July 1954|volume=28|issue=1|pages=27–62|doi=10.1093/aristoteliansupp/28.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was rebutted by fellow philosopher [[Antony Flew]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated27"/&gt; and, later, by [[Max Black]]. Black's "bilking argument" held that retrocausality is impossible because the observer of an effect could act to prevent its future cause from ever occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Max|title=Why Cannot an Effect Precede Its Cause?|journal=Analysis|date=January 1956|volume=16|issue=3|page=49|doi=10.2307/3326929|jstor=3326929}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more complex discussion of how [[free will]] relates to the issues Black raised is summarized by [[Newcomb's paradox]]. [[Essentialist]] philosophers have proposed other theories, such as proposing the existence of "genuine causal powers in nature"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Brian|title=The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism|date=2002|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montréal|isbn=9780773524743}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} or by raising concerns about the role of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] in theories of causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beebee|first1=Helen|title=Hume on Causation|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415243391}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Physics==
The ability to affect the past is sometimes taken to suggest that causes could be negated by their own effects, creating a logical contradiction such as the [[grandfather paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krasnikov|first1=S. V.|title=Causality violation and paradoxes|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 March 1997|volume=55|issue=6|pages=3427–3430|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.3427|bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.3427K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradiction is not necessarily inherent to retrocausality or time travel; by limiting the initial conditions of time travel with consistency constraints, such paradoxes and others are avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Earman|first1=John|last2=Smeenk|first2=Christopher|last3=Wüthrich|first3=Christian|title=Do the laws of physics forbid the operation of time machines?|journal=Synthese|date=7 May 2008|volume=169|issue=1|pages=91–124|doi=10.1007/s11229-008-9338-2|issn=0039-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of modern physics, such as the hypothetical [[tachyon]] [[particle physics|particle]] and certain [[T-symmetry|time-independent]] aspects of [[quantum mechanics]], may allow particles or information to travel backward in time. Jan Faye of the [[University of Copenhagen]] has argued that logical objections to macroscopic time travel may not necessarily prevent retrocausality at other scales of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faye|first1=Jan|title=Logic and Causal Reasoning|date=1994|publisher=Akad.-Verl.|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3050025995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Even if such effects are possible, however, they may not be capable of producing effects different from those that would have resulted from normal causal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elitzur|first1=A.|last2=Dolev|first2=S.|last3=Kolenda|first3=N.|title=Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540221883}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|300px|thumb|right|Time runs left to right in this [[Feynman diagram]] of [[electron–positron annihilation]]. When interpreted to include retrocausality, the electron (marked e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) was not destroyed, instead becoming the positron (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and moving backward in time.]]
The [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]], proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Richard Feynman]], uses retrocausality and a temporal form of [[destructive interference]] to explain the absence of a type of converging concentric [[wave]] suggested by certain solutions to [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John Archibald|last2=Feynman|first2=Richard Phillips|title=Interaction with the Absorber as the Mechanism of Radiation|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1 April 1945|volume=17|issue=2–3|pages=157–181|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.17.157|bibcode=1945RvMP...17..157W}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advanced waves don't have anything to do with cause and effect: they are simply a different mathematical way to describe normal waves. The reason they were proposed is so that a charged particle would not have to act on itself, which, in normal classical electromagnetism, leads to an infinite self-force.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Huw|title=Time's Arrow &amp; Archimedes' Point: New Directions for the Physics of Time|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195117981|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Feynman, and earlier [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], proposed an interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feynman|first1=R. P.|title=The Theory of Positrons|journal=Physical Review|date=15 September 1949|volume=76|issue=6|pages=749–759|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749|bibcode=1949PhRv...76..749F}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinterpreting the negative-energy solutions of the [[Dirac equation]]. Electrons moving backward in time would have a positive [[electric charge]]. Wheeler invoked this concept to explain the identical properties shared by all electrons, suggesting that "[[one-electron universe|they are all the same electron]]" with a complex, self-intersecting [[world line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum Electrodynamics |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=1965-12-11 |location=Nobel Lecture |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html |accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nambu|first1=Y.|title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|date=1 February 1950|volume=5|issue=1|pages=82–94|doi=10.1143/ptp/5.1.82|bibcode=1950PThPh...5...82N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backwards-in-time point of view is nowadays accepted as completely equivalent to other pictures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=Reply to "Comment to a paper of M. Villata on antigravity"|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=30 November 2011|volume=337|issue=1|pages=15–17|doi=10.1007/s10509-011-0940-2|arxiv=1109.1201|bibcode=2012Ap&amp;SS.337...15V}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it doesn't have anything to do with the macroscopic terms "cause" and "effect", which do not appear in a microscopic physical description.

===Relativity===
[[Closed timelike curve]]s, in which the [[world line]] of an object returns to its origin, arise from some [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] to the [[Einstein field equation]]. Although closed timelike curves do not appear to exist under normal conditions, extreme environments of [[spacetime]], such as a [[traversable wormhole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorne|first1=Kip S.|title=Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy|date=1995|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0393312768}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} or the region near certain [[cosmic strings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gott|first1=John Richard|title=Time Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time|date=2002|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|isbn=978-0618257355|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} may allow their formation, implying a theoretical possibility of retrocausality. The [[exotic matter]] or [[topological defect]]s required for the creation of those environments have not been observed.  Furthermore, [[Stephen Hawking]] has suggested a mechanism he describes as the [[chronology protection conjecture]], which would destroy any such closed timelike curve before it could be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawking|first1=S. W.|title=Chronology protection conjecture|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 July 1992|volume=46|issue=2|pages=603–611|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.603|bibcode=1992PhRvD..46..603H}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objections to the existence of closed timelike curves are not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Li-Xin|title=Must time machines be unstable against vacuum fluctuations?|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=1 September 1996|volume=13|issue=9|pages=2563–2568|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/13/9/019|bibcode=1996CQGra..13.2563L|arxiv=gr-qc/9703024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum physics===
Retrocausality is sometimes associated with the [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal]] correlations that generically arise from [[quantum entanglement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rave|first1=M. J.|title=Interpreting Quantum Interference Using a Berry's Phase-like Quantity|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=22 October 2008|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1073–1081|doi=10.1007/s10701-008-9252-y|bibcode=2008FoPh...38.1073R}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the notable special case of the [[delayed choice quantum eraser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Backward Causation and the EPR Paradox |author=Wharton, William R. |date=1998-10-28 |url=https://arxiv.org/html/quant-ph/9810060 |accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, verifying nonlocal correlations requires ordinary subluminal communication: the [[no communication theorem]] prevents the superluminal transfer of information, and fundamental descriptions of matter and forces require the full framework of [[quantum field theory]] in which [[Minkowski space|spacelike]]-separated operators commute. Accounts of quantum entanglement that do not involve retrocausality emphasize how the experiments demonstrating these correlations can equally well be described from different reference frames, that disagree on which measurement is a "cause" versus an "effect", as necessary to be consistent with special relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costa de Beauregard |first=Olivier |title=Time Symmetry and the Einstein Paradox |url=http://www.costa-de-beauregard.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/OCB-1977-5.pdf |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |issue=42B |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Ellerman |url=http://www.ellerman.org/a-common-fallacy/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615211907/http://www.ellerman.org/a-common-fallacy/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-15 |title=A Common Fallacy in Quantum Mechanics: Why Delayed Choice Experiments do NOT imply Retrocausality |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of such nonlocal quantum entanglements can be described in a way that is manifestly free of retrocausality if the states of the system is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0103079 |title=Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics|journal=Found.

Retrocausality is also associated with the [[two-state vector formalism]] (TSVF) in quantum mechanics, where the present is characterised by quantum states of the past and the future taken in combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/~yakir/yahp/yh165.pdf |author1=Aharonov, Yakir |author2=Lev Vaidman |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Two-State Vector Formalism: An Updated Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tachyons===
Hypothetical [[faster-than-light|superluminal]] particles called [[tachyon]]s have a spacelike trajectory, and thus can appear to move backward in time, according to an observer in a conventional reference frames. Despite frequent depiction in [[science fiction]] as a method to send messages back in time, tachyons do not interact with normal [[Massive particle|tardyonic matter]] in a way that would violate standard causality. Specifically, the [[Feinberg reinterpretation principle]] means that ordinary matter cannot be used to make of a tachyon detector capable of receiving information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinberg|first1=G.|title=Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles|journal=Physical Review|date=25 July 1967|volume=159|issue=5|pages=1089–1105|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089|bibcode=1967PhRv..159.1089F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parapsychology==
[[Parapsychology|Parapsychologist]] [[Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)|Helmut Schmidt]] presented quantum mechanical justifications for retrocausality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Helmut|title=Can an effect precede its cause?

Efforts to associate retrocausality with [[faith healing|prayer healing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leibovici |first=L. |title=Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomised controlled trial |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=323 |year=2001 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1450 |pages=1450–1 |pmid=11751349 |issue=7327 |pmc=61047}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been similarly discounted by legitimate scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bishop|first1=J.

In an experiment by psychologist [[Daryl Bem|Daryl J. Bem]], a subject was shown two sets of curtains, and was instructed to guess which one had a picture behind it, but the picture was not displayed behind the curtain until after the subject made their guess. Most of the results were statistically indistinguishable from chance (50%), but some results showed a higher margin of success (p.&amp;nbsp;17) for a subset of erotic images — 53.1%. Subjects which identified as "stimulus-seeking" in the pre-screening questionnaire scored even higher — 57.6%.  However its methodology has been strongly criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeBel|first1=Etienne P.|last2=Peters|first2=Kurt R.|title=Fearing the future of empirical psychology: Bem's (2011) evidence of psi as a case study of deficiencies in modal research practice|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=January 2011|volume=15|issue=4|pages=371–379|doi=10.1037/a0025172|url=http://psychology.okstate.edu/faculty/jgrice/psyc5314/ModalResearchProg_2011.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29891">A '''round-robin tournament''' (or '''all-play-all tournament''') is a [[competition]] in which each [[contestant]] meets all other contestants in turn.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1971, G. &amp; C. Merriam Co), p.1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Official Lawn Tennis Bulletin|last = Orcutt|first = William Dana|publisher = The Editors|year = 1895|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 1, 3|volume = 2|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Official_Lawn_Tennis_Bulletin.html?id=s7gsAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contrasts with an [[elimination tournament]].

==Terminology==
The term ''round-robin'' is derived from the French term ''ruban'', meaning "ribbon". Over a long period of time, the term was [[Folk etymology|corrupted and idiomized]] to ''robin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Standardizing Terminology for Better Communication: Practice, Applied Theory, and Results|date = 1993|editor1-last = Strehlov|editor1-first = Richard A|editor2-last = Wright|editor2-first = Sue Ellen|volume = 1166|isbn = 0-8031-1493-1|pages = 336–337|publisher = ASTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable]]|last = |first = |publisher = Harper &amp; Brother Publishers|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = 786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''single round-robin'' schedule, each participant plays every other participant once. If each participant plays all others twice, this is frequently called a ''double round-robin''. The term is rarely used when all participants play one another more than twice,&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt; and is never used when one participant plays others an unequal number of times (as is the case in almost all of the major United States professional sports leagues – see [[American Football League (1940)|AFL (1940–41)]] and [[All-America Football Conference]] for exceptions).

In the United Kingdom, a round-robin tournament is often called an American tournament in sports such as tennis or billiards which usually have [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 1912|title=A Glossary of Terms Used in Connection with Billiards|journal=Billiard Monthly|publisher=English Amateur Billiards Association|quote=American Tournament: A tournament in which each player must meet in turn every other player.|url=http://www.eaba.co.uk/mags/bm/1912/02/termsUsedInConnectionWithBilliards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allied"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allied|first=|title=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D37Cd3Ad7eIC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=1 August 2012|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-0550106254|page=38|chapter=American tournament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mead1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mead|first=Shepherd|title=How to succeed in tennis without really trying: the easy tennismanship way to do all the things no tennis pro can teach you|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPkafr1X4p8C|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=1977|publisher=McKay|isbn=9780679507499|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italian it is called {{lang|it|girone all'italiana}} (literally "Italian-style circuit"). In [[Serbian language|Serbian]] it is called the Berger system ({{lang|sr|Бергеров систем}}, {{lang|sh|Bergerov sistem}}), after chess player [[Johann Berger]]. A round-robin [[tournament]] with four players is sometimes called "quad" or "foursome".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.uschess.org/docs/forms/IntroToTournaments.pdf |title=An Introduction to USCF-Rated Tournaments | date=23 Feb 2006 |website = The United States Chess Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
In sports with a large number of competitive matches per season, double round-robins are common. Most [[association football]] leagues in the world are organized on a double round-robin basis, in which every team plays all others in its league once at home and once away. This system is also used in qualification for major tournaments such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the continental tournaments (e.g. [[UEFA European Championship]], [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]]). There are also round-robin [[Duplicate bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[draughts]], [[Go (game)|go]], [[curling]] and [[Scrabble]] tournaments. The [[World Chess Championship]] decided in 2005 and in 2007 on an eight-player double round-robin tournament where each player faces every other player once as white and once as black.

[[Group tournament ranking system|Group tournaments rankings]] usually go by number of matches won and drawn, with any of a variety of tiebreaker criteria.

Frequently, [[tournament#Multi-stage tournaments|pool stages within a wider tournament]] are conducted on a round-robin basis. Examples with single round-robin scheduling include the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA European Football Championship]], and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] (2004–2009) in football, [[Super Rugby]] ([[rugby union]]) in the Southern Hemisphere during its past iterations as Super 12 and Super 14 (but ''not'' in its later 15- and 18-team formats), the [[Cricket World Cup]], [[Indian Premier League]] Twenty-20 Cricket, [[The International (Dota 2)]] and many [[American football|American Football]] [[list of college athletic conferences|college conferences]], such as the [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] (which currently has 10 members).  The group phases of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[Copa Libertadores de América]] are contested as a double round-robin, as are most [[basketball]] leagues outside the United States, including the regular-season and Top 16 phases of the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]]; the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] has used a double round-robin for both its [[2009 UFL season|2009]] and [[2010 UFL season|2010]] seasons.

Season ending tennis tournaments also use a round robin format prior to the semi on stages

==Evaluation==
In theory, a round-robin tournament is the fairest way to determine the champion from among a known and fixed number of participants. Each participant, whether player or team, has equal chances{{clarifyme|date=May 2017}} against all other opponents. The element of luck is seen to be reduced as compared to a [[Elimination tournament|knockout system]] since one or two bad performances need not cripple a competitor's chance of ultimate victory. Final records of participants are more accurate as they represent the results over a longer period against the same opposition. This can also be used to determine which teams are the poorest performers and thus subject to [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] if the format is used in a multi-tiered league. This is also helpful to determine the final rank of all competitors, from strongest to weakest, for purposes of qualification for another stage or competition as well as for prize money. In [[team sport]] the (round-robin) major league champions are generally regarded as the "best" team in the land, rather than the ([[Single-elimination|elimination]]) cup winners.

Moreover, in tournaments such as the FIFA or ICC world cups, a first round stage consisting of a number of mini round robins between groups of 4 teams guards against the possibility of a team travelling possibly thousands of miles only to be eliminated after just one poor performance in a straight knockout system. The top one, two, or occasionally three teams in these groups then proceed to a straight knockout stage for the remainder of the tournament.

===Disadvantages of the format===
Round-robins can suffer from being too long compared to other tournament types, and with later scheduled games potentially not having any substantial meaning. They may also require tiebreaking procedures.

[[Swiss system tournament]]s attempt to combine elements of the round-robin and elimination formats, to provide a worthy champion using fewer rounds than a round-robin, while allowing draws and losses.

====Tournament length====
The main disadvantage of a round robin tournament is the time needed to complete it. Unlike a knockout tournament where half of the participants are eliminated after each round, a round robin requires one round less than the number of participants if the number of participants is even, and as many rounds as participants if the number of participants is odd. For instance, a tournament of 16 teams can be completed in just 4 rounds (i.e. 15 matches) in a knockout format; a round-robin would require 15 rounds (i.e. 120 matches) to finish. Other issues stem from the difference between the theoretical fairness of the round robin format and practice in a real event. Since the victor is gradually arrived at through multiple rounds of play, teams who perform poorly, who might have been quickly eliminated from title contention, are forced to play out their remaining games. Thus games are played late in the competition between competitors with no remaining chance of success. Moreover, some later matches will pair one competitor who has something left to play for against another who does not. It may also be possible for a competitor to play the strongest opponents in a round robin in quick succession while others play them intermittently with weaker opposition. This asymmetry means that playing the same opponents is not necessarily completely equitable: the same opponents in a different order may play harder or easier matches, while other teams are presented with more adversity during periods of the competition.{{clarifyme|date=September 2017}} There is also no scheduled showcase final match. Only by coincidence would two competitors meet in the final match of the tournament where the result of that match determined the championship. A notable instance of such an event was the [[Liverpool F.C. 0–2 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|May 26th, 1989]] match between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

====Qualified teams====
Further issues arise where a round-robin is used as a qualifying round within a larger tournament. A competitor already qualified for the next stage before its last game may either not try hard (in order to conserve resources for the next phase) or even deliberately lose (if the scheduled next-phase opponent for a lower-placed qualifier is perceived to be easier than for a higher-placed one). Four pairs in the [[Badminton at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's doubles|2012 Olympics Women's doubles badminton]], having qualified for the next round, were disqualified for attempting to lose in the round robin stage to avoid compatriots and better ranked opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/01/london-2012-badminton-disqualified-olympics|title=Eight Olympic badminton players disqualified for 'throwing games'|date=1 August 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The round robin stage at the Olympics were a new introduction and potential problems were readily known prior to the tournament.

====Circle of death====
Another disadvantage, especially in smaller round-robins, is the "circle of death," where teams cannot be separated on a head-to-head record. In a three-team round-robin, where A defeats B, B defeats C, and C defeats A, all three competitors will have a record of one win and one loss, and a tiebreaker will need to be used to separate the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~quizbowl/schedules.html|title=UC Berkeley Quiz Bowl: How To Make Schedules|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This famously happened during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group E]], where all four teams finished with a record of one win, one draw, and one loss.

==Scheduling algorithm==
[[File:Round-robin tournament_10teams_en.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Example of a round-robin tournament with 10 participating teams]]
If  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of competitors, a pure round robin tournament requires &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2} \end{matrix}(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; games.  If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, then in each of &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; rounds, &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; games can be run concurrently, provided there exist sufficient resources (e.g. courts for a [[tennis]] tournament).  If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd, there will be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rounds, each with &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n - 1}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; games, and one competitor having no game in that round.

The circle method is the standard [[algorithm]] to create a schedule for a round-robin tournament. All competitors are assigned to numbers, and then paired in the first round:

{| class="wikitable" summary="A table with 2 rows and seven columns. Each column is a pair of teams that play each other"
|+ style="white-space: nowrap" | Round 1. (1 plays 14, 2 plays 13, ... )

| style="color: hsl(194, 90%, 30%)" | 9
| style="color: hsl(166, 90%, 30%)" | 8
|}
Next, one of the contributors in the first or last column of the table is fixed (number one in this example) and the others rotated clockwise one position

|}

{| class="wikitable" summary="A table with 2 rows and seven columns. Each column is a pair of teams that play each other"

| style="color: hsl(138, 90%, 30%)" | 7
| style="color: hsl(111, 90%, 30%)" | 6
|}

This is repeated until you end up almost back at the initial position:

{| class="wikitable" summary="A table with 2 rows and seven columns. Each column is a pair of teams that play each other"
|+ style="white-space: nowrap" | Round 13. (1 plays 2, 3 plays 14, ... )

| style="color: hsl(83, 90%, 30%)" | 5
| style="color: hsl(111, 90%, 30%)" | 6
| style="color: hsl(138, 90%, 30%)" | 7
| style="color: hsl(166, 90%, 30%)" | 8
|- style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"
| style="color: hsl(0, 90%, 30%)" | 2
| style="color: hsl(332, 90%, 30%)" | 14
| style="color: hsl(305, 90%, 30%)" | 13
| style="color: hsl(277, 90%, 30%)" | 12
| style="color: hsl(249, 90%, 30%)" | 11
| style="color: hsl(222, 90%, 30%)" | 10
| style="color: hsl(194, 90%, 30%)" | 9
|}

If there are an odd number of competitors, a dummy competitor can be added, whose scheduled opponent in a given round does not play and has a [[bye (sports)|bye]]. The schedule can therefore be computed as though the dummy were an ordinary player, either fixed or rotating. Instead of rotating one position, any number [[relatively prime]] to &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; will generate a complete schedule.
The upper and lower rows can indicate home/away in sports, white/black in [[chess]], etc.; to ensure fairness, this must alternate between rounds since competitor 1 is always on the first row.  If, say, competitors 3 and 8 were unable to fulfil their fixture in the third round, it would need to be rescheduled outside the other rounds, since both competitors would already be facing other opponents in those rounds.  More complex scheduling constraints may require more complex algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.emba.uvm.edu/~jdinitz/preprints/design_tourney_talk.pdf|title = Designing Schedules for Leagues and Tournaments|date = 13 November 2004|website = Home Page for Jeff Dinitz|last = Dinitz|first = Jeff|publication-place = Mount Saint Mary College|publisher = GRAPH THEORY DAY 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This schedule is applied in chess and draughts tournaments of rapid games, where players physically move round a table. In France this is called the [[Carousel]]-Berger system (Système Rutch-Berger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Le livre de l'arbitre : édition 2008|last = |first = |publisher = Fédération Française des Échecs|year = |isbn = 978-2-915853-01-8|location = |pages = 56|url = http://www.echecs.asso.fr/LivreArbitre/Livre_arbitre.pdf#page=56|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schedule can also be used for "asynchronous" round-robin tournaments where all games take place at different times (for example, because there is only one venue). The games are played from left to right in each round, and from the first round to the last. When the number of competitors is even, this schedule performs well with respect to quality and fairness measures such as the amount of rest between games. On the other hand, when the number of competitors is odd, it does not perform so well and a different schedule is superior with respect to these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suksompong |first1=Warut |title=Scheduling asynchronous round-robin tournaments

Alternatively Berger tables,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Table de Berger|Table de Berger]] {{fr icon}}, examples of round robin schedules up to 30 participants.&lt;/ref&gt; named after the [[Austria]]n [[chess]] [[Chess master|master]] [[Johann Berger]], are widely used in the planning of tournaments. Berger published the pairing tables in his two Schachjahrbucher,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Schach-Jahrbuch für 1892/93 |last = Berger|first = Johann|publisher = |year = 1893|oclc = 651254787 |location = Leipzig|pages = |editor-last = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Schach-Jahrbuch für 1899/1900 : fortsetzung des schach-jahrbuches für 1892/93|last = Berger|first = Johann | publisher = |year = 1899| oclc = 651254792 |location = Leipzig|pages =21–27 |editor-last = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; with due reference to its inventor Richard Schurig.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Richard Schurig|Richard Schurig]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SchurigTables&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Die Paarung der Theilnehmer eines Turniers|date = |last = Schurig| first = Richard | journal = Deutsche Schachzeitung| issue = |publication-date = 1886|language = German|volume = 41|pages = 134–137|oclc = 556959107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This constitutes a schedule where player 14 has a fixed position, and all other players are rotated clockwise &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; positions. This schedule alternates colours and is easily generated manually. To construct the next round, the last player, number 8 in the first round, moves to the head of the table, followed by player 9 against player 7, player 10 against 6, until player 1 against player 2. Arithmetically, this equates to adding &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; to the previous row, with the exception of player &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. When the result of the addition is greater than &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;, then subtract &lt;math&gt;(\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2}\end{matrix}-1)&lt;/math&gt;.

This schedule can also be represented as a (n-1, n-1) table, expressing a round in which players meets each other. For example, player 7 plays against player 11 in round 4. If a player meets itself, then this shows a bye or a game against player n. All games in a round constitutes a diagonal in the table.

The above schedule can also be represented by a graph, as shown below:
[[Image:Round-robin-schedule-span-diagram.svg|thumb|none|Round Robin Schedule Span Diagram]]

Both the graph and the schedule were reported by [[Édouard Lucas]] in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Récréations Mathématiques|last = Lucas|first = Edouard|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|year = 1883|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 161–197|url = https://archive.org/stream/p2rcrationsm00lucauoft#page/176/mode/2up|chapter = Les jeux de demoiselles|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a recreational mathematics puzzle.
Lucas, who describes the method as ''simple and ingenious'', attributes the solution to Felix Walecki, a teacher at [[Lycée Condorcet]]. Lucas also included an alternative solution by means of a [[sliding puzzle]].

=== Original construction of pairing tables by Richard Schurig (1886) ===

For 7 or 8 players, Schurig&lt;ref name="SchurigTables" /&gt; builds a table with &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; vertical rows and &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; horizontal rows, as follows:
{| style="text-align:right; margin-left:6em;"
 |-
 |              | 1.
 |              | Round
 | width="40pt" | 1
 | width="40pt" | 2 
 | width="40pt" | 3
 | width="40pt" | 4
 |-
 |              | 2. || align = "center" | ,, || 5 || 6 || 7 || 1 
 |-
 |              | 3. || align = "center" | ,, || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
 |-
 |              | 4. || align = "center" | ,, || 6 || 7 || 1 || 2
 |-
 |              | 5. || align = "center" | ,, || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
 |-
 |              | 6. || align = "center" | ,, || 7 || 1 || 2 || 3
 |-
 |              | 7. || align =" center" | ,, || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7
 |}

Then a second table is constructed (with counting from the end) as shown below: 
{| style="text-align:right; margin-left:6em;"
 |-
 |              | 1.
 |              | Round
 | width="40pt" | . 1
 | width="40pt" | . 7 
 | width="40pt" | . 6
 | width="40pt" | . 5
 |-
 |              | 2. || align = "center" | ,, || . 5 || . 4 || . 3 || . 2 
 |-
 |              | 3. || align = "center" | ,, || . 2 || . 1 || . 7 || . 6
 |-
 |              | 4. || align = "center" | ,, || . 6 || . 5 || . 4 || . 3
 |-
 |              | 5. || align = "center" | ,, || . 3 || . 2 || . 1 || . 7
 |-
 |              | 6. || align = "center" | ,, || . 7 || . 6 || . 5 || . 4
 |-
 |              | 7. || align =" center" | ,, || . 4 || . 3 || . 2 || . 1
 |}

By merging above tables we arrive at:

{| style="text-align:right; margin-left:6em;"
 |-
 |              | 1.
 |              | Round
 | width="40pt" | 1, 1
 | width="40pt" | 2, 7 
 | width="40pt" | 3, 6
 | width="40pt" | 4, 5
 |-
 |              | 2. || align = "center" | ,, || 5, 5 || 6, 4 || 7, 3 || 1, 2
 |-
 |              | 3. || align = "center" | ,, || 2, 2 || 3, 1 || 4, 7 || 5, 6
 |-
 |              | 4. || align = "center" | ,, || 6, 6 || 7, 5 || 1, 4 || 2, 3
 |-
 |              | 5. || align = "center" | ,, || 3, 3 || 4, 2 || 5, 1 || 6, 7
 |-
 |              | 6. || align = "center" | ,, || 7, 7 || 1, 6 || 2, 5 || 3, 4
 |-
 |              | 7. || align = "center" | ,, || 4, 4 || 5, 3 || 6, 2 || 7, 1
 |}
Then the first column is updated: if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, player number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is alternatingly substituted for the first and second positions, whereas if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd a bye is used instead.

The pairing tables were published as an annex concerning the arrangements for the holding of master tournaments.
Schurig did not provide a proof nor a motivation for his algorithm.

'''Social perception''' (or '''person perception''') is the study of how people form impressions of and make inferences about other people as sovereign personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People learn about others' feelings and emotions by picking up information they gather from physical appearance, verbal, and [[nonverbal communication]]. [[Facial expression]]s, tone of voice, [[hand gesture]]s, and [[body language|body position]] or movement are just a few examples of ways people communicate without words. A real-world example of social perception is understanding that others disagree with what one said when one sees them roll their eyes. There are four main components of social perception: [[observation]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], integration, and confirmation.

Observations serve as the raw data of social perception—an interplay of three sources: persons, situations, and behavior. These sources are used as evidence in supporting a person's impression or inference about others. Another important factor to understand when talking about social perception is attribution. Attribution is expressing an individual's personality as the source or cause of their behavior during an event or situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/attribution-theory.html|title=Attribution Theory {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fully understand the impact of personal or situational attributions, social perceivers must integrate all available information into a unified impression. To finally confirm these impressions, people try to understand, find, and create information in the form of various biases. Most importantly, social perception is shaped by an individual's current motivations, emotions, and [[Cognitive load|cognitive load capacity]]. Cognitive load is the complete amount of mental effort utilized in the [[working memory]]. All of this combined determines how people attribute certain traits and how those traits are interpreted.

The fascination and research for social perception date back to the late 1800s when [[social psychology]] was first being discovered. As more and more research on social perception is done, the realization of its significance in understanding and predicting our social world continues to grow. This overview article aims to inform readers about the processes of social perception along with brief descriptions to relevant and related theories.

== Observation ==
The processes of social perception begin with observing persons, situations, and behaviors to gather evidence that supports an initial impression.

=== Persons – physical influence ===
Although society tries to train people not to judge others based on their physical traits, as social perceivers, we cannot help but be influenced by others' hair, skin color, height, weight, style of clothes, pitch in voice, etc., when making a first impression. People have the tendency to judge others by associating certain facial features with specific personality types. For example, studies indicate that people are perceived as stronger, more assertive, and competent if they have small eyes, low eyebrows, an angular chin, wrinkled skin, and a small forehead. People tend to associate baby-faced people with impotence and harmlessness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Situations – context from prior experiences ===
People are able to easily predict the sequences or results of an event based on the extent and depth of their past experiences with a similar event. The ability to anticipate the outcomes of a situation is also greatly influenced by an individual's cultural background because this inevitably shapes the types of experiences. Situational observations either lead humans to have preset notions about certain events or to explain the causes of human behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Behaviors – nonverbal communication ===
Nonverbal communication helps people express their emotions, attitudes, and personalities. The most dominant form of nonverbal communication is the use of facial expressions to channel different emotions. Greatly influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s research on facial expressions and book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals|The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872)]]'', it is believed that all humans, regardless of culture or race, encode and decode the six "primary" emotions, (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust), universally in the same way. To encode means to communicate nonverbal behavior, while to decode means to interpret the meaning or intention of the nonverbal behavior. Decoding sometimes is inaccurate due to affect blend, (a facial expression with two differently registered emotions), and/or [[display rules]], (culturally dictated rules about which nonverbal behaviors are acceptable to display).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other nonverbal cues such as: body language, eye contact, and vocal intonations can affect social perception by allowing for [[thin-slicing]]. Thin-slicing describes the ability to make quick judgements from finding consistencies in events based only on narrow frames of experience.

==Attribution==
With the observations drawn from persons, situations, and behavior, the next step is to make inferences that identify an individual's inner dispositions.

===Attribution theories===

A large component of social perception is [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]]. Attribution is the use of information gathered through observation to help individuals understand and rationalize the causes of one's own and others' behaviors. Psychological research on attribution began with the work of [[Fritz Heider]] in 1958, and was subsequently developed by others such as [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]]. People make attributions to understand the world around them in order to seek reasons for an individual's particular behavior. When people make attributions they are able to make judgments as to what was the cause or causes of a certain behavior. Attribution theory is the study of what systems and models people implement to make attributions about the behavior of others. It attempts to explain how we use information about the social environment to understand others' behavior.

One common bias people exhibit in attribution is called the [[fundamental attribution error]]. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency for people to attribute others' actions or behaviors to internal traits as opposed to external circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=L.|date=1977|title=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process|journal=Advances in Experimental Psychology|volume=10|pages=174–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how this may manifest in the real world as pointed out in research by [[Adrian Furnham|Furnham]] and Gunter is how one's view of the justness of poverty may be affected by one's financial status: one who has not experienced poverty may see it as being more or less deserved than might someone who has been impoverished at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furnham|first=A.F.|last2=Gunter|first2=B.|date=1984|title=Just world beliefs and attitudes towards the poor|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=23|pages=265–269|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1984.tb00637.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, fundamental attribution error can be a barrier to empathizing with others, as one does not consider all the circumstances involved in the actions of others.

==== Two-step process of making attributions ====
Unlike conventional attribution theories, the two-step process of attribution suggests that people analyze others' behaviors first by automatically making an internal attribution and only then considering possible external attributions that may affect the initial inference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Heider's most valuable contribution to the topic of attribution is the [[dichotomy]]: When attempting to decide why individuals behave a certain way, we can make either an internal or external attribution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Seventh Edition|last=Aronson|first=Elliot|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|last3=Akert|first3=Robin M.|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=0-13-814478-8|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=83–115|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal attribution, (also called [[dispositional attribution]] or personal attribution&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Seventh Edition|last=Kassin|first=Saul|last2=Fein|first2=Steven|last3=Markus|first3=Hazel Rose|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-0-618-86846-9|location=Belmont, CA|pages=93–127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is the assumption that an individual is acting a certain way due to something about that individual, such as personality, character, or attitude. External attribution, also called [[situational attribution]], is the inference that an individual is acting a certain way due to the situation he or she is in; the assumption is that most individuals would respond in the same way in that similar situation. Essentially, people first assume that a person's behavior is due to his or her personality, and then attempt to modify this attribution by also factoring in the person's situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Jones's correspondent inference theory ====
According to Edward Jones and Keith Davis's [[correspondent inference theory]], people learn about other individuals from behavior that is chosen freely, that is not anticipated, and that results in a small number of favorable outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three factors that people use as a basis for their inferences:
# An individual's degree of choice
# The expectedness of the behavior
# The intentions or motives behind the effects or consequences of the behavior

==== Kelley's covariation theory ====
According to American social psychologist [[Harold Kelley]], individuals make attributions by utilizing the [[covariation principle]]. The covariation principle claims that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a certain behavior occurs and the factors that are absent when it does not occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three types of covariation information that are particularly helpful: consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency.

If a single individual and a large majority of individuals behave similarly in reaction to a specific stimulus, then the individual's behavior is attributed to the stimulus and is high in consensus. The individual's behavior due to this specific stimulus should be compared to the individual's behavior in reaction other stimuli within the same broader category. This helps judge whether the level of distinctiveness information is high, and thus attributed to the stimulus. Lastly, consistency information is used to see what happens to the behavior at another time when the individual and the stimulus both remain unchanged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Integration ==
Unless a snap judgement is made from observing persons, situations, or behavior, people integrate the dispositions to form impressions.

===Information integration theory===
[[Norman H. Anderson]], an American social psychologist, developed the [[information integration theory]] in 1981. The theory states that impressions are made from the perceiver's personal dispositions and a weighted average of the target individual's characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The differences among perceivers are due to people using themselves as a standard, or frame of reference, when judging or evaluating others. People also tend to view their own skills and traits as favorable for others to also have. These impressions formed about others can also be influenced by the current, temporary mood of the perceiver. A concept called, [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] also affects a perceiver's impressions of others. Priming is the tendency for recently perceived or implemented concepts or words to come to mind easily and influence the understanding of the new information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Trait information also impacts people's impressions of others, and psychologist [[Solomon Asch]] was the first to discover that the existence of one trait tends to indicate the existence of other traits. Asch claimed that [[central trait]]s exist that exert a strong effect on the perceiver's overall impressions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, the sequence in which a trait is realized can also influence the trait's impact. Research shows that there is a tendency for information presented at the beginning of a sequence to have a greater effect on impressions than information presented later on, a concept called [[primacy effect]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Implicit personality theory ===
[[Implicit personality theory]] is a type of model people use to group various kinds of personality qualities together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Put in another way, implicit personality theories describe the way an observer uses the traits displayed by another person to form impressions about that other person. People pay attention to a variety of cues, including: visual, auditory, and verbal cues to predict and understand the personalities of others, in order to fill in the gap of the unknown information about a person, which assists with social interactions.

Certain traits are seen as especially influential in the formation of an overall impression of an individual; these are called [[Trait theory|central traits]]. Other traits are less influential in impression formation, and are called peripheral traits. Which traits are central or peripheral is not fixed, but can vary based on context. For instance, saying that a person is warm versus cold may have a central impact on an individual's impression formation when paired with traits such as "industrious" and "determined", but have a more peripheral impact when paired with traits such as "shallow" or "vain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nauts|first=S.|last2=Langner|first2=O.|last3=Huijsmans|first3=I.|last4=Vonk|first4=R.|last5=Wigboldus|first5=D. H. J.|date=2014|title=Forming impressions of personality: A replication and review of Asch’s (1946) evidence for a primacy-of-warmth effect in impression formation|journal=Social Psychology|volume=45|issue=3|pages=153–163|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim and Rosenberg&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=M. P.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=S.|date=1980|title=Comparison of two structural models of implicit personality theory|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=3|pages=375–389|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.3.375}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that when forming impressions of others, individuals assess others on an evaluative dimension. Which is to say that, when asked to describe personality traits of others, individuals rate others on a "good-bad" dimension. People's implicit personality theories also include a number of other dimensions, such as a "strong-weak" dimension, an "active-passive" dimension, an "attractive-unattractive" dimension, etc. However, the evaluative "good-bad" dimension was the only one that universally appeared in people's descriptions of others, while the other dimensions appeared in many, but not all, people's assessments. Thus, the dimensions included in implicit personality theories on which others are rated vary from person to person, but the "good-bad" dimension appears to be part of all people's implicit personality theories.

== Confirmation ==
After making and integrating attributions, individuals form impressions that are subject to confirmation biases and the threat of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].

=== Competence as social perceivers ===
It is true that people fall for the biases identified by social psychologists and for some biases that may have not yet been identified. Despite these misjudgments, there are four reasons that soundly demonstrate people's competence as social perceivers: 
# People can more accurately perceive social behaviors and interactions when they have a greater history of experiences with the other people.
# People can make more circumscribed predictions of how other individuals will act when in their presence. 
# Social perception skills can be improved through learning the rules of probability and logic. 
# People can make more precise inferences about others when motivated by concerns for open-mindedness and accuracy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Factors that influence social perception ===

==== Accuracy ====
The accuracy of social perception relates to the connection between judgments people make of others' psychological attributes, and the reality of those attributes with regards to the people being judged. There are three slightly varying approaches to interpreting accuracy the: pragmatic, constructivist, and realistic approaches. Empirical research suggests that social perception is mostly accurate, but the degree of accuracy is based on four major moderator variables. These moderators are attributes of the: judge, target, trait that is judged, and information on which the judgment is based. The [http://www.guwsmedical.info/rasch-model/the-realistic-accuracy-model-ram.html Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM)] explains that these moderators are a result of the process for accurate judgment. The process of accurate personality judgment starts with the target revealing relevant information, which then must be available to a judge, who then identifies and uses it to form a final judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last=Smelser|first=Neil J.|last2=Baltes|first2=Paul B.|publisher=Elsevier Ltd|year=2001|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8|location=|pages=11243–11246|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Difficulties in accuracy research =====
While accurate social perception is important, it has also been rather neglected. It is difficult to provide a set list of criteria that can be checked-off as accuracy can be subjective in nature. In the past, there was an assumption that people’s judgements were also considered erroneous and often mistaken. As such, many researchers have chosen to pursue other facets of research instead. It was not until these assumptions were proved incorrect through research and research methods became more sophisticated that genuine effort was put into analyzing accurate social perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767017526|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last=Funder|first=D.

===== Testing =====
TASIT (The Awareness of Social Inference Test) is an audiovisual test that In the past for the clinical assessment of social perception. The test is based upon several critical components of social perception that are crucial for social competence using complex, dynamic, visual, and auditory cues to assess these critical components. The test assesses the ability to identify emotions, a skill that is impaired in many clinical conditions. It also assesses the ability to judge what a speaker may be thinking or what their intentions are for the other person in the conversation, also referred to as [[theory of mind]]. Lastly, the test was developed to assess the ability to differentiate between literal and non-literal conversational remarks. The test is divided into three parts to measure; emotion, social inference – minimal, and social inference enriched. The test is composed of scenes, or vignettes, and those being assessed are asked to identify the emotions, a, feelings, beliefs, intentions, and meanings of the interactions. They are also assessed on more complex interactions to assess ability to interpret sarcasm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonald|last2=Bornhofen|last3=Shum|last4=Long|last5=Saunders|last6=Neulinger|date=2006|title=Reliability and validity of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT): A clinical test of social perception|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=28|issue=24|pages=1529–1542|doi=10.1080/09638280600646185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this testing assess the level of social perception of an individual.

TASIT has adequate psychometric properties as a clinical test of social perception. It is not overly prone to practice effects and is reliable for repeat administrations. Performance on TASIT is affected by information processing speed, working memory, new learning and executive functioning, but the uniquely social material that comprises the stimuli for TASIT provides useful insights into the particular difficulties people with clinical conditions experience when interpreting complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=====Bias=====

People are prone to numerous types of confirmation biases—tendencies to construe, find, and formulate information in ways that prove existing opinions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Preconceived prejudices, stereotypes, and discrimination otherwise known as social biases can contribute towards these tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sritharan|first=R.|last2=Gawronski|first2=B.|date=2010|title=Changing implicit and explicit prejudice: Insights from the associative-propositional evaluation model|journal=Social Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=113–123|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are also subject to exhibiting [[belief perseverance]], the tendency to hold false convictions even after they have been disproved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====== Self ======
* [[Availability heuristic]] – Tendency to place more importance and reliance on more immediate memories when evaluating specific topics, methods, concepts, or decisions. It is a mental shortcut that operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, then it must at least be as important as alternatives that are less easily recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.verywell.com/availability-heuristic-2794824|title=What Is an Availability Heuristic?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If people perceive themselves as less similar, they rate the perpetrator as more culpable.&lt;ref name="Reference D"/&gt;
*[[Forer effect]] (Barnum effect)&amp;nbsp;– Placing high belief in a general, vague description thinking it was meant specifically for an individual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">A '''statite''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''static'' and ''satellite'') is a hypothetical type of artificial [[satellite]] that employs a [[solar sail]] to continuously modify its [[orbit]] in ways that [[gravity]] alone would not allow. Typically, a statite would use the solar sail to "hover" in a location that would not otherwise be available as a stable [[geosynchronous orbit]]. Statites have been proposed that would remain in fixed locations high over [[Earth]]'s poles, using reflected [[sunlight]] to counteract the gravity pulling them down. Statites might also employ their sails to change the shape or velocity of more conventional orbits, depending upon the purpose of the particular statite.

The concept of the statite was invented independently (and approximately simultaneously) by [[Robert L. Forward]]&lt;ref name="Forward Patent"&gt;{{Ref patent | country = US | number = 5183225 | status = patent | title = Statite: Spacecraft That Utilizes Light Pressure and Method of Use |  gdate = 1993-02-02 | pridate =  | inventor = Robert L.

McInnes|Colin McInnes]], who used the term "halo orbit"&lt;ref&gt;McInnes, C. R. and Simmons, J. F. L.: "Halo Orbits for Solar Sails --- Dynamics and Applications," ESA Journal, Vol. 13, 1989, pp.229-234&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with the type of [[halo orbit]] invented by Robert Farquhar). Subsequently, the terms "non-[[Keplerian orbit]]" and "artificial [[Lagrange point]]" have been used as a generalization of the above terms.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}

No statites have been deployed to date, as solar sail technology is still in its infancy. NASA's cancelled [[Sunjammer (spacecraft)|Sunjammer]] solar sail mission had the stated objective of flying to an artificial Lagrange point near the Earth/Sun L1 point, to demonstrate the feasibility of the [http://wiki.solarsails.info/index.php?title=Geostorm Geostorm] [[geomagnetic storm]] warning mission concept proposed by NOAA's [[Patricia Mulligan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulligan|first1=Patricia|title=Solar Sails for the Operational Space Community|journal=Spaceviews|date=August 1998|volume=8|issue=3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Street harassment''' is a form of [[sexual harassment]] that consists of unwanted comments, gestures, honking,
[[wolf-whistling]]s, '''catcalling''', exposure, following, persistent sexual advances, and touching by strangers in public areas such as streets, shopping malls, and public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyberbullying Via Social Media|journal=[[Journal of School Violence]]|last1=Whittaker|first1=Elizabeth|author2=Robin M. Kowalski|date=2015|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–29|doi=10.1080/15388220.2014.949377}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the founder of the non-profit organization ''Stop Street Harassment'', it can also consist of physically harmless behavior, such as "kissing noises" and "non-sexually explicit comments," to "more threatening behavior" like stalking, flashing, sexual assault, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stop Street Harassment: Making Public Places Safe and Welcoming for Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|publisher=Praeger|year=2010|isbn=978-0313384967|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients include people of all genders, but women are much more commonly victims of harassment by men. According to ''Harvard Law Review'' (1993), street harassment is considered harassment done primarily by male strangers to females in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Cynthia Grant|date=January 1993|title=Street Harassment and the Informal Ghettoization of Women|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=106|pages=519|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, researchers from Cornell University and [[Hollaback!]] conducted the largest international cross-cultural study on street harassment. The data suggests that the majority of females have their first street harassment experience during puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihollaback.org/cornell-international-survey-on-street-harassment/|title=Street Harassment: The Largest International Cross-Cultural Study|last=|first=|date=May 2015|website=hollaback!|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of South Asia, public sexual harassment of women is called "[[eve teasing]]". The Spanish term ''piropos'' most widely used in Mexico holds a similar effect. Studies show that what is considered street harassment is similar around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kissling|first=Elizabeth|date=1991|title=Street harassment: The Language of Sexual Terrorism|jstor=42888749|journal=Discourse and Society|volume=2|issue=4|pages=457–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many perpetrators of these actions would not characterize them as harassment, though most recipients would. Harassment can also be disproportionately directed at those with what is perceived by passers-by as a non-typical [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is street harassment?|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/what-is-street-harassment/|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking photos of strangers without permission, as [[street photography]] and [[photojournalism]] practitioners do, is not considered street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kearl|first1=Holly|title=Stop Global Street Harassment: Growing Activism Around the World|date=August 2015|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There is no definitive beginning of street harassment, but discussion regarding the subject began in 1944 with the rape of [[Recy Taylor]]. Rosa Parks was commissioned to investigate the crime in which Taylor, a black woman, was kidnapped and gang raped in Abbeville, Alabama. Parks responded by starting what was later dubbed the "strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dailey|first=Jane|date=2011|title=At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance—A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power, by Danielle L. McGuire|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=2|issue=2|pages=490–491|doi=10.1093/jahist/jar290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement called Take Back the Night gained traction. This movement, still strongly represented today, is an international protest against sexual violence against women. Take Back the Night has become a non-profit organization that aims to end all forms of sexual violence, including street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://takebackthenight.org/about-us/|title=About – Take Back the Night|website=takebackthenight.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the "Wall Street Ogle-In" took place. Led by [[Karla Jay]], women marched on Wall Street with signs addressing street harassment. As a role reversal, the women catcalled the men they passed in hopes of raising awareness of the unpleasant nature of the street harassment women experience daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/blogs/when-womens-lib-vindicated-wall-streets-original-joan-holloway.htm|title=How Wall Street's Original Joan Holloway Inspired Second-Wave Feminist Protests|date=2015-08-25|work=Stuff Mom Never Told You|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Deirdre Davis wrote an academic article that helped clarify what street harassment is by explaining its five characteristics: 1) it takes place in a public space, 2) it most commonly occurs between men and women, 3) saying "thank you" to a harasser provokes further harassment, 4) comments often pertain to what cannot be seen on the woman's body, and 5) the harasser's comments, though disguised as compliments, are objectifying and derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Deirdre,|date=1994-01-01|title=The Harm That Has No Name: Street Harassment, Embodiment, and African American Women|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/83b9f21g|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the blog ''Stop Street Harassment'' became a non-profit that is "dedicated to documenting and ending gender-based street harassment worldwide" by hosting events and keeping people informed about action they can take to end street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/|title=About |publisher=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=2018-04-13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
There is a high prevalence for street harassment to become sexual violence. Worldwide, statistics show that 80% of women endure at least frequent street harassment, 45% feel that they cannot go alone to public spaces, 50% have to cross the street to find alternate routes to their destinations, 26% claim that they are in a relationship in order to avoid harassment, 80% feel the need to be constantly alert when traversing local streets and 19% have had to switch careers to escape the area in which harassment occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meza-De-Luna|first1=M.|last2=García-Falconi|first2=S.|title=Adolescent Street Harassment in Querétaro, Mexico|journal=Affilia|date=2014|volume=30 |issue=2|pages=158–169|doi=10.1177/0886109914541117}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is not only transnational, but also transcultural and affects people of all identities, races, and ages—everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennox|first1=R.|last2=Jurdi-Hage|first2=R.|title=Beyond the empirical and the discursive: The methodological implications of critical realism for street harassment research|journal=Womens Studies International Forum|volume=60|pages=23–28|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2016.11.010|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian government sponsored a large survey in 1993 called the Violence Against Women Survey. In the sample of over 12,000 women, 85% said they were victims of harassment by a stranger.&lt;ref name="JRCD" /&gt; In a 2002 survey of [[Beijing]] residents, 58% cited public buses as a common location for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harassment rampant on public transportation|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0411/cn8-4.html|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=Shanghai Star|date=11 April 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121955/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0411/cn8-4.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in Australia shows that almost 90% of women have experienced verbal or physical harassment in public one or more times in their lives. In Afghanistan, research done in the same year indicates that the prevalence of harassment was 93%. Canadian and Egyptian studies show that the rate of incidence is approximately 85% of women experiencing street harassment in the past year. In U.S.-based research, it was reported that women experienced stranger harassment on a monthly basis (41%), while a large minority reported experiencing harassment once every few days (31%). These statistics are given to show a sense of the phenomenon as widely construed, not taken as representative of the same phenomenon comparable across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fileborn|first1=B|last2=Vera-Gray|first2=F|title='I Want to be Able to Walk the Street Without Fear': Transforming Justice for Street Harassment|journal=Feminist Legal Studies|volume=25 |issue=2|page=203|doi=10.1007/s10691-017-9350-3|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
A representative survey of 2,000 Americans was commissioned in 2014 by activist group Stop Street Harassment and conducted by [[GfK]]. 65% of women and 25% of men reported having been the victims of street harassment in their lives. 41% of women and 16% of men said they had been physically harassed in some way, such as by being followed, [[exhibitionism|flashed]], or groped.&lt;ref name="SSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsafe and Harassed in Public Spaces|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2014-National-SSH-Street-Harassment-Report.pdf|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=31 October 2014|date=Spring 2014|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators are lone men in 70% of cases for female victims and 48% of cases for male victims; 20% of men who were harassed were the victims of a lone woman.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;  For men, the most common harassment was homophobic or transphobic slurs, followed by unwanted following, then catcalling and comments on body parts.  For women, the most common harassment was catcalling, followed by comments on body parts, unwanted touching or brushing up against, and then sexual slurs like "bitch" or "slut".&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;

For women, most harassment is performed by a total stranger. This comes from a 1990s study from the American Midwest. It was found that numerous women have experienced street harassment on numerous occasions. Another 50% were physically harassed or followed by such strangers. Half of those surveyed revealed this harassment occurred by their 17th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=badf8f6d-512b-410d-a384-25507577cf5e%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=linus.b3207216&amp;db=cat00322a|title=Stop Global Street Harassment|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=2015|website=One Search|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

66% of LGBT respondents in a 2012&lt;!-- note: the data relied upon in this report is from 2012, not 2014 --&gt; [[European Union]] survey said that they avoid [[holding hands]] in public for fear of harassment and assault. 50% said they avoid certain places or locations, and the places they listed as most unsafe to be open about their sexual orientations were "public transport" and "street, square, car parking lot, or other public space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU LGBT survey – European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey – Main results|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-eu-lgbt-survey-main-results_tk3113640enc_1.pdf|publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency]]|accessdate=31 October 2014|pages=87–89|format=pdf|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Stop Street Harassment national survey, LGBT men are 17% more likely to experience physically aggressive harassment and 20% more likely to encounter verbal harassment than heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/lgbt=men=experience=high=rates=of=street=harassment|title=LGBT Men Experience High Rates of Street Harassment|date=June 4, 2014|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|last=Miller|first=Hayley}}{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate survey, verbal harassment was cited as the most common form of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/.|title=Gay and Transgender Discrimination Outside the Workplace|last=Burns|first=Crosby|date=19 July 2011|website=American Progress|archive-url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/|archive-date=19 July 2011|dead-url=No|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were also a significant number of people who were harassed by being denied service or being physically harassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/|title=Gay and Transgender Discrimination Outside the Workplace|last=Burns|first=Crosby|date=19 July 2011|website=Center for American Progress|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample survey of 331 LGBTQ men in 2014 indicated the phenomena occurs worldwide. 90% of them claimed to be harassed in public spaces for their perceived differences. It was mainly their lack of traditionally masculine features that singled them out for abuse. This abuse was mainly aimed at how they did not fit typical gender roles while in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W_tPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Kearl,+Holly.+Stop+Global+Street+Harassment:+Growing+Activism+around+the+World.+ABC-CLIO,+LLC,+2015.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Stop Global Street Harassment|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=2015|website=Google Books|archive-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_tPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Kearl,+Holly.+Stop+Global+Street+Harassment:+Growing+Activism+around+the+World.+ABC-CLIO,+LLC,+2015.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qd9MCpzHfM&amp;sig=UkMwnWhOerK7yStLjbA6OEwlZ1E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbgdn02bPaAhUJslQKHbuSDfgQ6AEITTAL#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2015|dead-url=No|access-date=11 April 2018|isbn=9781440840210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health effects ===
A study in 2011 was aimed at recording the health effects of street harassment on women and girls. It was found that they were mentally stressed after experiencing street harassment. Poor mental health has been found to be linked to street harassment in addition to paranoia that certain spaces are not safe. The main way the women and girls put a stop to this was reducing the amount of time they spent on the street. However, this negatively impacted their ability to hold down a job or go to where they could receive healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=c3ba0215-5301-45f4-ab6b-d20f2035e2d3%40sessionmgr104|title=Experiences of street harassment and associations with perceptions of social cohesion among women in Mexico City|last=A Campos|first=Paola|date=1 January 2017|website=One Search|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 article, based on Canada's Violence Against Women Survey, showed that past exposure to harassment from strangers is an important factor in women's perceptions of their safety in public. Harassment from a stranger, as opposed to an acquaintance, is more likely to induce fear of sexual victimization.&lt;ref name="JRCD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macmillan|first1=Ross|last2=Nieorbisz|first2=Annette|last3=Welsh|first3=Sandy|title=Experiencing the Streets: Harassment and Perceptions of Safety among Women|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|date=1 August 2000|volume=37|issue=3|pages=306–322|doi=10.1177/0022427800037003003|url=http://jrc.sagepub.com/content/37/3/306.abstract|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 reported that "the experience of street harassment is directly related to a greater preoccupation with physical appearance and body shame, and is indirectly related to heightened fears of rape. ... Stranger harassment reduces feelings of safety while walking alone at night, using public transportation, walking alone in a parking garage, and while home alone at night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaudoir|first1=Stephenie R.|last2=Quinn|first2=Diane M.|title=Bystander Sexism in the Intergroup Context: The Impact of Cat-calls on Women's Reactions Towards Men|journal=Sex Roles|date=3 March 2010|volume=62|issue=9|pages=623–634|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9735-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
In some cases, men may enjoy the thrill of doing something illegal or taboo, and some may experience sexual gratification from groping, flirting, or sexual humiliation.  Negative remarks can also be the result of [[transphobia]] or [[homophobia]].{{citation_needed|reason=I realize this is considered common knowledge in feminist spaces, but someone should at least try to document it properly. Especially since the source cited in the following paragraph argues to the contrary.|date=August 2018}}

Australian reporter Eleanor Gordon-Smith recorded interactions in the 2010s in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales]], and found that men who catcalled women enjoyed getting attention, flirting, and the public performance. The men were also under the impression that the women who were the subject of their remarks and gestures enjoyed the attention and believed they were helping the women have a good time or were giving a compliment about physical appearance that would be appreciated. The vast majority of women in the area, in contrast, found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault. Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack.&lt;ref name="this_life"&gt;[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/603/once-more-with-feeling ''This American Life'' Episode 603: Once More, With Feeling Act One: Hollaback Girl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==
[[YouGov]] conducted a poll of about 1,000 Americans in August 2014. In their findings, 72% said it was never appropriate to make a "catcall", 18% said it was sometimes appropriate to catcall, and 2% said it was always acceptable. The majority (55%) labelled catcalling "harassment", while 20% called it "complimentary". Americans in the 18–29 age range were the most likely to categorize catcalling as complimentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Peter|title=Catcalling: Never OK and not a compliment|url=https://today.yougov.com/news/2014/08/15/catcalling/|publisher=YouGov|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of women in the Kings Cross area study found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault.&lt;ref name="this_life" /&gt; In a more representative sample, a 2014 U.S. survey found that 68% of harassed women and 49% of harassed men were "very or somewhat concerned" the situation would escalate.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt; Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack.&lt;ref name="this_life" /&gt; The U.S. survey found 31% of women responded by going out with other people instead of alone, and 4% of all victims made a major life change to avoid harassment, like moving or quitting a job.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;

== Representation in media ==
The mainstream media, including any printed, televised, social media or other online information sources, commonly represent sexual and street harassment using overly simplified narratives and delegitimizing language. There exists a tendency in media portrayals of the issue that harassment occurs as a reflection of individual aberration, usually highlighting aspects of misconduct by one party against another.&lt;ref name="Women 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=Paula|last2=Charlesworth|first2=Sara|title=Framing Sexual Assault through Media Representations|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=March 2013|volume=37|issue=1|pages=95–103|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2012.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While humanities and feminist scholarship identify any degree of sexual harassment as a manifestation of gendered oppression and discrimination in society, seldom do mainstream media sources report that harassment derives from systemic gender inequality or introduce dialogue in the context of broader issues.&lt;ref name="Women 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Review 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easteal et. al,|first1=Paula|title=Review: Enduring Themes and Silences in Media Portrayals of Violence against Women|journal=Women Studies International Forum|date=January 2015|volume=48|issue=1|pages=103–113|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2014.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that mainstream media shapes the public opinion of harassment is by incorporating conservative messages to their audiences, specifically through the use of invalidating rhetoric. As with other forms of oppression against women, the language presented by media sources commonly undermines the validity of street harassment complaints.&lt;ref name="Review 2014" /&gt; The particular overuse of the words, "alleged," "supposed," "expected," immediately create a sense of uncertainty toward claims of harassment and assault, therefore imposing a sense of responsibility and/or guilt on to the victim.&lt;ref name="Review 2014" /&gt;

While the internet, social media specifically, allows a new platform for activism against street harassment, it has become a source of frequent verbal harassment against users. Harassment that victims may face in real life on the streets translates to the online public forum of Twitter. In a case study following a hashtag originating in November 2011, #mencallmethings, primarily female Twitter users posted and discussed examples of the harassment they received online from men.&lt;ref name="Conceptualizing Women 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Megarry|first1=Jessica|title=Online Incivility or Sexual Harassment? Conceptualizing Women's Experiences in the Digital Age|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=November 2014|volume=47|issue=1, part A|pages=46–55|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of this trending hashtag, tweets that were meant to educate, share stories, and create a sense of togetherness between victims often received backlash from the male Twitter user population, demonstrating that on an unmonitored media source women's voices on harassment are again silenced.&lt;ref name="Conceptualizing Women 2014" /&gt;

While internet "trolling" (defined as aggressive online behavior) is prevalent across several internet circles, the manifestation of gendered society which normalizes street harassment, result in a specific type of Internet aggression that feminist scholars label as "gendertrolling."&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mantilla|first1=Karla|title=Gendertrolling: Misogyny Adapts to New Media|journal=Feminist Studies|date=20|issue=2013|page=53|url=electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsglr&amp;AN=edsgcl.350577349&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gendertrolling is thought to be a more threatening form of social media presence, one that aligns with the responses to the #mencallmethings posts. What allows gendertrolling to become destructive to its victims are the prescriptive signs of gender-based insults, hate speech, credible threats, unusual intensity, scope, longevity of attacks, and reaction to women speaking out, all which are similar features of street harassment.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com" /&gt;

==Activism==
Public activism against street harassment has grown since the late 2000s. A group called Stop Street Harassment began as a blog in 2008 and became incorporated as a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|non-profit organization]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides tips for dealing with street harassment in safe and assertive ways, as well as provide opportunities to "take community action". In 2010, Stop Street Harassment started the annual "International Anti-Street Harassment Week". During the third week in April, people from around the globe participated in "marches, rallies, workshops, and sidewalk chalkings" in an effort to gain attention for the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/our-work/meetusonthestreet/|title=International Anti-Street Harassment Week|publisher=Stop Street Harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group called [[Hollaback!]] was founded in 2010.

Activists have made use of [[viral video]]s to publicize the frequency of unsolicited comments that women receive in public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leeds|first1=Sarene|title=Jessica Williams Continues Her War Against Catcalls on 'The Daily Show'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/10/03/jessica-williams-continues-her-war-against-catcalls-on-the-daily-show/|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hajela |first1=Deepti |title=Viral Video Documents New York Street Harassment |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/viral-video-documents-york-street-harassment-26568112 |accessdate=31 October 2014 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News |date=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031005238/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/viral-video-documents-york-street-harassment-26568112 |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One American [[street art]]ist used [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for a campaign called "Stop Telling Women to Smile." The artist posts portraits of herself and other young women accompanied with messages against street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Felicia R.|title=An Artist Demands Civility on the Street With Grit and Buckets of Paste|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/arts/design/tatyana-fazlalizadeh-takes-her-public-art-project-to-georgia.html|accessdate=4 November 2014|work=New York Times|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Minneapolis]] woman created a set of printable "Cards Against Harassment" (in homage to the game ''[[Cards Against Humanity]]'') that she distributes to street harassers. The cards are meant to explain to street harassers why their comments are unwanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silva|first1=Estey|title=Cards Against Harassment address street harassers directly|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Family/Modern-Parenthood/2014/0724/Cards-Against-Harassment-address-street-harassers-directly|accessdate=4 November 2014|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Cities Global Initiative created by UN-Habitat in 1996 is an approach to address harassment in public places through partnerships with cities’ communities, local organizations, and municipal governments. Actions taken to address this include improved street designs and lighting in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/05/2013-un-csw/|title=2013 UN Comission on the Status of Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=28 May 2013|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Commission of the Status of Women (CSW), a subcategory under UN Women, is committed to empowering women and advocating for gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw|title=Commission on the Status of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=UN Women|access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, it included multiple clauses into their "[http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Agreed Conclusions]" that focused on sexual harassment in public places in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/05/2013-un-csw/|title=2013 UN Comission on the Status of Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=28 May 2013|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study in ''The'' ''British Journal of Criminology'' examines the extent to which online sites serve as a form of informal justice for street harassment victims. The results show that individuals experience “validation” or “affirmation” after self-disclosing their experiences online and may receive acknowledgement or support by doing so. Notably, some individuals feel re-victimized or experience re-traumatization. It was found that online justice is limited, but in particular for street harassment, it is possible that victims achieve some form of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fileborn|first=Bianca|date=November 2017|title=Justice 2.0: Street harassment victims' use of social media and online activism as sites of informal justice|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/57/6/1482/2698882|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=57|pages=1482–1501|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
In some jurisdiction there are laws that make some forms of street harassment illegal. Peru has had anti-street harassment laws since March 2015.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21651849-crackdown-public-displays-machismo-criminalising-catcallers|title=Criminalising the catcallers|work=The Economist|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quezon City]] in the [[Philippines]], which has a high rate of street harassment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Fritzie|title=The streets that haunt Filipino women|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/124993-sexual-harassment-women-streets|accessdate=June 2, 2016|agency=[[Rappler]]|date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented an ordinance against street harassment, such as cat-calling and wolf-whistling, on May 16, 2016. Penalties for acts of street harassment include [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] of [[Philippine peso|Php]] 1,000 to Php 5,000 and a 1-month jail term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sauler|first1=Erika|title=In QC, wolf whistles can land you to jail|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/788539/in-qc-wolf-whistles-can-land-you-in-jail|accessdate=June 2, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the United States, laws regarding street harassment are under the jurisdiction of individual states. In Illinois there are laws that relate to street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SSH-KYR-Illinois.pdf|title=Illinois|last=|first=|date=|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a potential precursor to physical assault and even murder, offensive speech and [[hate speech]] are protected under the [[First Amendment]]. Although a perpetrator is legally allowed to shout obscenities, other acts such as public indecency and sexual assault are blatant violations of the law. Offensive speech and hate speech as forms of street harassment are frequently used as evidence against repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logan|first=Laura S.|date=2015-03-01|title=Street Harassment: Current and Promising Avenues for Researchers and Activists|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=3|pages=196–211|doi=10.1111/soc4.12248|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public's rejection of criminalizing offensive speech and hate speech in view of the First Amendment poses a challenge for the legal system. Contrary to popular belief, it is not just those who are unaffected by street harassment that hold this ideal; victims and survivors of offensive speech and hate speech are reluctant to advocate against this First Amendment right. Adversely, the public is hesitant to rely on the law in their daily lives as they prefer autonomy, regardless of how grave the situation may be.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2000 1055–1090"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Laura Beth|date=2000|title=Situating Legal Consciousness: Experiences and Attitudes of Ordinary Citizens about Law and Street Harassment|jstor=3115131|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1055–1090|doi=10.2307/3115131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is there a sense of powerlessness when being victimized during street harassment, but also during the legal process. More often than not, plaintiffs are unprepared for litigation and the courtroom as they are inexperienced, to no fault of their own. Quite frequently, plaintiffs are victims of legal aggression via their street harassment perpetrator. Perpetrators will file a frivolous lawsuit in response to their victim's charges. In addition to this, it is difficult to acquire government aid, as seen in the 1994 case when the EEOC received 11,000 harassment complaints and prosecuted fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stambaugh|first=Phoebe Morgan|date=1997|title=The Power of Law and the Sexual Harassment Complaints of Women|jstor=4316504|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=9|issue=2|pages=23–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of interviews conducted by Laura Beth Nielson in 2000, regarding the attitudes of the public in relation to the law and street harassment, four paradigms were offered. The freedom of speech paradigm is based on the ideal of allegiance to the First Amendment's supposed ideology. The autonomy paradigm is based on the desire for self-governance. The impracticality paradigm is based on the impossibility of regulation in regards to offensive speech and hate speech. Lastly, the distrust of authority paradigm is based on the lack of faith in legal officials to enforce laws. These four paradigms exemplify the reasoning behind the lack of criminalization for street harassment.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2000 1055–1090"/&gt;

A 2014 report to the [[UN General Assembly]] by the [[United Nations]]' top official for [[counter-terrorism]] and [[human rights]] condemned mass electronic surveillance as a clear violation of core [[privacy]] rights guaranteed by multiple treaties and conventions and makes a distinction between "targeted surveillance" - which "depend[s] upon the existence of prior suspicion of the targeted individual or organization" — and "mass surveillance", by which "states with high levels of [[Internet]] penetration can [...] gain access to the telephone and e-mail content of an effectively unlimited number of users and maintain an overview of Internet activity associated with particular [[website]]s".&lt;ref name=theintercept1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenwald|first1=Glenn|title=UN Report Finds Mass Surveillance Violates International Treaties and Privacy Rights|url=https://theintercept.com/2014/10/15/un-investigator-report-condemns-mass-surveillance/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom's [[House of Lords]] also distinguishes between these two broad types of surveillance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance: Citizens and the State - Constitution Committee|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldconst/18/1804.htm|publisher=House of Lords|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Mass surveillance is also known as “passive” or “undirected” surveillance. [...] It is not targeted on any particular individual but gathers images and information for possible future use. CCTV and databases are examples of mass surveillance.
* Targeted surveillance is surveillance directed at particular individuals and can involve the use of specific powers by authorised public agencies. Targeted surveillance can be carried out overtly or covertly, and can involve human agents. Under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] (RIPA), targeted covert surveillance is “directed” if it is carried out for a specific investigation or operation. By comparison, if it is carried out on designated premises or on a vehicle, it is “intrusive” surveillance. Targeting methods include the interception of communications, the use of communications “traffic” data, visual surveillance devices, and devices that sense movement, objects or persons.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Only targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime, including [[terrorism]], is justified, according to a decision by the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=theguardian1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European court’s snooping judgment ‘bolsters privilege’|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/european-courts-snooping-judgment-bolsters-privilege/5059203.article|publisher=Law Society Gazette|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=EU's highest court delivers blow to UK snooper's charter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heathman|first1=Amelia|title=EU court deals major blow to UK's controversial snooper's charter|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/eu-rules-against-snoopers-charter|publisher=WIRED UK|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current approach of the [[NSA]] and its related organizations is attempting to collect all [[SIGINT|signals]] of everybody at all times without any prior selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The crux of the NSA story in one phrase: 'collect it all'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/crux-nsa-collect-it-all|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maass|first1=Peter|title=Inside NSA, Officials Privately Criticize "Collect It All" Surveillance|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/05/28/nsa-officials-privately-criticize-collect-it-all-surveillance/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=David|title=‘No Place to Hide’ by Glenn Greenwald, on the NSA’s sweeping efforts to ‘Know it All’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald-on-the-nsas-sweeping-efforts-to-know-it-all/2014/05/12/dfa45dee-d628-11e3-8a78-8fe50322a72c_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; So any current selection is only used for targets of special interest, human review or special resource allocation.

Such selectors include searching the web for the [[Privacy software|privacy-enhancing software tools]] such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=The NSA Is Targeting Users of Privacy Services, Leaked Code Shows|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/nsa-targets-users-of-privacy-services/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA targets the privacy-conscious|url=https://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_page-1.html|publisher=Das Erste|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal control and consent ===
Selectors for who to surveil and for what to look for in searches for unknown threats as well as their extents can be decided upon by society. Verifiable public consent on broad selectors and their extents as well as proper mechanisms and institutions for oversight may allow for a better cooperation of private sectors and citizens with their intelligence communities.

=== Germany and NSA's selector lists ===
In [[Operation Eikonal]] German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] agents received "Selector Lists" − search terms for their [[Dragnet (policing)|dragnet surveillance]]. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Spying Close to Home: German Intelligence Under Fire for NSA Cooperation - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agency-bnd-under-fire-for-nsa-cooperation-a-1030593.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS), the [[Eurocopter]] project&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bnd-und-nsa-die-chronologie-des-spionageskandals/11722810.html|title=BND und NSA: Die Chronologie des Spionageskandals – Politik – Tagesspiegel|work=tagesspiegel.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-neue-bnd-affaere-ein-foul-mit-folgen-1.2448810|title=Wie die NSA europäische Unternehmen ausspionierte|work=Süddeutsche.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.&lt;ref name="ts1" /&gt; Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nsa-spitzelei-bnd-soll-12-000-suchbegriffe-geloescht-haben-13569002.html|title=NSA-Spitzelei: BND soll 12.000 Suchbegriffe gelöscht haben|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=1 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and the [[Greens (Germany)|Greens]] filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - BVerfG, Beschluss des Zweiten Senats vom 13. n|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2016/10/es20161013_2bve000215.html|website=bundesverfassungsgericht.de|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BND's project group charged with supporting the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal|NSA investigative committee in German parliament]] set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated [[economic espionage]] directly under the Germans' noses.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denkler|first1=Thorsten|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: NSA jubelte BND deutsche Spähziele unter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienst-affaere-nsa-jubelte-bnd-deutsche-spaehziele-unter-1.2715253|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, [[Kurt Graulich]], as a "person of trust" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Constitutional Court rules out access to NSA's 'selectors' list|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-constitutional-court-rules-out-access-to-nsas-selectors-list/a-36396385|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designierter NSA-Sonderermittler: Ein Mann, 40.000 brisante Daten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-sonderermittler-kurt-graulich-ein-mann-40-000-datensaetze-a-1040661.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his almost 300-paged report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Graulich-Abschlussbericht|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/graulich-abschlussbericht-101.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]] − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstaffäre: Sonderermittler spricht von klarem Vertragsbruch der NSA|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-selektorenliste-kurt-graulich-spricht-von-klarem-vertragsbruch-a-1060280.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstkontrolleure: BND hat gegen Recht und Auftrag verstoßen|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Geheimdienstkontrolleure-BND-hat-gegen-Recht-und-Auftrag-verstossen-3045627.html|publisher=Heise Online|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BND hat jahrelang unter Freunden spioniert|url=http://www.dw.com/de/bnd-hat-jahrelang-unter-freunden-spioniert/a-19393446|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Markus|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: BND spitzelte mit eigenen Selektoren|url=http://www.fr-online.de/datenschutz/geheimdienst-affaere-bnd-spitzelte-mit-eigenen-selektoren,1472644,32163156.html|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus Landefeld]], member of the board at the Internet industry association [[Eco International]], has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somaskanda|first1=Sumi|title=Is Big Brother coming to Germany?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/12/big-brother-coming-germany-161213062129779.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calls for targeted surveillance ==

=== Intelligence officials ===
Former [[NSA]] director and [[whistleblower]] [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] testified that while targeted data collection operations could help prevent terror attacks, "overcollection" of mass data undermined security and had consistently cost lives because of "analysis paralysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Travis|first1=Alan|last2=Bowcott|first2=Owen|title='Snooper's charter' will cost British lives, MPs are warned|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/snoopers-charter-will-cost-british-lives-mps-warned|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the UK government should "redirect" intelligence agencies and law enforcement to targeted surveillance with it being "based on probable cause and developing knowledge about the targets and make sure they qualify for things like warrants". He also states that "retroactively analysing people, anybody you want, any time you want, that's certainly possible with bulk acquisition of data but that's certainly not what democracies are built on". According to him "that's what [[totalitarian]] states are built on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burgess|first1=Matt|title=UK mass surveillance 'totalitarian' and will 'cost lives', warns ex-NSA tech boss|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mass-surveillance-william-binney-nsa-uk-ip-bill|publisher=WIRED UK|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] states:
{{Quote|text=What I protest most strongly is mass surveillance, indiscriminate surveillance where they are watching everyone. Targeted surveillance that's backed by a court...is the least intrusive means of achieving these investigative goals without destroying the rights of everyone else in a free society |author=Edward J.

Snowden also noted that the men who committed recent terrorist attacks in France, Canada and Australia were under surveillance but they weren't singled out.
{{Quote|text=It wasn't the fact that we weren't watching people or not, it was the fact that we were watching people so much that we did not understand what we had.

In May 2015 ''[[The Intercept]]'' revealed that it obtained documents that showed that officials inside the NSA have criticized the 'collect it all'-approach as well with the documents having titles such as "Data Is Not Intelligence", "The Fallacies Behind the Scenes", "Cognitive Overflow?", "Summit Fever", "In Praise of Not Knowing", "Dealing With a 'Tsunami' of Intercept", "Overcome by [[Information overload|Overload]]?" and "Too Many Choices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maass|first1=Peter|title=Inside NSA, Officials Privately Criticize "Collect It All" Surveillance|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/05/28/nsa-officials-privately-criticize-collect-it-all-surveillance/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents feature conclusions such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The SIGINT mission is far too vital to unnecessarily expand the haystacks while we search for the needles. Prioritization is key.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We in the agency are at risk of a similar, collective paralysis in the face of a dizzying array of choices every single day&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Analysis paralysis' isn’t only a cute rhyme. It's the term for what happens when you spend so much time analyzing a situation that you ultimately stymie any outcome [...] It's what happens in SIGINT when we have access to endless possibilities, but we struggle to prioritize, narrow, and exploit the best ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Politics ===
[[United Kingdom]]'s [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] have demanded that the Government ends indiscriminate mass surveillance and introduces a more targeted and effective [[counter-terrorism]] policy that uses targeted surveillance of specific individuals who are suspected of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lib Dems call for targeted surveillance not Big Brother|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/targeted-surveillance-not-big-brother|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en|date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson [[Alistair Carmichael]] asks that "mass spying on the British people should be replaced with targeted surveillance of specific individuals suspected of wrongdoing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How spies broke law to snoop on your emails|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3845800/How-spies-broke-law-snoop-emails-Intelligence-agencies-harvested-data-websites-visited-people-called-texted.html|publisher=Mail Online|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British spies illegally kept databases on UK citizens.

In the 2015 "Resolution 2045" the [[European Parliamentary Assembly]] "recognises the need for effective, targeted surveillance of suspected terrorists and other organised criminal groups" and states that "such targeted surveillance can be an effective tool for law enforcement and crime prevention", while at the same time "according to independent reviews carried out in the United States, mass surveillance does not appear to have contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks, contrary to earlier assertions made by senior intelligence officials. Instead, resources that might prevent attacks are diverted to mass surveillance, leaving potentially dangerous persons free to act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass surveillance - Resolution 2045 (2015)|url=https://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=21692&amp;lang=en|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy campaigners argue that instead of "wasting resources gathering and sifting through the volume of data being accumulated through mass surveillance", resources would be better allocated in providing more personnel for targeted surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|title=Does the Berlin attack make the case for increased surveillance?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/22/berlin-terrorist-attack-surveillance-intelligence-agencies|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis of 10 recent [[terror attack]]s [[Ryan Gallagher]] of ''[[The Intercept]]'' concludes that "if any lesson can be learned from studying the perpetrators of recent attacks, it is that there needs to be a greater investment in conducting targeted surveillance of known terror suspects and a move away from the constant knee-jerk expansion of dragnet surveillance, which has simply not proven itself to be effective, regardless of the debate about whether it is legal or ethical in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|title=From Paris to Boston, Terrorists Were Already Known to Authorities|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/11/18/terrorists-were-already-known-to-authorities/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Privacy International]] launched a legal case against Britain's security services Thomas de la Mare QC of the group states there is a danger that "de facto constant surveillance" such as the services' orders for bulk data from telecom companies on request could become "the most potent instrument of repression" and argued during the hearing, that such non-targeted forms of surveillance have turned investigations on their head. The campaigners argue that whereas in the past, individual inquiries based on suspicion would throw up leads, it is now algorithmic processing of data providing those leads with that amounting to mass surveillance.&lt;ref name=ft1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=UK heading towards era of parliament-approved mass surveillance|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/uk-heading-towards-era-of-parliament-approved-mass-surveillance/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], which is challenging the legality of bulk collection in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] criticizes the "Report of the bulk powers review" by [[David Anderson (British politician)|David Anderson]] QC for failing to answer whether information gathered via bulk powers was the "critical factor in preventing or detecting serious crime, and whether that information could have been obtained from smart, targeted surveillance instead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=UK spy agencies’ use of mass surveillance backed by external reviewer|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/19/uk-spy-agencies-use-of-mass-surveillance-backed-by-external-reviewer/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Paddick]] comments the 2016 [[Investigatory Powers Act]], saying "as with any legislation, there is a significant risk that authorities will use powers in a way that parliament never intended" and called for proper oversight to ensure any surveillance is targeted and proportionate.&lt;ref name=theguardian1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asthana|first1=Anushka|title=Revealed: British councils used Ripa to secretly spy on public|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/british-councils-used-investigatory-powers-ripa-to-secretly-spy-on-public|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;? --&gt;
Privacy campaigners say the bill clearly lays out the mass surveillance powers that would be at the disposal of the security services, and want it amended so that the surveillance is targeted and based on suspicion and argue that the powers are so sweeping, and the bill's language so general, that not just the security services but also government bodies will be able to analyse the records of millions of people even if they are not under suspicion.&lt;ref name=ft1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viña|first1=Gonzalo|title=Surveillance: Taking liberties?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1b7df076-57bb-11e6-9f70-badea1b336d4|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Troy Wolverton]] notes that the documents leaked by Snowden revealed widespread abuses, both at home and abroad.

Jo Glanville, editor of [[Index on Censorship]] and a member of the Ministry of Justice working party on libel reform, asserts that keeping the country safe does not entitle the government or the intelligence services to act without regards to our human rights and that "it is possible to conduct targeted surveillance with effective oversight while according respect to all our rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=David|last2=Kreissl|first2=Reinhard|title=Surveillance in Europe|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317915461|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sauQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientists at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] have developed an algorithmic framework for conducting targeted surveillance of individuals within social networks while protecting the privacy of "untargeted" digital bystanders that "outputs a list of confirmed targeted individuals discovered in the network, for whom any subsequent action (e.g., publication in a most-wanted list, further surveillance, or arrest in the case of terrorism; medical treatment or quarantine in the case of epidemics) will not compromise the privacy of the protected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Michael|title=Algorithms Claim to Hunt Terrorists While Protecting the Privacy of Others|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/algorithms-claim-to-hunt-terrorists-while-protecting-the-privacy-of-others|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kearns|first1=Michael|last2=Roth|first2=Aaron|last3=Wu|first3=Zhiwei Steven|last4=Yaroslavtsev|first4=Grigory|title=Private algorithms for the protected in social network search|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=26 January 2016|volume=113|issue=4|pages=913–918|doi=10.1073/pnas.1510612113|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/913|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4743768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 it was reported that German federal agencies are using a new program called "Radar", developed by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] and the [[University of Zürich]], that aims to help evaluate the risk posed by persons. It includes a catalog of questions such as about the person's relationship to violence and access to weapons and takes into account data on past terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neues Sicherheitssystem: "Radar" soll Gefährder besser erkennen|url=http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Radar-soll-Gefaehrder-besser-erkennen-article19609922.html|website=n-tv.de|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neue BKA-Software soll Gefährder beurteilen|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/amri-125.html|website=tagesschau.de|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crypto and security communities can make the Internet more secure by making population-wide surveillance technically or economically infeasible, understanding that modest amounts of targeted surveillance will always be technically and economically feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Privacy and Security in an Age of Surveillance|doi=10.4230/DagMan.5.1.25|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bc17/0ae9d483812e8244089eca297abb03d2af73.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Snowden]] notes that "we're thwarting mass surveillance when we use [[encryption]]. We're not stopping targeted surveillance. Because even, again, if you have the most well-encrypted device in the world, if the government spends a million dollars to pay a hacker to exploit your phone personally, they will very likely succeed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden: 'Journalists Are a Threatened Class' in Era of Mass Surveillance|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/10/26/snowden-journalists-are-threatened-class-era-mass-surveillance|publisher=Common Dreams|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to legalize mass surveillance as targeted surveillance ==
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] claims that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and its defenders are trying to pass off their mass surveillance as being authorized under Section 702 of the [[FISA Amendments Act]] as "targeted surveillance" even though it includes the collection of the content of hundreds of millions of communications annually and the real-time search of billions more which according to them fits the definition "mass surveillance" under Section 702.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Word Games: What the NSA Means by "Targeted" Surveillance Under Section 702|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/nsa-word-games-mass-v-targeted-surveillance-under-section-702|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--http://www.law360.com/articles/848733/3rd-circ-revives-challenge-to-nsa-email-surveillance--&gt;

Furthermore, the organization asks how the US government justified the [[Yahoo! email scanning program|Yahoo email scanning]] under [[FISA]], asking whether the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] has interpreted FISA – which authorizes targeted surveillance of certain foreigners' (such as spies or terrorists) communications – to mean that the government can conscript Yahoo into mass surveillance of all of its users' emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Time for Answers on Yahoo's Email Scanning|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/its-time-answers-yahoos-email-scanning|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to documents obtained from Edward Snowden and published by [[Glenn Greenwald]] the NSA and [[GCHQ]] have been automating targeted operations, allowing for "industrial scale exploitation" that can potentially infect "millions" of machines with [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopfstein|first1=Janus|title=The NSA’s "Targeted" Surveillance Is Looking Less Targeted All the Time|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/12/nsa_tailored_access_operations_turbine_surveillance_looking_less_targeted.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|title=NSA trove shows 9:1 ratio of innocents to suspicious people in "targeted surveillance"|url=https://boingboing.net/2014/07/06/huge-nsa-surveillance-trove-sh.html|publisher=Boing Boing|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">'''The "No-Problem" Problem''' refers to an often spoken facet of [[systemic bias]], whereby exclusion of minorities or
marginalized people and knowledge occurs because the issue is perceived as either not a problem, or not the speaker's
problem. The term was defined in 1990 by [[Deborah Rhode]] who published a paper by this title in the 1991 [[Yale Law Journal]].&lt;ref name=article&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/796785.pdf The "No-Problem" Problem: Feminist Challenges and Cultural Change], by Rhode, Yale Law Journal, Vol. 100, nr. 6, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, inspired by difficulties of people grappling with class and racial issues, was applied by Rhode specifically to the women's movement as being a problem of ''perception'', since "the most traditional approach has been to acknowledge gender disparities, but to deny their injustice".&lt;ref name=article/&gt; Twenty years later, the problem was revisited by Brenda Frink of the [[Clayman Institute for Gender Research]] with her article ''The persistence of the no-problem problem''.&lt;ref name=Frink&gt;[https://gender.stanford.edu/news-publications/gender-news/persistence-no-problem-problem The persistence of the no-problem problem], by Brenda Frink, Clayman Institute for Gender Research, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She quoted Rhode's 2010 book on the subject of women's physical appearance, ''The Beauty Bias: The Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhode|first1=Deborah L.|authorlink1=Deborah Rhode|title=The Beauty Bias: the Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=0195372875}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perception in the problem had been taken a step further and been distilled into an issue of physical appearance, since "women who fall short of cultural beauty ideals are disadvantaged in jobs, salaries, and promotions even where looks bear no obvious relationship to performance". 
In 2014 Ilene Fischer wrote a blog in the Huffington Post titled ''The No-Problem Problem'' applying the term to the [[gender pay gap]] at [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ilene-fischer/the-noproblem-problem_b_6072774.html The No-Problem Problem], by Ilene Fischer, Huffington Post, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Library of Babel'''" ({{lang-es|La biblioteca de Babel}}) is a [[short story]] by [[Argentina|Argentine]] author and [[librarian]] [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1899–1986), conceiving of a [[universe]] in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and [[character set]].

The story was originally published in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in Borges' [[1941 in literature|1941]] collection of stories ''El Jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' (''The Garden of Forking Paths''). That entire book was, in turn, included within his much-reprinted ''[[Ficciones]]'' ([[1944 in literature|1944]]). Two [[English language|English-language]] [[translation]]s appeared approximately simultaneously in [[1962 in literature|1962]], one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges's works titled ''[[Labyrinths]]'' and the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of ''Ficciones''.

==Plot summary==
Borges' narrator describes how his universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent [[hexagon]]al rooms, each of which contains the bare necessities for human survival—and four walls of bookshelves. Though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless, the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic [[grapheme|characters]] (22 letters, the period, the comma, and space). Though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish, the library also must contain, somewhere, every coherent book ever written, or that might ever be written, and every possible [[permutation]] or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books. The narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information, including predictions of the future, biographies of any person, and translations of every book in all [[language]]s. Conversely, for many of the texts, some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents.

Despite—indeed, because of—this glut of information, all books are totally useless to the reader, leaving the librarians in a state of suicidal despair. This leads some librarians to [[superstitious]] and [[cult]]-like behaviors, such as the "Purifiers", who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the "Crimson Hexagon" and its illustrated, magical books. Others believe that since all books exist in the library, somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library's contents; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the "Man of the Book" has read it, and they travel through the library seeking him.

==Themes==
[[File:Jorge Luis Borges.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Borges in 1976]]
The story repeats the theme of Borges' [[1939 in literature|1939]] essay "[[The Total Library]]" ("La Biblioteca total"), which in turn acknowledges the earlier development of this theme by [[Kurd Lasswitz]] in his [[1901 in literature|1901]] story "The Universal Library" ("Die Universalbibliothek"):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain examples that [[Aristotle]] attributes to [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] clearly prefigure it, but its belated inventor is [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], and its first exponent, [[Kurd Lasswitz]]. [...] In his book ''The Race with the Tortoise'' (Berlin, 1919), Dr [[Theodor Wolff]] suggests that it is a derivation from, or a parody of, [[Ramón Llull]]'s thinking machine [...T]he elements of his game are the universal orthographic symbols, not the words of a language [...] Lasswitz arrives at twenty-five symbols (twenty-two letters, the space, the period, the comma), whose recombinations and repetitions encompass everything possible to express in all languages. The totality of such variations would form a Total Library of astronomical size. Lasswitz urges mankind to construct that inhuman library, which chance would organize and which would eliminate intelligence. (Wolff's ''The Race with the Tortoise'' expounds the execution and the dimensions of that impossible enterprise.)&lt;ref&gt;Borges, Jorge Luis. ''The Total Library: Non-Fiction 1922–1986.'' Allen Lane The Penguin Press, London, 2000. Pages 214–216. Translated by Eliot Weinberger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of Borges' signature motifs are featured in the story, including [[infinity]], [[reality]], [[Kabbalah|cabalistic reasoning]], and [[labyrinth]]s. The concept of the library is often compared to [[Infinite monkey theorem|Borel's dactylographic monkey theorem]]. There is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in "The Library of Babel", although Borges had mentioned that analogy in "The Total Library": "[A] half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum." In this story, the closest equivalent is the line, "A blasphemous sect suggested [...] that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books."

Borges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story, "[[The Book of Sand]]" in which there is an infinite book (or book with an indefinite number of pages) rather than an infinite library. Moreover, the story's ''Book of Sand'' is said to be written in an unknown alphabet and its content is not obviously random. In The Library of Babel, Borges interpolates Italian mathematician [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.

The concept of the library is also overtly analogous to the view of the universe as a [[sphere]] having its center everywhere and its [[circumference]] nowhere. The [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] [[Blaise Pascal]] employed this [[metaphor]], and in an earlier essay Borges noted that Pascal's manuscript called the sphere ''effroyable,'' or "frightful".

In any case, a library containing ''all'' possible books, arranged at random, might as well be a library containing ''zero'' books, as any true information would be buried in, and rendered indistinguishable from, all possible forms of false information; the experience of opening to any page of any of the library's books has been simulated by websites which create screenfuls of random letters.&lt;ref&gt;See https://libraryofbabel.info/&lt;/ref&gt;

The quote at the beginning of the story, "By this art you may contemplate the variation of the twenty-three letters," is from [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s 1621 ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]''.

==Philosophical implications==
There are numerous philosophical implications within the idea of the finite library which exhausts all possibilities. Every book in the library is "intelligible" if one decodes it correctly, simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a [[one-time pad]]. This lends itself to the philosophical idea proposed by [[Immanuel Kant]], that our mind helps to structure our experience of reality; thus the rules of reality (as we know it) are intrinsic to the mind. So if we identify these rules, we can better decode 'reality'. One might speculate that these rules are contained in the crimson hexagon room which is the key to decoding the others. The library becomes a temptation, even an obsession, because it contains these gems of enlightenment while also burying them in deception. On a psychological level, the infinite storehouse of information is a hindrance and a distraction, because it lures one away from writing one's own book (i.e. living one's life). Anything one might write would of course already exist. One can see any text as being pulled from the library by the act of the author defining the search letter by letter until they reach a text close enough to the one they intended to write. The text already existed theoretically, but had to be found by the act of the author's imagination.&lt;ref name=Kelly1994&gt;{{citation|title=Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|year=1994|author=Kelly, Kevin|isbn=978-0-201-48340-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another implication is an argument against certain proofs of the [[existence of God]], as it is carried out by [[David Hume]] using the thought experiment of a similar library of books generated not by human mind, but by nature.&lt;ref name=Hume1779&gt;{{citation|title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion Part 3|year=1779|author=Hume, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite extent===
In mainstream theories of natural language syntax, every syntactically-valid utterance can be extended to produce a new, longer one, because of [[Recursion#In_language|recursion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the theory of syntax|author=Noam, Chomsky|year=1969|orig-year=1965|publisher=M.I.T. Press|isbn=9780262030113|edition=1st pbk.|location=Cambridge|oclc=12964950}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this process can be continued indefinitely, then there is no upper bound on the length of a well-formed utterance and the number of unique well-formed strings of any language is [[countably infinite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.|date=September 1, 2013|title=The Central Question in Comparative Syntactic Metatheory|journal=Mind &amp; Language|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=492–521|doi=10.1111/mila.12029|issn=1468-0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the books in the Library of Babel are of bounded length ("each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters"), so the Library can only contain a finite number of distinct strings, and thus cannot contain all possible well-formed utterances. Borges' narrator notes this fact, but believes that the Library is nevertheless infinite; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically, given an eventual "order" to the "disorder" of the seemingly-random arrangement of books.

===Quine's reduction===
In a short essay, [[W.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;O. Quine]] noted the interesting fact that the Library of Babel is finite (that is, we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written), and that the Library of Babel can be constructed in its entirety simply by writing a dot on one piece of paper and a dash on another. These two sheets of paper could then be alternated at random to produce every possible text, in [[Morse code]] or equivalently [[binary code|binary]]. Writes Quine, "The ultimate absurdity is now staring us in the face: a universal library of two volumes, one containing a single dot and the other a dash. Persistent repetition and alternation of the two are sufficient, we well know, for spelling out any and every truth. The miracle of the finite but universal library is a mere inflation of the miracle of binary notation: everything worth saying, and everything else as well, can be said with two characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/universal_library.html|title=Universal Library|author=W.V.O Quine|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full possible set of protein sequences ([[sequence space (evolution)|Protein sequence space]]) has been compared to the Library of Babel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnold, FH|title=The Library of Maynard-Smith: My Search for Meaning in the protein universe|journal=Advances in Protein Chemistry|date=2000|volume=55|pages=ix–xi|pmid=11050930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostermeier|first1=M|title=Beyond cataloging the Library of Babel.|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|date=March 2007|volume=14|issue=3|pages=237–8|pmid=17379136|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2007.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Library of Babel'', finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order. The same would be true of protein sequences if it were not for natural selection, which has picked out only protein sequences that make sense. Additionally, each protein sequence is surrounded by a set of neighbors (point mutants) that are likely to have at least some function. [[Daniel Dennett]]'s 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'' includes an elaboration of the Library of Babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences, which he calls the Library of Mendel, in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation. Dennett uses this concept again later in the book to imagine all possible algorithms that can be included in his Toshiba computer, which he calls the Library of Toshiba. He describes the Library of Mendel and the Library of Toshiba as subsets within the Library of Babel.

==Influence on later writers==
*[[Umberto Eco]]'s postmodern novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) features a labyrinthine library, presided over by a blind monk named Jorge of Burgos.
*In "The Net of Babel", published in ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1995, [[David Langford]] imagines the Library becoming [[computer]]ized for easy access. This aids the librarians in searching for specific text while also highlighting the futility of such searches as they can find anything, but nothing of meaning as such. The sequel continues many of Borges's themes, while also highlighting the difference between [[data]] and [[information]], and [[satire|satirizing]] the [[Internet]].
*[[Russell K. Standish|Russell Standish]]'s ''Theory of Nothing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html|title=Theory of Nothing|publisher=Hpcoders.com.au|date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the concept of the Library of Babel to illustrate how an [[ultimate ensemble]] containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe. This theory, therefore, implies the reality of all universes.
*[[Michael Ende]] reused the idea of a universe of hexagonal rooms in the ''Temple of a Thousand Doors'' from ''[[The Neverending Story]]'', which contained all the possible characteristics of doors in the fantastic realm. A later chapter features the [[infinite monkey theorem]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] uses the concept of the infinite library in his ''[[Discworld]]'' novels. The knowledgeable librarian is a human wizard transformed into an orangutan.
*''The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel'' (2008) by [[William Goldbloom Bloch]] explores the short story from a mathematical perspective. Bloch analyzes the hypothetical library presented by Borges using the ideas of topology, information theory, and geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bloch, William Goldbloom|title=The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/faculty-directory/bill-goldbloom-bloch/|title=William Goldbloom Bloch's home page|publisher=Faculty.wheatoncollege.edu|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[City at the End of Time]]'' (2008), the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'Babel', an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language. Bear has stated that this was inspired by Borges, who is also namechecked in the novel. Borges is described as an unknown Argentinian who commissioned an encyclopedia of impossible things, a reference to either "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" or the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]''.
*''Fone'', a short comic novel drawn by [[Milo Manara]], features a human astronaut and his alien partner stranded on a planet named Borges Profeta. The planet is overflowed by books containing all the possible permutations of letters.
*[[Steven L. Peck]] wrote a novella entitled ''A Short Stay in Hell'' (2012) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of Borges' Library of Babel.
*The third season of ''Carmilla'', a Canadian single-frame web series based on the novella by [[Sheridan Le Fanu|J. Sheridan Le Fanu]], is set in a mystical library described as "non-Euclidean" and omnipotent.  It contains a door that, depending on the knocking pattern on its panels, can be opened into any universe. It also creates a temporary parallel universe and is able to shift a character between the parallel and the original.  As the parallel universe collapses, darkness falls, and a character perishes in the void after uttering the words, "O time thy pyramids," which are contained on the second-to-last page of a book in the Library of Babel.
*In [[Christopher Nolan]]'s film [[Interstellar (film)|''Interstellar'']], the protagonist, Cooper, played by [[Matthew McConaughey]], becomes trapped in a world which mirrors that of Borges' i.e. Cooper's universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent [[hexagonal]] rooms, or libraries, each of which contains the bare necessities for survival. Though the order and content of the books and rooms are random and apparently completely meaningless, Cooper can, by manipulating the books, affect change in the "real" world and is, as such, analogous to the "Man of the Book", the messianic figure in The Library of Babel. Unlike the Man of the Book, however, Cooper is something more than just a [[metaphor]] and has a transformative role in his [[Universe]], becoming a [[catalyst]] and an agent of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/review-interstellar|author=Pinkerton, Nick|title=Review: Interstellar|date=July 21, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Atlantic]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/382636/|title=Interstellar Isn't About Religion (and Also It Is Totally About Religion)|author=Garber, Megan|date=November 12, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/11/13/363444786/the-science-of-interstellar|title=The Science Of 'Interstellar'|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jonathan Basile enterprised to recreate the Library in Borges' story on his website http://libraryofbabel.info, adapted to the English language. An algorithm he created generates a 'book' by iterating every permutation of 29 characters: the 26 English letters, space, comma, and period. Each book is marked by a coordinate, corresponding to its place on the hexagonal library (hexagon name, wall number, shelf number, and book name) so that every book can be found at the same place every time. The website is said to contain "all possible pages of 3200 characters, about 10&lt;sup&gt;4677&lt;/sup&gt; books".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libraryofbabel.info/About.html|title=Library of Babel Website : About|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Unicist Research Institute''' is a global decentralized [[research]] boutique, specialized in [[complexity science]], focused on the research of [[complex adaptive systems]] and their applications in the fields of social, institutional and individual [[behavior]]. It was founded in 1976 by [[Peter Belohlavek]] as an unincorporated association that was later transformed into a privately held company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicist.org/about-us.php|title=About us|publisher=www.unicist.org|accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicist.org/peter-belohlavek.php|title=About the Founder|publisher=www.unicist.org|accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its holding in Delaware, USA and its Research Bunker in Adrogue, Argentina, The Unicist Research Institute has a business arm and an academic arm. Some of its core specialties are the development of [[cognitive systems]], [[social behavior]] labs and educational programs for graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ferro|first= María Laura|date=2003-01-05|title= Teoría Unicista: Otra manera de aprender|magazine= Revista Nueva|location= Nº 599, p. 10-12|publisher= Agrupación Diarios del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The framework of the [[complexity science]] [[research]] [[methodology]] used in The Unicist Research Institute is based on [[pragmatism]], [[structuralism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Una investigación sobre los impulsores del comportamiento humano|url= |magazine= Mañana Profesional|location=p.27|publisher=Ediciones Mañana Profesional|date= May–June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four basic pillars of the [[applied research]] of The Unicist Research Institute were the [[ontogenesis]] of [[evolution]], the anthropological invariables and their evolution, the functionality of the roots of [[human intelligence]], and the double dialectical [[behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.unicist.org/pdf/proceedings_uc091.pdf|title= IX International Unicist Conference: Individual, institutional and social evolution &amp; Strategy|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= January 23–24, 2008|website= www.unicist.org|publisher= The Unicist Research Institute|access-date=2018-09-22|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social applications==

The Future Research Laboratory of The Unicist Research Institute develops future scenarios as the core aspect for social and [[economic development]] plans. In this area, The Unicist Research Institute introduced [[evolutionary economics]] in the [[microeconomics]] driven development program for countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Spain]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[United Kingdom]] based on its 40-year [[scenario building]] work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= García Bartelt|first= Mercedes|date=2005-05-11|title=Reclaman un mayor apoyo a emprendedores|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/703188-reclaman-un-mayor-apoyo-a-emprendedores|work=La Nación|location=Economía|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Brasil: Sanear para así crecer|url= |work= El Cronista Comercial|location=p.9|date=1990-03-18|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.unicist-school.org/microeconomics-driven-development/|title= Project on Microeconomics Driven Development - Social Lab|publisher= The Unicist School|accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Los pueblos cambian gobiernos, y no gobiernos a los pueblos|url= |work= El Día|location= Información Nacional -Uruguay, p.14|date=1989-08-18 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adec.org.ar/noticias-institucionales/noticia/1220|title= Conferencia sobre Prospectiva: Construcción de Escenarios Futuros, Regionales y de Negocios|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011-10-26|website= |publisher=ADEC: Agencia para el Desarrollo de la ciudad de Córdoba|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main applied researches of the institute include:

* The development of a [[Social Evolution]] Theory that was applied in political strategies. In 1987, the final application was done in the [[political campaign]] for the candidate who won the governors election in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Luchia-Puig|first= Cecilia|date=1989|title= Claves en la conducción empresaria|url= |location= |publisher= Ediciones Macchi|pages=105–116 |isbn=950-537-146-2|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The development of the Unicist Theory of [[Evolution]] that explained the dynamics of [[complex adaptive systems]] allowed developing multiple technologies to deal with [[adaptive behavior]] in social, economic and business entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Johnson|first= Peter|date=2004-12-16|title= Argentina faces 20-year transition period|url= |work= Buenos Aires Herald|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Peter Belohlavek &amp; The Unicist Research Institute|url= |magazine= Mañana Profesional|location= Segundo Congreso Nacional: Argentina necesita emprendedores. Nº 91, p.9|publisher=Ediciones Mañana Profesional|date= August–September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In this field, the institute developed social, economic and political scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Economista prevê mudança nos anos 90|url= |work= O Estado de São Paulo|location= Economia, p.4|date=1990-04-05|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The academic arm==

The academic arm of The Unicist Research Institute uses the unicist reflection driven [[education]] approach for graduates, which is homologous to research-based [[learning]] programs, but focused on researching the root causes of complex adaptive environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Caldas|first= Sérgio Túlio|date=1990-08-30|title= Economista cria centro de estudo empresarial|url= |work= O Estado de São Paulo|location= Economia, p. 9 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[Business Education]] this approach is based on learning to manage the concepts and fundamentals that underlie business functions and define the root causes of the problems to manage the root drivers of the solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ferro|first= María Laura|date=2003-01-05|title= Teoría Unicista: Otra manera de aprender|magazine= Revista Nueva|location= Nº 599, p. 12|publisher= Agrupación Diarios del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The business arm==

Some of the main accomplishments of the institute include:

* The Introduction of an epistemological method to validate [[quantitative research]] results in complex environments. The [[research]] made with American Express on travel expenses in 1988 was the first quantitative research with unicist epistemological validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Reveladora encuesta de American Express|url= |work= La Nación|location= Economía y Finanzas, p. 15|date=1988-10-31|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Avanzan los gastos por viajes y representación en Argentina|url= |work= Ambito Financiero|location= p. 7|date=1988-10-28|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The refutation of the traditional [[Law of Demand]] developed at The Unicist Research Institute allowed developing technologies to manage and monitor market [[behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Gesualdi|first= Patricia|date= 2013-05-06|title= Refutación a la Teoría de la Demanda|url= |magazine= Mañana University|location= p. 22-23|publisher=Ediciones Mañana Profesional|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The development of predictors in complex market processes to foster growth strategies was included in the first applications of the personalized organization model applied to growth that was used at Diners Club in 1981 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Luchia-Puig|first= Cecilia|date=1989|title= Claves en la conducción empresaria|url= |location= |publisher= Ediciones Macchi|pages=25–42|isbn=950-537-146-2|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an adaptive client centered management model in Renault that became a standard for [[business]] optimization in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Radiografía del caso Renault|url= |magazine= Noticias|location= Section: Empresas, p. 58-59 |publisher= Editorial Perfil|date=1990-01-14 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The development of a double dialectical [[logic]] to deal with the dynamics of [[adaptive systems]] led to the development of the unicist [[artificial intelligence]] model as a [[wikt:predictor|predictor]] for [[adaptive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Belohlavek|first= Peter|date=2006|title= Unicist logic to approach complexity|url= |location= |publisher= Blue Eagle Group|page= |isbn=978-987-1223-57-2|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Unparalleled Invasion'''" is a [[science fiction]] story written by [[Jack London]]. It was first published in ''[[McClure's]]'' in July 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=80308|title=The Unparalleled Invasion}}, retrieved 2015-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Under the influence of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], China modernizes and undergoes its own version of the [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji Reforms]] in the 1910s. In 1922, China breaks away from Japan and fights a brief war that culminates in the Chinese annexation of the Japanese possessions of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]], [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Formosa]], and [[Manchuria]]. Over the next half century, China's population steadily grows, and eventually migration overwhelms European colonies in Asia. The United States and the other Western powers launch a [[biological warfare]] campaign against China, resulting in the destruction of China's population, the few survivors of the plague being killed out of hand by European and American troops. China is then colonized by the Western powers. This opens the way to a joyous epoch of "splendid mechanical, intellectual, and art output". In the 1980s war clouds once more gather between Germany and France, and the story ends with the nations of the world solemnly pledging not to use the same techniques they had against China.

== Background and context ==
"The Unparalleled Invasion" was included in ''The Strength of the Strong'', a collection of stories by London published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/StrengthStrong/contents.html ''The Strength of the Strong''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527044818/http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/StrengthStrong/contents.html |date=2015-05-27 }} The World of Jack London, retrieved 2015-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; which also included "[[The Dream of Debs]]", a critique of [[capitalism|capitalist society]] in the US, and "The Strength of the Strong", which used a primitive background as metaphor of [[social injustice]] among men. 

"The Unparalleled Invasion" has been controversial for its depiction of [[genocide]] and has been cited&lt;ref name="slate review" /&gt; as evidence of London's [[racism]]. The genocide is described in considerable detail and nowhere is any objection made to it. The terms "yellow life" and "yellow populace" appear in the story. It ends with the "sanitation of China" and its re-settlement by Westerners.

'''Theological virtues''' are [[virtue]]s associated in [[Christian theology]] and [[Christian philosophy|philosophy]] with [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] resulting from the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] of [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=Rziha/&gt;  Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally they have been named [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], and can trace their importance in Christian theology to [[Paul the Apostle]] in [[1 Corinthians 13]], who also pointed out that charity is the most important.

The medieval Catholic philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] explained that these virtues are called theological virtues "because they have [[God]] for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by [[Divine revelation]] in the [[Sacred Scriptures]]".&lt;ref name=Delany/&gt;

==Moral theology ==
[[Image:VirtudesBraga.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The three Virtues in [[Bom Jesus do Monte|Bom Jesus]], [[Braga]] ]]

A person receives the theological virtues by their being "infused"—through [[Divine grace]]—into the person.&lt;ref name=CatholicEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: Virtue|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|date=1912|last=Waldron|first=M.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological virtues are so named because their object is the divine being (theos).
* ''Faith'' is the infused virtue, by which the intellect, by a movement of the will, assents to the supernatural truths of Revelation, not on the motive of intrinsic evidence, but on the sole ground of the infallible authority of God revealing.&lt;ref name=CatholicEncyclopedia/&gt; According to [[Hugh Pope]] "[W]hat God says is supremely credible, though not necessarily supremely intelligible for us."&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm Pope, Hugh. "Faith." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Vatican Council]] (III, iii;) stated that "faith is a supernatural virtue by which we with the inspiration and assistance of God's grace, believe those things to be true which He has revealed...although the assent of faith is in no sense blind, yet no one can assent to the Gospel teaching in the way necessary for salvation without the illumination of the Holy Spirit..."&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt; It is a gratuitous gift of God.
* ''Hope'' is defined as a Divinely infused virtue, acts upon the will, by which one trusts, with confidence grounded on the Divine assistance, to attain life everlasting.&lt;ref name=CatholicEncyclopedia/&gt; Its opposite is the sin of despair.&lt;ref name=Delany/&gt;
* ''Charity'' is a divinely infused virtue, inclining the human will to cherish God for his own sake above all things, and man for the sake of God. To love God is to wish Him all honour and glory and every good, and to endeavour, as far as one can, to obtain it for Him. John 14:23 notes a unique feature of reciprocity which makes charity a veritable friendship of man with God. "Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm Sollier, Joseph. "Love (Theological Virtue)." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of love may give place to [[hatred]], [[wrath]] or indifference.

==1 Corinthians 13==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2018}}
The first mention in Christian literature of the three theological virtues is in [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul's]] first letter to the Thessalonians 1:3, "...calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P10P.HTM NAB, 1 Thessalonians 1, n.2]&lt;/ref&gt; He later refers to this triad of virtues again, "But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P10T.HTM NAB, 1 Thessalonians 5:8]&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In [[1 Corinthians 13]], Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." First, because it informs the other two: "It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." Secondly, from a temporal perspective, love lasts, while "Hope isn't hope if its object is seen", and faith gives way to possession.

==Aquinas==
Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (''prudentia'') and moral virtue (e.g. courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness). This is frequently termed "the Unity of the Virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Annas, Julia. ''The Morality of Happiness'' (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 73-84&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas stated that theological virtues are so called "because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures".&lt;ref name=Delany&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07465b.htm Delany, Joseph. "Hope." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatment of the virtues, [[Aquinas]] viewed the theological virtues as being the product of habitual grace. According to Aquinas, this grace, through the theological virtues, allows humanity to become agents in meritorious action that is beyond their own natural ability. In this way it is supernatural.&lt;ref name="Rziha"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rziha|first1=John Michael|title=Perfecting Human Actions: St. Thomas Aquinas on Human Participation in Eternal Law|date=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=9780813216720|pages=143–149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CBFQw8hz8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas says "Faith has the character of a virtue, not because of the things it believes, for faith is of things that appear not, but because it adheres to the testimony of one in whom truth is infallibly found". (De Veritate, xiv, 8)&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt;

Aquinas further connected the theological virtues with the cardinal virtues. He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological virtues, caused by habitual grace, to find their fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal virtues.&lt;ref name=Rziha/&gt;

==Comparison of Cardinal and Theological Virtues==
The moral virtues are acquired by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology holds that the theological virtues differ from the [[cardinal virtues]] in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. Like the cardinal virtues, an individual who exercises these virtues strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.&lt;ref name=Drefcinski/&gt;

Following [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], Aquinas also recognized a separate but related type of moral virtue which is also infused by God. The distinction lies both in their source and end. The moral virtue of temperance recognizes food as a good that sustains life, but guards against the sin of [[gluttony]]. The ''infused'' virtue of temperance disposes the individual to practice fasting and abstinence. The infused moral virtues are connected to the theological virtue of Charity.&lt;ref name=Drefcinski&gt;[http://people.uwplatt.edu/~drefcins/233AquinasVirtues.html Drefcinski, Shane. "A Very Short Primer on St. Thomas Aquinas’ Account of the Various Virtues", University of Wisconsin–Platteville]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote three encyclicals about the theological virtues: ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (about love), ''[[Spe salvi]]'' (about hope), and ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' (about faith: this encyclical was written both by Pope Benedict XVI and by [[Pope Francis]]).&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/enciclica-papa-el-papa-pope-lumen-fidei-26222/ | title = The light of faith: origin, history and horizon of the christianism |newspaper = [[La Stampa]] | location = Turin | first = Alessandro | last = Speciale | date = 4 July 2013 | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Waste Minimisation Act''' is an Act of Parliament passed in [[New Zealand]] in 2008.

It was a Private Members Bill introduced by [[Mike Ward (New Zealand politician)|Mike Ward]]. The major provisions of the Act are: a levy on landfill waste, promoting [[product stewardship]] schemes, some mandatory waste reporting, clarifying the role of territorial authorities with respect to waste minimisation, and sets up a Waste Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/waste-minimisation.html|title=The Waste Minimisation Act 2008|date=2009-03-22|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act has a provision where the Minister for the Environment can assign the status of [[priority product]], which are those that can cause a high degree of environmental harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0089/latest/DLM1154572.html#DLM1154572|title=Waste Minimisation Act 2008 - Declaration of priority products|date=25 September 2008|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}{{Feminism sidebar}}
A '''women-only space''' is an area where only women are allowed, thus providing a place where they do not have to interact with men. Historically and globally, many cultures had, and many still have, some form of female seclusion.

==Purpose and background==
Women-only spaces are a form of [[sex segregation]], and practices such as women-only [[public toilet]]s, [[women-only passenger car]]s on public transport or [[women's parking space]]s may be described using both terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Browne|first=Kath|title=Genderism and the Bathroom Problem: (re)materialising sexed sites, (re)creating sexed bodies|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography|date=Sep 2004|volume=11|issue=3|pages=331–346|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=14573951&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=10 May 2014|doi=10.1080/0966369042000258668}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes referred to as "[[safe space]]". The goal is to provide women an area to work, free of male judgment or harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=HRCA&amp;u=lom_nmichu&amp;id=GALE%7CA445288645&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=lom_nmichu&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These spaces do not go without challenge. [[Men's rights]] activists have launched lawsuits to gain access to female-only spaces, as for example ''[[Stopps v Just Ladies Fitness (Metrotown) Ltd]]'', regarding a gym in Canada. The access of [[trans woman|trans women]], with or without legal recognition of their acquired gender, is also sometimes contentious, both from an ethical and from a legal perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.juliaserano.com/outside.html |title=On the Outside Looking In  |author=Julia Serano |authorlink=Julia Serano |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2012/05/legalities_of_e |title=Legalities of excluding trans women from women only spaces |author=Julian Norman |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Mary|title=FEMINIST SPIRITUALITY AND GENDER Lessons From Beyond Women-Only Space|journal=Communities|date=2014|volume=162|pages=38–72|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=94890559&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases questions have been raised about the value and legitimacy of particular spaces being reserved for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/07/feminist-troublemaker-film-festival |title=So I'm a feminist troublemaker for requesting some women-only space? |author=Julia Long |date=2012-12-07 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's quarters and segregated societies ==
Many cultures have had a tradition of separate living space for the women of a household ("women's quarters"); this becomes more elaborate the larger the house is, reaching its peak in royal palaces. The best known example is probably the [[harem]], a Turkish word, but similar systems existed elsewhere, and still do, in some places.
*[[Andaruni]] (Iran)
*[[Seraglio]] (Ottoman Empire)
*[[Zenana]] (South Asia) - hence, [[Zenana missions]], providing medical and educational support to segregated women
*[[Purdah]] (South Asia)
*[[Terem (Russia)|Terem]] (Russia)
*[[Ōoku]] (Japan)

Some societies segregate most public facilities by sex, according to their interpretation of [[Islam and gender segregation]]; critics calls this [[gender apartheid]] after the former South African system of racial division. The best known examples are Saudi Arabia ([[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia#Sex segregation]]) and Iran ([[Sex segregation in Iran]], [[Women's rights in Iran]]). More disputed regimes include Afghanistan ([[Taliban treatment of women]]) and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

==History==
In English-speaking societies, the rise of [[first wave feminism]], including the long struggles for the vote ([[suffrage]]) and for access to education and the professions, led to various initiatives to widen women's possibilities.
* A [[Ladies' Ordinary|ladies' ordinary]] was a women-only dining space which started to appear in North American hotels and restaurants from 1830, when it was socially unacceptable for women to dine in public without a male escort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Paul|date=2014-09-01|title=Women and Restaurants in the Nineteenth-Century United States|url=https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article-abstract/48/1/1/947457/Women-and-Restaurants-in-the-Nineteenth-Century|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1093/jsh/shu042|issn=0022-4529}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1910s and 1920s, there was widespread encouragement in the United States for the establishment of ladies' lounges and rest rooms to accommodate rural women who traveled into county seats and market towns to conduct business. The [[Ladies Rest Room]] in Lewisburg, Tennessee, may be the last free-standing one in that state still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ladies Rest Room: correspondence 2 :: Southern Places|url=http://digital.mtsu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15838coll4/id/2591/rec/1|website=digital.mtsu.edu|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1929 [[Virginia Woolf]] published an influential essay entitled "[[A Room of One's Own]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fth.sagepub.com/content/17/1/43.full.pdf+html|title=Because They're Worth It! Making Room for Female Students and Thealogy in Higher Education Contexts|last=|first=|date=|website=fth.sagepub.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some of these allow men at certain times of the day, week, or year, for example as guests. Other establishments allow men and women into physically separate areas. Others exist only temporarily, renting space for a few hours or days. Some of these allow children, either only girls or both sexes.

===Toilets===
{{Main|Sex segregation in public restrooms}}

In almost all countries, [[public toilet]]s are segregated by sex.

===Places to wash===
[[File:Fourneau St-Michel - Lavoir (Saint-Remy).jpg|thumb|A restored ''lavoir'' in Belgium]]
Public nudity is in many cultures restricted to single-sex groups. So [[public baths]] may separate men and women by time or by space.
*[[Turkish bath]], ''hammam'', see especially its [[Turkish bath#Function: gendered social space|function as a gendered social space]]
*[[Mikveh]], the [[ritual washing in Judaism|Jewish ritual bath]]

Specific examples include:
*[[Frauenbad Stadthausquai]], a public bath built in Switzerland in the late 19th century for women, and which still operates as such
*[[Hampstead Ponds|Hampstead Heath Ladies' Pond]], a reservoir in a London park

In many cultures, laundry was seen as "women's work", so the village wash-house (''[[lavoir]]'') acted as a space for women to gather and talk together as they washed clothes.

===Changing rooms===
{{Main|Changing rooms}}

Places to change one's clothes, for example for leisure (at the gym, swimming pool, or beach), or for work (locker rooms at factories and hospitals), or while shopping (department store fitting rooms), are usually single-sex. Some have individual cubicles, while others provide only communal facilities, e.g. an open space with benches and lockers.

===Menstruation===
{{See also|Culture and menstruation}}
Some [[menstrual taboo]]s require a woman to stay at home, or avoid certain places such as temples, but other cultures assign a particular place to segregate herself from her community, for example the ''[[chhaupadi]]'' (menstrual huts) of Nepal today, or ''[[The Red Tent (Diamant novel)|The Red Tent]]'', a fictionalised version of Old Testament-era customs.  The anthropologist Wynne Maggi describes the communal ''bashali'' (large menstrual house) of women in the [[Kalasha Valley]] (northwestern Pakistan) as their 'most holy place', respected by men and serving as women's all-female organizing centre for establishing and maintaining gender solidarity and power.&lt;ref&gt;W. Maggi, 2001. ''Our Women are Free. Gender and Ethnicity in the Hindukush.''  Michigan: University of Michigan Press &lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[seclusion of girls at puberty]] (i.e. [[menarche]]) is another such custom.

===Motherhood and lactation===
The [[lactation room]] is a modern, mostly American phenomenon, designed for using electric [[breast pump]]s and refrigerating the expressed milk. In many countries, spaces for women to nurse their babies can be known as breastfeeding rooms or nursing areas. The period of [[postpartum confinement]] was traditionally a time for new mothers to learn to care for their infant from older and more experienced women.

===Land and shelter===
[[File:Famille.jpg|thumb|A family outside their hut in Umoja village]]
* [[Womyn's land]], stemming from [[separatist feminism]] of the 1970s
* Anti-war activism such as [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]] in the UK and [[Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice]] in the US
* [[Umoja, Kenya]], a village of women and children fleeing domestic violence
* [[JINWAR]], Syria, a village for women without a husband and their children
* [[Women's shelter]], a place of temporary accommodation for women fleeing domestic violence, e.g. [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]]
* Some [[homeless shelters]] are just for women, e.g. [[Rosie's Place]]
* Most [[rape crisis center]]s

===Education===
* Girls' schools, i.e. [[single-sex education]], see also [[:Category:Girls' schools]]
* [[Women's college]]s and universities
* [[Finishing school]]
*[[Fraternities and sororities|Sororities]]

When formal education was banned by the Taliban, underground schools sprung up, such as the [[Golden Needle Sewing School]] for writers to secretly discuss their work.

===Religious places===
* [[Women's mosques]] in China, and more generally [[Gender segregation and Muslims#Sex segregation in mosques|the women's space in most mosques]], see [[Mosque#Gender separation|Gender separation in mosques]]
*[[Gender separation in Judaism]], as for example the [[Mechitza]] used to demarcate women's space in a synagogue
*[[Convent]], the home of Christian nuns
*[[Double monastery]], with separate space for monks (men) and nuns (women)
*[[Beguinage]], all-women accommodation in the Low Countries

===Health care===
Historically, some health care services for women (particularly around childbirth) were staffed by women. As women gained increased access to education in the late nineteenth century, hospitals hired female physicians for female patients; nurses by this point were almost exclusively female.
*[[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital]] is named after one of Britain's first female physicians
*[[London School of Medicine for Women]], the first medical school to train women as doctors

During [[second-wave feminism]], health activists set up [[feminist health centers]], particularly in the United States. Some places are for women from one background, such as the [[Native American Women’s Health Education Resource Center]]. Some holistic care centres are for mothers and their children, such as [[Nkosi's Haven]] in South Africa.
