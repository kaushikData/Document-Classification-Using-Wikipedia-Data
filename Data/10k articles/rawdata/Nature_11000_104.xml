'''{{mp|(52760) 1998 ML|14}}''', provisional designation {{mp|1998 ML|14}}, is a stony [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]], approximately 1 kilometer in diameter. It was discovered on 24 June 1998, by the [[LINEAR]] survey at the [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] in Socorro, New Mexico.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Description ==

{{mp|1998 ML|14}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9–3.9&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years and 9 months (1,366 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.62 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 2[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It is also a [[Mars-crossing asteroid]].

Shortly after its discovery, {{mp|1998 ML|14}} was imaged by [[radar]] at [[Goldstone Observatory|Goldstone]] and [[Arecibo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/~lance/asteroid_radar_properties/nea.sc_oc.html|title=NEA CIRCULAR POLARIZATION RATIO RANKING|date=11 April 2006|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=Asteroid Radar Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study showed that the asteroid has a [[rotation period]] of 15 hours, and a shape that is roughly spherical, with some steep protrusions and large craters.&lt;ref name="Hicks-1998a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hicks-1998b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner-2014e" /&gt;

On August 24, 2013 it passed at a distance of 21.9 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It was hoped to be observed by Goldstone radar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/goldstone_asteroid_schedule.html Goldstone radar]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was [[Minor planet designation|numbered]] by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 16 February 2003.&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; As of 2018, it has not been [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

[[File:Delta-O-18 in deep sea sediment-svg.svg|thumb|300px|[[δ18O|{{delta|18|O|}}]], a proxy for temperature, for the last 600,000 years (an average from several deep sea sediment carbonate samples)]]

The '''100,000-year problem''' ("100&amp;nbsp;ky problem", "100&amp;nbsp;ka problem") of the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] of [[orbital forcing]] refers to a discrepancy between the reconstructed [[geologic temperature record]] and the reconstructed amount of incoming solar radiation, or [[insolation]] over the past 800,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymo|first=Maureen E.|author-link=Maureen Raymo|last2=Nisancioglu|first2=Kerim H.|date=|year=2003|title=The 41 kyr world: Milankovitch’s other unsolved mystery|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=18|issue=1|pages=|bibcode=2003PalOc..18.1011R|doi=10.1029/2002PA000791|quote=All serious students of Earth's climate history have heard of the '100 kyr problem' of Milankovitch orbital theory, namely the lack of an obvious explanation of the dominant ~100 kyr periodicity in climate records of the last 800,000 years.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to variations in the Earth's orbit, the amount of insolation varies with periods of around 21,000, 40,000, 100,000, and 400,000 years. Variations in the amount of incident solar energy drive changes in the [[climate]] of the Earth, and are recognised as a key factor in the timing of initiation and termination of [[glaciation]]s.

While there is a Milankovitch cycle in the range of 100,000 years, related to Earth's [[orbital eccentricity]], its contribution to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of [[precession]] and [[obliquity]]. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of [[ice age]]s at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.
The unexplained transition between the two periodicity regimes is known as the [[Middle Pleistocene|mid-Pleistocene]] transition, dated to some 800,000 years ago.

The related "400,000-year-problem" refers to the absence of a 400,000-year periodicity due to [[orbital eccentricity]] in the geological temperature record over the past 1.2&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John Huggett, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=_DF-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95  "Problems with orbital forcing"], ''The Natural History of Earth: Debating Long-Term Change in the Geosphere and Biosphere'', Routledge Studies in Physical Geography and Environment, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of the 100,000-year cycle==
[[Image:Epica-vostok-grip-140kyr.png|thumb|300px|A &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/suP&gt;O record for the past 140,000&amp;nbsp;years from Greenland ([[NGRIP]]) and Antarctica ([[EPICA]], [[Vostok Station#Ice core drilling|Vostok]]) ice cores]]

The [[geologic temperature record]] can be [[palaeoclimatology|reconstructed]] from sedimentary evidence. Perhaps the most useful indicator of past climate is the [[isotope fractionation|fractionation]] of [[oxygen isotope]]s, denoted [[&amp;delta;18O|''&amp;delta;''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]. This fractionation is controlled mainly by the amount of water locked up in ice and the absolute temperature of the planet, and has allowed a timescale of [[marine isotope stage]]s to be constructed.

By the late 1990s, {{delta|18|O}} records of air (in the [[Vostok Station#Ice core drilling|Vostok]] ice core) and marine [[foramanifera|sediments]] was available and was compared with estimates of [[insolation]], which should affect both temperature and ice volume. As described by [[Nicholas Shackleton|Shackleton]] (2000), the deep-sea sediment record of {{delta|18|O}} "is dominated by a 100,000-year cyclicity that is universally interpreted as the main ice-age rhythm". Shackleton (2000) adjusted the time scale of the Vostok ice core {{delta|18|O}} record to fit the assumed [[orbital forcing]] and used spectral analysis to identify and subtract the component of the record that in this interpretation could be attributed to a linear (directly proportional) response to the orbital forcing. The residual signal (the remainder), when compared with the residual from a similarly retuned marine core isotope record, was used to estimate the proportion of the signal that was attributable to ice volume, with the rest (having attempted to allow for the [[Dole effect]]) being attributed to temperature changes in the deep water.

The 100,000-year component of ice volume variation was found to match sea level records based on coral age determinations, and to lag orbital eccentricity by several thousand years, as would be expected if orbital eccentricity were the pacing mechanism. Strong non-linear "jumps" in the record appear at [[deglaciation]]s, although the 100,000-year periodicity was not the strongest periodicity in this "pure" ice volume record.

The separate deep sea temperature record was found to vary directly in phase with orbital eccentricity, as did Antarctic temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; so eccentricity appears to exert a geologically immediate effect on air temperatures, deep sea temperatures, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Shackleton (2000) concluded: "The effect of orbital eccentricity probably enters the paleoclimatic record through an influence on the concentration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;".&lt;ref name="Shackleton2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shackleton, N.J.|first=|authorlink=Nicholas Shackleton|date=|year=2000|title=The 100,000-Year Ice-Age Cycle Identified and Found to Lag Temperature, Carbon Dioxide, and Orbital Eccentricity|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/289/5486/1897?ck=nck|journal=Science|volume=289|issue=5486|pages=1897–1902|bibcode=2000Sci...289.1897S|doi=10.1126/science.289.5486.1897|pmid=10988063|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkibbi and Rial (2001) identified the 100&amp;nbsp;ka cycle as one of five main challenges met by the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch]] model of [[orbital forcing]] of the ice ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elkibbi Maya, Rial Jose A |year=2001 |title=An outsider's review of the astronomical theory of the climate: is the eccentricity-driven insolation the main driver of the ice ages? |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=56 |pages=161–177 |doi=10.1016/s0012-8252(01)00061-7|bibcode=2001ESRv...56..161E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses to explain the problem==
[[Image:Earth obliquity range.jpg|alt=Diagram shows that obliquity varies from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees.|thumb||The effect of obliquity variations may, in concert with precession, be amplified by orbital inclination.]]

As the 100,000-year periodicity only dominates the climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lorraine-lisiecki.com/stack.html |title=LR04 Benthic Stack |last=Lisiecki |first=Lorraine |authorlink=Lorraine Lisiecki |year=2005 |publisher=lorraine-lisiecki.com |accessdate=Oct 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence there is still no clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.

===Climatic resonance===
The mechanism may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's climate system may have a natural [[resonance|resonance frequency]] of 100&amp;nbsp;ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100&amp;nbsp;ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch.&lt;ref name="Ghil1994"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ghil|first=Michael|date=|year=1994|title=Cryothermodynamics: the chaotic dynamics of paleoclimate|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=193534|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|volume=77|issue=1–3|pages=130–159|bibcode=1994PhyD...77..130G|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(94)90131-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gildor2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gildor|first=Hezi|last2=Tziperman|first2=Eli|date=|year=2000|title=Sea ice as the glacial cycles' climate switch: Role of seasonal and orbital forcing|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=15|issue=6|pages=605–615|bibcode=2000PalOc..15..605G|doi=10.1029/1999PA000461|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this claim point out that the resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2&amp;nbsp;million years. This is feasible—[[continental drift]] and [[sea floor spreading]] rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change.&lt;ref name=Ruddiman2006 /&gt; Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause,&lt;ref name="Saltzman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saltzman|first=Barry|last2=Hansen|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Maasch|first3=Kirk A.|date=|title=The late Quaternary glaciations as the response of a three-component feedback system to Earth-orbital forcing|url=|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|publication-date=December 1984|volume=41|issue=23|pages=3380–3389|bibcode=1984JAtS...41.3380S|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1984)041&lt;3380:TLQGAT&gt;2.0.CO;2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=G.

Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rial|first=José A.|last2=Oh|first2=Jeseung|last3=Reischmann|first3=Elizabeth|date=|title=Synchronization of the climate system to eccentricity forcing and the 100,000-year problem|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n4/full/ngeo1756.html|journal=Nature Geoscience|publication-date=2013-03-10|volume=6|issue=4|pages=289–293|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..289R|doi=10.1038/NGEO1756|accessdate=Oct 16, 2014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100&amp;nbsp;ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.

===Orbital inclination===
[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|alt=Drawing shows the preseasonal change in orbital inclination as the earth turns counter-clock wise.|thumb|Precessional cycles may produce a 100,000 year effect.]]

[[Milankovitch cycles#Orbital inclination|Orbital inclination]] has a 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity, while [[Milankovitch cycles#Orbital shape|eccentricity]]'s 95 and 125ka periods could inter-react to give a 108ka effect. While it is possible that the less significant, and originally overlooked, inclination variability has a deep effect on climate,&lt;ref name="Muller1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller|first=Richard A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=Gordon J.|date=|year=1995|title=Glacial cycles and orbital inclination|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/377107b0|journal=Nature|publication-date=1995-09-14|volume=377|issue=6545|pages=107–108|bibcode=1995Natur.377..107M|doi=10.1038/377107b0|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eccentricity only modifies insolation by a small amount: 1–2% of the shift caused by the 21,000-year precession and 41,000-year obliquity cycles.  Such a big impact from inclination would therefore be disproportionate in comparison to other cycles.&lt;ref name="Ruddiman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ruddiman|first=William F.|date=|title=Orbital changes and climate|url=http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/peef/teaching/orbital_forcing/assets/Ruddiman_2006_QSR.pdf|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|publication-date=December 2006|volume=25|issue=23–24|pages=3092–3112|bibcode=2006QSRv...25.3092R|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2006.09.001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030023122/http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/peef/teaching/orbital_forcing/assets/Ruddiman_2006_QSR.pdf|archive-date=Oct 30, 2008|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible mechanism suggested to account for this was the passage of Earth through regions of cosmic dust. Our eccentric orbit would take us through dusty clouds in space, which would act to occlude some of the incoming radiation, shadowing the Earth.&lt;ref name=Muller1995 /&gt;

In such a scenario, the abundance of the isotope [[helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]], [[cosmogenic|produced]] by [[cosmic ray|solar ray]]s splitting gases in the upper atmosphere, would be expected to decrease—and initial investigations did indeed find such a drop in &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He abundance.&lt;ref name="Farley1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Farley|first=K.A.|date=|title=Cenozoic variations in the flux of interplanetary dust recorded by &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He in a deep-sea sediment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/376153a0|journal=Nature|publication-date=1995-07-13|volume=376|issue=6536|pages=153–156|bibcode=1995Natur.376..153F|doi=10.1038/376153a0|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kortenkamp1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kortenkamp|first=Stephen J.|last2=Dermott|first2=Stanley F.|date=1998-05-08|title=A 100,000-Year Periodicity in the Accretion Rate of Interplanetary Dust|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/280/5365/874|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5365|pages=874–6|bibcode=1998Sci...280..874K|doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.874|pmid=9572725|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others have argued possible effects from the dust entering the atmosphere itself, for example by increasing cloud cover (on July 9 and January 9, when the Earth passes through the invariable plane, [[mesospheric cloud]] increases).&lt;ref name="pmid11607741"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller|first=Richard A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=Gordon J.|date=|title=Spectrum of 100-kyr glacial cycle: orbital inclination, not eccentricity.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=11607741|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|publication-date=1997-08-05|volume=94|issue=16|pages=8329–34|bibcode=1997PNAS...94.8329M|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.16.8329|pmc=33747|pmid=11607741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the 100&amp;nbsp;ka eccentricity cycle can act as a "pacemaker" to the system, amplifying the effect of precession and obliquity cycles at key moments, with its perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hays|first=J.D.|last2=Imbrie|first2=John|last3=Shackleton|first3=N.J.|date=1976-12-10|title=Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4270/1121|journal=Science|volume=194|issue=4270|pages=1121–32|bibcode=1976Sci...194.1121H|doi=10.1126/science.194.4270.1121|pmid=17790893|access-date=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precession cycles===
A similar suggestion holds the 21,636-year [[Milankovitch cycles#Apsidal precession|precession cycles]] solely responsible. Ice ages are characterized by the slow buildup of ice volume, followed by relatively swift melting phases. It is possible that ice built up over several precession cycles, only melting after four or five such cycles.&lt;ref name="Imbrie1980"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Imbrie|first=John|last2=Imbrie|first2=John Z.|date=1980-02-29|title=Modeling the Climatic Response to Orbital Variations|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/207/4434/943|journal=Science|volume=207|issue=4434|pages=943–53|bibcode=1980Sci...207..943I|doi=10.1126/science.207.4434.943|pmid=17830447|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar luminosity fluctuation===
A mechanism that may account for periodic fluctuations in solar luminosity has also been proposed as an explanation.   Diffusion waves occurring within the sun can be modeled in such a way that they explain the observed climatic shifts on earth.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ehrlich|first=Robert|date=|title=Solar resonant diffusion waves as a driver of terrestrial climate change|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erehrlich/Diffusion_waves.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics]]|publication-date=May 2007|volume=69|issue=7|pages=759–766|arxiv=astro-ph/0701117|bibcode=2007JASTP..69..759E|doi=10.1016/j.jastp.2007.01.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; signal again appears to contradict this finding.&lt;ref name="Marsh2007"&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0706.3621|class=physics.gen-ph|first=Gerald E.|last=Marsh|title=Climate Change: The Sun's Role|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land vs. oceanic photosynthesis===
[[Image:Algal bloom 20040615.jpg|alt=The lighter coloring of irregular patches in the Atlantic Ocean off France shows where algae are blooming.|thumb|An [[algal bloom]]. The relative importance of land- and sea-based photosynthesis may fluctuate on a 100,000-year timescale.]]

The [[Dole effect]] describes trends in {{delta|18|O}} arising from trends in the relative importance of land-dwelling and oceanic [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizers]]. Such a variation is a plausible cause of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Bender1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Michael|last2=Sowers|first2=Todd|last3=Labeyrie|first3=Laurent|date=|title=The Dole effect and its variations during the last 130,000 years as measured in the Vostok ice core|url=http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/bender94gbc_222964.pdf|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|publication-date=September 1994|volume=8|issue=3|pages=363–376|bibcode=1994GBioC...8..363B|doi=10.1029/94GB00724|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sowers1993"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sowers|first=Todd|last2=Bender|first2=Michael|last3=Labeyrie|first3=Laurent|last4=Martinson|first4=Doug|last5=Jouzel|first5=Jean|last6=Raynaud|first6=Dominique|last7=Pichon|first7=Jean Jacques|last8=Korotkevich|first8=Yevgeniy Sergeevich|date=|year=1993|title=A 135000-year Vostok-SPECMAP common temporal framework|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=8|issue=6|pages=737–766|bibcode=1993PalOc...8..737S|doi=10.1029/93PA02328|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing research===
The recovery of higher-[[optical resolution|resolution]] [[ice core]]s spanning more of the past 1,000,000 years by the ongoing [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] project may help shed more light on the matter. A new, high-precision dating method developed by the team&lt;ref name="Kawamura2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kawamura|first1=K.|last2=Parrenin|first2=F. D.

The new chronology is inconsistent with the "inclination" theory of the 100,000-year cycle. The establishment of leads and lags against different orbital forcing components with this method—which uses the direct insolation control over nitrogen-oxygen ratios in ice core bubbles—is in principle a great improvement in the temporal resolution of these records and another significant validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis. An international climate modelling exercise (Abe-ouchi ''et al.'', Nature, 2013&lt;ref name="AbeOuchi2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Abe-Ouchi|first=Ayako|displayauthors=et al.|date=|year=2013|title=Insolation-driven 100,000-year glacial cycles and hysteresis of ice-sheet volume|url=|journal=Nature|volume=500|issue=7461|pages=190–193|bibcode=2013Natur.500..190A|doi=10.1038/nature12374|pmid=23925242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) demonstrated that climate models can replicate the 100,000-year cyclicity given the orbital forcing and carbon dioxide levels of the late Pleistocene. The isostatic history of ice sheets was implicated in mediating the 100,000-year response to the orbital forcing. Larger ice sheets are lower in elevation because they depress the continental crust upon which they sit, and are therefore more vulnerable to melting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">'''Agamassan''' is a [[porosity|porous]] [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]] used to safely absorb [[acetylene]] and thus allow the transport, storage and commercial exploitation of the otherwise unstable gas. It was developed and patented by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Nobel Laureate]] and industrialist [[Gustaf Dalén]]. Dalén was prominent in developing applications for acetylene.

Acetylene can readily explode when in liquid or solid form or while being pressurized, if it is pure. Dalén himself was blinded in an acetylene explosion.

In 1896, French chemists [[Georges Claude]] and Albert Hess discovered that large quantities of acetylene could be dissolved in [[acetone]] and rendered nonexplosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Claude|first1=Georges|last2=Hess|first2=Albert|title=Sur un nouveau mode d'emmagasinement de l'acétylène|journal=Comptes Rendus |date=1897|volume=124|pages=626–628|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822009517715;view=1up;seq=632|trans-title=On a new way of storing acetylene|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the liquid was reduced by consumption or cooling, explosive acetylene gas would collect in the space above the liquid's surface. The solution was to compress acetylene in a porous medium.

Before Dalén's work, numerous attempts were made to find a mass sufficiently elastic to withstand shock without crumbling and producing cavities filled with explosive acetylene gas.

Acetylene is shipped and stored in metal cylinders filled with agamassan, which is half-filled with [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF) or acetone. The acetylene is dissolved in the DMF or acetone. Such cylinders are safe to transport and use.

In Swedish, the porous filler is known as "AGA-massan", which would translate as "AGA mass", "AGA body", or "AGA compound". [[AGA AB|AGA]] was the company Dalén founded. The compound originally consisted of, among other things, asbestos, cement, and coal. The 1930 US patent also mentions kieselguhr ([[diatomaceous earth]]).

'''Ataegina''' or '''Ataecina''' (Spanish; {{lang-pt|Atégina}}) was a popular [[goddess]] worshipped by the ancient [[Iberians]], [[Lusitanians]], and [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]]s of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

==Name and functions==
The name ''Ataegina'' is most commonly derived from a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] source: the two roots ''*atte-'' and ''*geno-'' to mean "Reborn" or from ''*ad-ak&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ī-'' (Irish ''adaig'') meaning "night";&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051110085811/http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_7/sopena_6_7.html E-Keltoi Journal of Inter-disciplinary Celtic Studies Vol. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; however her presence in decidedly non-Indo-European [[Iberians|Iberian]] regions suggest that she may have an older, indigenous origin, in which case her name's etymology is more likely of an [[Iberian language|Iberian]] or [[Tartessian language|Tartessian]] etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Cristina Maria Grilo, Ataegina uma divindade Paleohispânica,  Revista Santuários. - Lisboa, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Epigraphs from the [[Badajoz]] region associate the goddess with the Roman [[Proserpina]] or [[Persephone]] which would make her a goddess presiding over Spring and seasonality, echoing the "reborn" derivation of the name.&lt;ref name="Abascal"&gt;Juan Manuel Abascal, ''Las inscripciones latinas de Santa Lucía del Trampal (Alcuéscar, Cáceres) y el culto de Ataecina en Hispania,'' Archivo Español de Arqueología 68: 31-105 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ataegina was worshipped in [[Lusitania]] and [[Betica]]; there were also sanctuaries dedicated to Ataegina in  [[Elvas Municipality|Elvas]] ([[Portugal]]), and [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] and [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]] in [[Spain]], along with other places, especially near the [[Guadiana river]]. She was one of the goddesses worshipped in ''Myrtilis'' (today's [[Mértola]], [[Portugal]]), ''Pax Julia'' ([[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], Portugal) and especially the city of ''Turobriga'', whose precise location is unknown. A bronze plaque from [[Malpartida de Cáceres]] suggests associations with the [[goat]] as a sacred animal.&lt;ref name="Abascal" /&gt;

==Dwarf planet==
{{Main|Controversy over the discovery of Haumea}}
A team claiming to be the discoverers of the [[dwarf planet]] and [[plutoid]] {{dp|Haumea}}, Ortiz ''et al.'', proposed ''Ataecina'' as the name of the body, due to her mythical connections with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] (Proserpina was the wife of Pluto), and her association with southern Spain, near to the discoverers' observatory. This proposal was not however accepted by the [[International Astronomical Union]], not only because there is a dispute over whether Ortiz had actually discovered Haumea, but also [[chthonic]] deities are reserved for the names of bodies orbiting in resonance 2:3 ([[plutino]]) with [[Neptune]], which was not the case for Haumea, which is in resonance 7:12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Controversial dwarf planet finally named 'Haumea'|author=Rachel Courtland|work=NewScientistSpace|year=2008|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14759-controversial-dwarf-planet-finally-named-haumea.html|accessdate=2008-09-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919010052/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn14759-controversial-dwarf-planet-finally-named-haumea.html| archivedate= 19 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/skyblog/newsblog/28646964.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pollution abatement]], the '''best available technology''' (or '''BAT''') is the technology approved for limiting pollutant discharges with regard to an abatement strategy. Similar terms are ''best available techniques'', ''best practicable means'' or ''best practicable environmental option''. BAT is a moving target on practices, since developing societal values and advancing techniques may change what is currently regarded as "reasonably achievable", "best practicable" and "best available".

A literal understanding will connect it with a "spare no expense" [[doctrine]] which prescribes the acquisition of the best state of the art [[technology]] available, without regard for traditional [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uci.edu/lawreview/vol4/no4/Sinden.pdf |title=Cost-Benefit Analysis, Ben Franklin, and the Supreme Court  |last1=Sinden |first1=Amy |date=2014 |website=UC Irvine Law Review |publisher=University of California, Irvine School of Law |access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practical use, the cost aspect is also taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorrell |first=Steve |title=The Meaning of BATNEEC: Interpreting Excessive Costs in UK Industrial Pollution Regulation |publisher=sussex.ac.uk |date=2001-02-19 |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp61/sewp61.html |accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [See also discussions on the topic of the [[precautionary principle]] which, along with considerations of ''best available technologies'' and ''cost-benefit analyses'', is also involved in discussions leading to formulation of environmental policies and regulations (or opposition to same).]

{{quote box|width=23em|"''But no person shall be subject to the foregoing penalties for any act done in the exercise of any right to which he is by law entitled, if he prove to the satisfaction of the court, before whom he is tried, '''that he has used the best practicable means''', within a reasonable cost, to render harmless the liquid or solid matter so permitted to flow or to be put into waters.''"|&lt;ref name="BestPracticableMeans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Clement|title=A Treatise on the Law Relating to the Pollution &amp; Obstruction of Watercourses|publisher=Stevens and Haynes|location=London, UK|year=1877|pages=175–176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L0g0AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2009-02-27|=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Best practicable means'' was used for the first time in UK national primary legislation in section 5 of the Salmon Fishery Act 1861&lt;ref name="BestPracticableMeans" /&gt; and another early use was found in the [[Alkali Act]] Amendment Act 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Bob |title=BPM/BPEO vs BAT - A personal view |publisher=bnes.com |date=n.d. |url=http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202060742/http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-date=2004-02-02 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but before that appeared in the Leeds Act of 1848.

The ''BAT'' concept was first time used in the 1992 [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic for all types of industrial installations (for instance, [[chemical plant|chemical plants]]).

Some doctrine deem it already acquired the status of [[customary law]].

In the [[United States]], BAT or similar terminology is used in the [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] and [[Clean Water Act]].

==European Union directives==

''Best available techniques not entailing excessive costs (BATNEEC)'', sometimes referred to as ''best available technology'', was introduced in 1984 with Directive 84/360/EEC and applied to air pollution emissions from large industrial installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31984L0360&amp;from=EN Council Directive 84/360/EEC] (PDF; 496&amp;nbsp;kB) of 28 June 1984 on the combating of air pollution from industrial plants.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Directive 84/360/EEC was superseded by the [[Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control|Integrated pollution prevention and control directive]] (IPPC), 96/61/EC, which applied the framework concept of ''Best Available Techniques'' (BAT) to the integrated control of pollution to the three media air, water and soil. The concept is also part of the directive's recast in 2008 (2008/1/EC) and its successor directive, the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]] 2010/75/EU published in 2010.

According to article 15(2) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], emission limit values and the equivalent parameters and technical measures in permits shall be based on the best available techniques, without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0075&amp;from=EN Directive 2010/75/EU] (PDF; 2.78&amp;nbsp;MB) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control).&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive includes a definition of best available techniques in article 3(10):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"best available techniques" means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicates the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing the basis for emission limit values and other permit conditions designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a whole:
:    - "techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;
:    - "available" means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator;
:    - "best" means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

BAT for a given industrial sector are described in BAT reference documents (BREFs) as defined in article 3(11) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]]. BREFs are the result of an exchange of information between [[European Union]] Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the [[European Commission]] pursuant to article 13 of the directive. This exchange of information is often called the Sevilla process because it is steered by the [[Institute for Prospective Technological Studies]] of the European Commissions' [[Joint Research Centre]], which is based in Seville. The process is described in detail in Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012D0119&amp;from=EN Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU] (PDF; 1.54&amp;nbsp;MB) of 10 February 2012 laying down rules concerning guidance on the collection of data and on the drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance referred to in Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important chapter of the BREFs, the BAT conclusions, are published as implementing decisions of the [[European Commission]] in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]]. According to article 14(3) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], the BAT conclusions shall be the reference for setting permit conditions of large industrial installations.

==United States environmental law==
===Clean Air Act===
The [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] requires that certain facilities employ [[Best Available Control Technology]] to control [[air pollution|emissions]].
: ...an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this Act emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning, clean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of each such pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Air Act of 1990, section 169(3), {{USC|42|7479(3)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean Water Act===
The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires issuance of national [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] discharge regulations (called "[[effluent guidelines]]"), which are based on BAT and several related standards.
: ...effluent limitations for categories and classes of point sources,... which (i) shall require application of the best available technology economically achievable for such category or class, which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA) section 301(b), {{USC|33|1311(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ...Factors relating to the assessment of best available technology shall take into account the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements), and such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(b), {{USC|33|1314(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of the effluent standards, the BAT concept is a "model" technology rather than a specific regulatory requirement. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) identifies a particular model technology for an industry, and then writes a regulatory performance standard based on the model. The performance standard is typically expressed as a numeric effluent limit measured at the discharge point. The industrial facility may use any technology that meets the performance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related CWA provision for [[water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water]] intake structures requires standards based on "best technology available."
: ...the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 316(b), {{USC|33|1326(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conventions==

The concept of BAT is also used in a number of international conventions such as the [[Minamata Convention]] on Mercury, the [[Stockholm Convention]] on Persistent Organic Pollutants, or the [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic.

In [[ecology]] and [[Earth science]], a '''biogeochemical cycle''' or '''substance turnover''' or '''cycling of substances''' is a pathway by which a [[chemical substance]] moves through biotic ([[biosphere]]) and abiotic ([[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[hydrosphere]]) compartments of [[Earth]]. There are biogeochemical cycles for carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and water; and there are human-induced cycles such as those for mercury and atrazine. In some cycles there are ''reservoirs'' where a substance remains for a long period of time (such as an ocean or lake for water).

== Systems ==
[[Image:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Chloroplasts]] conduct [[photosynthesis]] and are found  in [[plant cell]]s and other [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. These are Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''Plagiomnium affine'' — Many-fruited Thyme-moss.]]
Ecological systems ([[ecosystem]]s) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a part of the system, for example the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, etc.
All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water ([[hydrosphere]]), land ([[lithosphere]]), and/or the air ([[atmosphere]]).&lt;ref name="enviroliteracy.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biogeochemical Cycles|url=http://www.enviroliteracy.org/subcategory.php/198.html|publisher=The Environmental Literacy Council|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the nutrients—such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]]—used in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a ''closed system''; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system.&lt;ref name="enviroliteracy.org"/&gt; 

The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an ''open system''; the sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the [[trophic level]]s of a food web.  Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the major sources of [[food energy]].  These compounds are oxidized to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by plants to make organic compounds.  The [[chemical reaction]] is powered by the light energy of the sun.

It is possible for an ecosystem to obtain energy without sunlight.  Carbon must be combined with hydrogen and oxygen in order to be utilized as an energy source, and this process depends on sunlight.  Ecosystems in the [[deep sea]], where no sunlight can penetrate, use sulfur.  [[Hydrogen sulfide]] near [[hydrothermal vent]]s can be utilized by organisms such as the [[giant tube worm]].  In the [[sulfur cycle]], sulfur can be forever recycled as a source of energy.  Energy can be released through the [[oxidation]] and [[redox|reduction]] of sulfur compounds (e.g., oxidizing elemental sulfur to [[sulfite]] and then to [[sulfate]]).

Although the Earth constantly receives energy from the sun, its chemical composition is essentially fixed, as additional matter is only occasionally added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.

== Reservoirs ==
[[Image:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Coal is a reservoir of [[carbon]].]]

The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a ''reservoir'', which, for example, includes such things as [[coal]] deposits that are storing [[carbon]] for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="carbon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baedke|first1=Steve J.|last2=Fichter|first2=Lynn S.|title=Biogeochemical Cycles: Carbon Cycle|url=http://csmgeo.csm.jmu.edu/geollab/idls/carboncycle.htm|website=Supplimental Lecture Notes for Geol 398|publisher=James Madison University|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in ''exchange pools''. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals.&lt;ref name="carbon" /&gt;  

Plants and animals utilize carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy.  Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it back into the air or surrounding medium.  Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its ''[[residence time]]''.&lt;ref name="carbon" /&gt;

There are many biogeochemical cycles that are currently being studied for the first time as [[climate change]] and human impacts are drastically changing the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles. These newly studied biogeochemical cycles include 
* the [[mercury cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury Cycling in the Environment|url=http://wi.water.usgs.gov/mercury/mercury-cycling.html|website=Wisconsin Water Science Center|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
* the human-caused cycle of [[atrazine]], which may affect certain species.

Biogeochemical cycles always involve hot equilibrium states: a balance in the cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may involve compartments distributed on a global scale.

As biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire globe, the study of these is inherently multidisciplinary.  The carbon cycle may be related to research in [[ecology]] and [[atmospheric sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first=1A. D. |last2=Lukina|first2=N.

'''Biological Hermeneutics''' is the transdisciplinary study of written and printed media using artistic and scientific methods to trace the biological history of the text. For more on transdisciplinary study see [[transdisciplinarity]].

== History ==
Biological Hermeneutics came into being after the development of the [[microscope]] during the 17th century. The most celebrated practitioner [[Robert Hooke]] devoted two of his 'Schema' of his ground breaking book ''Micrographia'' to the study of the [[Microbiomes of the built environment|microbiome]] of the book.

Schema 12  was drawn from studying the red covers of a ‘small book’ which he judged to be made of ‘Sheeps skin’, he found:&lt;blockquote&gt;… a small white spot of hairy mould, multitudes of which I found to bespeck &amp; whiten [the book]. These spots appear’d, through a good Microscope, to be a very pretty shap’d Vegetative body, which, from almost the same part of the Leather, shot out multitudes of small long cylindrical and transparent stalks …&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hooke/robert/micrographia/observ20.html|title=Micrographia, by Robert Hooke : observ20|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schema 33 is dedicated to '''the study of the small silver coloured'' book-worm'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hooke/robert/micrographia/observ52.html|title=Micrographia, by Robert Hooke : Observ. LII. Of the small Silver-colour'd Book-worm.|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the discipline stalled however with the ascendance of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] to the presidency of the Royal Society where he 'did much to obscure Hooke'.

A collection of books maintaining the investigation of the transdiscipline can be found at [[Chetham's Library]] where the practice was developed from Hooke's initial investigations through the collecting policy of successive librarians who 'set out to acquire a major collection of books and manuscripts that would cover the whole range of available knowledge and would rival the college libraries of Oxford and Cambridge'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://library.chethams.com/history/|title=Chetham's Library {{!}} History|work=Chetham's Library|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to collect biological material for later study books were sent out into the community as parish libraries. Gorton library is the last surviving example and has yet to be investigated using Biological Hermeneutic techniques.

In 1831 the foundation of the British Association for the Advancement of Science led to the popularisation of science and enabled a wider group to undertake their own investigations outside of the Royal Society creating a space for the further development of the practice.

[[The Royal Meteorological Society]]. It is the largest enthusiasts' weather observer network within the United Kingdom. The organisation aims to bring together those with an interest in observing the weather, their observations being compiled into monthly bulletins containing news, data and views.

Weather knows no boundaries, and neither does the membership of COL. Stations range from those with a single raingauge to full-size synoptic and official climatological stations. Many of the stations are equipped with a [[Stevenson screen]] and Snowdon [[Raingauge]], while some include [[Campbell–Stokes recorder]] for measuring sunshine and an [[Anemometer]]. Increasingly, members are employing [[Automatic weather station]]s.

Not only keen to observer the weather, members are keen to share their expertise and information and data is frequently used in school/university projects, and by practitioners of the law and forensic science.

[[File:Castle_Union.jpg|thumb|[[Mushroom cloud]] with multiple condensation rings from the [[Castle Union]] 6.9 Mt hydrogen bomb test]]

A transient '''condensation cloud''', also called '''Wilson cloud''', is observable at large [[explosion]]s in [[humidity|humid]] air.

When a [[nuclear weapon]] or a large amount of a conventional [[explosive]] is detonated in sufficiently [[humidity|humid]] air, the "negative phase" of the [[shock wave]] causes a [[rarefaction]] (reduction in density) of the air surrounding the explosion, but not contained within it. This rarefaction results in a temporary cooling of that air, which causes a [[condensation]] of some of the water vapor contained in it. When the pressure and the temperature return to normal, the Wilson cloud dissipates.&lt;ref&gt;Glasstone, Samuel and Philip J. Dolan. ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', U.S. Dept. Of Defense/ Dept. Of Energy; 3rd Edition (1977), p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Since heat does not leave the affected air mass, this change of pressure is [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]], with an associated change of temperature. In humid air, the drop in temperature in the most rarefied portion of the shock wave can bring the air temperature below its [[dew point]], at which moisture condenses to form a visible [[cloud]] of microscopic water droplets. Since the pressure effect of the wave is reduced by its expansion (the same pressure effect is spread over a larger radius), the vapor effect also has a limited radius. Such vapor can also be seen in low pressure regions during [[g-force|high–g]] subsonic maneuvers of aircraft in humid conditions.

Scientists observing the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in 1946 at [[Bikini Atoll]] named that transitory cloud a "Wilson cloud" because of its similarity to the appearance of the inside of a [[Wilson cloud chamber]], an instrument they would have been familiar with. (The cloud chamber effect is caused by a temporary reduction in pressure in a closed system and marks the tracks of electrically-charged [[sub-atomic particle]]s.) Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term ''condensation cloud''.

The shape of the shock wave, influenced by different speed in different altitudes, and the temperature and humidity of different atmospheric layers determines the appearance of the Wilson clouds. During [[nuclear test]]s, '''condensation rings''' around or above the fireball are commonly observed. Rings around the fireball may become stable and form rings around the rising stem of the [[mushroom cloud]].

The lifetime of the Wilson cloud during nuclear [[air burst]]s can be shortened by the [[thermal radiation]] from the fireball, which heats the cloud above the dew point and evaporates the droplets.

The same kind of condensation cloud is sometimes seen above the wings of aircraft in a moist atmosphere. The top of a wing has a reduction of air pressure as part of the process of generating lift. This reduction in air pressure causes a cooling, just as above, and the condensation of water vapor. Hence, the small, transient clouds that appear.

The [[vapor cone]] of a [[transonic]] aircraft is another example of a condensation cloud.

[[Image:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|The [[Amazon river]] delta showing no clouds above river waters because water is not a diathermanous fluid.]]
'''Diathermancy''' (from "dia" ''through'' and "thermē" ''heat'') is the property of some fluids that allows rays of light through them without itself being heated. A diathermanous fluid is thus "[[Permeation|permeable]]" by heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?diathermanous]&lt;/ref&gt;). Diathermancy was first described by German physicist and chemist [[Heinrich Magnus]] in the 1800s (&lt;ref&gt;Magnus wrote initially four papers on Diathermancy [http://www.archive.org/stream/catalogueofscien04roya#page/184/mode/1up])&lt;/ref&gt;). Atmospheric air ''is'' diathermanous; therefore, air is not heated by sunshine, but by long wave heat reflected by soil, and especially, by water on the Earth's surface. Water, on the contrary, ''is not'' diathermanous, and it is heated directly by sunshine.
==Atmospheric heating from oceanic waters==
[[File:Nepac sst oper0-Temp-sup-Oc-Pacífico-16-sep-2013.png|thumb|left|350 px|Northeastern Pacific Ocean Surface Water Temperature]]
Atmospheric heat comes from long wave radiation from the soil and, mostly, from the water surface (oceans, lakes, rivers), since water is a not diathermanous body and covers three quarters of Earth's surface. Diathermancy cause [[Subsidence (atmosphere)|subsidence]] on damp or water surfaces. That is because these areas tend to absorb heat radiation directly from the Sun but very slowly and also emits this radiation to the atmosphere very slowly. Therefore, cold ocean currents have very clear skies, without clouds, because subsidence from cold and heavy air avoids or limits [[convection]] since they are opposite processes.

Dystrophic lakes, also known as humic lakes, are lakes that contain high amounts of [[humic substances]] and organic acids. The presence of these substances causes the water to be brown in colour and have a generally low [[pH]] of around 4.0-6.0.  Due to these acidic conditions, there is little [[biodiversity]] able to survive, consisting mostly of [[algae]], [[phytoplankton]], picoplankton, and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="DRZY"&gt;Drzymulska, D., Fiłoc, M., Kupryjanowicz, M., Szeroczyńska, K., &amp; Zieliński, P. 2015. Postglacial shifts in lake trophic status based on a multiproxy study of a humic lake. Holocene, 25(3), 495-507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JASS"&gt;Jasser, I.  1997. The dynamics and importance of picoplankton in shallow, dystrophic lake in comparison with surface waters of two deep lakes with contrasting trophic status. Hydrobiologia, 342/343(1), 87-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Ample research has been performed on the many dystrophic lakes located in Eastern Poland, but dystrophic lakes can be found in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name="KOST"&gt;Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I. 2017. Microbial Biomass and Enzymatic Activity of the Surface Microlayer and Subsurface Water in Two Dystrophic Lakes.  Polish Journal of Microbiology, 66(1), 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Classification of Dystrophic Lakes==

Lakes can be categorzied according to the increasing productivity as [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]], mesotrophic, [[eutrophic]], and hypereutrophic.  Dystrophic lakes used to be classified as oligotrophic due to their low [[productivity]].  However, more recent research shows dystrophia can be associated with  any of the trophic types.  This is due to a wider possible pH range (acidic 4.0 to more neutral 8.0 on occasion) and other fluctuating properties like nutrient availability and chemical composition.  Therefore, dystrophia can be categorized as a condition affecting trophic state rather than a trophic state in itself &lt;ref name="KOSTR"&gt;Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I, Jasser, I. 2011. Black box: what do we know about humic lakes?  Polish Journal of Ecology, 59(4), 647-664.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Chemical Properties==

Dystrophic lakes have a high level of dissolved organic carbon.  This consists of contains organic [[Carboxylic acid|carboxylic]] and [[Phenolic acid|phenolic acids]], which keep water pH levels relatively stable by acting as a natural [[Buffer solution|buffer]].  Therefore, the lake’s naturally acidic pH is largely unaffected by industrial emissions.  Dissolved organic carbon also reduces the entry of ultraviolet radiation and can reduce the [[bioavailability]] of heavy metals by binding them.&lt;ref name="KORO"&gt;Korosi, J. B. and Smol, J. P. 2012. Contrasts between dystrophic and clearwater lakes in the long-term effects of acidification on cladoceran assemblages. Freshwater Biology, 57(1), 2449–2464.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significantly lowered calcium content in the water and [[sediment]] of a dystrophic lake when compared with a regular lake.&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt; [[Essential fatty acid|Essential fatty acids]], like EPA{{clarify|date=December 2017}} and DHA{{clarify|date=December 2017}}, are still present in the organisms in humic lakes, but are downgraded in nutritional quality by this acidic environment, resulting low nutritional quality of dystrophic lake's [[Autotroph|producers]], such as phytoplankton.&lt;ref name="TAI"&gt;Taipale, S.J, Vuorio, K, Strandberg, U, et al. 2016. Lake eutrophication and brownification downgrade availability and transfer of essential fatty acids for human consumption.  Environment International, 96(1), 156-166.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hydrochemical Dystrophy Index is a scale used to evaluate the dystrophy level of lakes.  In 2016, Gorniak proposed a new set of rules for evaluating this index, using properties such as the surface water pH, [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electric conductivity]], and concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon.&lt;ref name="GORN"&gt;Górniak, A. 2016. A new version of the Hydrochemical Dystrophy Index to evaluate dystrophy in lakes. Ecological Indicators, 78(1), 566-573.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because of different preexisting trophic status, lakes affected by dystrophia may differ strongly in their chemical composition from other dystrophic lakes. &lt;ref name="KOSTR" /&gt; Studies of the chemical composition of dystrophic lakes have shown heightened levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and higher activities of [[lipase]] and [[Glucosidases|glucosidase]] in polyhummic lakes when compared with oligohumic lakes.  In oligohumic lakes, the surface microlayers have higher levels of [[phosphatase]] activity than the subsurface microlayers. The opposite is true when the lake is polyhumic.  Both oligohumic and polyhumic lakes show higher [[aminopeptidase]] activity in the subsurface microlayers than in the surface microlayers.&lt;ref name="KOST" /&gt;

==Life in Dystrophic Lakes==

The [[Drainage basin|catchment area]] of a dystrophic lake is usually a [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forest rich with [[Sphagnum|peat mosses]] that spread along the water surface.&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt; Despite the presence of ample nutrients, dystrophic lakes can be considered nutrient-poor, because their nutrients are trapped in organic matter, and, therefore. are unavailable to primary producers.&lt;ref name="DRAK"&gt;Drakare, S, Blomqvist, P, Bergstro, A, et al. 2003. Relationships between picophytoplankton and environmental variables in lakes along a gradient of water colour and nutrient content.  Freshwater Biology, 48(1), 729-740.&lt;/ref&gt; The organic matter in dystrophic lakes is mainly is allochthonous: it is terrestrially derived: organic matter removed in the catchment area gradually fills this aquatic environment. Due to this organic matter rich [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], it is bacterioplankton that contraols for the rate of nutrient flux between the aquatic and terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name="NEW"&gt;Newton, R.J. et al. 2006. Microbial community dynamics in a humic lake: differential persistence of common freshwater phylotypes. Environmental Microbiology, 8(6), 956-970.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bacteria are found in high numbers and have great growth potentials despite dystrophic conditions. These bacteria drive the food web of humic lakes by providing energy and supplying usable forms of organic and inorganic carbon to other organisms, primiarily to [[Phagocytosis|phagotrophic]] and [[Mixotroph|mixotrophic]] [[Flagellate|flagellates]]. &lt;ref name="SAL"&gt;Salonen, K, and Jokinen, S.  1988.  Flagellate grazing on bacteria in a small dystrophic lake.  Hydrobiologia, 161(1), 203-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Decomposition of organic matter by bacteria converts also organic nitrogen and phosphorus into their inorganic forms which are now available for uptake by  primary producers which includes both large and small phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria).&lt;ref name="JASS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt; The biological activity of humic lakes is, however, dominated by bacterial [[metabolism]], which dominates the [[food web]].  The  chemistry of humic lakes makes it difficult for higher trophic levels such as [[Planktivore|planktivorous]] fish to establish themselves, leaving a simplified food web consisting mostly of plants, plankton, and bacteria.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt; The dominance of the bacteria means that the dystrophic lakes to have a higher [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] rate than [[primary production]] rate.&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt;

==Impacts of Dystrophication on a Lake Ecosystem==

The formation of a humic lake via organic runoff has a dramatic effect on the lake [[ecosystem]].  Chemical composition changes that increase the lake’s acidity make it difficult for fish and other organisms to [[Cell proliferation|proliferate]].  The quality of the lake for use as drinking water also decreases as the carbon concentration and acidity increase. The fish that do adapt to the increased acidity may also not be fit for human consumption, as the [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutant]]s. Concentrations and mobility of heavy metals may also be altered as a result of changes in chemical composition of a humic lake.&lt;ref name="LARS"&gt;Larsen, S., Andersen, T., and Hessen, D. O.  2010.  Global Change Biology, 17(2), 1186-1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dystrophic Lakes and Climate Change==

Lakes are commonly known to be important sinks in the [[carbon cycle]].  Due to their high levels of dissolved organic carbon, dystrophic lakes are significantly larger carbon sinks than clear lakes.&lt;ref name="SOB"&gt;Sobek, S. et al.  2006.  A Carbon Budget of a Small Humic Lake: An Example of the Importance of Lakes for Organic Matter Cycling in Boreal Catchments.  Ambio, 35(8), 469-475.&lt;/ref&gt; The elevated levels of carbon concentrations in humic lakes are affected by vegetation patterns in the catchment area, the runoff from which is the main source of organic material.  However, changes in these levels can also be attributed to shifts in precipitation, modifications of soil [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralization]] rates, reduced [[Sulfate|sulphate]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]], and changes in temperature.  All these factors can be affected by [[climate change]]. Overall, climate change is expected to increase the supply of organic carbon to lakes and therefore change the character of some to the dystrophic one &lt;ref name="LARS"/&gt;.

==Examples of Dystrophic Lakes==

Examples of dystrophic lakes that have been studied by scientists include Lake Suchar II in Poland, and lakes Allgjuttern, Fiolen, and Brunnsjön in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GORN" /&gt;

The '''Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer''' ('''FUSE''') is a space-based [[telescope]] operated by the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Applied Physics Laboratory]]. ''FUSE'' was launched on a [[Delta II]] rocket on 24 June 1999, as a part of [[NASA]]'s [[Origins program]].  ''FUSE'' detected light in the far [[ultraviolet]] portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 90.5-119.5&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s, which is mostly unobservable by other telescopes.  Its primary mission was to characterize universal [[deuterium]] in an effort to learn about the stellar processing times of deuterium left over from the [[Big Bang]].
''FUSE'' resides in a [[low Earth orbit]], approximately 760&amp;nbsp;km (410&amp;nbsp;[[nautical mile|nmi]]) in altitude, with an inclination of 25&amp;nbsp;degrees and just less than a 100-minute orbital period.  Its [[Explorer program|Explorer]] designation is '''Explorer 77'''.

On 12 July 2007, ''FUSE''{{'s}} final [[momentum wheel|reaction wheel]], which is required for accurately pointing a spacecraft, failed and efforts to restart it were unsuccessful.  An announcement was made on 6 September that because the fine control needed to perform its mission had been lost, the ''FUSE'' mission would be terminated.&lt;ref name="sr25334"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=25334 |title=ROSES-07 Amendment 20: Cancel FUSE Legacy Science Program |work=Spaceref.com |author=NASA HQ |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optical design ==
Although the original specification was to have a [[Wolter telescope|Wolter]]-type grazing incidence telescope,&lt;ref name="ia7-1"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1994SPIE.2011...34K |title=Optical design of Lyman/FUSE |journal=Instrumentation in Astronomy VII |first=David A. |last=Content |display-authors=etal |date=July 1990 |pages=943–952 |doi=10.1117/12.19157 |volume=1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final design of the ''FUSE'' telescope comprises four individual mirrors.  Each of the four mirrors is a 39-by-35&amp;nbsp;cm (15.4-by-13.8&amp;nbsp;in) off-axis parabola.  Two mirror segments are coated with [[silicon carbide]] for reflectivity at the shortest ultraviolet wavelengths, and two mirror segments are coated with [[lithium fluoride]] over [[aluminum]] that reflects better at longer wavelengths. This optimizes performance over the entire spectral range.&lt;ref name="nssdc-master"/&gt;

Each mirror has a corresponding [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]]-corrected, [[holography|holographically]]-ruled [[diffraction grating]], each one on a curved substrate so as to produce four 1.65&amp;nbsp;m (5.4&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Henry Augustus Rowland|Rowland]] circle [[spectrograph]]s.  The dispersed ultraviolet light is detected by two [[microchannel plate detector|microchannel plate]] intensified double delay-line detectors, whose surfaces are curved to match the curvature of the focal plane.&lt;ref name="fuse-aas95"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/papers/technical/aas95/aas95.html |title=The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer Mission |work=JHU.edu |first=D.J. |last=Sahnow |display-authors=etal |date=3 July 1995 |accessdate=7 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723225453/http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/papers/technical/aas95/aas95.html |archivedate=23 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science results ==
Over 400 scientific papers have been written using data from ''FUSE'',&lt;ref name="fuse-pub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/~awf/fusepubs/JHU/ |title=FUSE Publications |work=JHU.edu |accessdate=7 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819044145/http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/~awf/fusepubs/JHU/ |archivedate=19 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with subjects ranging from cool stars to the intergalactic medium.  One of the primary science goals of ''FUSE'' was to study the abundance of deuterium, an isotope of [[hydrogen]].  Because of the large number of atomic absorption and emission lines in the far-ultraviolet, ''FUSE'' enabled many studies of galactic, extragalactic and intergalactic chemistry and chemical evolution.

==Impacts==

'''GIOVE''' {{IPA-it|ˈdʒɔve|}}, or '''Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element''', is the name for two [[satellite]]s built for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) to test technology in orbit for the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM10V638FE_index_0.html First Galileo satellites named 'GIOVE'], ESA press release, 9 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Giove is the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for "Jupiter". The name was chosen as a tribute to [[Galileo Galilei]], who discovered the first four [[natural satellite]]s of [[Jupiter]], and later discovered that they could be used as a universal [[clock]] to obtain the [[longitude]] of a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface.

The GIOVE satellites are operated by the [[GIOVE Mission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMWL4N0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE mission core infrastructure], ESA press release, 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMUGJRMTWE_galileo_0.html One year of Galileo signals; new website opens], ESA press release, 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[GIOVE Mission|GIOVE-M]]) segment in the frame of the risk mitigation for the In Orbit Validation (IOV) of the [[Galileo positioning system]].

==Purpose==
These validation satellites were previously known as the ''Galileo System Testbed (GSTB) version 2 (GSTB-V2)''. In 2004 the ''Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1)'' project validated the on-ground algorithms for Orbit Determination and Time Synchronization (OD&amp;amp;TS). This project, led by ESA and [[European Satellite Navigation Industries]], has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEM6KYP3K3E_index_0.html Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 experimentation is now complete], ESA News release, 7 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

GIOVE satellites transmitted multifrequency ranging signals equivalent to the signals of future [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]]: L1BC, L1A, E6BC, E6A, E5a, E5b. The main purpose of the GIOVE mission was to test and validate the reception and performance of novel code modulations designed for [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] including new signals based on the use of the BOC ([[Binary Offset Carrier]]) technique, in particular the high-performance E5AltBOC signal.

==Satellites==
[[Image:Giovea.jpg|thumb|right|250px|GIOVE-A launch]]
===GIOVE-A===
Previously known as ''GSTB-V2/A'', this satellite was constructed by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]] (SSTL).

Its mission has the main goal of claiming the frequencies allocated to [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] by the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]. It has two independently developed Galileo signal generation chains and also tests the design of two on-board [[rubidium]] [[atomic clock]]s and the orbital characteristics of the [[intermediate circular orbit]] for future satellites.

GIOVE-A is the first spacecraft whose design is based upon SSTL's new Geostationary Minisatellite Platform (GMP) satellite bus, intended for [[geostationary orbit]]. GIOVE-A is also SSTL's first satellite outside [[low Earth orbit]], operating in [[medium Earth orbit]]), and is SSTL's first satellite to use deployable Sun-tracking solar arrays. Previous SSTL satellites use body-mounted solar arrays, which generate less power per unit area as they do not face the Sun directly.

====Launched on 28 December 2005====
It was launched at 05:19 UTC on December 28, 2005 on a [[Soyuz-FG]]/[[Fregat]] from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]].

====First Galileo transmissions====
It began communicating as planned at 09:01 UTC while circling the Earth at a height of 23,222&amp;nbsp;km. The satellite successfully transmitted its first navigation signals at 17:25 GMT on 12 January 2006. These signals were received at [[Chilbolton Observatory]] in [[Hampshire]], UK and the ESA Station at [[Libin|Redu]] in [[Belgium]]. Teams from SSTL and ESA have measured the signal generated by GIOVE-A to ensure it meets the frequency-filing allocation and reservation requirements for the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), a process that was required to be complete by June 2006.

====Technical details====
The GIOVE-A signal in space is fully representative of the [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] signal from the point of view of frequencies and modulations, chip rates, and data rates. However, GIOVE-A can only transmit at two frequency bands at a time (i.e., L1+E5 or L1+E6).

GIOVE-A codes are different from [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] codes. The GIOVE-A navigation message is not representative from the structure and contents viewpoint (demonstration only purpose). The generation of [[pseudorange]] measurements and detailed analysis of the tracking noise and [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] performance of GIOVE-A ranging signals have been performed with the use of the GETR (Galileo Experimental Test Receiver) designed by [[Septentrio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.septentrio.com/sites/default/files/papers/SimskySleewaegenMertensWillemsHollreiserF3iongnss2007.pdf A.Simsky et al. Multipath and Tracking Performance of Galileo Ranging Signals Transmitted by GIOVE-A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810151909/http://www.septentrio.com/sites/default/files/papers/SimskySleewaegenMertensWillemsHollreiserF3iongnss2007.pdf |date=2012-08-10 }}, Proceedings of ION GNSS 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some public controversy about the open source nature of some of the Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringbritain.com/space/archives/40-Unlocking-the-truth-behind-GIOVE-A-signals.html Unlocking the truth behind GIOVE-A signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029133845/http://www.engineeringbritain.com/space/archives/40-Unlocking-the-truth-behind-GIOVE-A-signals.html |date=2006-10-29 }}, SSTL press release, 18 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early part of 2006, researchers at Cornell monitored the GIOVE-A signal and extracted the PRN codes. The methods used and the codes which were found were published in the June 2006 issue of ''GPS World''. ESA has now made the codes public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM4EDN0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE-A navigation signal available to users], ESA press release, 2 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Retirement====
GIOVE A was retired (but not decommissioned) in June 2012, after being raised in altitude to make way for an operational satellite. It remains under command by SSTL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Galileo_pathfinder_GIOVE_A_retires_999.html Galileo pathfinder GIOVE-A retires], 9 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===GIOVE-B===
{{wikinews|Soyuz rocket launches GIOVE-B satellite}}
GIOVE-B (previously called ''GSTB-V2/B''), has a similar mission, but has greatly improved signal generation hardware.

It was originally built by satellite consortium [[European Satellite Navigation Industries]], but following re-organization of the project in 2007, the satellite prime contractor responsibility was passed to [[Astrium]].

GIOVE-B also has MEO environment characterization objectives, as well as signal-in-space and receiver experimentation objectives. GIOVE-B carries three [[atomic clock]]s: two [[rubidium standard]]s and the first space-qualified passive [[hydrogen maser]].

====Launched on 27 April 2008====

The launch was delayed due to various technical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.space.com/spacenews/satellitecomm/GioveB_090106.html Giove B Launch Slips to Early 2007], Peter de Selding, Space News, 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and took place on 27 April 2008 at 04:16 Baikonur time (22:16 UTC Saturday) aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]]/[[Fregat]] rocket provided by [[Starsem]]. The Fregat stage was ignited three times to place the satellite into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/releases/presrel08_04_27.html |title=Starsem successfully launches second Europe navigation satellite |publisher=Arianespace |date=2008-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602023204/http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/releases/presrel08_04_27.html |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giove-B reached its projected orbit after 02:00 UTC and successfully deployed its solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jydCERiyJhe5puK-JKlQ-n6BqEtw  afp.google.com, Second test satellite for Galileo launched, reaches orbit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502021713/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jydCERiyJhe5puK-JKlQ-n6BqEtw |date=2008-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Galileo navigation transmissions ====
GIOVE-B started transmitting navigation signals on May 7, 2008. The reception of the signals by GETR receivers and other means has been confirmed at a few ESA facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/GIOVE-B_launch/SEMGVUZXUFF_0.html ESA - GIOVE-B launch - GIOVE-B transmitting its first signals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technical details====
According to ESA, this is "a truly historic step for satellite navigation since GIOVE-B is now, for the first time, transmitting the GPS-Galileo common signal using a specific optimised waveform, [[MBOC]] (multiplexed binary offset carrier), in accordance with the agreement drawn up in July 2007 by the EU and the US for their respective systems, Galileo and the future GPS III".

“''Now with GIOVE-B broadcasting its highly accurate signal in space we have a true representation of what Galileo will offer to provide the most advanced satellite positioning services, while ensuring compatibility and interoperability with GPS''”, said ESA Galileo Project Manager, Javier Benedicto.

After launch, early orbit operations and platform commissioning, GIOVE-B's navigation payload was switched on and signal transmission commenced on May 7 and the quality of these signals is now being checked. Several facilities are involved in this process, including the GIOVE-B Control Centre at Telespazio's facilities in Fucino, Italy, the Galileo Processing Centre at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), in the Netherlands, the ESA ground station at Redu, Belgium, and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) Chilbolton Observatory in the United Kingdom.
 
Chilbolton's 25-metre antenna makes it possible to analyse the characteristics of GIOVE-B signals with great accuracy and verify that they conform to the Galileo system's design specification. Each time the satellite is visible from Redu and Chilbolton, the large antennas are activated and track the satellite. GIOVE-B is orbiting at an altitude of 23 173 kilometres, making a complete journey around the Earth in 14 hours and 3 minutes.
 
The quality of the signals transmitted by GIOVE-B will have an important influence on the accuracy of the positioning information that will be provided by the user receivers on the ground. On board, GIOVE-B carries a passive hydrogen maser atomic clock, which is expected to deliver unprecedented stability performance.
 
The signal quality can be affected by the environment of the satellite in its orbit and by the propagation path of the signals travelling from space to ground. Additionally, the satellite signals must not create interference with services operating in adjacent frequency bands, and this is also being checked.
 
Galileo teams within ESA and industry have the means to observe and record the spectrum of the signals transmitted by GIOVE-B in real time. Several measurements are performed relating to transmitted signal power, centre frequency and bandwidth, as well as the format of the navigation signals generated on board. This allows the analysis of the satellite transmissions in the three frequency bands reserved for it.
 
The GIOVE-B mission also represents an opportunity for validating in-orbit critical satellite technologies, characterising the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) radiation environment, and to test a key element of the future Galileo system - the user receivers.

===GIOVE-A2===
With the delays of GIOVE-B, the European Space Agency again contracted with [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd|SSTL]] for a second satellite, to ensure that the Galileo programme continues without any interruptions that could lead to loss of frequency allocations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM8LNN0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE-A2 to secure the Galileo programme], European Space Agency press release, 5 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of GIOVE-A2 was terminated due to the successful launch and in-orbit operation of GIOVE-B.

==Mission segment==
'''The GIOVE Mission''' segment, or '''GIOVE-M''', is the name of a project dedicated to the exploitation and experimentation of the GIOVE satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMWL4N0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE mission core infrastructure], ESA press release, 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The GIOVE Mission was intended to ensure risk mitigation of the In Orbit Validation (IOV) phase of the [[Galileo positioning system]].

==GIOVE Mission history==
The GIOVE Mission Segment began in October 2005 with the purpose of providing experimental results based on real data to be used for risk mitigation throughout the overall [[Galileo In Orbit Validation]] (IOV) phase of the [[Galileo positioning system]]. 

The GIOVE Mission segment infrastructure was based on evolution of the Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1) infrastructure conceived to process data from the GIOVE-A and GIOVE-B satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giove.esa.int/page_index.php?menu=101&amp;page_id=34 GIOVE System Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324074824/http://www.giove.esa.int/page_index.php?menu=101&amp;page_id=34 |date=2007-03-24 }}, GIOVE website.&lt;/ref&gt; The GIOVE Mission segment was composed of a central processing facility called the Giove Processing Center (GPC) and a network of thirteen experimental Giove Sensor Stations (GESS).

The main objectives of the GIOVE Mission Segment experimentation were in the areas of:
* On-board clock characterisation
* Navigation message generation
* Orbit modelling

[[Image:Front Entrance to ISAS.jpeg|200px|thumb|Entrance to the ISAS [[Sagamihara Campus]]]]
{{nihongo|'''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'''|宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}} (ISAS) is a [[Japan]]ese national research organization of [[astrophysics]] using [[rocket]]s, [[astronomy|astronomical]] satellites and [[interplanetary probe]]s which played a major role in [[Japan's space development]].  Since 2003, it is a division of [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAXA History|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/about/history/index_e.html|publisher=JAXA Official Website (English)|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISAS originated as part of the [[Institute of Industrial Science]] of the [[University of Tokyo]], where [[Hideo Itokawa]] experimented with miniature [[solid-fuel rocket]]s ([[Pencil Rocket]] and [[Baby Rocket]]) in the 1950s.  This experimentation eventually led to the development of the [[Kappa_(rocket)|Κ (''Kappa'')]] [[sounding rocket]], which was used for observations during the [[International Geophysical Year]].  By 1960, the Κ-8 rocket had reached an altitude of 200 km.

In 1964, the rocket group and the ''Institute of Aeronautics'', along with [[high altitude balloon|scientific ballooning]] team&lt;!--from Kobe Univ?--&gt;, were merged to form {{nihongo|''Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science''|宇宙航空研究所|Uchū kōkū kenkyūjo}} within the University of Tokyo.  The rocket evolved into the [[Lambda (rocket)|L (''Lambda'')]] series, and, in 1970, L-4S-5 was launched as Japan's first artificial satellite [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]].

Although ''Lambda'' rockets were only sounding rockets, the next generation of [[Mu (rocket family)|M (''Mu'') rocket]]s was intended to be satellite launch vehicles from the start.  Beginning in 1971, ISAS launched a series of [[scientific satellites]] to observe the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]].  Since the launch of [[Hakucho]] in 1979, ISAS has had [[X-ray astronomy]] satellites consecutively in orbit, until it was briefly terminated by the launch failure of [[ASTRO-E]].

In 1981, as a part of university system reform, and for the mission expansion, ISAS was spun out from University of Tokyo as an inter-university national research organization, ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science''.

In 2003, three national aerospace organizations including ISAS were merged to form [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).  The English name ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'' is still used, although the Japanese name was changed to 宇宙科学研究本部, (literally, ''Space Science Research Division'', whereas the previous name's literal translation was ''Space Science Laboratory'').  In 2010, the name was changed back to the previous {{nihongo||宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5438">The '''Jacob Barnet affair''' occurred in 1612 when a [[Jew]]ish teacher by the name of Jacob Barnet was arrested and imprisoned by officials of the [[University of Oxford]] for changing his mind about being [[baptism|baptised]].&lt;ref name=Sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

==Background==
Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and until the 1850s the [[University of Oxford]] required all students and the faculty staff to be [[Christian]]s and members of the established church (the [[Church of England]]).&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; In addition, [[Edward I]]'s ban on Jews living in England remained in force until [[Cromwell]] overturned it. Nevertheless, a few visiting Jewish Hebrew teachers taught students at the university privately, or worked in the [[Bodleian Library]] on Hebrew manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

In 1609, the French [[Huguenot]] scholar [[Isaac Casaubon]] invited Jacob Barnet, an Italian Jew, to his home in [[Drury Lane]], London.&lt;ref name=Sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; During their time together, they discussed Jewish texts on various topics, and Barnet proved to Casaubon that Jesus had been buried in accordance with standard Jewish burial practice rather than (as argued by [[Caesar Baronius|Cardinal Baronio]]) in a new way that became the method of Catholic burial.&lt;ref name=Sketch/&gt; Casaubon thereafter employed Barnet as his secretary, and in 1610 the two of them came to Oxford.&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

==Oxford==
Barnet's personal qualities, as well as his erudition, meant that he was liked and respected by scholars at the university. While at Oxford, he decided to be baptised as a Christian, and told Casaubon of his decision; Casaubon told the [[Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]], who (like other members of the university) was pleased with Barnet's decision.  Preparations were made for Barnet to be baptised at a grand service in the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]].&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

Barnet, however, did not attend the ceremony, having decided against converting; he left Oxford on foot.&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; According to the 17th-century Oxford antiquarian [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], [[Arthur Lake (bishop)|Arthur Lake]], the [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of [[New College, Oxford]], sent pursuers after Barnet on foot and on horseback; Lake was one of the "learned Doctors" of the university whom Wood said had been "deceived" by Barnet's "tricks".&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;  Barnet was apprehended and taken back to Oxford, where he refused to be baptised. He was then detained in the unpleasant conditions of the [[Bocardo Prison]].&lt;ref name=Sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt; In the meantime, [[William Twyss]], who was to preach at the service, changed his sermon to address Barnet's change of heart, demonstrating (according to Wood) "God's just judgment upon that perverse nation and people, whom he had given up to a reprobate sense even to this very day."&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Casaubon was appalled by the treatment of Barnet and considered it a "violation of Christian ethics".&lt;ref name=Sketch/&gt; He later said that he did not think that changing one's mind on such a matter of religion was a criminal matter.&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; He appealed on Barnet's behalf to [[James I of England|King James I]], who issued a warrant for his release. Some months after his arrest, he was put on a ship to France and exiled.&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;  Later, Barnet was an adviser at the French court on Jewish matters.&lt;ref name=Sketch/&gt;

hold the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]. All are described as flowering or ornamental cherries, though they have mixed parentage, and some have several or unknown parents. They are valued for their [[cherry blossom|spring blossom]], and in some cases ornamental fruit and bark.&lt;ref name=RHSAZ&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|page=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list does not include the edible, or culinary, fruit trees in the genus ''Prunus'' (cherries, peaches, almonds, plums etc.). Dimensions shown are the maximum, which can often be restricted by regular pruning. Many cultivars also lend themselves to [[bonsai]] treatment.
A note on species names; where only ''Prunus'' is indicated, the species or hybrid name is unknown or conjectural.

This is a '''list of species in the plant genus ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]''''', often known as [[violet (plant)|violet]]s or [[pansy|pansies]].

''Viola'' is the largest genus in the family Violaceae, containing between 525 and 600 species.&lt;ref name=ning&gt;Ning, Z. L., et al. (2012). [http://www.annbot.net/PDF/anb49-free/anb49-383i.pdf ''Viola jinggangshanensis'' (Violaceae), a new species from Jiangxi, China.] ''Annales Botanici Fennici'' 49(5) 383-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zhou&gt;Zhou, J.

'''Montroydite''' is the mineral form of [[mercury(II) oxide]] with formula HgO. It is a rare mercury mineral. It was first described for an occurrence in the mercury deposit at [[Terlingua, Texas|Terlingua]], [[Texas]] and named for Montroyd Sharp who was an owner of the deposit.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

Montroydite occurs in mercury deposits of hydrothermal origin. Associated minerals include: [[native mercury]], [[cinnabar]], [[metacinnabar]], [[calomel]], [[eglestonite]], [[terlinguaite]], [[mosesite]], [[kleinite]], [[edgarbaileyite]], [[gypsum]], [[calcite]] and [[dolomite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

'''Naval regions and districts''' were the [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine|official shore establishment]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Kriegsmarine]] during [[World War II]]. The Kriegsmarine shore establishment was divided into four senior regional commands, who were in turn subordinated to the operational [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Navy Group Commands|Navy Group commanders]] who commanded all sea and shore naval forces within a particular geographical region.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann W. &amp; Hildebrand H., Die Deutsche Kriegsmarine, Verlag Hans-Henning Podzun, Bad Nauheim (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Within each naval region were several subordinate naval districts who were responsible for all navy shore activities within their area of responsibility, most significantly were the various [[List of German naval ports during World War II|German ports]] of [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]].

==Naval regions==
The naval regions (''Marineoberkommando'') were the senior most shore command in a given geographical area and were subordinate to the Navy Group commanders. A total of four naval regions were eventually established in occupied Europe during the Second World War. A deputy commander, known as the "2. Admiral" commanded staff units and oversaw regional administrative matters. Specifically, the deputy region commander oversaw the ''Schiffs–Stamm-Abteilung'' (Ship's Administration Department) which was a liaison for port commands and also served as the ultimate authority for personnel in transit or stationed in shore naval garrisons. For those permanent assigned to the ship's department, a subordinate ''Schiffs–Stamm-Regiment'' existed as an intermediary command.&lt;ref&gt;Goerlitz, Walter. History of the German General Staff, 1657-1945. Boulder and London: Westview Press (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major subordinates to the regional command were the ''Befehlshaber der Sicherung'' (Commander of Security), ''Inspektion des Schiffsmaschinewesens'' (Naval engineering inspector), ''Artilleriearsenalinspektionen'' (Inspector of [[arsenal]]s and [[artillery]]), and the ''Sanitätsamt der Marinestation'' (Medical department). A regional signals detachment (''Marine–Nachrichten–Abteilung'') also existed to coordinate orders and messages between the various subordinate commands.

All naval regions were permanently assigned at least one navy shore combat unit. In most cases this was known as the ''Marine–Schützen–Bataillon''; a larger formation known as a ''Marine–Bordflak–Brigade'' also existed. Engineering and [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]] naval units were typically grouped into a ''Marine–Festungspionier–Bataillon''. Regional commands were also responsible for the operation of all naval [[military prison|prisons]]. Naval [[prisoner-of-war]] camps were under the jurisdiction of a senior officer known as the ''Kommandantur des Marine–Kriegsgefangenen– und Interniertenlagers''.

All naval regions further maintained a legal office as well as a war correspondence company (''Marinekriegsberichterkompanie''). All induction and recruiting centers operated through an office known as the ''Marine–Abrechnungs– und Vorprüfungsamt'' while the ''Dienststelle für Eignungsprüfung'' administrated certification examinations for the various [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine#Kriegsmarine rates|naval rates]]. Each naval region also maintained a billeting and housing office, known as the ''Abwicklungsamt''.

===Naval Region North Sea===

The North Sea naval region was the first to be established and was originally known as ''Der Kommandierende Admiral der Marinestation der Nordsee''. The command was formed from a preexisting unit of the Reichsmarine, known as the [[Marinestation der Nordsee]]. In the spring of 1943, the title was renamed as the ''Marineoberkommando der Nordsee''. Major subordinate districts were the ''Deutsches Marinekommando Italien'' (this command eventually became Naval Region South) and the ''Admiral in den Niederlanden'' which oversaw all German naval matters in the occupied [[Netherlands]].

The following officers held the title of regional commander during the years of Naval region North Sea's existence.

* [[Admiral (Germany)|Admiral]] [[Otto Schultze]]: Jul 1935 - Oct 1937
* Admiral [[Hermann Boehm (admiral)|Hermann Boehm]]: Oct 1937 - Oct 1938 
* Admiral [[Alfred Saalwächter]]: Oct 1938 - Aug 1939
* Admiral [[Otto Schultze]]: Aug - Nov 1939 
* Vice admiral [[Hermann Densch]]: Nov 1939 - Mar 1943
* Admiral [[Erich Förste]]: Mar 1943 - May 1945

Major port cities under the control of Naval Region North Sea were [[Wilhelmshaven]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Bremen]]. The regional command was also the authority for all [[United States Naval Observatory|naval observatories]] in the area. A central administrative office, known as the ''Heimatverwaltung West'' coordinated all shore activities while the ''Heimatverwaltung Ausland'' oversaw region personnel deployed to other areas of the Kriegsmarine. The ''Troßschiffverband Nord'' was the department responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all [[troopship|troop ship]]s on call for deployment into the [[North Sea]].

===Naval Region Baltic Sea===

Germany had maintained a naval presence in the [[Baltic Sea]] since the 19th century, and in 1865 the earliest continuous command in the area, the [[Marinestation der Ostsee]], was established in Kiel. By June 1935, the Reichsmarine had established a position known as ''Der Chef der Marinestation der Ostsee''. In November 1938, the Kriegsmarine created the post of ''Der Kommandierende General der Marinestation der Ostsee'', also headquartered at [[Kiel]]. The region was commanded by a full admiral (or [[general admiral]]) with a deputy known as the ''2. Admiral der Ostseestation''.

Subordinated to the Baltic Sea regional commander were three "coastal commanders" (''Küstenbefehlshaber'') who oversaw various harbor and coastal defense units. The port superintendent of Kiel (''Marineintendantur Kiel'') also reported directly to the regional command as well as several inspection units for naval weapons, artillery, torpedoes, and well as an Inspector for Training and Education (''Inspektion des Bildungswesens der Marine''). The naval region also contained a signals unit, medical department, and personnel branch. The commander of U-boats was originally administratively subordinated to the Baltic regional commander, but became an independent separate command after 1938.

In mid 1942, the name of the command was shortened to ''Kommando der Marinestation der Ostsee'' and in 1943 adopted its final name as ''Marineoberkommando Ostsee''. The two primary subordinate naval districts were the ''Admiral Dänemark'' (controlling all shore based German naval forces in [[Denmark]]) and the ''Admiral Ostland'' which controlled naval shore forces east of Kiel, including those stationed in [[Poland]].

The following Kriegsmarine officers held the position as Baltic Sea regional commander:

* Admiral [[Conrad Albrecht]]: Jul 1935 - Nov 1938
* Admiral [[Rolf Carls]]: Nov 1938 - Jan 1940
* Admiral [[Günther Guse]]: Jan 1940 - Mar 1943
* Admiral [[Hubert Schmundt]]: Mar 1943 - Mar 1944
* General admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]]: Mar 1944 - May 1945

===Naval Region South===

Shore activities in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] were originally overseen by an office, known as the ''Chef des Deutschen Marineverbindungsstabes'', headed by Rear Admiral [[Eberhard Weichold]] and established in June 1940. The following year, the office adopted the lengthy title ''Deutscher Admiral beim Admiralstab der königlich italienischen Marine''. In November 1941, the office was re-designated as the ''Befehlshaber des Deutschen Marinekommandos Italien''. In March 1943, the command was assumed by Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm Meendsen-Bohlken]]. Meedsen-Bohlken was briefly replaced by Vice Admiral [[Friedrich Ruge]], in May 1943, before Meedsen-Bohlken returned to the same post that August. In July 1944, command was assumed by Vice Admiral [[Werner Löwisch]]. In January 1945 the Italian naval shore command was renamed as the ''Oberbefehlshaber Marineoberkommando Süd''.

===Naval Region Norway===

The final Navy regional command established during the Second World War was the ''Marineoberkommando in Norwegen'', established in late 1943 to deal specifically with German naval forces in [[Norway]]. Admiral [[Otto Ciliax]] served as regional commander until the last month of the war when he was replaced by Admiral [[Theodor Krancke]].

The headquarters of the Norwegian naval region was at [[Oslo]] where was maintained a headquarters staff, signals company, and war correspondence unit. A naval weapons office, known as the ''Torpedoarsenal Norwegen'' oversaw all logistics for naval arms, in particular submarine [[torpedoes]], for Kriegsmarine units stationed in Norway. The region also operationally controlled a [[anti-submarine net|submarine netting]] group known as ''Netzsperrgruppe Nord''. In addition to regular naval shore commands,the Norwegian Naval Region also hosted four naval construction brigades (''Bauaufsicht der Kriegsmarine'') which were stationed in [[Horten]], [[Bergen]], [[Trondheim]], and [[Tromsø]]

==Naval districts==

Naval districts were the direct operational forces for all shore units of the Kriegsmarine and were assigned coastal areas of responsibility as well as operational command of any permanently assigned submarine or ship flotillas (although administratively, these units were under the various [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Navy Type Commands|type commanders]]). Most naval regions also maintained a staff headquarters unit, signals unit, war correspondence company, as well as a regional medical clinic.

Navy districts were operationally subordinated to Navy group commanders and were organized by either geographical region or country of occupation. The "Admiral Deutsche Bucht" was headquartered in [[Wilhelmshaven]] and commanded German ports along the North Sea. The "Admiral z.b.V. Südost" was in command of inland waterways, river units, and was headquartered at [[Traunstein]].

===France and the Low Countries===

After the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupation of France]] and the [[Low Countries]], the Kriegsmarine established a single regional command for these areas which was known as "Admiral West". The command was first stood up in May 1940, while the [[Battle of France]] was still ongoing, with its first commander Admiral [[Karlgeorg Schuster]]. In June 1940, following the surrender of France, the command's name changed to ''Kommandierender Admiral Frankreich'' and was headquartered in Paris. In May 1941, command as "Admiral Frankreich" was passed to [[Otto Schultze]]. In August 1942, the final commander, [[Wilhelm Marschall]] was appointed and would hold the command until that November. At that time the naval region of France was broken up into smaller areas as a result of [[Case Anton]] when Germany occupied the entirety of France.

The three late war naval districts of France were:

* Admiral Atlantikküste (Western [[France]])
* Admiral Kanalküste ([[English Channel]]) 
* Admiral französischen Südküste (Southern France)	

[[Friedrich Rieve]] commanded the English channel district during the [[Invasion of Normandy]] while [[Ernst Scheurlen]] commanded southern France during [[Operation Dragoon]]. In both these cases, the commands were disbanded shortly thereafter due to an overrun of the districts by Allied forces. The "Atlantic Coast" command, overseeing the majority of naval forces in western France, remained active until early 1945 under its final commander, Admiral [[Johannes Bachmann]].

A special naval area was also established for the city of Paris and was known as the ''Höheres Kommando der Marinedienststellen in Groß-Paris'' (Supreme Command for Naval Services in the Greater Paris Area). The command contained a headquarters staff, several transport units, a signals and communications division, legal office, and medical staff. [[Werner Lindenau]] served as naval commander of Paris from June 1943 until the Germans evacuated the city the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Rosbottom, R. When Paris Went Dark: The City of Light Under German Occupation, 1940-1944, Back bay Books (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

German port facilities in [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied Belgium]] were never formed into an independent command and were subordinated to other regions and naval districts. Naval shore authority in the [[Netherlands]] was originally a subordinate officer to Admiral West and was known as the ''Marinebefehlshaber in den Niederlanden''. The original commander was [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière]] who briefly held the post for a one month in May 1940 before command was assumed by [[Helmuth Kienast]]. In June 1943, the post was past to ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Kurt Caesar Hoffmann]] who was in turn relieved by [[Gustav Kleikamp]] in March 1943. the following month, the Netherlands district became an independent command known as the ''Kommandierender Admiral in den Niederlanden''. The final command of the district was Vice Admiral [[Rudolf Stange]], who held command in January 1945 until the Germans evacuated the country in the face of advancing Allied forces.

===Denmark and Norway===

When German [[Denmark in World War II|occupied Denmark]] in April 1940, the Kriegsmarine established a naval command for the entire country known as the ''Marinebefehlshaber Dänemark''. The command was first held by Admiral [[Raul Mewis]] and maintained two subordinate naval districts known as the ''Abschnitt Nordjütland'' and the ''Abschnitt Südjütland und dänische Inseln''. In March 1943 the name of the command was changed to the ''Kommandierender Admiral Dänemark'', frequently shortened to simply "Admiral Dänemark". The command was then assumed by Vice Admiral [[Hans-Heinrich Wurmbach]], who held the post until the end of World War II. In April 1944, after Germany had placed all of [[Denmark]] under military occupation the previous fall, the command name was again changed to ''Kommandierender Admiral Skagerak''.&lt;ref&gt;Lampe, D., Hitler's Savage Canary: A History of the Danish Resistance in World War II, PWxyz, LLC (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German occupation of Norway]], with its direct access to the North Sea, required the Kriegsmarine to form a major naval command to deal with the vastness of the Norwegian coastline, along with its many ports and harbors. The originally Norwegian naval command was known as the ''Kommandierender Admiral Norwegen'' and the post was held by [[Hermann Boehm (admiral)|Hermann Böhm]] between 1940 and 1943. By the end of 1940, the Norwegian naval area had been elevated to the status of a naval region (the region name would formally change in February 1943), with the following subordinate Norwegian naval regions established.

* Admiral norwegische Nordküste (Northern Norway)
* Admiral norwegische Westküste (Central Norway)
* Admiral norwegische Südküste (Southern Norway)
* Admiral norwegische Polarküste ([[Arctic Circle|Polar Norway]])

The Norwegian naval region and areas would continue in full operation until the end of World War II and consisted of the largest number of Kriegsmarine forces which remained intact upon Germany's surrender in May 1945.&lt;ref&gt; Vigness, Paul G., The German Occupation of Norway, Vantage Press (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic Sea Naval District===

The Baltic Sea naval area was first formed in November 1941, headquartered at [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], and responsible for German port and harbors east of the main naval region out of Kiel. The geographical area of the command was relatively small and the posted commander never held a higher rank than ''Kapitän zur See''. After Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]], and occupied the [[Baltic states]], the command's responsibility increased and eventually held authority over several naval shore facilities, including medical units, arsenals, and communication commands in [[Liepāja|Libau]], [[Tallinn|Reval]], and [[Riga]].

Two of the more unique units assigned to the Baltic area were a ''Pathologische Abteilung'', consisting of naval medical personnel conducting [[pathology]] research, as well as an island station at [[Bolshoy Tyuters|Tütters]]. The area command also oversaw several coastal monitoring stations (''Küstenüberwachungsstellen'') which were incorporated into the Kriegsmarine system of [[sea defense zone]]s.

In 1944, as the Baltic countries came under danger of liberation by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces, the Baltic Sea area was divided into two geographical regions (east and west) with Vice Admiral [[Werner Lange]] assuming command in the west (as ''Admiral Westliche Ostsee'') while [[Theodor Burchardi]] assumed command as ''Admiral östliche Ostsee'' in the east. Following liberation by Soviet forces, the naval commands in Riga were accused of war crimes for utilizing Slavic and Jewish slave labor for hard labor on German controlled [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kuenzl, A. &amp; Shimron G., The Execution of the Hangman of Riga. Vallentine Mitchell (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===North and Black Seas===

The Kriegsmarine maintained four smaller naval commands to deal with various shore facilities not covered under another major naval area. The largest was the "Admiral Nordmeer", formed in October 1941 as a direct subordinate to the Naval regional commander for the North Sea. [[Hubert Schmundt]] served as the North Sea area commander until 1942 when he was replaced by [[August Thiele]]. [[Otto Klüber]] then held the post until command was assumed by a deputy in 1944.

An independent naval region was the "Admiral Schwarzes Meer", responsible for shore operations in the [[Black Sea]]. The command had originally been established as a navy expeditionary group before being renamed as the ''Deutsche Marinemission Rumänien'' in 1942. The name of the command was changed the following year to "Admiral Schwarzes Meer" before adopting its final name as the ''Kommandierender Admiral Schwarzes Meer'' in 1944. Several officers held this posting until Germany finally withdrew from the area in the face of [[Red Army]] advance.

'''Black Sea area commanders'''

* ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Fleischer]]: Feb 1941 – Apr 1942
* ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Hans-Heinrich Wurmbach]]: May 1942 – Aug 1942
* ''Konteradmiral'' [[Hellmuth Heye]] (acting commander): Sep 1942 – Oct 1942
* ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Robert Witthoeft-Emden]]: Nov 1942 – Jan 1943
* ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Gustav Kieseritzky]]: Feb 1943 – Oct 1943
* ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Helmuth Brinkmann]]: Nov 1943 – Oct 1944

The Black Sea area command held the same authority as a naval region and possessed a headquarters staff at [[Constanța|Konstanza]] with an attached signals unit and naval pioneer battalion. The area command also held operational control over the deployment of two assigned [[submarine chaser]] flotillas as well as a flotilla of auxiliary minesweepers and patrol-sentry boats. The [[30th U-boat Flotilla]] was also deployed to the area, however operational control was held by the ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]''. Later in the war, the Black sea area gained a [[anti-submarine net|submarine netting]] unit known as ''Netzsperrgruppe Schwarzes Meer''.

In addition to standard ports and harbors, the Black Sea area maintained a number of commands for smaller inlet naval stations, known as ''Seetransportstelle''. Around the Black Sea area were also interspersed naval directorate stations (''Marine-Intendanturdienststelle'') which coordinated all activities across the geographical region.

===Aegean and Adriatic Seas===

Following the German [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|conquest of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Axis occupation of Greece|invasion of Greece]], the Kriegsmarine set up two naval commands for regional operations in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Adriatic Sea]]s. The Aegean naval command was first established in February 1941, under Rear Admiral [[Hans-Hubertus von Stosch]]. Command was then assumed in the fall of that year by [[Erich Förste]], who held it until February 1943, when command was past to [[Werner Lange]].

The Aegean naval command consisted of a headquarters staff as well as an attached signals unit and pioneer battalion. A naval garrison (''Wachkompanie'') was stationed at [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] while the shipyards in [[Athens]] also fell under the regional command. The region further maintained a transportation company, two war correspondence companies, and was the administrative senior authority for the third [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Destroyers|destroyer flotilla]] and the [[23rd U-boat Flotilla]]. Later in the war, the region added a legal office, [[quartermaster]] command, as well as a [[anti-submarine net|submarine netting]] squadron (''Netzsperrgruppe Süd''). The region was also the reporting senior for two German [[hospital ship]]s. 

The Adriatic naval region ("Admiral Adria") was established in September 1943 under ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Joachim Lietzmann]]. The command originally consisted of a headquarters staff in [[Trieste]] accompanied by a communications unit and pioneer command. By 1944, smaller offices of the region, dealing with logistics, operations, torpedo armament, and naval artillery placements, had been established in [[Pula]], [[Dubrovnik]] (Ragusa), [[Split, Croatia|Spalato]], and [[Durrës]]. In July 1944, command was assumed by Vice Admiral [[Werner Löwisch]].

==Naval areas==

In larger Naval regions, an intermediary command between the regions and local forces was the "Navy Area" (''Marine–Abschnitt'') of which the Kriegsmarine established seventeen such areas during the Second World War. In occupied territories, as well as some major German ports, these areas were known as ''Kriegsmarinedienststellen'' (Navy War Service Areas) with fourteen established between 1941 and 1945. Navy areas were typically commanded by a senior naval officer, most often a ''Kapitän zur See'' or ''Korvettenkapitän'', who was known as ''Der Kommandant im Abschnitt''.

===Navy Area Headquarters===

* [[Copenhagen|Kopenhagen]]
* [[Le Havre]]
* [[Marseille]]
* [[Oslo]]
* [[Ostend|Ostende]]
* [[Szczecin|Stettin]]

==Sea defense zones==

{{main|Sea defense zone}}

Sea defense zones were tactical naval areas, along the coastline of occupied Europe, intended to provide an operational command chain in the event of an actual enemy attack. The zones were commanded by an officer normally ranked as either ''Kapitän zur See'' or ''Konteradmiral''. The sea defense zone commander (''Kommandant der Seeverteidigung'') answered to the Navy regional commanders and would take tactical control over all shore forces in a given area should an enemy launch an actual attack against a segment of German coastline.

In practice, the sea defense zones became well tested when the Allies invaded western Europe, in particular at the [[battle of Normandy]]. Sea Defense zone forces also fought fiercely to avoid losing Germany's submarine bases in France, in [[Allied siege of La Rochelle|one case]] holding out for several months under Allied siege before surrendering.

Both [[palaeoclimate]] changes and recent [[global warming]] changes have exhibited strong polar amplification, as described below.

==History==
An observation based study related to Arctic amplification was published in 1969 by [[Mikhail Budyko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/tellusa.v21i5.10109 |volume=21 |issue=5 |doi=10.3402/tellusa.v21i5.10109|title=The effect of solar radiation variations on the climate of the Earth |year=1969 |first=M.I. |last=Budyko |journal=Tellus|pages=611–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study conclusion has been summarized as, "Sea ice loss affects Arctic temperatures through the surface albedo feedback."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00382-015-2489-1.pdf |title=Atmospheric impacts of sea ice decline in CO2 induced global warming |doi=10.1007/s00382-015-2489-1 |year=2015 |first=Ivana |last=Cvijanovic |first2=Ken |last2=Caldeira |journal=Climate Dynamics |pages=1173–86 |volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalescientific.org/2016/06/ice-in-action-sea-ice-at-the-north-pole-has-something-to-say-about-climate-change|title=Ice in Action: Sea ice at the North Pole has something to say about climate change|year=2016|work=YaleScientific}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year a similar model was published by [[William D.

== Amplification ==
=== Amplifying mechanisms ===
[[Ice–albedo feedback|Feedbacks associated with sea ice and snow cover]] are widely cited as the main cause of recent terrestrial polar amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hansen J., Sato M., Ruedy R. | year = 1997 | title = Radiative forcing and climate response | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres | volume = 102 | issue = D6| pages = 6831–64 | doi=10.1029/96jd03436 | bibcode=1997JGR...102.6831H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCC 2013" /&gt; However, amplification is also observed in model worlds with no ice or snow.&lt;ref name="Alexeev"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alexeev V.

=== Ocean circulation ===
It has been estimated that 70% of global wind energy is transferred to the ocean and takes place within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Eventually, [[upwelling]] due to wind-stress transports cold Antarctic waters through the Atlantic [[surface current]], while warming them over the equator, and into the Arctic environment. Thus, warming in the Arctic depends on the efficiency of the global ocean transport and plays a role in the polar see-saw effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=February 3, 2010|url=http://www.leif.org/EOS/2010GL042793.pdf|authors=Petr Chylek, Chris K.

=== Amplification factor ===
Polar amplification is quantified in terms of a '''polar amplification factor''', generally defined as the ratio of some change in a polar temperature to a corresponding change in a broader average temperature:

::::&lt;math&gt;{ PAF }={\Delta{T}_{p}\over\Delta\overline{T}}&lt;/math&gt;{{space}}{{space}},

&lt;br/&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\Delta{T}_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is a change in polar temperature and &lt;math&gt;\Delta\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt;{{space}}{{space}} is, for example, a corresponding change in a global mean temperature.

== Paleoclimate polar amplification ==
The glacial / [[interglacial]] cycles of the [[Pleistocene]] provide extensive [[palaeoclimate]] evidence of polar amplification, both from the Arctic and the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt; In particular, the temperature rise since the [[last glacial maximum]] {{formatnum:20000}} years ago provides a clear picture.

[[Jennifer Francis]] told Scientific American in 2017, "A lot more water vapor is being transported northward by big swings in the [[jet stream]]. That’s important because water vapor is a greenhouse gas just like carbon dioxide and methane. It traps heat in the atmosphere. That vapor also condenses as droplets we know as clouds, which themselves trap more heat. The vapor is a big part of the amplification story—a big reason the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-arctic-is-getting-crazy/ |title=The Arctic Is Getting Crazy |year=2017 |work=Scientific American |first=Mark |last=Fischetti }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollen''' is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains which are male [[Gametophyte|microgametophytes]] of [[spermatophyta|seed plants]], which produce male [[gamete]]s (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of [[sporopollenin]] that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the [[stamen]]s to the [[gynoecium|pistil]] of flowering plants, or from the male [[Conifer cone|cone]] to the female cone of [[Pinophyta|coniferous plants]]. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it [[germinate]]s, producing a [[pollen tube]] that transfers the [[sperm]] to the [[ovule]] containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called [[palynology]] and is highly useful in [[paleoecology]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and [[Forensic science|forensics]].

Pollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the [[Stamen|anther]] of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pollination |volume=22 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In flowering plants the vegetative tube cell produces the [[pollen tube]], and the generative cell divides to form the two sperm cells.

=== Formation ===
Pollen is produced in the [[microsporangia]] in the male cone of a conifer or other [[gymnosperm]] or in the anthers of an [[Flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[flower]]. Pollen grains come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see [[electron micrograph]], right). Pollen grains of [[pine]]s, [[fir]]s, and [[spruce]]s are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the [[forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis'' spp.),{{which|date=February 2017}} is around 6&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] (0.006&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter.{{citation  needed|date=February 2017}} Wind-borne pollen grains can be as large as about 90–100&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = 59743 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211287498 | year = 2001 | title = Corn pollen deposition on milkweeds in and near cornfields | volume = 98 | issue = 21 | pages = 11919–24 | pmid = 11559840 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | last1 = Pleasants| first1 = J.

In angiosperms, during flower development the anther is composed of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther. The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into the wall of the pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells.

In a process called '''microsporogenesis''', four haploid [[microspore]]s are produced from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or [[meiocyte]]), after [[meiotic division]]. After the formation of the four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to [[cytokinesis]], whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the [[monocots]] is successive, but there are important exceptions.&lt;ref name=Furness2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furness|first1=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|authorlink2=Paula Rudall|title=Pollen and anther characters in monocot systematics|journal=Grana|date=January 2001|volume=40|issue=1–2|pages=17–25|doi=10.1080/00173130152591840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During microgametogenesis, the unicellular microspores undergo mitosis and develop into mature [[microgametophyte]]s containing the gametes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/development Pollen Development — University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In some flowering plants,{{which|date=February 2017}} [[germination]] of the pollen grain may begin even before it leaves the microsporangium, with the generative cell forming the two sperm cells.

=== Structure ===
Except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a double wall. The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered [[cellulose]] called the '''endospore''' or '''intine''', and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of [[sporopollenin]] called the '''exospore''' or '''exine'''. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as '''spinulose''' (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as '''echinate'''. Various terms also describe the sculpturing such as '''reticulate''', a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus, muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina).

The pollen wall protects the sperm while the pollen grain is moving from the anther to the stigma; it protects the vital genetic material from drying out and solar radiation. The pollen grain surface is covered with waxes and proteins, which are held in place by structures called sculpture elements on the surface of the grain. The outer pollen wall, which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods. The outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin.

Pollen apertures are regions of the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or a significant reduction in exine thickness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furness|first=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|date=2004-03-01|title=Pollen aperture evolution--a crucial factor for eudicot success?|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=9|issue=3|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2004.01.001|pmid=15003239|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5084}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content. Elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]]). Apertures that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/ppapertr.html|author=Davis, Owen |title=Aperture|work=geo.arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollen may be referred to as '''inaperturate''' (apertures absent) or '''aperturate''' (apertures present).

The transfer of pollen grains to the female reproductive structure ('''''[[Carpel|pistil]]''''' in angiosperms) is called '''[[pollination]]'''. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, in which case the plant is described as '''[[Anemophily|anemophilous]]''' (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g., pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. '''[[Entomophily|Entomophilous]]''' (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and [[protein]]-rich, for dispersal by [[insect]] [[pollinator]]s attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some [[mite]]s are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called [[palynivore]]s.

In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in the pollen chamber, located beneath the [[Ovule|micropyle]], underneath the integuments of the ovule. A [[pollen tube]] is produced, which grows into the [[nucellus]] to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of [[Pinophyta]] and [[Gnetophyta]] are without [[flagella]], and are carried by the pollen tube, while those of [[Cycad]]ophyta and [[Ginkgophyta]] have many flagella.

When placed on the [[Carpel|stigma]] of a flowering plant, under favorable circumstances, a pollen grain puts forth a [[pollen tube]], which grows down the tissue of the style to the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]], and makes its way along the [[placenta]], guided by projections or hairs, to the micropyle of an [[ovule]]. The nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus, which divides (if it hasn't already) to form two sperm cells. The sperm cells are carried to their destination in the tip of the [[pollen tube]]. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise during [[pollen tube]] growth appear to be efficiently [[DNA repair|repaired]] in the generative cell that carries the male [[genome|genomic information]] to be passed on to the next plant generation.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirano T, Takagi K, Hoshino Y, Abe T |title=DNA damage response in male gametes of Cyrtanthus mackenii during pollen tube growth |journal=AoB Plants |volume=5 |issue= |pages=plt004 |year=2013 |pmid=23550213 |pmc=3583183 |doi=10.1093/aobpla/plt004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vegetative cell that is responsible for tube elongation appears to lack this [[DNA repair]] capability.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213" /&gt;

==Pollen in the fossil record==
{{Main article|Palynology}}
Pollen's sporopollenin outer sheath affords it some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Also, pollen analysis has been widely used for reconstructing past changes in vegetation and their associated drivers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franco-Gaviria |first=Felipe et al. |title=The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |year=2018 |publisher=[[Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana 70, 1]] |pages=61–78 |url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Allergy to pollen==

}}
[[Allergic rhinitis|Nasal allergy]] to pollen is called [[pollinosis]], and allergy specifically to grass pollen is called [[hay fever]]. Generally, pollens that cause allergies are those of anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random and the likelihood of one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.

Pollen allergies are common in polar and temperate climate zones, where production of pollen is seasonal. In the tropics pollen production varies less by the season, and allergic reactions less.
In northern Europe, common pollens for allergies are those of [[birch]] and [[alder]], and in late summer [[Artemisia vulgaris|wormwood]] and different forms of [[hay]]. Grass pollen is also associated with [[Asthma|asthma exacerbations]] in some people, a phenomenon termed [[Thunderstorm asthma|thunderstorm asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erbas|first=B.|last2=Jazayeri|first2=M.|last3=Lambert|first3=K.

In the US, people often mistakenly blame the conspicuous [[goldenrod]] flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen does not become independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by [[ragweed]], a widespread anemophilous plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oder|first1=Tom|title=Dear allergy sufferers: Don't blame goldenrod|url=http://www.mnn.com/health/allergies/stories/dear-allergy-sufferers-dont-blame-goldenrod|website=mnn.com|publisher=Mother Nature Network|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona]] was once regarded as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several ragweed species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing [[irrigation|irrigated lawns and gardens]], more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever.

Anemophilous spring blooming plants such as [[oak]], [[birch]], [[hickory]], [[pecan]], and early summer [[grass]]es may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.

The number of people in the United States affected by hay fever is between 20 and 40 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skoner|first1=DP|title=Allergic rhinitis: definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, detection, and diagnosis.|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=July 2001|volume=108|issue=1 Suppl|pages=S2–8|pmid=11449200|doi=10.1067/mai.2001.115569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent [[allergic response]] in the nation. There are certain evidential suggestions pointing out hay fever and similar allergies to be of [[Hereditary disease|hereditary origin]]. Individuals who suffer from [[eczema]] or are [[asthma]]tic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term hay fever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/allergies/living-with-allergies-10/rhinitis Allergies and Hay Fever] WebMD. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], decades of rising temperatures cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater numbers, as well as introduction of new species such as ragweed.&lt;ref&gt;Siewertsen, Bjarne. "[http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/haard-nyser-for-allergikere-i-varm-fremtid/ Hård nyser for allergikere i varm fremtid]"  (English: Hard sneeze for allergic people in warm future) ''[[Danish Meteorological Institute]]'', 18 April 2015. Retrieved: 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most efficient way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a [[General practitioner|general physician]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergiesandtreatments.com/pollen-allergy/ Bee, grass pollen allergy symptoms]. allergiesandtreatments.com. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
{{main article|Allergic rhinitis#treatment}}
[[Antihistamines]] are effective at treating mild cases of pollinosis, this type of non-prescribed drugs includes [[loratadine]], [[cetirizine]] and [[chlorpheniramine]]. They do not prevent the discharge of [[histamine]], but it has been proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this [[biogenic amine]], which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.

[[Decongestants]] can be administered in different ways such as tablets and [[nasal spray]]s.

[[Allergen immunotherapy|Allergy immunotherapy]] (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to pollen, thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Overtvelt L. et al. Immune mechanisms of allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy. Revue française d'allergologie et d'immunologie clinique. 2006; 46: 713–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies.

==Nutrition==
Most major classes of [[predatory]] and [[parasitic]] [[arthropod]]s contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that [[bee]]s are the primary pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many other [[Hymenoptera]] other than bees consume pollen as adults, though only a small number feed on pollen as [[larva]]e (including some [[ant]] larvae). [[Spider]]s are normally considered [[carnivore]]s but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for [[spider]]lings, which catch pollen on their [[spider web|webs]]. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some [[Acari|predatory mites]] also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as ''[[Euseius tularensis]]'', which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as [[Mordellidae]] and [[Melyridae]] feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as [[Curculionidae]], [[Chrysomelidae]], [[Cerambycidae]], and [[Scarabaeidae]] are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40000 species of [[Carabidae|ground beetle]]s, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species). Similarly, [[Ladybird]] beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. [[Hemiptera]] are mostly [[herbivore]]s or [[omnivore]]s but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the [[Anthocoridae]]). Many adult flies, especially [[Syrphidae]], feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all [[Fly|flies]], cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| chapter = The Pollen Feeders| title = Relationships of Natural Enemies and Non-Prey Foods| volume = 7| pages = 87–11| year = 2009| isbn = 978-1-4020-9234-3| doi = 10.1007/978-1-4020-9235-0_6| last1 = Lundgren| first1 = Jonathan G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of fungus, including ''[[Fomes fomentarius]]'', are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fungal Strategies of Wood Decay in Trees|author= Schwarze, Francis W.

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not found any harmful effects of bee pollen consumption, except from the usual allergies. However, FDA does not allow bee pollen marketers in the United States to make health claims about their produce, as no scientific basis for these has ever been proven. Furthermore, there are possible dangers not only from allergic reactions but also from contaminants such as pesticides and from fungi and bacteria growth related to poor storage procedures. A manufacturers's claim that pollen collecting helps the bee colonies is also controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158| archiveurl = http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00004421/00001| title = Producing Pollen | author = Sanford, Malcolm T. | publisher = University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences | accessdate=2007-08-30}}.

== Spiritual purposes ==
In some [[Native American religion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, pollen is used in [[prayer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and rituals to symbolize life and renewal by [[sanctifying]] objects, dancing grounds, trails, and [[sandpainting]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. It may also be sprinkled over heads or in mouths. Many [[Navajo]] people believe the body becomes [[holy]] when it travels over a trail sprinkled with pollen. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Native American Religions|last=Hirshfelder|first=Arlene|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=0816039496|location=|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-classical history''' (also called the '''Post-Antiquity era''', '''Post-Ancient Era''', or '''Pre-Modern Era''') is a [[periodization]] commonly used by the school of "[[world history]]" instead of [[Middle Ages]] (Medieval), which is roughly synonymous.&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt; The period runs from about AD 500 to 1450 though there may be regional differences and debates. The era was globally characterized by the expansion of civilizations geographically, the development of three of the great world religions (Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism), and development of networks of trade between civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf The Post‐Classical Era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031011114/http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf |date=2014-10-31 }} by Joel Hermansen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt;

In Asia, the [[spread of Islam]] created a [[Caliphate|new empire]] and [[Islamic Golden Age]] with trade between the [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n and [[Europe]]an continents, and advances in [[science in the medieval Islamic world]]. [[East Asia]] experienced the full establishment of power of [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]], which established several prosperous dynasties influencing Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. Religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] spread. [[Gunpowder]] was originally developed in China during the post-classical era. The [[Mongol Empire]] connected Europe and Asia creating safe trade and stability between the two regions. In total the [[World population estimates|population of the world]] doubled in the time period from approximately 210 million in AD 500 to 461 million in 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein Goldewijk|first=Kees|last2=Beusen|first2=Arthur|last3=Janssen|first3=Peter|date=2010-03-22|title=Long-term dynamic modeling of global population and built-up area in a spatially explicit way: HYDE 3.1|journal=The Holocene|volume=20|issue=4|pages=565–573|doi=10.1177/0959683609356587|issn=0959-6836|bibcode=2010Holoc..20..565K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population generally grew steadily throughout the period but endured some incidental declines in events including the [[Plague of Justinian]], [[Mongol invasions and conquests|The Mongol Invasions]] and the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name="Haub1650"&gt;Haub (1995): "The average annual rate of growth was actually lower from 1 A.D. to 1650 than the rate suggested above for the 8000 B.C. to 1 A.D. period. One reason for this abnormally slow growth was the Black Plague. This dreaded scourge was not limited to 14th century Europe. The epidemic may have begun about 542 A.D. in Western Asia, spreading from there. It is believed that half the Byzantine Empire was destroyed in the 6th century, a total of 100 million deaths."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
===Terminology and periodization===
[[File:Leonardo Bruni 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leonardo Bruni]] was a Renaissance historian who helped develop the concept of the Middle Ages.]]
'Post-classical history' is a [[periodization]] used by historians employing a "[[world history]]" approach to history, specifically the school developed during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns&gt;{{cite book |editor=R. Charles Weller |title=21st-Century Narratives of World History: Global and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |publisher=Palgrave |chapter=Periodization in World History: Challenges and Opportunities |last=Stearns |first=Peter N. |authorlink=Peter N. Stearns |year=2017 |page= |isbn=978-3319620770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of world history, the term is also sometimes used to avoid erroneous pre-conceptions around the terms "Middle Ages", "Medieval" and "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" (see [[medievalism]]).

The post-classical period corresponds roughly to the period from 500 to 1450 CE.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Beginning and ending dates might vary depending on the region, with the period beginning at the end of the previous classical period: [[End of the Han Dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651).

The post-classical period is one of the five or six major periods world historians use: (1) early civilization; (2) [[Ancient history|classical societies]]; (3) post-classical; (4) [[early modern]]; (5) [[long nineteenth century]]; and (6) [[Modern history|contemporary or modern era]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; (Sometimes the nineteenth century and modern are combined.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt;) Although ''post-classical'' is synonymous with the [[Middle Ages]] of Western Europe, the term ''post-classical'' is not necessarily a member of the traditional [[Late Middle Ages#Historiography and periodization|tripartite periodisation]] of Western European history into 'classical', 'middle' and 'modern'.

===Approaches===
The historical field of [[world history]], which looks at common themes occurring across multiple cultures and regions, has enjoyed extensive development since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1–14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, World History research has tended to focus on [[early modern globalization]] (beginning around 1500) and subsequent developments, and views post-classical history as mainly pertaining to [[Afro-Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Historians recognize the difficulties of creating a periodization and identifying common themes that include not only this region but also, for example, the Americas, since they had little contact with Afro-Eurasia before the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Thus recent research has emphasised that 'a global history of the period between 500 and 1500 is still wanting' and that 'historians have only just begun to embark on a global history of the Middle Ages'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many regions of the world, there are well established histories. Although [[Medieval Studies]] in Europe tended in the nineteenth century to focus on creating histories for individual nation-states, much twentieth-century research focused, successfully, on creating an integrated history of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinty Nelson, 'Why Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamicate world likewise has a rich regional historiography, ranging from the fourteenth-century [[Ibn Khaldun]] to the twentieth-century [[Marshall Hodgson]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Adam J. Silverstein, ''Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 94-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, research into the network of commercial hubs which enabled goods and ideas to move between China in the East and the Atlantic islands in the West—which can be called the [[Archaic globalization|early history of globalisation]]—is fairly advanced; one key historian in this field is [[Janet Abu-Lughod]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [81-83].&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding of communication within sub-saharan Africa or the Americas is, by contrast, far more limited.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [80-81].&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent history-writing, therefore, has begun to explore how it might be possible meaningfully to write history that spans the Old World, where human activities were fairly interconnected, and establishes its relationship with other worlds, such as the Americas and Oceania. In the assessment of [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]], [[John Darwin (historian)|John Darwin]], [[Margret Frenz]], and [[Chris Wickham]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;Global history may be boundless, but global historians are not. Global history cannot usefully mean the history of everything, everywhere, all the time. [...] Three approaches [...] seem to us to have real promise. One is global history as the pursuit of significant historical problems across time, space, and specialism. This can sometimes be characterized as [[comparative history|‘comparative’ history]]. [...] Another is connectedness, including transnational relationships. [...] The third approach is the study of globalization [...]. Globalization is a term that needs to be rescued from the present, and salvaged for the past. To define it as always encompassing the whole planet is to mistake the current outcome for a very ancient process.&lt;ref&gt;James Belich, John Darwin, and Chris Wickham, 'Introduction: The Prospect of Global History', in ''The Prospect of Global History'', ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 3–22 [3] {{DOI|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732259.001.0001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A number of commentators have pointed to the history of the earth's [[climate]] as a useful approach to World History in the Middle Ages, noting that certain climate events had effects on all human populations.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Atwell, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078878 Volcanism and Short-Term Climatic Change in East Asian and World History, c. 1200-1699]', ''Journal of World History'', 12.1 (Spring 2001), 29-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet, ''Cotton, Climate, and Camels in Early Islamic Iran: A Moment in World History'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|978-0231519878}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Ellenblum, ''The Collapse of the Eastern Mediterranean: Climate Change and the Decline of the East, 950-1072'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L. Brooke, ''Climate Change and the Course of Global History: A Rough Journey'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), {{ISBN|978-1139050814}}, {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9781139050814}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main trends==

The Post-classical era saw several common developments or themes. There was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas; the rise and/or spread of the three major world, or missionary, religions; and a period of rapidly expanding trade and trade networks.

=== Growth of civilization ===
{{Main|Civilization}}[[File:Líneas de Nazca, Nazca, Perú, 2015-07-29, DD 54.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Nazca culture]] which produced the [[Nazca Lines]] were one of South America's Andean Civilizations thriving from the 1st to the 8th century. Photograph by Diego Delso. ]]
First was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas across [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Mesoamerica]], and western [[South America]]. However, as noted by world historian [[Peter N. Stearns]], there were no common global political trends during the post-classical period, rather it was a period of loosely organized states and other developments, but no common political patterns emerged.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; In Asia, China continued its historic [[dynastic cycle]] and became more complex, improving its bureaucracy. The creation of the Islamic Empires established a new power in the Middle East, North Africa, and [[Central Asia]]. Africa created the [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] and [[Mali Empire|Mali]] kingdoms in the West. The fall of Roman civilization not only left a power vacuum for the Mediterranean and Europe, but forced certain areas to build what some historians might call new civilizations entirely.{{sfn|Birken|1992|pages=451–461}} An entirely different political system was applied in Western Europe (i.e. [[feudalism]]), as well as a different society (i.e. [[manorialism]]). But the once East Roman Empire, Byzantium, retained many features of old Rome, as well as Greek and Persian similarities. Kiev Rus' and subsequently Russia began development in Eastern Europe as well. In the isolated Americas, Mesoamerica saw the building of the [[Aztec]] Empire, while the Andean region of South America saw the establishment of the [[Inca Empire]].

=== Spread of universal religions ===
{{Main|History of religion}}
[[File:Siege of Acre.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Acre (1189–91)|Siege of Acre (1191)]], religious wars were common in Post-classical times. One of the largest of such wars were the [[Crusades]]. Picture dated from 1280.|200x200px]]
Religion that envisaged the possibility that all humans could be included in a universal order had emerged already in the first millennium BC, particularly with Buddhism. In the following millennium, Buddhism was joined by two other major, universalising, missionary religions, both developing from [[Judaism]]: Christianity and Islam. By the end of the period, these three religions were between them widespread, and often politically dominant, across the Old World.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, ''[[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]'', trans. by Yuval Noah Harari, John Purcell and Haim Watzman (London: Harvill Secker, 2014), {{ISBN|978-1846558238|978-1846558245}}, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buddhism]] spread from India into China and flourished there briefly before using it as a hub to spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam;{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} a similar effect occurred with Confucian revivalism in the later centuries.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"/&gt;
* [[Christianity]] had become the [[State church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, and continued spreading into northern and eastern Europe during the post-classical period at the expense of belief systems that Christians labelled [[Paganism|pagan]].{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} An attempt was even made to incur upon the Middle East during the [[Crusades]]. The split of the [[Catholic Church]] in Western Europe and the [[Orthodox Church]] in Eastern Europe encouraged religious and cultural diversity in Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=Fletcher |title=The Conversion of Europe: From Paganism to Christianity, 371-1386 AD |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Islam]] began between 610 and 632, with a series of revelations to [[Muhammad]]. It helped unify the warring [[Bedouin]] clans of the Arabian peninsula and, through a rapid series of [[Muslim conquests]], became established to the west across [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|North Africa]], the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberian Peninsula]], and parts of [[Islam in Africa|West Africa]], and to the east across [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Persia]], [[Islamicisation of Xinjiang|Central Asia]], [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|India]], and [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam J. |last=Silverstein |title=Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0199545728 |pages=9–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade and communication ===
{{Main|Trade route}}

Finally, communication and trade across [[Afro-Eurasia]] increased rapidly. The [[Silk Road]] continued to spread cultures and ideas through trade and throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Trade networks were established between West Europe, Byzantium, early Russia, the Islamic Empires, and the [[Far East]]ern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|title=Environment and Trade: The Viking Age|publisher=Khan Academy|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005514/https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|archive-date=2018-06-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa the earlier introduction of the Camel allowed for a new and eventually large [[Trans-Saharan trade]] which connected Sub-Saharan West Africa to Eurasia. The Islamic Empires adopted many Greek, Roman, and Indian advances and spread them through the Islamic sphere of influence, allowing these developments to reach Europe, North and West Africa, and Central Asia. Islamic sea trade helped connect these areas, including those in the [[Indian Ocean]] and in the [[Mediterranean]], replacing Byzantium in the latter region. The Christian Crusades into the Middle East (as well as Muslim Spain and [[Sicily]]) brought Islamic science, technology, and goods to Western Europe.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} Western trade into East Asia was pioneered by [[Marco Polo]]. Importantly, China began the sinicization (or Chinese influence) of regions like Japan,{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} Korea, and Vietnam through trade and conquest. Finally, the growth of the [[Mongol Empire]] in Central Asia established safe trade such as to allow goods, cultures, ideas, and disease to spread between Asia, Europe, and Africa.

The Americas had their own trade network, however theirs was limited by the lack of draft animals and the wheel. In [[Oceania]] some of the island chains of [[Polynesia]] and [[Micronesia]] also engaged in trade with one another.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Historical climatology|Little Ice Age}}During Post-Classical times, there is evidence that many regions of the world were affected similarly by global climate conditions however, direct effects in temperature and precipitation varied by region. According to [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] changes did not all occur sanctimoniously at once. Generally however studies found that temperatures were relatively warmer, in the eleventh century, but colder by the early seventeenth century. It is uncertain the degree of climate change which occurred in all regions across the world, and whether such changes were all part of a global trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb09climatology/files/2012/03/Pages_2013_NatureGeo.pdf |title=Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |issue=5 |page=339 |date=2013-04-21 |doi=10.1038/NGEO1797|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..339P |last1=Ahmed |first1=Moinuddin |last2=Anchukaitis |first2=Kevin J. |last3=Asrat |first3=Asfawossen |last4=Borgaonkar |first4=Hemant P. |last5=Braida |first5=Martina |last6=Buckley |first6=Brendan M. |last7=Büntgen |first7=Ulf |last8=Chase |first8=Brian M. |last9=Christie |first9=Duncan A. |last10=Cook |first10=Edward R. |last11=Curran |first11=Mark A.J. |last12=Diaz |first12=Henry F. |last13=Esper |first13=Jan |last14=Fan |first14=Ze-Xin |last15=Gaire |first15=Narayan P. |last16=Ge |first16=Quansheng |last17=Gergis |first17=Joëlle |last18=González-Rouco |first18=J.

There are climate periods that could be roughly said to account for large scale climate trends in the Post Classical Period. These include the [[Late Antique Little Ice Age]], the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and the [[Little Ice Age]]. The [[Extreme weather events of 535–536|Extreme Weather Events of 536–537]] were likely initiated by the eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Lake llopango caldera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Sulfate emitted into the air initiated global cooling, migrations and crop failures worldwide possibly intensifying an already cooler time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160208112918.htm|title=Old trees reveal Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA) around 1,500 years ago|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that the world's temperature remained colder on average for at least a century afterwards.

The [[Medieval Warm Period|Medieval Warming Period]] from 950–1250 occurred mostly throughout the northern hemisphere causing many areas to have warmer summers, the high temperatures would only be surpassed by the Global Warming of the 20th/21st centuries. It has been hypothesized that the warm of temperatures allowed the Norse to colonize Greenland, due to ice-free waters at the time. Outside of Europe there is evidence of warming conditions, including higher temperatures in China and major North American droughts which adversely effected numerous cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.memphis.edu/NADA/TimeSeriesDisplay.aspx|title=Drought Congruence 1000-1300, Central United States|last=|first=|date=2010|website=North American Drought Atlas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1250, glaciers began to expand in Greenland effecting its [[Thermohaline circulation]], cooling the entire North Atlantic. In the 14th century, the growing season in Europe became unreliable, meanwhile in China the cultivation of Oranges were driven southward by colder temperatures. Especially in Europe, the Little Ice Age had large cultural ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eh-resources.org/timeline-middle-ages/|title=Timeline Middle Ages and Early Modern Period – Environmental History Resources|work=Environmental History Resources|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Little Ice Age]] would persist until the industrial revolution, far beyond the time-frame of the Post Classical Period.&lt;ref name="Hendy2002"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hendy | first1 = E.| last2 = Gagan | first2 = M.| last3 = Alibert | first3 = C.| last4 = McCulloch | first4 = M.| last5 = Lough | first5 = J.| last6 = Isdale | first6 = P.| title = Abrupt decrease in tropical Pacific sea surface salinity at end of Little Ice Age| journal = Science| volume = 295| issue = 5559| pages = 1511–1514| year = 2002| pmid = 11859191| doi = 10.1126/science.1067693|bibcode = 2002Sci...295.1511H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes for the little Ice-Age are unclear, possible explanations include [[Solar maximum|sunspots]], [[Earth's orbit|orbital cycles of the Earth]], [[Volcano|volcanic activity]], [[Thermohaline circulation|ocean circulation]], and man made [[population decline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira_research/Pongratz_Caldeira.html|title=Carnegie Department of Global Ecology|website=dge.carnegiescience.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===
{{main|Medieval Middle East}}

The Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Postclassical Era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the [[Caliphate|Arabian Empires]].

In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated by empires and their spheres of influence; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Outline of History|last=Wells|first=H.G|publisher=Garden City Publishing Inc|year=1920|isbn=|location=Garden City, NUY|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.

While the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the Turkic-based [[Seljuq Empire]].
After Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.

The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions.

In 1401, the region was further plagued by the [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turko-Mongol]], [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].

During the Postclassical Era, [[Africa]] was both culturally and politically affected by the introduction of Islam and the Arabic empires.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=184}} This was especially true in the north, the [[Sudan region]], and the east coast.

These were ruled by kings or councils of elders who would control their constituents in a variety of ways. Most of these peoples practiced spiritual, animistic religions. Africa was culturally separated between Saharan Africa (which consisted of [[North Africa]] and the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]) and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (everything south of the Sahara). Sub-Saharan Africa was further divided into the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], which covered everything north of [[Central Africa]], including [[West Africa]]. The area south of the Sudan was primarily occupied by the [[Bantu peoples]] who spoke the [[Bantu language]]. From 1100 onward [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] and the [[Islamic World]] became dependent on Africa for gold.

'''Sub Saharan Africa'''

After 650 approximately urbanization expanded for the first time beyond the ancient kingdoms [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] and [[Nubia]]. The Precolonial civilizations of African Civilization can be divided into three categories based on religion.  (1) Christian Civilizations on the [[Horn of Africa]] (2) Islamic Civilizations which formed in the Niger River valley in West Africa, and on the coast of East Africa and (3) Traditional Societies which adhered to native African Religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/world-history/sub-saharan-africa/#age-of-pre-colonial-civilization|title=History of Sub-Saharan Africa {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of the Sahara African kingdoms developed based on continental trade with one another through land based routes and generally avoided sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins Atlas of World History|editor-last=Barraclough|editor-first=Geoffrey|publisher=Borders Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0681502888|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub Saharan Africa was part of two large, separate trading networks, the Trans Saharan trade which bridged commerce between West and North Africa. Due to the huge profits from trade native African Islamic empires arose, including those of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=225|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, [[Musa I of Mali|Mana Masua]] king of Mali may have been the wealthiest person of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tschanz|first=David|title=Lion of Mali: The Hajj of Mansa Musa|url=https://www.academia.edu/1593503|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mali, the city of [[Timbuktu]] was an international center of science and well known throughout the Islamic World, particularly from the [[Sankore Madrasah|University of Sankore]].

There has been difficulty applying the word 'medieval' or 'post classical' to the history of South Asia. This section follows historian Stein Burton's definition that corresponds from the 8th century to the 16th century, more of less following the same time frame of the Post Classical Period and the European Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stein|first=Burton|author-link=Burton Stein|editor-last=Arnold|editor-first=D.|date=27 April 2010|title=A History of India|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-1405195096|page=105|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC&amp;pg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 13th century, there was no less than 20 to 40 different states on the Indian Subcontinent which hosted a variety of cultures, languages, writing systems and religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: A History|last=Keay|first=John|authorlink=John Keay|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2000|pages=xx–xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the time period [[Buddhism]] was predominant throughout the area with the short lived [[Pala Empire]] on the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indo Gangetic Plain]] sponsoring the faith's institutions.

In Southern India, the [[Hindu]] Kingdom of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] gained prominence with an overseas empire that controlled parts of modern-day Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya|Indonesia]] as oversees territories and helped spread Hinduism into the historic culture of these places.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Asia'' by B.V. Rao p.211&lt;/ref&gt;  In this time period, neighboring areas such as [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[History of Tibet|Tibet]], [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]] were under [[Greater India|South Asian influence]].

From 1206 onward a series of [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Turkic Islamic invasions]] based from modern day Afghanistan and Iran conquered massive portions of Northern India, founding the [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultante]] which remained supreme until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history : cultures, states, and societies to 1500|publisher=|others=Berger, Eugene., Israel, George L., Miller, Charlotte., Parkinson, Brian (Brian R.), Reeves, Andrew., Williams, Nadejda.|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=107|oclc=961216293|last1 = Berger|first1 = Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George L.|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delhi Sultanate introduced Islam to the conquered populations for the first time. Native religions fared differently, [[Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent|Buddhism declined]] in South Asia vanishing in many areas but Hinduism survived and reinforced itself in areas conquered by [[Hindu–Islamic relations|Muslims]]. In the far South the Kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijanyagar]] was not conquered by any Muslim state in the period. The turn of the 16th century would see the rise of a new Islamic Empire – the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the establishment of European trade posts by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]].

Built in the 9th century Borobudur is the largest Buddhist Temple in the world.|alt=|left]]From the 8th century onward Southeast Asia stood to benefit from the trade taking place between South and East Asia, numerous kingdoms arose in the region due to the flow of wealth passing through the [[Strait of Malacca]]. While Southeast Asia had numerous outside influences [[Greater India|India]] was the greatest source of inspiration for the region.  North Vietnam as an exception was culturally closer to China for centuries due to conquest.

Since rule from the third century BC North Vietnam continued to be subjugated by Chinese states, although they continually resisted periodically. There were three periods of [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese Domination]] that spanned near 1100 years. Vietnam gained long lasting independence in the 10th century when China was [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|divided]].  Nonetheless even as an independent state a sort of begrudging [[sinicization]] occurred. By the end of the Postclassical Era, Vietnam would be in control of its own [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. South Vietnam was governed by  the ancient Hindu [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] but was annexed by [[Cham–Annamese War|Vietnamese invaders]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=annam+sacked+their+country+vietnamese+smashed+champa+cham+officials+told+the+chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=annam%20sacked%20their%20country%20vietnamese%20smashed%20champa%20cham%20officials%20told%20the%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur|first=Ben|last=Kiernan|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|location=|page=110|isbn=978-0300144253|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and maritime trade between China and [[South Asia]] created the foundation for Southeast Asia's first major empires; including the [[Khmer Empire]] from Cambodia and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] from Indonesia. During the Khmer Empire's height in the 12th century the city of [[Angkor Thom]] was among the largest of the pre-modern world due to its water management. [[Jayavarman II|King Jayavarman II]] constructed over a hundred hospitals throughout his realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indianized states of Southeast Asia|first=George|last=Cœdès|isbn=978-0824803681|location=Honolulu|oclc=961876784|year=1968|publisher=East-West Center Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby rose the [[Pagan Empire]] in modern-day Burma, using elephants as military might.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=211|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Buddhist [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and its tolerance for believers of older polytheistic gods helped  [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] become supreme in the region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In Indonesia, [[Srivijaya]] from the 7th through 14th century was a [[Thalassocracy]] that focused on maritime city states and trade. Controlling the vital choke points of the [[Sunda Strait|Sunda]] and [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca straits]] it became rich from trade ranging from Japan through Arabia. Gold, Ivory and Ceramics were all major commodities traveling through port cities. The Empire was also responsible for the construction of wonders such as [[Borobudur]]. During this time Indonesian sailors crossed the [[Indian Ocean]]; evidence suggests that they may have colonized [[History of Madagascar|Madagascar]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar Founded By Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/madagascar-women-120320.html |title=Madagascar Founded By Women  |publisher=Discovery.com|date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian culture spread to the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Philippines]], likely through Indonesian trade resulting in the first documented use of writing in the archipelago and [[Indianized kingdom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History by Richard Bulliet, Pamela Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch, Lyman Johnson p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time changing economic and political conditions else where and wars weakened the traditional empires of South East Asia. While the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol Invasions]] did not directly annex Southeast Asia the war-time devastation paved way for the rise of new nations. In the 15th century the Khmer Empire was supplanted by the Thai [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] was overtaken by the [[Majapahit]] and later the Islamic [[Malacca Sultanate]] by 1450.

The Mongol Empire which existed during the 13th and 14th centuries, was the largest [[List of largest empires#Largest empires by land area and population|continuous land empire]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan. ''The Mongols''. p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]], the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from [[Central Europe]] to the [[Sea of Japan]], extending northwards into [[Siberia]], eastwards and southwards into the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Indochina]], and the [[Iranian plateau]], and westwards as far as the [[Levant]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=234|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the [[Mongolia]] homeland under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]], who was proclaimed ruler of all Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and then under his descendants, who sent [[Mongol invasions|invasions]] in every direction.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond.

''Culture and Conquest''. p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]], or one of his other sons such as [[Tolui]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], or [[Jochi]]. After [[Möngke Khan]] died, rival ''[[kurultai]]'' councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers [[Ariq Böke]] and [[Kublai Khan]], who then not only fought each other in the [[Toluid Civil War]], but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Biran |title=Qaidu and the Rise of the Independent Mongol State in Central Asia |publisher=The Curzon Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0700706310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatayid]] and [[House of Ögedei|Ögedeid]] families.

The Chinese style stamp was used outside China as the official symbol of the Khans and their messengers|alt=]]The [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260 marked the high-water point of the [[Mongol conquests]] and was the first time a Mongol advance had ever been beaten back in direct combat on the battlefield. Though the Mongols launched many more invasions into the Levant, briefly occupying it and raiding as far as Gaza after a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]] in 1299, they withdrew due to various geopolitical factors.

By the time of Kublai's death in 1294, the Mongol Empire had fractured into four separate khanates or empires, each pursuing its own separate interests and objectives: the [[Golden Horde]] khanate in the northwest; the [[Chagatai Khanate]] in the west; the [[Ilkhanate]] in the southwest; and the [[Yuan dynasty]] based in modern-day [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="China p413"&gt;''The Cambridge History of China: Alien Regimes and Border States''. p.&amp;nbsp;413.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1304, the three western khanates briefly accepted the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson.

===The Silk Road===
{{main|History of Central Asia|History of Siberia|Silk Road}}[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|left|thumb|Central Asian Buddhist Monks, the Silk Road allowed for the exchange for ideas as well as goods. A Caucasian looking [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teacher possibly [[Sogdia]]n instructs an East-Asian monk. Dated from the 9th century near [[Turpan|Turfan, Xinxiang, China]] |214x214px]]
The Silk Road was a Eurasian trade route that played a large role in global communication and interaction. It stimulated cultural exchange; encouraged the learning of new languages; resulted in the trade of many goods, such as silk, gold, and spices; and also spread religion and disease.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} It is even claimed by some historians – such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[William Hardy McNeill]], [[Jerry H. Bentley]], and [[Marshall Hodgson]] – that the Afro-Eurasian world was loosely united culturally, and that the Silk Road was fundamental to this unity.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} This major trade route began with the [[Han dynasty]] of China, connecting it to the Roman Empire and any regions in between or nearby. At this time, Central Asia exported horses, [[wool]], and [[jade]] into China for the latter's silk; the Romans would trade for the Chinese commodity as well, offering wine in return.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=101}} The Silk Road would often decline and rise again in trade from the Iron Age to the Postclassical Era. Following one such decline, it was reopened in Central Asia by [[Han Dynasty]] General [[Ban Chao]] during the 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The Silk Road was also a major factor in spreading religion across Afro-Eurasia. Muslim teachings from Arabia and [[Persia]] reached East Asia. Buddhism spread from India, to China, to Central Asia. One significant development in the spread of Buddhism was the carving of the [[Gandhara]] School in the cities of [[Taxila (ancient)|ancient Taxila]] and the [[Peshwar]], allegedly in the mid 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The route was vulnerable to spreading plague. The [[Plague of Justinian]] originated in East Asia and had a major outbreak in Europe in 542 causing the deaths of a quarter of the Mediterranean's population. Trade between Europe, Africa and Asia along the route was at least partially responsible for spreading the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/|title=Justinian's Plague (541–542 CE)|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a popular theory that the Black Death was caused by the Mongol conquests. The claim is that the direct link that it opened between the East and West provided the path for rats and fleas that carried the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780691135892|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no concrete historical evidence to this theory, the plague is considered endemic on the steppe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction|last=Milward|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199782864|location=Oxford|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were vulnerabilities as well to changing political situations. The rise of Islam changed the Silk Road, because Muslim rulers generally closed the Silk Road to [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] to an extent Europe would be cut off from Asia for centuries. Specifically, the political developments that affected the Silk Road included the emergence of the Turks, the political movements of the Sasanian and Byzantine empires, and the rise of the Arabs, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|last2=Sims-Williams|first2=Ursula|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1932476121|location=Chicago, IL|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Song Tapestry.jpg|thumb|Chinese-Song-era tapestry, Chinese Silk was carried west over large distances and sold for large profits.|alt=Chinese-Song era tapestry|264x264px]]

The Silk Road flourished again in the 13th century during the reign of the Mongol Empire, which through conquest had brought stability in Central Asia comparable to the [[Pax Romana]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=146|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by a Muslim historian that Central Asia was peaceful and safe to transverse &lt;blockquote&gt;"(Central Asia) enjoyed such a peace that a man might have journeyed from the land of sunrise to the land of sunset with a golden platter upon his head without suffering the least violence from anyone."{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, trade and communication between Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East required little effort. Handicraft production, art, and scholarship prospered, and wealthy merchants enjoyed cosmopolitan cities.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Silk Road trade played a role in spreading the infamous [[Black Death]]. Originating in China, the [[bubonic plague]] was spread by Mongol warriors catapulting diseased corpses into enemy towns in the [[Crimea]]. The disease, spread by rats, was carried by merchant ships sailing across the Mediterranean that brought the plague back to Sicily, causing an [[epidemic]] in 1347.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=310}} Nevertheless, after the 15th century, the Silk Road disappeared from regular use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was primarily a result from the growing sea travel pioneered by Europeans, which allowed the trade of goods by sailing around the southern tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The term ''Post Classical Science'' is often used in Academic Circles and in college courses to combine the study of [[European science in the Middle Ages|Medieval European Science]] and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Medieval Islamic Science]] due to their interactions with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/HIS-SCI-STUDY-GUIDE/0036_postClassicalScience.html|title=Outline – Post-Classical Science – History of Science Study Guide – Dr Robert A.

In the case of the Western World and in Islamic realms much emphasis was placed on preserving the rationalist Greek Tradition of figures such as [[Aristotle]]. In the context of science within Islam there is a debate as to whether Islamic Scientists simply preserved accomplishments from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] or built upon earlier Greek advances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1945) ''[[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]]'', book 2, part 2, chapter X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdus Salam]], H.R.

Within Eurasia, there were four major civilization groups that had literate cultures and created literature and arts. These include Europe, The Middle East, South Asia and East
Asia. Southeast Asia could be a possible fifth category but was influenced heavily from both South and East Asia literal cultures. All four cultures in Post-Classical Times used [[poetry]], [[drama]] and [[prose]]. Throughout the period and until the 19th century poetry was the dominant form of literary expression. In the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and China great poetic works often used figurative language. Examples include, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Shakuntala]]'', the [[Arabic]] ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Thousand and one nights]]'', [[Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]] '' and works by the Chinese [[Du Fu]]. In Japan, prose uniquely thrived more than in other geographic areas. The ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is considered the world's first realistic novel written in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/world-literature-music/|title=World Literature and Music {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musically, most regions of the world only used [[Melody|melodies]] as opposed to [[harmony]]. Medieval Europe was the lone exception to this rule, developing harmonic music in the 14th/15th century as musical culture transitioned form sacred music (meant for the church) to secular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/western-music-timeline/|title=Western Music Timeline {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Asian and Mid-Eastern music were similar to each other for their use of [[Microtonal music|microtone]].

{{main|Pre-Columbian era}}

The Postclassical Era of the Americas can be considered set at a different time span from that of Afro-Eurasia. As the developments of Mesoamerican and Andean civilization differ greatly from that of the Old World, as well as the speed at which it developed, the Postclassical Era in the traditional sense does not take place until near the end of the Medieval Age in Afro-Eurasia. As such, for the purposes of this article, the [[Classic stage]] of the Americas will be discussed here, which takes place from about 400 to 1400. For the technical Postclassical stage in American development, see [[Post-Classic stage]].

===North America===
As a continent there was little unified trade or communication. Advances in agriculture spread northward from Measoamerica indirectly through trade. Major cultural areas however still developed independently of each other.

==== Norse Contact and the Polar Regions ====
{{Main|Norse colonization of North America}}

While there was little regular contact between the Americas and the Old World the [[Vikings|Norse Vikings]] explored and even colonized [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]] as early as 1000. None of these settlements survived past [[Middle Ages|Medieval Times]]. Outside of Scandinavia knowledge of the discovery of the Americas was interpreted as a [[Vinland#Medieval geographers|remote island]] or the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|title=[Vinland in] Chapter 39|first=Adam of|last=Bremen|date=30 November 1977|website=www.canadianmysteries.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100208/http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|archivedate=17 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse arriving from Greenland settled Greenland from approximately 980 to 1450.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Norse arrived in southern [[Greenland]] prior to the 13th century approach of [[Inuit]] [[Thule people]] in the area. The extent of the interaction between the Norse and Thule is unclear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Greenland was valuable to the Norse due to trade of ivory that came from the tusks of walruses. The [[Little Ice Age]] adversely effected the colonies and they vanished.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of archaeology|last=1956-|first=Cunliffe, Barry W.

The Norse also explored and colonized farther south in [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland Canada]] at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] referred to by the Norse as ''[[Vinland]]''. The colony at most existed for twenty years and resulted in no known transmission of diereses or technology to the [[First Nations]]. To the Norse ''Vinland'' was known for plentiful grape vines to make superior wine. One reason for the colony's failure was constant violence with the native [[Beothuk]] tribe who the Norse referred to as [[Skræling|Skraeling]].

After initial expeditions there is a possibility that the Norse continued to visit modern day Canada. Surviving records from Medieval Iceland indicate some sporadic voyages to a land called ''[[Markland]]''  possibly the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada]] as late as the 1347 presumably to collect wood for deforested Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seaver |first=Kristen A. |title=The Frozen Echo: Greenland and the Exploration of North America, Ca.

[[Native American in the United States|Native American tribes]] varied greatly in characteristics; some, including the [[Mississippian culture]] and the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] were complex chiefdoms. Other nations which inhabited the states of the modern northern United States and Canada had less complexity and did not follow technological changes as quickly. Approximately around the year 500 during the [[Woodland period]] , Native Americans began to transition to bows and arrows from spears for hunting and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archaeology.uiowa.edu/american-indian-archery-technology-0|title=American Indian Archery Technology {{!}} The Office of the State Archaeologist|website=archaeology.uiowa.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancement however was uneven. During the 12th century was the widespread adoption of Corn as a staple crop in the [[Eastern United States]]. Corn would continue to be the staple crop of natives in the Eastern United States and Canada until the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].

In The Eastern United States rivers were the medium of trade and communication. [[Cahokia]] located in the modern U.S [[State of Illinois]] was among the most significant within the Mississippi Culture. Focused around [[Monks Mound]] archeology indicates the population increased exponentially after 1000 because it manufactured important tools for agriculture and cultural attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=393|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1350 Cahokia was abandoned, environmental factors have been proposed for the  city's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.wisc.edu/as-the-river-rises-cahokias-emergence-and-decline-linked-to-mississippi-river-flooding/|title=As the river rises: Cahokia's emergence and decline linked to Mississippi River flooding|website=news.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Ancestral Puebloans constructed clusters of buildings in the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]] site located in the [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]]. Individual houses may have been occupied by more than 600 residents at any one time. Chaco Canyon was the only pre-Columbian site in the United States to build paved roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carballo|first=David M|title=Trade Routes in the Americas Before Columbus|url=https://www.academia.edu/4998969|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|Toltec [[Atlantean figures]] at the Tula site. The [[Toltec|Toltec Civilization]] inspired the later [[Aztecs]]. Photograph provided by the Wikipedia User Luidger|alt=|left]]At the beginning of the global Post Classic Period, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was at its zenith, housing over 125,000 people, at 450 A.D it was the sixth largest city in the world at the time. The city's residents built the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] the third largest pyramid of the world, oriented to follow astronomical events. Suddenly in the 6th and 7th centuries, the city suddenly declined possibly as a result of severe environmental damage caused by [[extreme weather events of 535–536]]. There is evidence that large parts of the city were burned, possibly in a domestic rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Teotihuacan/|title=Teotihuacan|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's legacy would inspire all future civilizations in the region.

Following Teotihuacan came the Classic Age of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Civilization]] clustered in dozens of city states on the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and modern day [[Guatemala]]. The most significant of these cities were [[Chichen Itza]] which often fiercely competed with its neighbors to be the dominant economic influence in the region. The Mayans had an upper caste of priests, who were well versed in astronomy, mathematics and writing. The Mayan developed the concept of zero, and a 365-day calendar which possibly per-dates its creation in Old-World societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab58|title=HISTORY OF MESOAMERICAN CIVILIZATION|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 900, many Mayan cities suddenly declined in a period of drought.[[File:Aztec11 Bloodletting.jpg|thumb|Aztec Bloodletting, priests conduct a heart sacrifice, from the ''Tudela Codex'', 16th century.|197x197px]]

The [[Toltec Empire]] arose from the [[Toltec]] culture, and were remembered as wise and benevolent leaders. One priest-king called [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin]] advocated against human sacrifice. After his death in 947, civil wars of religious character broke out between those who supported and opposed Topiltzin's teachings. Modern historians however are skeptical of the extent of Toltec and influence and believe that much of the information known about the Toltecs was created by the later Aztecs as an inspiration myth.

In the 1300s, a small band of violent, religious radicals called the [[Aztec]]s began minor raids throughout the area.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=148|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they began to claim connections with the Toltec civilization, and insisted they were the rightful successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://glencoe.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0024122010/899891/Bentley5e_Chapter_20_Intro_Final.pdf|title=Traditions and Encounters, AP Edition , 5th Edition|last=Bentley|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chapter 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began to grow in numbers and conquer large areas of land. Fundamental to their conquest, was the use of [[Terrorism|political terror]] in the sense that the Aztec leaders and priests would command the [[human sacrifice]] of their [[Conquest (military)#Subjugation|subjugated]] people as means of humility and coercion.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Most of the Mesoamerican region would eventually fall under the Aztec Empire.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; On the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] most of the [[Maya peoples|Mayan People]] continued to be independent of the Aztecs but their traditional civilization declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=149|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec developments expanded cultivation, applying the use of [[chinampa]]s, irrigation, and [[terrace agriculture]]; important crops included [[maize]], [[sweet potato]]es, and [[avocado]]s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 1430 the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] allied with other powerful [[Nahuan languages|Nahuatl]] speaking cities- [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlacopan]] to create the Aztec Empire otherwise known as Triple-Alliance. Though referred to as an empire the Aztec Empire functioned as a system of tribute collection with Tenochtitlan at its center.  By the turn of the 16h century "[[flower war]]s" between the Aztecs and rival states such as [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] had continued for over fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html |title=Conquistadors – Cortés |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}

South American civilization was concentrated in the Andean region which had already hosted complex cultures since 2,500&amp;nbsp;BC.  East of the Andean region, the natives were generally semi nomadic. Discoveries on the [[Amazon basin|Amazon River Basin]] indicate the region likely had a pre-contact population of five million people and hosted complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=December 2009 |volume=83 |issue=322 |pages=1084–1095 |title=Pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the upper Purús: a complex society in western Amazonia |first1=Martti |last1=Pärssinen |first2=Denise |last2=Schaan |first3=Alceu |last3=Ranzi |doi= 10.1017/s0003598x00099373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the continent numerous agricultural peoples from [[History of Colombia|Colombia]] to [[History of Argentina|Argentina]] steadily advanced until European contact.

==== Andean Region ====
{{main|Andean civilizations|}}
[[File:Temple of the Sun, Machu Picchu, Peru - panoramio (1).jpg|left|thumb|Temple of the Sun, Machu Picchu, Peru, provided by David Broad.|238x238px|alt=]]

During [[Ancient history|Ancient times]] the Andean Region had developed civilizations independent of outside influences including that of [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), ''Encyclopedia of the Incas'', New York: Rowand &amp; Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite  6 or 7 pristine civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Post Classical era a cycle of civilizations continued until Spanish Contact. Collectively Andean societies lacked currency, a written language and solid draft animals enjoyed by old world civilizations. Instead Andeans developed other methods to foster their growth, including use of the [[quipu]] system to communicate messages, lamas to carry smaller loads and an economy based on [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Societies were often based on strict social hierarchies and economic redistribution from the ruling class.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the first half of the Post Classical Period the Andean Region was dominated by two almost equally powerful states. In the North of Peru was the [[Wari Empire]] and in the South of Peru and Bolivia was there is the [[Tiwanaku empire]] both of whom were inspired by the earlier [[Moche culture|Moche People]]. While the extent of their relationship to each other known, it is believed that they were in a Cold-War with one another, competing but avoiding direct conflict to avoid [[mutual assured destruction]]. Without war there was prosperity and around the year 700 Tiwanaku city hosted a population of 1.4.&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Alan L. ''Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara,'' Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 8th century both states declined due to changing environmental conditions, laying the ground work for the Incas to emerge as a distinct culture centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=387|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century the [[Inca Empire]] rose to annex all other nations in the area. Led by their, sun-god king, [[Sapa Inca]], they slowly conquered what is now [[Peru]], and built their society throughout the Andes cultural region. The Incas spoke the [[Quechua languages]] The Incas used the advances created by earlier Andean societies .Incas have been known to have used [[abacus]]es to calculate mathematics. The Inca Empire is known for some of its magnificent structures, such as [[Machu Picchu]] in the [[Cusco region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=389|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The empire expanded quickly northwards to Ecuador, Southwards to central Chile. To the north of the Inca Empire remained the independent [[Tairona]] and [[Muisca Confederation|Musica Confederation]] who practiced agriculture and gold metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Muisca_Civilization/|title=Muisca Civilization|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Tairona_Civilization/|title=Tairona Civilization|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the postclassical era drew to a close in the 15th century, many of the empires established throughout the period were in decline.

The Byzantines faced repeated attacks from eastern and western powers during the [[Fourth Crusade]], and declined further until the loss of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=138–139|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest change came in terms of trade and technology. The global significance of the fall of the Byzantines was the disruption of overland routes between Asia and Europe. Traditional dominance of [[Nomad]]ism in Eurasia declined and the [[Pax Mongolica|Pax Mongolia]] which had allowed for interactions between different civilizations was no longer available. China, which had previously engaged in expansion and innovation became isolationist in the 14th century under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and would remain so until the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|pages=168–169|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Asia]] and [[South Asia]] were conquered by [[Gunpowder Empires]] which successfully utilized advances in military technology but closed the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Madeline C.|last=Zilfi|year=1997|title=Halil Inalcik and Donald Quataert, editors.

Europeans – specifically the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and various Italian explorers – intended to replace land travel with sea travel.

Other Explorers such as the Spanish sponsored Italian [[Christopher Columbus]] intended to engage in trade by traveling on unfamiliar routes west from Europe. The subsequent [[European discovery of the Americas]] in 1492 resulted in the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian exchange]] and the world's first [[globalization]].

{{redirect|RF}}

'''Radio frequency''' ('''RF''') refers to an [[oscillation]] rate of an [[Alternating_current|alternating electric current]] or voltage or of a [[Magnetic_field|magnetic]], electric or [[Electromagnetic_field|electromagnetic]] field or mechanical system in the [[frequency]] range from around twenty thousand times per second ({{val|20|ul=kHz}}) to around three hundred billion times per second ({{val|300|ul=GHz}}). This is roughly between the upper limit of [[audio frequency|audio frequencies]] and the lower limit of [[infrared]] frequencies;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xHNBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA364#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false J. A. Fleming, ''The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy and Telephony'', London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1919, p. 364]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Ghirardi, ''Radio Physics Course'', 2nd ed. New York: Rinehart Books, 1932, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; these are the frequencies at which energy from an oscillating current can radiate off a conductor into space as [[radio wave]]s.  Different sources specify different upper and lower bounds for the frequency range. While RF usually refers to electrical rather than mechanical oscillations, mechanical RF systems are not uncommon (see [[mechanical filter]] and [[RF MEMS]]).

== Special properties of RF current ==
[[Electric current]]s that oscillate at radio frequencies have special properties not shared by [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]] of lower frequencies.
* Energy from RF currents in conductors can radiate into space as [[electromagnetic wave]]s ([[radio wave]]s).  This is the basis of [[radio]] technology.
* RF current does not penetrate deeply into electrical conductors but tends to flow along their surfaces; this is known as the [[skin effect]].
* RF currents applied to the body often do not cause the painful sensation and muscular contraction of [[electric shock]] that lower frequency currents produce.&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;{{cite book

However this does not mean RF currents are harmless; they can cause internal injury as well as serious superficial burns called ''[[Radiation burn|RF burns]]''.
* RF current can easily [[Ionization|ionize]] air, creating a conductive path through it.  This property is exploited by "high frequency" units used in electric [[arc welding]], which use currents at higher frequencies than power distribution uses.
* Another property is the ability to appear to flow through paths that contain insulating material, like the [[dielectric]] insulator of a [[capacitor]]. This is because [[capacitive reactance]] in a circuit decreases with frequency.
* In contrast, RF current can be blocked by a coil of wire, or even a single turn or bend in a wire.  This is because the [[inductive reactance]] of a circuit increases with frequency.
* When conducted by an ordinary electric cable, RF current has a tendency to reflect from discontinuities in the cable such as connectors and travel back down the cable toward the source, causing a condition called [[standing wave]]s. Therefore, RF current must be carried by specialized types of cable called [[transmission line]].

[[diathermy|RF diathermy]] is a medical treatment that uses RF induced heat as a form of [[physical therapy ]]and in surgical procedures. It is commonly used for muscle relaxation. It is also a method of heating tissue electromagnetically for therapeutic purposes in medicine. Diathermy is used in physical therapy to deliver moderate heat directly to pathologic lesions in the deeper tissues of the body.  Surgically, the extreme heat that can be produced by diathermy may be used to destroy [[neoplasms]], [[warts]], and [[infected tissues]], and to [[cauterize]] [[blood vessels]] to prevent excessive bleeding. The technique is particularly valuable in [[neurosurgery]] and surgery of the eye.  Diathermy equipment typically operates in the short-wave radio frequency (range 1–100&amp;nbsp;MHz) or microwave energy (range 434–915&amp;nbsp;MHz).

[[Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy]] (PEMF) is a medical treatment that purportedly helps to heal bone tissue reported in a recent NASA study. This method usually employs electromagnetic radiation of different frequencies - ranging from static magnetic fields, through extremely low frequencies (ELF) to higher radio frequencies (RF) administered in pulses.

==Effects on the human body==
Radio frequency current through tissue will generate heat in the tissue and can cause burns.

==Measurement==
{{More citations needed|date=July 2017}}

Test apparatus for radio frequencies can include standard instruments at the lower end of the range, but at higher frequencies the test equipment becomes more specialized.

'''Rainbow Valley Conservation Reserve''' is a [[protected area]] located south of [[Alice Springs]], [[Northern Territory]] in Australia. The reserve was established in 1990 to protect the unique [[sandstone]] formations and the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] art, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and sacred natural objects within an area of {{convert|24.83|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} around a large sandstone [[cliff|bluff]].&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|16}} The sandstone layers in the main formation resemble the colored stripes of a rainbow, with the red-orange hues of sandstone that is rich with iron creating a strong contrast with the lighter shaded sandstone that turns pale yellow or gold in the late day sun as it shines on the northwest-facing cliffs.&lt;ref name=website&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow Valley Conservation Reserve Official Site|url=http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/parks/find/rainbowvalley|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205004851/http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/parks/find/rainbowvalley|archivedate=4 Dec 2015|publisher=PWCNT|year=2015|accessdate=4 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainbow Valley's main sandstone formation is known as ''Wurre'' by the local Aboriginals, the Twertentyeye group of Upper Southern [[Aranda people|Arrernte people]],&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|16}} and is a significant part of their homeland which they call ''Imarnte''.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|3}} Since 2008, the area has been jointly managed by the Twertentyeye and the [[Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory]] (PWCNT)&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet for Rainbow Valley Conservation Reserve|url=http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/10599/RainbowValley.pdf|publisher=PWCNT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228230127/http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/10599/RainbowValley.pdf|archivedate=28 Feb 2015|accessdate=4 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the first conservation reserve to have a joint management plan.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|3}}

==Geography==
The Rainbow Valley access road is located {{convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Alice Springs as a branch off the [[Stuart Highway]]. The unsealed dirt access road heads east then southeast for {{convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}} to a parking lot situated on the west side of a [[claypan]] that extends northwest from the base of the main sandstone formation. Since there are some sandy sections along the access road, the official park site declares the road as "recommended for 4WD vehicles only."&lt;ref name=website /&gt; The joint management plan's official document, however, refers to the access road as "suitable for conventional vehicles driven with care" but still recommends 4WD for the final {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} around the claypan. A plan to re-align and improve the final section was in place as of June 2008.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|61}}

The reserve is located in the arid center of the country where rain is irregular and droughts are common. The nearest place with official records, Alice Springs, has a median annual rainfall of {{convert|286|mm|in|abbr=on}} and an [[evaporation]] rate of more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. No permanent water sources exist on the surface though there is an [[aquifer]] not far below the surface. A single rockhole does contain rainwater for long periods and was therefore an important source for the Aboriginal people after significant rainfall.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|45}}

==Geology==
The cliffs and rocky outcrops in Rainbow Valley are composed of 350 million year old ''Hermannsburg Sandstone''. Below the surface there is a layer of ''Mereenie Sandstone'' which becomes exposed above ground level in the James Range, a mountain range to the south of the reserve. Various exposed sandstone [[Joint (geology)|joint]]s, eroded honeycomb holes, iron-stained sandstone and fossils are found in the formations.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|43}} Since these sandstones are very delicate they can be damaged by any human interaction. Climbing on or disturbing the formations is prohibited. The claypans are also delicate and visitors are advised to stay off them unless they are dry and a permit is obtained.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|44}}

The colored bands in the rock layers of Rainbow Valley were created during a much wetter time in the history of this very dry region. Heavy rains would cause the reddish, iron-rich sandstone to dissolve and the subsequent dry seasons would cement those dissolved minerals on the surface, staining them a deeper red. The dark red [[caprock]] contains the most iron and is more resistant to erosion than the lighter colored sandstone layers, which delays the eventual collapse and disintegration of the formations.&lt;ref name=website /&gt;

A marked trail leads to another featured formation called ''Mushroom Rock'' where [[fairy martin]] nests are located high up on the rock wall.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:A232, Alice Springs Desert Park, Alice Springs, Australia, thorny devil, 2007.JPG|thumb|left|Thorny devil]]
More than 400 plant species are found in Rainbow Valley including [[Triodia (grass)|spinifex]] grasslands, [[acacia]] shrubs and [[Eucalyptus coolabah|coolibah]] trees in the western part of the reserve. [[Acacia aneura|Mulga]] trees grow close to the sandstone formations and even on top of them. [[Allocasuarina decaisneana|Desert oaks]] are more common on the east side of the main formation.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|47}}

The ''[[Eremophila (plant)|eremophila]] Rainbow Valley'' is a sandplain shrub listed as ''vulnerable'' under the ''Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act'' (CEPBCA). The species survives only in a very restricted range and is not protected in any other reserve. ''Daviesia arthropoda'' is another rare shrub that grows on sand dunes in the reserve.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|48}}

The observed animal species are 110 birds, 20 mammals, 46 reptiles and three frogs. [[Emu]]s, [[bat]]s, [[dingo]]es and [[honeypot ant]]s are significant animals in the local Aboriginal culture. Bat species include the [[Gould's wattled bat]] and the [[lesser long-eared bat]].&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Migratory black, brown and pied [[honeyeater]]s use the [[grevillea]] and eremophila shrubs as their breeding habitat, while the [[white-winged fairywren]]'s habitat includes the [[zygochloa]] and spinifex grasslands. The [[grey falcon]], [[redthroat]] and [[red-tailed black cockatoo]] are listed as ''lower risk near threatened'' under the ''Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act'' (TPWCA).&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|50}}

The [[Common wallaroo|euro]] is the most observed mammal, while the [[black-flanked rock-wallaby]] is listed as ''vulnerable'' by the CEPBCA and ''near threatened'' by the TPWCA - the only mammal with a conservation listing in the reserve. The [[Thorny dragon|thorny devil]] and the [[trilling frog]] also live in the reserve.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|50}}

==Aboriginal significance==
More than forty Aboriginal archaeological sites have been found and recorded.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|39}} These sites include [[petroglyph]]s (engraved rock), [[pictogram|pictographs]] (painted rock), grinding stones, stone tools, quarries and camp sites. All archaeological sites are in a restricted access area which requires permission and a guide to enter.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|13,40}}

To the south of the main sandstone formation, a [[massif]] called ''Ewerre'' by the Twertentyeye is registered as a sacred site, as well as all the surrounding area within {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} of that rock. The black rocks lying on the northern side of the main formation are also considered significant natural objects that are not to be moved from their current locations.&lt;ref name=website /&gt;

In consideration of both the Aboriginal culture and the ideals of conservation of the area, visitors may only explore in the designated viewing and camping areas on the southwest side of the claypan, and along the trail to Mushroom Rock or other officially marked trails.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|11}} All other areas, including the claypan, are restricted access requiring a guide.&lt;ref name=jmp/&gt;{{rp|61}}

==Facilities==
Visitors may camp in two designated areas. A camping fee is required and payable on site. There are gas barbecues, firepits, picnic tables and pit toilet facilities available.&lt;ref name=website /&gt;

'''Sacred mountains''' are central to certain [[religion]]s and are the subjects of many legends. For many, the most symbolic aspect of a mountain is the peak because it is believed that it is closest to [[heaven]] or other religious worlds. &lt;ref&gt;Naess, Arne. Mountains and Mythology. Trumpeter 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have traditions centered on sacred mountains, which either are or were considered [[holy]] (such as [[Mount Olympus]] in [[Greek mythology]]) or are related to famous events (like [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Judaism]] and descendant religions). In some cases, the sacred mountain is purely mythical, like the [[Hara Berezaiti]] in [[Zoroastrianism]]. Mount [[Kailash]] is believed to be the abode of the Hindu deity [[Shiva]]. [[Volcano]]es, such as [[Mount Etna]] in [[Italy]], were also considered sacred, Mount Etna being believed to have been the home of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of fire and the forge.

==Ancient myths and practices==

[[Carpathian Mountains]] - an arc roughly 1,500 km (932 mi) long across Central Europe.

[[File:Greece Mount Olympus (1).jpg|thumb|Mount Olympus]]
[[Mount Olympus]] is the highest mountain peak in [[Greece]]. It was once regarded as the “home of the Greek Gods/The Twelve Olympians of the [[Hellenistic]] World". It was also considered the site of the War of the Titans (Titanomachy) where Zeus and his siblings defeated the Titans.

[[Mount Othrys]] is a mountain in Central Greece, which is believed to be the home of the Titans during the ten-year war with the Gods of Mount Olympus.

[[Mount Ida]], also known as Mountain of the Goddess, refers to two specific mountains: one in the Greek island of Crete and the other in [[Turkey]] (formerly known as Asia Minor).

Mount Ida is the highest mountain on the island of [[Crete]] is the sacred mountain of the Titaness [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], also known as the mother of the Greek Gods. It is also believed to be the cave where Greek God [[Zeus]] was born and raised.

The other Mt. Ida is located in Northwestern Turkey alongside the ruins of Troy (in reference to the Hellenistic Period). The mountain was dedicated to [[Cybele]], the Phrygian (modern-day Turkey) version of Earth Mother. Cybele was the goddess of caverns and mountains. Some refer to her as the “Great Mother” or “Mother of the Mountain”. The mythic [[Trojan War]] is said to have taken place at Mount Ida and that the Gods gathered upon the mountaintop to observe the epic fight. Mount Ida in Turkey is also represented in many of the stories of Greek author [[Homer]] such as [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]].

Mount Athos, located in Greece, is also referred to as the Holy Mountain. It has great historical connections with religion and classical mythology. In religion it is believed that after the Ascension of the Lord, the Virgin Mary landed on the island and came upon a pagan temple. It was there that the pagan practitioners converted from paganism to Christianity. The [[Virgin Mary]] then blessed the land and claimed it her own.&lt;ref&gt;Mount Athos: Renewal in Paradise By Graham Speake. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2002. 294 pp. {{ISBN|0-300-09353-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical mythology]], [[Mount Athos]] is named after the [[Thracian]] giant who battled [[Poseidon]], God of the Sea, during the clash of the titans and Gods. It is also said that Greek historian was given the task of creating a canal through the mountain after the failed journey of Persian leader, [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Overtime, [[Alexander the Great]] has become associated with the mountain for his worldly powers. The myth states that Roman architect [[Dinocrates]] had wanted to carve Alexander the Great's figure onto the top of the mountain in tribute to him.&lt;ref&gt;Dora, Veronica Della. 2005. Alexander the Great's Mountain. Geographical Review Vol. 95 Issue 4 p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[Inca]] displayed a connection with death and their mountains. It is well known by scholars that the Inca sensed a deep reservoir of spirituality along the mountain range. Situating their villages in the mountains, they felt these places acted as portal to the gods. Ritual child sacrifices called [[Capachochas]] were conducted annually, where the most precious gift that could be given (innocent, blemishless, perfect human life) would be sacrificed to the gods. Tremendous effort would be taken as the sacrificial victims would be paraded alive throughout the cities, with multiple festivals and feasts taking place. The final destination would be the tops of some of the highest mountains near their villages, leaving these sacrifices to freeze in the snow. These would take place during great times of distress, during times of famine, violent periods of war, and even during times of political shift. This connection with the mountain as a sacred space is paramount. There would be no other place that would be sufficient or acceptable enough for the gods to accept these gifts. It is neither a surprise nor a coincidence that their honored dead were placed on the highest peaks of the mountains to express the shared connection between the sacred mountain, the gods, and the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Ceruti, Constanza.2004 Human Bodies as Objects of Dedication at Inca Mountain Shrines (North-Western Argentina). World Archaeology 36:103–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern indigenous beliefs==

Various cultures around the world maintain the importance of mountain worship and sacredness. One example is the [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] peoples of New Zealand. The Taranaki center their whole life around the sacred mountain, the [[Mount Taranaki]]. It is no wonder that they shared the same name, as they shared their livelihood from its streams. The rivers that flowed down its steep terrain fed the plants, animals, and gave the tribe all they needed for life. The Taranaki tribe places this mountain into a context of a love story, spelling out the history of their creation in a battle over love, defeat, and a happy ending where this Taranaki Mountain found love with a neighboring volcano. This narrative plays out in the lives of the tribesmen where the mountain is their love, their life force. Life is given from megalith, and when life is taken away, the people are ultimately returned to the mountain. This mountain can be explained as anthropomorphisised, a living organism of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ailsa. 1997. Who is that Mountain Standing there... Its Taranaki...

In [[Korea]], people have maintained ancient ways of worshiping mountain spirits. While they are not in fact worshiping the land itself, the gods associated with this worship are united to the land. These spirits are female entities to whom people pay tribute while passing by the mountains, asking for good luck and protection. People also travel to these mountains to ask for fertility. While people generally hold to these female deities for protection or to perpetuate life, one of their most important functions is to protect the dead. The [[ponhyangsansin]] is a guardian spirit that is protecting an important clan grave site in the village. Each mountain goddess has an equally interesting story that is tied to their accounts of war against Japan, and the historical legacy of their emperors. Each spirit learned difficult lessons and experienced some sort of hardship. These legacies in the mountains serve as a kind of monument to the history of Korea. While many of the accounts may be true, their details and accuracy are shrouded by time and ritual. While the inaugurations of new ponhyang san sin are not being conducted, fallen important clansmen and leaders are strategically placed in the mountains in order for these strong, heroine-like spirits may fiercely guard their graves. The history of Korea is in turn protecting its own future.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, James H.1996 Female Mountain Spirits in Korea: A Neglected Tradition. Asian Folklore Studies 55: 19–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], [[Mount_Kōya|Mount Koya-san]] is the home to one of the holiest Buddhist monastery complexes in the country. It was founded by a saint, [[Kukai]], who is also known as Kobo Dashi and is regarded as a famous wandering mystic; his teachings are infamous throughout Japan and he is credited with being an important figure in shaping early Japanese culture. Buddhists believe that Kobo Dashi is not dead, but will instead awake and assist in bringing enlightenment to all people, alongside the Buddha and other [[bodhisattvas]]. It is believed that he was shown the sacred place to build the monastery by a forest god; this site is now the location of a large cemetery that is flanked by 120 esoteric Buddhist temples. Approximately a million pilgrims visit Mount Koya-san a year; these pilgrims have included both royals and commoners who wish to pay their respects to Kobo Dashi. [[Mount Fuji]], known as Fuji-san in Japanese, is another sacred mountain in Japan. Several [[Shinto]] temples flank its base, which all pay homage to the mountain. A common belief is that Fuji-san is the incarnation of the earth spirit itself. The [[Fuki-ko]] sect maintains that the mountain is a holy being, and the home to the goddess [[Sengen-sama]]. Annual fire festivals are held there in her honor. Fuji-san is also the site of pilgrimages; reportedly, 40,000 people climb up to its summit every year.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Brad. Sacred Places Around the World: 108 Destinations. 2nd ed. San Francisco: CCC Publishing, 2008. 34–83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibet's [[Mount Kailash]] is a sacred place to four religions: Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Bon Po (a native Tibetan religion prior to Buddhism), and [[Ayyavazhi]] religions. According to some Hindu tradition, Kailash is the home of the deity [[Shiva]]. In Hindu religion, Mount Kailash also plays an important role in Rama's journey in the ancient [[Sanskrit]] epic, [[Ramayana]]. Buddhists hold that Kailash is the home of [[Samvara]], a guardian deity, and a representation of [[Buddha]]. Buddhists believe that Mount Kailash has supernatural powers that are able to clean the sins of a lifetime of any person. Followers of Jainism believe that Kailash is the site where the founder of Jainism reached [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. Bon Po teaches that Kailash is the home of a wind goddess.

[[Mount Meru]] is a cosmic mountain which is described to be one of the highest points on Earth and is the center of all creation. In the Hindu religion, it is believed that Meru is home to the god [[Brahma]], who is believed to be the father of the human race and all the demigods produced afterward. Indian [[cosmology]] believes that the sun, moon, and stars all revolve around Mount Meru. Folklore suggests the mountain rose up from the ground piercing the heavens giving it the moniker "navel of the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Mabbett, I.W. 1983. The Symbolism of Mount Meru. History of Religions Vol. 23 No.1 pp. 64–83&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Torah, and consequently the Old Testament of the Bible, Mount Sinai is the location that Moses received the Ten Commandments directly from God. The tablets form the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]], which is a central cornerstone of Jewish faith. [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] is located at the foot of Sinai. It was founded by empress Helena, who was the mother of the first Christian Roman emperor, [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. It was completed under the rule of [[Justinian]] two centuries later. The monastery was visited by the prophet Muhammed, who blessed it and promised “that it would be cherished by Muslims for all time”.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Brad. Sacred Places Around the World: 108 Destinations. 2nd ed. San Francisco: CCC Publishing, 2008. 34–83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the monastery is home to a group of [[Greek Orthodox]] monks, as well as a large collection of [[Byzantine art]], illuminated manuscripts, icons, and books; the collection of icons in particular has been proclaimed one of the oldest in the world.

The [[Navajo people|Navajo]] possess a strong belief system in regards to the natural-supernatural world and have a belief that objects have a supernatural quality. For example, the Navajo consider mountains to be sacred. There are four peaks, which are believed to have supernatural aspects. The mountains each represent a borderline of the original Navajo tribal land. The mountain ranges include [[Mount Taylor (New Mexico)|Mount Taylor]], the [[San Francisco Peaks]], [[Blanca Peak]], and [[Hesperus Peak]] located in the [[La Plata Mountains]].

Each mountain/peak is representative of a color, direction, and correlates with a cultural light phenomenon dealing with the cosmic scheme of the rising and of the setting sun. Directionally, the mountains are described in a clockwise motion following the movement of the sun beginning with the eastern mountain of Blanca Peak. Blanca Peak is associated with the color white and the "Dawn Man" referring to the rising of the sun. Next in the south is Mt. Taylor, which is associated with the color blue and the "Horizontal Blue Man" referring to the daytime. In the west is the San Francisco Peaks, which is representative of the color yellow and the "Horizontal Yellow Woman" and is associated with the setting of the sun. And finally in the north is the Hesperus Peak of the La Plata Mountains which is given the color black and belongs to the light phenomenon of the "Darkness Woman" representing the nighttime.&lt;ref&gt;Lamphere, Louise. 1969. Symbolic Elements in Navajo Ritual. Southwestern Journal of Anthropology Vol. 25 No. 3 pp. 379–305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community identity==
History shows that mountains were commonly part of a complex system of mountain and ancestor worship. Having immortalized fallen brethren in the edifice, the people share a common allegiance with all the other people of a community. The meanings that were etched into the mountain and mound terrain connected the villagers. They were all subject to the same landscape and village history, which were bound together by their cultural significance. The history of [[ancestors]] could be told by simply pointing at specific mountains and remembering the stories that were passed down throughout the generations. The worship of ancestors and the mountains were largely inseparable. An interconnected web between history, landscape, and culture was thus formed.&lt;ref&gt;Dillehay, Tom D. 1995 Mounds of social death: Araucanian funeraruries and political succession. In Tombs for the Living: Andean Mortuary Practices. T. Dillehay Ed. pp. 281–314 Dumbarton Oaks Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this would be the Hindu belief that Mount Kailas is the final resting place for the
souls of the dead, as well as the large cemetery placed on Mount Koya-san.

Sacred mountains can also provide an important piece of a culture's identity. For example, Messerli and Ives write, “The [[Armenians|Armenian]] people regard Mount Ararat, a volcano in eastern Turkey believed to be the site of [[Noah's Ark]] in the Bible, to be a symbol of their natural and cultural identity”.&lt;ref&gt;Messerli, Bruno, and Jack D. Ives. Mountains of the World: A Global Priority. 17. International Mountain Society, 1997. 39–54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the mountain's role as a part of a cultural identity, even people who do not live close to the mountain feel that events occurring to the mountain are relevant to their own personal lives. This results in communities banning certain activities near the mountain, especially if those activities are seen as potentially destructive to the sacred mountain itself.

==Pilgrimages==
To date, Kailash has never been climbed, largely due to the fact that the idea of climbing the mountain is seen as a major sacrilege. Instead, the worshipful embark on a [[pilgrimage]] known as the [[kora (pilgrimage)|kora]]. The kora consists of a 32-mile path that circles the mountain, which typically takes five days with little food and water. Various icons, prayer flags, and other symbols of the four religions that believe Kailash is sacred mark the way. To Buddhists and Hindus, the pilgrimage is considered a major moment in a person's spiritual life. Olsen writes, “One circuit is believed to erase a lifetime of sin, while 108 circuits is believed to ensure enlightenment”.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Brad. Sacred Places Around the World: 108 Destinations. 2nd ed. San Francisco: CCC Publishing, 2008. 34–83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the most sacred mountains in the Middle East,  mentioned in the Old Testament can be seen on the mountain's summit, such as the area where Moses “sheltered from the total glory of God”.

Sacred Mountains are often seen as a site of revelation and inspiration. Mount Sinai is an example, as this is the site where the covenant is revealed to Moses. [[Mount Tabor]] is where it is supposed Jesus was revealed to be the Son of God. [[Muhammed]] is said to have received his first revelation on [[Mount Hira]].&lt;ref&gt;Quran Ch. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The mountains' roles as places of revelation and transformation often serve to attract [[tourists]] as much as they do religious pilgrims. However, in some cases, the financial revenue is overlooked and sacred mountains are conserved first due to their role in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Messerli, Bruno, and Jack D. Ives. Mountains of the World: A Global Priority. 17. International Mountain Society, 1997. 39–54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of The Aetherius Society conduct pilgrimages to 19 mountains around the world that they describe as being "holy mountains".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetherius.org/pilgrimages-to-holy-mountains/ Aetherius Society webpage on holy mountains]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
{{tone|date=November 2015}}
Sacred mountains are often viewed as the source of a power which is to be awed and revered. Often, this means that access to the sacred mountain is restricted. This could result in climbing being banned from a sacred mountain completely (as in the case of Mount Kailas) or for secular society to give the mountain a wide berth. Because of the respect accorded to a mountain's sacred power, many areas have been declared off limit for construction and remain conserved. For example, a large amount of forest has been preserved due to its proximity to [[Mount Koya]]-san. Additionally, sacred mountains can be seen as the source of something vital. This could be a blessing, water, life, or healing. Mount Kailas's role as the source for four major rivers is celebrated in [[India]] and not simply seen as mundane. Rather, this also adds to its position as a sacred place, especially considering the sacred position of the Ganges river in Indian culture. Mountains that are considered home to deities are also central to prayers for the blessings from the gods reputed to live there. This also creates a sense of purity in the source of the mountain. This prompts people to protect streams from pollution that are from sacred mountains, for example.

Views of preservation and sacredness become problematic when dealing with diverse populations. When one observes the sacred mountain of the [[Sacramento Valley]] in the United States, it becomes clear that methods and opinions stretch over a vastly differing body of protesters. Shasta Mountain was first revered by the Native American tribe, the [[Wintu]]. Shasta was in effect a standing monument for the individuals of their cultural history. This bounded view of sacred mountains changed drastically during the 1800s. It is commonly assumed that sacred mountains are limited by a single society, trapped in a time capsule with only one definition to explain it: the indigenous tribe. Shasta's glory had expanded to multiple regions of the world, communities of differing religions making their pilgrimage up to the summits of this glorious mountain. The Wintu tribe did not hold a monopoly on the sacredness anymore. There were others contesting to the meanings, adding new rituals and modifying old ones. With the advent of new technology and desires to turn this mountain into a skiing lodge, angry voices from all over the world rose up with variants of demands on why and how we should preserve this beautiful mountain.

Almost every day different religious practices such as nude bathing, camping out with magic crystals, yoga, and many “quasi-Christian” groups such as the I AM march their ways up to the tips of this mountain. With this activity the mountain pathways become clustered, cluttered and littered. Even the pathways’ existence leads to erosion, and further slow degradation of the mountain. The [[Wintu]] tribe has voiced concerns and asked for support from the government to regulate the activities practiced on “their” mountain saying that “they are disturbed by the lack of respect” shown for this piece of land. It has become greatly debated if the more vulnerable and “spiritually desirable” places of the mountain should be closed and maintained only by the Wintu tribe, who see this land as a sacred graveyard of their ancestors, or open to all who seek spiritual fulfillment such as the modern-day group of the [["I AM" Activity|I AM]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntsinger, Lynn and Maria Fernandez -Martinez 2000 Spiritual Pilgrims at Mount Shasta California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15423">'''Sarah Fraser Robbins''' (December 27, 1911 - February 9, 2002) was a writer and educator in the field of [[natural history]] and a dedicated [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]].

Her scientific specialty was the creatures that inhabit the shallow waters of the seacoast of [[Massachusetts]]. She was a fervent [[Birdwatching|birder]] as well. She was the first director of education at the [[Peabody Museum of Salem]], 1971-1981. She spent many years before and after that time exploring the dwellers of the waters, [[littoral zone]], and sky near her house in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]]. For almost twenty years she served on the board of directors of the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]] and contributed regular columns to the Society’s magazines. She was also a member of the [[Society of Woman Geographers]], an elite group of adventurers and travelers. She rode elephants to see tigers in [[India]], flew over the [[Alps]] in a [[hot air balloon]], and fished in [[Afghanistan]].

== Early life, education, and marriage ==

Sarah Fraser was the youngest of five children, one boy and four girls, of George Corning Fraser (born February 25, 1872 in [[New York City]], died November 15, 1935 in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]) and Jane Gardener Tutt (born August 4, 1874 in [[Danville, Kentucky]], died December 25, 1936 in [[New York City]]). They were married December 5, 1895 in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. Sarah was born in [[Morristown, New Jersey]] on December 27, 1911. Almost a fifty-year resident of Gloucester, she died in [[Boston]] on February 9, 2002 at the age of 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/17251827/Descendants-of-Andrew-Fraser-Robbins-and-Robbins|publisher=Family Tree Maker|accessdate=July 23, 2014|title=Descendents of Andrew Fraser Robbins and Robbins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah’s father was a [[lawyer]] in New York City and amateur [[geologist]] by avocation. He had a great spirit of wanderlust that he passed on to his children. He enjoyed taking his daughters on summer field trips to the western United States, especially [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=George|last2=Swanson|first2=Frederick|title=Journeys in the Canyon Lands of Utah and Arizona, 1914-1916|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQLb9CtbOJwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Journeys+in+the+Canyon+Lands+of+Utah+and+Arizona,+1914-1916&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qOU6VPnJMcHksASHh4KIDg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Journeys%20in%20the%20Canyon%20Lands%20of%20Utah%20and%20Arizona%2C%201914-1916&amp;f=false|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=0-8165-2440-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah was educated at [[Brearley School]] in New York City, became a debutante, and was honored at a dinner and dance given by her older sisters in November, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Dinner and Dance for Sarah Fraser|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E04E1DC1F38E433A25754C2A9679D946194D6CF|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 27, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed her older sister, Ann, to [[Bryn Mawr College]]. She graduated in 1934 with a degree in geology, with distinction. During her senior year she received the Elizabeth S. Shippen Prize in Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bryn Mawr College Calendar 1932-1934|url=https://archive.org/details/brynmawrcalendar2527bryn|date=January 1, 1932|publisher=Bryn Mawr College}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 and 1935 she returned to Brearley to teach science. In 1984, at her fiftieth reunion, she was chosen by her Bryn Mawr classmates to present the class gift to the college.

On May 2, 1936, in the garden of the estate at Morristown, she married Chandler Robbins II of Boston, the son of physician Dr. William Bradford Robbins and his wife Marian Bennett Robbins. Chandler Robbins II was born in Boston on November 21, 1906 and died in Boston on June 2, 1955 of cancer. His entire career, except for the [[World War II]] years, was spent with the [[Bates Mill|Bates Manufacturing Company]] of [[Lewiston, Maine]], one of the greatest [[textile]] companies in America.

The young couple moved to [[Auburn, Maine]], where the first three of five children were born: Hanson Corning, born in 1937; Theodore Bennett, born in 1939; and Marian, born in 1941 and died in 1975. Two other daughters, Sarah, born in 1943, and Jane, born in 1945, were born in [[Washington, D.C.]] while their father served in the production section of the research and development division of the Office of the [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|Quartermaster General]]. At the time of Chandler Robbins’s death, he was described as “assistant to the president in charge of research and development” for the Bates Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Obituary: Chandler Robbins|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/843302085.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+3%2C+1955&amp;author=&amp;pub=Daily+Boston+Globe+%281928-1960%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Chandler+Robbins+2d|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=June 3, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Years at Eastern Point, Gloucester, Massachusetts ==
After renting summer houses on Gloucester for many years, Sarah Fraser's maternal aunt Myra Tutt purchased a house on Aileen Terrace, Eastern Point in 1928. At her death in 1946, Miss Tutt bequeathed the house on the harbor to her niece. For almost ten years, until Chandler Robbins’s death, the family spent summers in Gloucester and the school year in Auburn. Immediately after her husband’s death, Mrs. Robbins moved into the Eastern Point house and lived there all year round until her death in 2002.&lt;ref name=garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Joseph|title=Eastern Point: A Nautical, Rustical, and More or Less Sociable Chronicle of Gloucester’s Outer Shield and Inner Sanctum, 1606-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HT4DAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Eastern+Point:+A+Nautical,+Rustical,+and+Social+Chronicle+of+Gloucester%E2%80%99s+Outer+Shield+and+Inner+Sanctum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0QM7VMijLcWYyASTx4KwDA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA|date=January 1, 1971|publisher=Commonwealth Editions|isbn=978-1-88983-307-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah’s greatest friend and traveling companion was Dorothy Addams Brown, a summer and later full-time resident of Eastern Point. Dotty was born in Boston in 1923 and died in Gloucester in 2014. Addams Brown was the first woman vice president of the [[Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Obituary: Dorothy Addams "Dotty" Brown|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/1511654020.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+30%2C+2014&amp;author=Boston&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Dorothy+Addams+%22Dotty%22+Brown|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
									
== Years with the Peabody Museum of Salem ==
In 1956 Robbins began her volunteer work at the Peabody Museum of Salem, now the [[Peabody Essex Museum]]. This was the beginning of twenty-five years of work at the Museum. In 1958, she first appears in the annual report of the director of the Peabody Museum, Ernest Dodge. In that year she was a volunteer working under Dorothy Snyder on the renovation of the "Mammals of Essex County" exhibit. In 1961, she was made Honorary Curator of Natural History. In 1971, she was made the first Director of Education of the Museum. The position was made possible by an anonymous donation. In 1981, she is listed as Director Emerita. She was then 70 years old.

While working at the museum in 1971, she gave an introduction to Physical Geology, a 6-session presentation on the “Living Landscape of Essex County,” and a 2-session in-service teacher training at the Massachusetts Audubon center in Gloucester on the physical geology of [[Essex County, Massachusetts]], including the sea shore.
						
In 1972, she gave a 12-session lecture course, “How to Look at the Landscape,” and two 6-session courses on “At the Edge of the Tide” and “Living Landscapes of Essex County,” as well as lectures on [[whaling]] and [[Alaska]].

In 1973, she and Clarice Yentsch co-authored ''The Sea is All About Us'', a guidebook to the marine environments of [[Cape Ann]] and other northern [[New England]] waters.

In 1974, she ran a 5-week marine science program for almost one hundred children of Gloucester and neighboring [[Rockport, Massachusetts]], overseeing a staff of eight teachers.

In 1975, she presided over a symposium at [[Harvard University]] of the [[National Association of Underwater Instructors]]. She also led geology field trips by bus and whale watches by boat. She re-ran the previous year's program for Gloucester school children.

In 1976, she spent some time in [[New Guinea]]; she became editor of ''Aquasphere'', the magazine of the [[New England Aquarium]]; and she gave a 4-session course in [[Oceanography]] for the [[United States Power Squadrons]].

In 1977, she was involved in planning a course on the environment with the extension service of the [[University of Massachusetts]], and also started planning a “Discovery Room” for the Peabody Museum.

In 1978 and 1979, she was the naturalist aboard the schooner Harvey Gamage on week-long cruises among the [[Virgin Islands]]. She also ran seminars for elementary school teachers at [[Salem State College]]. After 1978, the museum director ceased detailing her activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Reports of the Director, 1958-1981|publisher=Peabody Museum of Salem|date=1958–1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins retired in July 1981. During all her years at the Peabody Museum (which became the Peabody Essex Museum in 1992), she provided for the professional development of teachers to take leadership roles. By the end of her tenure, the museum's Education Department was providing programs for over thirty thousand children and nine thousand adults annually.

In 2003, in her memory, the Peabody Essex Museum established the Sarah Fraser Robbins Directorship of the new Art &amp; Nature Center. This center features original exhibits that investigate the interconnection between people and nature through contemporary art, historical objects and interactive experiences.

== Contributions to the improvement of the environment of Gloucester ==
In 1961, Robbins, with other Eastern Point residents, prevailed upon members of the Raymond family to give what ultimately became almost forty acres of land on Eastern Point to the Massachusetts Audubon Society.&lt;ref name=garland/&gt;

In 1978, Robbins, her daughter Sarah, and Philip Weld, Jr. swam almost a mile and a half in the open water of Gloucester Harbor to protest the ongoing pollution of the harbor waters. Every year since then, open water swimmers have commemorated that swim; 2014 is the 36th annual swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.active.com/gloucester-ma/water-sports/swimming-races/36th-annual-celebrate-the-clean-harbor-swim-2014|accessdate=October 12, 2014|title=36th Annual Celebrate the Clean Harbor Swim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current course is about 1.2 miles out and back in the harbor. Until 1993, the swim was sponsored by the Massachusetts Audubon Society. In that year its name was changed to “Celebrate the Clean Harbor,” since the conditions had immensely improved. The Weld family sponsored a harbor cleanup research and monitoring program under the auspices of the Massachusetts Society to ensure that the federal funding necessary that the program was spent wisely.&lt;ref name=garland/&gt; Currently, the race is sponsored by the New England Marathon Swimming Association. Robbins swam it for many years, and her daughter Sarah has succeeded her.

In 1970, the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] bought the defunct Consolidated Lobster Company buildings at Hodgkins Cove on the northwest side of Cape Ann to set up a marine research station to study the “basic productivity of marine water.” &lt;ref name=seaabout&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Sarah|last2=Yentsch|first2=Clarice|title=The Sea Is All About Us|publisher=Peabody Museum of Salem|isbn=978-0875770468}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Charles Yentsch arrived to serve as the director, and brought his wife Clarice. Clarice Yentsch, familiar only with the ecosystems of southern waters, sought out Robbins to teach her about northern New England waters. In late June, 1974, the Yentsches resigned, and they, with most of their team of researchers and the research vessel R. V. Bigelow, moved to [[Boothbay, Maine]] where they established the [[Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences]].

Maritime Gloucester, formerly the Gloucester Maritime Heritage Center, is located on the Gloucester waterfront. The education center at Maritime Gloucester, formally the Sarah Fraser Robbins Marine Science Center, was dedicated November 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maritimegloucester.org/about/history|accessdate=July 12, 2014|title=History: Maritime Gloucester}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 2014, Maritime Gloucester presented the first Sarah Fraser Robbins Environmental Award to Dr. Molly Lutcavage, director of research at the University of Massachusetts Large Pelagics Research Center–in absentia, because she was in Hawaii establishing a cooperative satellite tuna tagging project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/lutcavage-receives-first-sarah-fraser|accessdate=October 12, 2014|title=Lutcavage Receives First Sarah Fraser Robbins Environmental Award from Maritime Gloucester}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the occasion of the formal launch of a re-edition of the book ''The Sea is All About Us'', which Robbins and Clarice Yentsch had co-authored in 1973.&lt;ref name=seaabout/&gt;

== Publications ==
Robbins had a regular column, “The Curious Naturalist,” which appeared in the magazines of the Massachusetts Audubon Society. She contributed articles between 1958 and 1971, almost all on the creatures of the littoral zone of Gloucester.

In 1973, she was the senior author of a book, co-authored by Clarice Yentsch, entitled ''The Sea is All About Us'', which was based on fifty of the articles that Sarah had contributed to the Audubon Society’s magazine with added material. It was jointly published by the Peabody Museum and the Cape Ann Society for Marine Science.&lt;ref name=seaabout/&gt;
						
She also published articles on the seashore in Aquasphere, the journal of the New England Aquarium, and many small, regional journals concerned with the environment.
 
== Legacy ==
The guidebook and the two education centers are concrete reminders of Robbins's legacy as a provider of programs which brought natural history to thousands of people. She was an early example of a “citizen scientist.” The Sarah Fraser Robbins Environmental Award, first given by Maritime Gloucester in 2014, is established in her name to commemorate this legacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2655">'''Silicon drift detectors''' ('''SDD'''s) are X-ray radiation detectors used in x-ray spectrometry ([[X-ray_fluorescence|XRF]] and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDS]]) and [[electron microscopy]]. Their chief characteristics compared with other X-ray detectors are:
*high count rates
*comparatively high energy resolution (e.g. 125 eV for Mn Kα wavelength)
*[[Peltier cooling]]

==Working principle==
Like other solid state X-ray detectors, silicon drift detectors measure the energy of an incoming photon by the amount of ionization it produces in the detector material. This varying ionization produces varying charge, which the detector electronics measure for each incoming photon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxford-instruments.com/OxfordInstruments/media/nanoanalysis/brochures%20and%20thumbs/OI_AppNote_SDD_Explained_1.pdf/ Silicon Drift Detectors Explained, Oxford Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt; In the SDD, this material is high purity silicon with a very low leakage current. The high purity allows for the use of [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier|Peltier]] cooling instead of the traditional liquid nitrogen. The major distinguishing feature of a SDD is the transversal field generated by a series of ring electrodes that causes charge carriers to 'drift' to a small collection electrode. The 'drift' concept of the SDD (which was imported from particle physics) allows significantly higher count rates coupled with a very low capacitance of the detector.

In older detector designs, the collection electrode is centrally located with an external FET ([[field effect transistor]]) to convert the current into a voltage and thus represents the first stage of amplification. Newer designs integrate the FET directly into the chip, which greatly improves energy resolution and throughput. This is due to the reduction of capacitance between anode and FET, which reduces electronic noise.

Other designs move the anode and FET outside of the irradiated area. This causes a slightly longer response time, which leads to a slightly lower throughput (750,000 counts per second instead of 1,000,000). However, due to the smaller anode size, this leads to better energy resolutions (down to 123 eV for Mn Kα wavelength). Combined with improved or adapted signal processing, it is possible to maintain the [[silicon]] drift detector's energy resolution up to 100,000 counts per second.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ketek.net/sdd/technology/working-principle/ Function of silicon drift detector]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnsensor.de/Welcome/Detectors/SDD Silicon Drift Detector development]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the study of '''sonochemistry''' is concerned with understanding the effect of ultrasound in forming acoustic [[cavitation]] in liquids, resulting in the initiation or enhancement of the chemical activity in the solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |date=1990 |volume=247 |issue=4949 |pages=1439–45 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/247/4949/1439|doi=10.1126/science.247.4949.1439 |pmid=17791211 |title=Sonochemistry |last1=Suslick |first1=K. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Therefore, the chemical effects of ultrasound do not come from a
direct interaction of the ultrasonic sound wave with the molecules in the solution. Sound waves propagating through a liquid at ultrasonic frequencies do so with a wavelength that is dramatically longer than molecular dimensions or the bond length between atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the sound wave cannot affect that vibrational energy of the bond, and can therefore not directly increase the internal energy of a molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Suslick, K. S. "Sonochemistry," Science 1990, 247, 1439–1445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suslick, K. S.; Flannigan, D. J. “Inside a Collapsing Bubble, Sonoluminescence and Conditions
during Cavitation” Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2008, 59, 659–683.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, sonochemistry arises from acoustic [[cavitation]]: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid.&lt;ref name=Suslick1989&gt;Suslick, Kenneth S. (February 1989). The Chemical Effects of Ultrasound. ''Scientific American''. pp.62–68 (p.62)&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of these bubbles is an almost [[adiabatic]] process, thereby resulting in the massive build-up of energy inside the bubble, resulting in extremely high temperatures and pressures in a microscopic region of the sonicated liquid. The high temperatures and pressures result in the chemical excitation of any matter that was inside of, or in the immediate surroundings of the bubble as it rapidly imploded. A broad variety of outcomes can result from acoustic cavitation, including sonoluminescence, increased chemical activity in the solution due to the formation of primary and secondary radical reactions, and increase chemical activity through the formation of new, relatively stable chemical species that can diffuse further into the solution to create chemical effects (for example, the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the combination of two hydroxyl radicals formed following the dissociation of water vapor inside the collapsing bubbles what water is exposed to ultrasound.

The influence of sonic waves traveling through liquids was first reported by Robert Williams Wood (1868–1955) and Alfred Lee Loomis (1887–1975) in 1927. The experiment was about the frequency of the energy that it took for sonic waves to "penetrate" the barrier of water. He came to the conclusion that sound does travel faster in water, but because of the water's density compared to our earth's atmosphere it was incredibly hard to get the sonic waves into the water. After lots of research they decided that the best way to disperse sound into the water was to make loud noises into the water by creating bubbles that were made at the same time as the sound. One of the easier ways that they put sound into the water was they simply yelled. But another road block they ran into was the ratio of the amount of time it took for the lower frequency waves to penetrate the bubbles walls and access the water around the bubble, and then time from that point to the point on the other end of the body of water. But despite the revolutionary ideas of this article it was left mostly unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, R.W.; Loomis, A.L. The Physical and Biological Effects of High Frequency Sound Waves of Great Intensity. Phil. Mag. 1927, 4, 414.&lt;/ref&gt;   Sonochemistry experienced a renaissance in the 1980s with the advent of inexpensive and reliable generators of high-intensity ultrasound.&lt;ref name="Suslick1989"/&gt;

Upon irradiation with high intensity sound or ultrasound, acoustic cavitation usually occurs.  Cavitation – the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles irradiated with sound — is the impetus for sonochemistry and sonoluminescence.&lt;ref name="Leighton, T.G. The Acoustic Bubble 1994, pp.531-555"&gt;Leighton, T.G. The Acoustic Bubble; Academic Press: London, 1994, pp.531–555.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bubble collapse in liquids produces enormous amounts of energy from the conversion of kinetic energy of the liquid motion into heating the contents of the bubble.  The compression of the bubbles during cavitation is more rapid than thermal transport, which generates a short-lived localized hot-spot.  Experimental results have shown that these bubbles have temperatures around 5000 K, pressures of roughly 1000 atm, and heating and cooling rates above 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; K/s.&lt;ref&gt;Suslick, K.S.; Hammerton, D.A.; Cline, R.E., Jr.  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  1986, 108, 5641.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flint, E.B.; Suslick, K.S. Science. 1991, 253, 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;  These cavitations can create extreme physical and chemical conditions in otherwise cold liquids.

With liquids containing solids, similar phenomena may occur with exposure to ultrasound.  Once cavitation occurs near an extended solid surface, cavity collapse is nonspherical and drives high-speed jets of liquid to the surface.&lt;ref name="Leighton, T.G. The Acoustic Bubble 1994, pp.531-555"/&gt;  These jets and associated shock waves can damage the now highly heated surface.  Liquid-powder suspensions produce high velocity interparticle collisions.  These collisions can change the surface morphology, composition, and reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Suslick, K.S.; Doktycz, S.J. Adv. Sonochem. 1990, 1, 197–230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three classes of sonochemical reactions exist: homogeneous sonochemistry of liquids, heterogeneous sonochemistry of liquid-liquid or solid–liquid systems, and, overlapping with the aforementioned, sonocatalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn, C.; Einhorn, J. Luche, J.L. Synthesis 1989, 787.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luche, J.L.; Compets. Rendus. Serie. IIB 1996, 323, 203, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pestman, J.M.; Engberts, J.B.F.N.; de Jong, F. Jong. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1994, 113, 533.&lt;/ref&gt;   Sonoluminescence is a consequence of the same cavitation phenomena that is responsible for homogeneous sonochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, L.A. Physics Today 1994, 47, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Putterman, S.J. Sci. Am. February 1995, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suslick, K. S.; Flannigan, D. J. "Inside a Collapsing Bubble: Sonoluminescence and the Conditions during Cavitation" Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2008, 59, 659-683.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical enhancement of reactions by ultrasound has been explored and has beneficial applications in mixed phase synthesis, materials chemistry, and biomedical uses.  Because cavitation can only occur in liquids, chemical reactions are not seen in the ultrasonic irradiation of solids or solid–gas systems.

For example, in [[chemical kinetics]], it has been observed that ultrasound can greatly enhance chemical reactivity in a number of systems by as much as a million-fold;&lt;ref&gt;Suslick, K.S.; Casadonte, D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 3459.&lt;/ref&gt; effectively acting to activate heterogenous catalysts. In addition, in reactions at liquid-solid interfaces, ultrasound breaks up the solid pieces and exposes active clean surfaces through microjet pitting from cavitation near the surfaces and from fragmentation of solids by cavitation collapse nearby. This gives the solid reactant a larger surface area of active surfaces for the reaction to proceed over, increasing the observed rate of reaction. &lt;ref&gt;Zeiger, B. W.; Suslick, K. S. "Sonofragmentation of Molecular Crystals" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 14530-14533.&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hinman, J. J.; Suslick, K. S. "Nanostructured Materials Synthesis Using Ultrasound" Top. Curr. Chem., 2017, 375, 1-36. DOI: 10.1007/s41061-016-0100-9&lt;/ref&gt;

While the application of ultrasound often generates mixtures of products, a paper published in 2007 in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' described the use of ultrasound to selectively affect a certain [[cyclobutane]] ring-opening reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] | title = Brute Force Breaks Bonds | date = 22 March 2007 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i13/8513notw4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atul Kumar (chemist)|Atul Kumar]] has reported multicomponent reaction Hantzsch ester synthesis in Aqueous Micelles using ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;Atul Kumar, R.A.Muarya SYNLETT 1987, 109, 3459.https://www.organic-chemistry.org/abstracts/lit2/076.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some water pollutants, especially chlorinated organic compounds, can be destroyed sonochemically.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Garcia, J, Saez, V., Tudela, I., Diez-Garcia, M.I., Esclapez, M.D., Louisnard, O., (2010) Sonochemical Treatment of Water Polluted by Chlorinated Organocompounds. A Review. Water 2(1), 28–74. http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/2/1/28/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonochemistry can be performed by using a bath (usually used for [[ultrasound|ultrasonic cleaning]]) or with a high power probe, called an [[ultrasonic horn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4701">The '''Southeast Australia temperate savanna''' [[ecoregion]] is a large area of grassland dotted with [[eucalyptus]] trees running north-south across central [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

==Location and description==
It is a dry area of low hills and valleys of which the southern section is the wheat-growing plain known as the [[Riverina]] and the northern section is low hills and plains mostly used for grazing sheep running north to the plains of the [[Murray-Darling basin|Darling River basin]] and the New South Wales–[[Queensland]] border. Rivers of the savanna include the [[Murray River]] and the [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] in the south and the [[Darling River]] in the north. Rainfall is low and irregular, from 300–500&amp;nbsp;mm per year becoming less the further westward and inland you go.

==Flora==
The dry climate sustains hardy shrubs and grasses scattered with small patches of the [[Eucalyptus populnea|bimble box]] and [[Eucalyptus coolabah|coolibah]] eucalyptus trees that once covered most of this part of Australia. The Riverina area nearer the coast contains [[Eucalyptus camaldulensis|red river gum]] and [[Eucalyptus largiflorens|black box]].

The effect of massive numbers of sheep on the grassland was dramatic and was noted by settlers in the grassland regions. The original soil of the grasslands was soft and absorbed rain readily, but heavy continuous stock grazing drove a degradation sequence that shifted the botanical composition of native grasslands from an ecosystem regulated by large, perennial tussock grasses such as Themeda triandra (Kangaroo Grass) to one containing abundant disturbance tolerant native grasses such as Rytidosperma spp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Land of Sweeping Plains |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/20/pid/7219.htm |editor1=Williams, Nicholas |editor2=Marshall, Adrian |editor3=Morgan, John |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |year=2015 |isbn=9781486300815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
These grasslands are the western limit for much of the wildlife that lives here as further west is desert. Wildlife of the savanna includes mammals such as the mouse-like [[kultarr]] marsupial (''Antechinomys laniger''), [[tiger quoll]] (''Dasyurus maculatus''), and [[brush-tailed rock-wallaby]] (''Petrogale penicillata''). The [[western barred bandicoot]] (''Perameles bougainville fasciata'') and [[bridled nail-tail wallaby]] that once lived here are now presumed extinct in New South Wales. Birds include the endangered [[bush stone-curlew]] (''Burhinus grallarius''), [[superb parrot]] (''Polytelis swainsonii''), [[red goshawk]] (''Erythrotriorchis radiatus''), [[malleefowl]] (''Leipoa ocellata'') and [[plains-wanderer]] (''Pedionomus torquatus''), and reptiles include an endangered [[skink]] ''[[Anomalopus mackayi]]''. The Riverina grasslands are home to birds such as the [[freckled duck]], and wintering populations of [[swift parrot]] (''Lathamus discolor'').

==Threats and preservation==
Active preservation of habitats is required because much of the savanna has been converted to pasture or wheatland. This is particularly so in the Riverina where most has been cleared for wheat planting, a process that is ongoing, while the grasslands are vulnerable to overgrazing, and rivers including the Murray and Murrumbidgee are depleted by being water sources for large irrigation projects. As land is cleared it becomes habitat for invasive species such as [[noisy miner]] bird (''Manorina melanophrys'') and [[Australian raven]] (''Corvus coronoides''). The main protected area is the steep volcanic outcrops of [[Warrumbungle National Park]]. There are small areas of parkland elsewhere and plans to create more,&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkins, D., D. Goldney, G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2475">A '''speed record''' is a [[world record]] for [[speed]] by a person, animal, or [[vehicle]]. The function of speed record is to record the speed of moving animate objects such as humans, animals or vehicles.

== Overall speed record ==
Overall speed record is the record for the highest average speed regardless of any criteria, categories or classes that all the more specific records belong to, provided that the route was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/526993-first-person-to-twice-hold-three-simultaneous-overall-ocean-rowing-speed-records|title=First person to twice hold three simultaneous overall ocean rowing speed records on different oceans|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps to compare various performances that differ by the type of the craft, vessel or vehicle, the departure and the arrival points (provided that the distances are comparable), number, age and gender of the crew members, departure date, etc. The distance used for calculating the overall speed record is usually the distance in a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanrowing.com/Blue_Riband_Trophy.htm|title=ocean rowing across Atlantic speed record|website=www.oceanrowing.com|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of man-powered races, overall speed record doesn't always reflect the best performance.

'''Toxic hotspots''' are locations where emissions from specific sources such as water or air pollution may expose local populations to elevated health risks, such as cancer.&lt;ref name=ARBglossary&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Air Pollution Terms|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/html/gloss.htm#hot|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emissions contribute to cumulative health risks of emissions from other sources nearby. Urban, highly populated areas around pollutant emitters such as old factories and waste storage sites are often toxic hotspots.

==Soil contamination hotspots==
The 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] in India, the world's worst chemical disaster, is a prime example of a significant toxic hotspot. The toxic gas leaked from the understaffed Union Carbide plant killed up to 20,000 people and left 120,000 others chronically ill.&lt;ref name="bhopaldisaster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/bhopal-disaster-still-unresolv/|title=Bhopal Disaster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhopal continues to face pollution problems from the abandoned factory today.

==Air pollution hotspots==
[[Air pollution]] hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air pollution hot spot|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/air-pollution-hot-spot.htm|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hotspots denote areas in which a population's exposure to pollution and estimated health risks are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Air Pollution Terms|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/air-pollution-hot-spot.htm|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air pollution hotspots are particularly common in highly populated, urban areas, where there may a combination of stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars and trucks) of pollution.  Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. A fine particulate matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each year, is a significant problem. It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pettit|first=David|title=Global Toll of Air Pollution: Over 3 Million Deaths Each Year|publisher=Switchboard NRDC|url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|date=14 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061609/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|archivedate=8 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations, some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income (cite one of the early readings from our syllabus, e.g. Mohai &amp; Pellow, or Saha). Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of [[social vulnerability]], including race, a lack of ability to influence regulatory permitting and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.&lt;ref name="Drury"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drury|first=Richard|last2=Belliveau|first2=Michael|last3=Kuhn|first3=J Scott|last4=Shipra|first4=Bansal|title=Pollution Trading and Environmental Justice: Los Angeles' Failed Experiment in Air Pollution Policy|journal=Duke Environmental Law &amp; Policy Forum|date=Spring 1999|volume=9|issue=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Morello-Frosch 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morello-Frosch|first=Rachel|last2=Zuk|first2=Miriam|last3=Jerrett|first3=Michael|last4=Shamasunder|first4=Bhavna|last5=Kyle|first5=Amy D.|title=Understanding the Cumulative Impacts of Inequalities in Environmental Health: Implications for Policy|journal=Health Affairs|date=2011|volume=30| doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0153|pages=879–887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities.&lt;ref name="Morello-Frosch 2011"/&gt; Blacks and Latinos generally face more pollution than whites and Asians, and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones.&lt;ref name="Drury"/&gt; Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the South and metropolitan areas of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Mohai et al.|title=Racial and Socioeocnomic Disparities in Residential Proximity|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=2009|volume=99|issue=3|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.131383|pages=S649–S656|pmid=19890171|pmc=2774179 | last1 = Mohai | first1 = P | last2 = Lantz | first2 = PM | last3 = Morenoff | first3 = J | last4 = House | first4 = JS | last5 = Mero | first5 = RP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Residents in public housing, who are generally low-income with poor access to health care and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods, are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lerner|first=Steve|chapter=Port Arthur, Texas: Public Housing Residents Breathe Contaminated Air from Nearby Refineries and Chemical Plants|title=Sacrifice Zones: The Front Lines of Toxic Chemical Exposure in the United States|publisher=MIT Press|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community groups and academic researchers have argued the unequal distribution of pollution on the poor and communities of color is an “[[environmental justice]]”.

Policy makers and researchers concerned with improving environmental justice for communities situated next to major sources of air pollution have developed a number of regulatory tools to identify air pollution hotspots. The EPA, for example, utilizes their Risk-Screening Environmental Indictors (RSEI) model to identify hotspots from a score of 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating closer proximity to hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment|url=http://epa.gov/riskassessment/basicinformation.htm#arisk|accessdate=20 April 2014|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual states have also taken steps to improve identification and surveillance. California's AB 2588 Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Program, enacted in 1987, seeks to collect emission data, determine health risks, and notify local residents of major risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Air Toxics "Hot Spots" Information and Assessment Act|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/ab2588/overview.htm|date=9 October 2013|publisher=California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; By identifying hotspots regulators hope these tools will help them reduce pollution and inform nearby populations through the health risk assessments of individual pollutants and facilities that are summed in each zone to develop a total lifetime cancer risk.
Air pollution hot spots are also at issue in pollution-trading programs, such as [[cap-and-trade]] systems designed to control pollution. These programs can potentially exacerbate effects from air pollution hotspots if the differences in chemical hazards are ignored. These programs also cause pollution to be mitigated towards where credit-buying firms are located.&lt;ref name="Drury"/&gt; Factories can purchase emissions reduction credits from other firms, which leads to concentrated areas of pollution since facilities that sell their credits are “exporting” their pollution to firms more likely to buy credits. However, some studies have noted that these claims have not materialized. Evan Ringquist, a professor at Indiana University of Public and Environmental Affairs, states that there is little empirical evidence to suggest the emergence of hotspots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Indiana University|title=Emissions trading doesn't cause pollution 'hot spots,' study finds|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110330094008.htm|date=23 May 2011|publisher=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Oakland, California===
Located in the East [[San Francisco Bay]], the neighborhood of [[West Oakland]] is home to mainly low-income African American and Latino residents who are exposed to a disproportionate amount of airborne toxins as compared to the rest of the surrounding [[Alameda County]]. West Oakland's close proximity to highways and the Port of Oakland leave residents highly exposed to pollutants caused by moving and stationary sources of diesel pollution, thus leaving them at higher risk for health complications such as [[asthma]] and even shorter life expectancy than surrounding neighborhoods averages.&lt;ref name="Pastor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pastor|first=Manuel|title=Still Toxic After All These Years|url=http://cjtc.ucsc.edu/docs/bay_final.pdf|publisher=Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High emissions of toxic chemicals and airborne particulate matter in West Oakland that cause health issues are due to diesel fuels used for transportation in the [[Port of Oakland]] and surrounding highways. Traffic and transportation-related air pollutants include [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[black carbon]], and diesel [[particulate matter]].&lt;ref name="Gonzalez 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Priscilla|author2=Meredith Minkler |title=Community-Based Participatory Research and Policy Advocacy to Reduce Diesel Exposure in West Oakland, California|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=2011|volume=101|issue=S1|doi=10.2105/ajph.2010.196204|pages=S166–S175|pmid=21551381|pmc=3222507}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Residents are more exposed to harmful pollutants compared to other areas of the Bay Area and Oakland and therefore more at risk for harmful health effects. Compared to the State of California, West Oakland produces 90 times more diesel emission particulates per square mile per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palaniappan|first=Meena|title=Clearing the Air: Reducing Diesel Pollution in West Oakland|url=http://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2013/02/clearing_the_air_final3.pdf|publisher=Pacific Institute|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pollutants have detrimental health effects such as asthma and reduced life expectancy while putting children at higher susceptibility for health complications.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez 2011"/&gt;

Inequitable economic, residential, and environmental conditions in this low-income community of color leave residents of West Oakland with poor and inequitable health outcomes. African-American and Latino children of 10–18 years in West Oakland are more susceptible to onset lung defects such as asthma.&lt;ref name="Pastor"/&gt;  According to Alameda County Vital Statistics, an African American child born in West Oakland is expected to live 14 fewer years than a white child born in the more wealthy [[Oakland Hills]].&lt;ref name=" Gonzalez 2011"/&gt; Children 5 and under in west Oakland visit the emergency room for asthma three times more often than children in the county as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancing environmental justice in the Bay Area|url=http://sfbay.sierraclub.org/environment/environmental-justice.htm|publisher=Sierra Club: San Francisco Bay Chapter|accessdate=30 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330194748/http://sfbay.sierraclub.org/environment/environmental-justice.htm#|archive-date=2014-03-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple efforts and strategies to spur legislation for equitable environmental conditions in low-income communities. There are many [[environmental justice]] groups and organizations in the Bay Area that encourage community participation in pursuing environmental justice. For example, data is collected by a [[Community-based participatory research]] (CBPR) and collaborated with West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project (WOEIP) in order to find effective and accurate findings to prove injustice and eventually spur reform in environmental policy. These research efforts can be used to document and communicate trends in air quality in West Oakland to policymakers.&lt;ref name=" Gonzalez 2011"/&gt; Effectiveness of efforts by these groups are multiplied by and increasing availability of environmental poverty lawyers who empower legislation in the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Luke|title=Empowerment as the Key to Environmental Protection: The Need for Environmental Poverty Law|journal=Ecology Law Quarterly|date=1992|volume=19:619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richmond, California===

[[Richmond, California|Richmond]], located in the San Francisco Bay Area, is an evolving, multi-cultural community that has transformed itself from an over-polluted industrial town to a pioneer in an environmental justice movement.

Because Richmond is an air pollution hotspot, Richmond residents have applied different strategies since the 1980s to try to improve local air quality. The first EJ movement in the area started in the late 1980s, when the activist tried to stop construction of a garbage incinerator near North Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='We are Richmond.'

The “sniffers” alert the “samplers” to collect the air samples when they notice a problem. The “samplers” then contact the Coordinator to check the bucket and perform the paperwork before submitting the samples to the Laboratory, in which the results will be reported to CBE, an environmental justice organization. The “Bucket Brigades” did not only raise the awareness local citizens to fight against the air pollution in their area but also their participation.&lt;ref name=dara&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'rourke|first=Dara|author2=Gregg P.

As the number of activists and participants grew in numbers, their position in the battle against environmental injustice was further fortified with the election Green-party mayor of Richmond, Gayle McLaughlin, as well as three new council members sympathetic to their cause in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We are Richmond.

Due to great forces from the local communities and fellow EJ activists in Richmond area, Chevron has been making progress to embrace cleaner environment. In 2005, local activists managed to convince [[Bay Area Air Quality Management District]] to tighten the air pollution regulations by increasing the frequency of fines of facility incidents.&lt;ref name=dara/&gt; Since then, Chevron has been [[Gas flare|flaring]] 10 times less than before.&lt;ref name=manuel&gt;{{cite web|title=Still toxic after all these years|accessdate=30 April 2014|author=Manuel Pastor|author2=James Sadd |author3=Rachel Morello-Frosch |url=http://cjtc.ucsc.edu/docs/bay_final.pdf|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of that, Chevron has invested $150 million for building gas turbine in order to reduce air emission, increase energy efficiency, as well as provide most electrical and steam power Chevron requires to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment|url=http://richmond.chevron.com/home/environmentandsafety/environment.aspx|publisher=Chevron Richmond|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilmington, most of its residents are ethnic minorities, is possible to bear more environmental burden than other communities in Los Angeles because it is located next to several sources of air pollution. For example, Wilmington has "the highest concentration of refineries in the State". Emissions from refineries in Wilmington include [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[benzene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board|title=Community Air Quality Monitoring: Special Studies Wilmington|journal=California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board|date=November 2013|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/ch/reports/wilmington_sb25_report.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilmington has higher concentration of [[diesel particulate matter]] due to emissions from diesel trucks from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di|first=Pingkuan|title=Diesel Particulate Matter Exposure Assessment Study for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach|journal=California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board|date=April 2006|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/ports/marinevess/documents/portstudy0406.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risks associated with diesel are often underestimated since existing epidemiological studies cannot isolate exposure to diesel PM.&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"/&gt; However, exposure to diesel particulate matter can cause “irritation to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs”, asthma, “exhaust immunological effects”, and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diesel Particulate Matter|url=http://www.epa.gov/region1/eco/airtox/diesel.html|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groundwater contamination==
The town of [[Hinkley, California]], located in the [[Mojave Desert]], had its [[groundwater]] contaminated with [[hexavalent chromium]] starting in 1952, resulting in a legal case against [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] (PG&amp;E) and a multimillion-dollar settlement in 1996. The legal case was dramatized in the film ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', released in 2000.

PG&amp;E operates a [[compressor station]] in Hinkley for natural gas transmission pipelines. The natural gas has to be re-compressed approximately every {{convert|350|mi|km}}, and the station uses large cooling towers to cool the gas after it has been compressed.
[http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb6/water_issues/projects/pge/index.shtml Between 1952 and 1966], the water used in these cooling towers contained hexavalent chromium – now recognized as a [[carcinogen]] – to prevent rust in the machinery. The water was stored between uses in unlined ponds, which allowed it to percolate into the groundwater.  This severely contaminated the groundwater, affecting soil and contaminating water wells near the compressor station, with a plume  approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} long and nearly {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb6/water_issues/projects/pge/index.shtml PG&amp;E Hinkley Chromium Cleanup] California Environmental Protection Agency, 9/10/08&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Proving Grounds===
{{Main|Pacific Proving Grounds}}
[[File:Bravo fallout2.png|right|thumb|The [[Castle Bravo]] test of 1954 spread [[nuclear fallout]] across the [[Marshall Islands]], parts of which were still inhabited.]]
The Pacific Proving Grounds was the name used to describe a number of sites in the [[Marshall Islands]] and a few other sites in the [[Pacific Ocean]], used by the [[United States]] to conduct [[nuclear testing]] at various times between 1946 and 1962. In July 1947, after the first atomic weapons testing at [[Bikini Atoll]], the United States entered into an agreement with the [[United Nations]] to govern the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] as a strategic [[United Nations trust territory|trusteeship territory]]. The Trust Territory is composed of 2,000 islands spread over {{convert|3000000|sqmi|km2}} of the [[North Pacific Ocean]].  On July 23, 1947, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] announced the establishment of the Pacific Proving Grounds.&lt;ref&gt;McDougal, Myres S. and Schlei, Norbert A. "The Hydrogen Bomb Tests in Perspective: Lawful Measures for Security". In Myres S. McDougal, et al. (1987), ''Studies in World Public Order'', p. 766. New Haven: New Haven Press. {{ISBN|0-89838-900-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

105 [[atmospheric]] (i.e., not [[underground nuclear test|underground]]) [[nuclear test]]s were conducted there, many of which were of extremely high yield. While the Marshall Islands testing composed 14% of all U.S. tests, it composed nearly 80% of the total yields of those detonated by the U.S., with an estimated total yield of around 210 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]], with the largest being the 15 Mt [[Castle Bravo]] shot of 1954 which spread considerable [[nuclear fallout]] on many of the islands, including several which were inhabited, and some that had not been evacuated.&lt;ref name="GREEN"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/mejato.htm The evacuation of Rongelap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213074238/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/mejato.htm |date=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the islands which were part of the Pacific Proving Grounds continue to be contaminated by [[nuclear fallout]], and many of those who were living on the islands at the time of testing has suffered from an increased incidence of various health problems. Through the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] of 1990, at least [[United States dollar|$]]759 million has been paid to Marshall Islanders as compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing. Following the Castle Bravo accident, $15.3 million was paid to [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brook.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/50.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307133445/https://www.brookings.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/50.htm |archivedate=2006-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nevada Test Site===
{{Main|Nevada Test Site}}
[[File:NNSA-NSO-787.jpg|thumb|Mushroom cloud from the Nevada Test Site seen from downtown Las Vegas.]]

The Nevada Test Site (NTS), is a [[United States Department of Energy]] reservation located in southeastern [[Nye County]], [[Nevada]], about 65 miles (105&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of the city of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Formerly known as the '''Nevada Proving Grounds''',&lt;ref name="DOE/NV-1024"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/factsheets/DOENV_1024.pdf |title=Miss Atom Bomb |author=National Nuclear Security Administration / Nevada Site Office |date=January 2011 |work=Fact Sheets |accessdate=2011-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303003053/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/factsheets/DOENV_1024.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the site was established on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1951 for the testing of [[nuclear device]]s, covering approximately {{convert|1,360|sqmi}} of desert and mountainous terrain. [[Nuclear test]]ing at the Nevada Test Site began with a {{convert|1|ktonTNT|adj=on}} bomb dropped on [[Frenchman Flat]] on 27&amp;nbsp;January 1951. Many of the iconic images of the nuclear era come from the NTS.

During the 1950s, the [[mushroom cloud]]s from atmospheric tests could be seen for almost {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}}. The city of [[Las Vegas]] experienced noticeable seismic effects, and the distant mushroom clouds, which could be seen from the downtown hotels, became tourist attractions. [[St. George, Utah]], received the brunt of the fallout of above-ground [[nuclear testing]] in the Yucca Flats/Nevada Test Site. Winds routinely carried the fallout of these tests directly through St. George and southern Utah. Marked increases in [[cancer]]s, such as leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers, were reported from the mid-1950s through 1980.&lt;ref name="jama1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Carl|year=1984|title=Cancer Incidence in an Area of Radioactive Fallout Downwind From the Nevada Test Site|journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]|doi=10.1001/jama.1984.03340260034023|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/251/2/230.short|volume=251|issue=2|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falk, Jim 1982 p. 134"&gt;Falk, Jim (1982). ''Global Fission:The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986 through 1994, two years after the United States put a hold on full-scale [[nuclear weapons testing]], 536 [[anti-nuclear]] protests were held at the Nevada Test Site involving 37,488 participants and 15,740 arrests, according to government records.&lt;ref name="elynews.com"&gt;[http://www.elynews.com/articles/2007/07/18/news/news04.txt Western Shoshone spiritual leader dies]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those arrested included the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] and the actors [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]].

The Nevada Test Site contains 28 areas, 1,100 buildings, 400 miles (640&amp;nbsp; km) of paved roads, 300 miles of unpaved roads, ten heliports, and two airstrips. The most recent test was a sub-critical test of the properties of [[plutonium]], conducted underground on December 7, 2012.

===Semipalatinsk Test Site===
{{Main|Semipalatinsk Test Site}}
The Semipalatinsk Test Site, also known as "The Polygon", was the primary testing venue for the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[nuclear weapons]]. It is located on the [[steppe]] in northeast [[Kazakhstan]] (then the [[Kazakh SSR]]), south of the valley of the [[Irtysh River]]. The scientific buildings for the test site were located around 150&amp;nbsp;km west of the town of [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] (later renamed Semey), near the border of [[East Kazakhstan Province]] and [[Pavlodar Province]] with most of the nuclear tests taking place at various sites further to the west and south, some as far as into [[Karagandy Province]].

The Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989 with little regard for their effect on the local people or environment. The full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by Soviet authorities and has only come to light since the test site closed in 1991.

From 1996 to 2012, a secret joint operation of Kazakh, Russian, and American nuclear scientists and engineers secured the waste plutonium in the tunnels of the mountains.&lt;ref name="belfer"&gt;[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/23327/plutonium_mountain.html Plutonium Mountain: Inside the 17-Year Mission to Secure a Legacy of Soviet Nuclear Testing], [[Eben Harrell]] &amp; [[David E.

'''''Triplochiton scleroxylon''''' is a [[tree]] of the genus ''[[Triplochiton]]'' of the family ''[[Malvaceae]]''. The [[timber]] is known by the common names '''African whitewood''', '''abachi''', '''obeche''' in [[Nigeria]], '''wawa''' in [[Ghana]], '''ayous''' in [[Cameroon]] and '''sambawawa''' in [[Ivory Coast]]. 

==Description==
The species is distributed around the tropical areas of [[Western Africa]]. Trees grow to 20-60m tall with a 1-1.5m wide trunk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wood-database.com/obeche/ Obeche - The Wood Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The timber yielded is typically pale yellow and is moderately soft and light for a hardwood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trada.co.uk/wood-species/obeche/ Wood Species Database: Obeche - TRADA]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abachi.JPG|thumb|left|Abachi wood]]
The timber is used in the manufacture of veneer, furniture, picture frames and mouldings. It is also used by [[guitar]] makers. ''[[Gibson]]'' and ''[[Fender Japan]]'' have used the wood to produce limited edition guitars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.talkbass.com/threads/fender-japan-jb75-in-ayus-obeche.1217390/ Fender Japan JB75 in Ayus/Obeche - TalkBass.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-USA/Les-Paul-Jr-Doublecut-Exclusive.aspx Gibson.com - Gibson Les Paul Jr Doublecut]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree is a host of the African silk moth, ''[[Anaphe venata]]'', whose caterpillars feed on the leaves and spin cocoons which are then used to make [[silk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://reforest-iita.org/home/93-the-african-whitewood-triplochiton-scleroxylon.html African whitewood (Triplochiton scleroxylon) - Reforet IITA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood is exploited in its natural habitat, a harvest that is unsustainable in some areas. However, it remains classed as 'least concern' on the IUCN Red List. &lt;ref name=iucn&gt;African Regional Workshop (Conservation &amp; Sustainable Management of Trees, Zimbabwe, July 1996). 1998.

[[File:Vidicon tube.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|vidicon tube (2/3 inch in diameter)]]
'''Video camera tubes''' were devices based on the [[cathode ray tube]] that were used to capture [[television]] images prior to the introduction of [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digicamhistory.com/1980_1983.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digicamhistory.com/1984_1985.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oldradio.com/archives/hardware/TV/RCA-TV.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s to the 1980s.

In these tubes, the [[cathode ray]] was scanned across an image of the scene to be broadcast. The resultant current was dependent on the brightness of the image on the target. The size of the striking ray was tiny compared to the size of the target, allowing 483 horizontal [[scan line]]s per image in the [[NTSC]] format, or 576 lines in [[PAL]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NTSC#Lines and refresh rate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cathode ray tube==
Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons, "[[cathode ray]]s", is known as a cathode ray tube (CRT). These are usually seen as display devices as used in television receivers and computer displays. The camera pickup tubes described in this article are also CRTs, but they display no image.&lt;ref name="CRT_CEST"&gt;"Cathode-ray tube." ''McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology.'' Third Ed., Sybil P. Parker, ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1992, pp. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early research==
In June 1908, the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published a letter in which [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]], fellow of the [[Royal Society]] ([[UK]]), discussed how a fully electronic television system could be realized by using [[cathode ray tube]]s (or "Braun" tubes, after its inventor, [[Karl Braun]]) as both imaging and display devices.&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the "real difficulties lie in devising an efficient transmitter", and that it was possible that "no photoelectric phenomenon at present known will provide what is required".&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the [[Germans|German]] Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1909.&lt;ref name="Dieckmann-CRT"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell-Swinton later expanded on his vision in a presidential address given to the Röntgen Society in November 1911. The photoelectric screen in the proposed transmitting device was a mosaic of isolated rubidium cubes.&lt;ref name="Swinton-Rontgen1"&gt;

In a letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some "not very successful experiments" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a [[cathode ray]] beam.&lt;ref name="Swinton_ET1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams succeeded in transmitting "very faint" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate, but much better images were obtained when the metal plate was covered with zinc sulphide or selenide,&lt;ref name="Miller-Strange"/&gt; or with aluminum or zirconium oxide treated with caesium.&lt;ref name="Iams-Rose-1937"/&gt; These experiments are the base of the future [[#Vidicon|vidicon]].

===Operation===
The [[optics|optical]] system of the image dissector focuses an image onto a photocathode mounted inside a high vacuum. As light strikes the photocathode, electrons are emitted in proportion to the intensity of the light (see [[photoelectric effect]]). The entire electron image is deflected and a scanning aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the photocathode to be captured by the detector at any given time. The output from the detector is an electric current whose magnitude is a measure of the brightness of the corresponding area of the image. The electron image is [[frequency|periodically]] deflected horizontally and vertically ("[[raster scan]]ning") such that the entire image is read by the detector many times per second, producing an electrical signal that can be conveyed to a [[video monitor|display device]], such as a CRT monitor, to reproduce the image.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keith&amp;Tsatsulin"/&gt;

The image dissector has no "[[capacitance|charge storage]]" characteristic; the vast majority of electrons emitted by the photocathode are excluded by the scanning aperture,&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; and thus wasted rather than being stored on a photo-sensitive target, as in the iconoscope or image orthicon (see below), which largely accounts for its low light sensitivity.

==Iconoscope==

[[File:Zworykin1931iconoscope.png|thumb|Diagram of the iconoscope, from Zworykin's 1931 patent]]
{{main article|Iconoscope}}
An iconoscope is a camera tube that projects an image on a special "[[capacitance|charge storage]]" plate containing a mosaic of electrically isolated photosensitive granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, somewhat analogous to the [[human eye]]'s [[retina]] and its arrangement of [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]]. Each photosensitive granule constitutes a tiny capacitor that accumulates and stores electrical charge in response to the light striking it. An [[electron beam]] periodically sweeps across the plate, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the light striking it between each discharge event.&lt;ref name="US2158259"&gt;{{cite web

The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or "camera" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by the Hungarian engineer [[Kálmán Tihanyi]] in the beginning of 1925.&lt;ref name="IEC_Tihanyi"&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=person&amp;item=75 "Kálmán Tihanyi (1897–1947)", ''IEC Techline'']{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2009-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges ("photoelectrons") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in [[Hungary]] in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed "Radioskop".&lt;ref name="Radioskop"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/kalman-tihanyis-1926-patent-application-radioskop/ "Kálmán Tihanyi's 1926 Patent Application 'Radioskop'"], ''Memory of the World'', United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), 2005, retrieved 2009-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application,&lt;ref name="IEC_Tihanyi"/&gt; Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930,&lt;ref name="abstract1928"&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_V3&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19301111&amp;CC=GB&amp;NR=313456A&amp;KC=A Tihanyi, Koloman, ''Improvements in television apparatus''].

In 1923, while employed by the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Russian-born American engineer [[Vladimir K.

The new video camera tube developed by Lubszynski, Rodda and McGee in 1934 was dubbed "the super-Emitron". This tube is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. It has an efficient [[photocathode]] that transforms the scene light into an electron image; the latter is then accelerated towards a target specially prepared for the emission of [[secondary electrons]]. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the [[secondary emission]] is stored in the granules. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image, discharging each granule, and producing an electronic signal like in the iconoscope.&lt;ref name="GB442666"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "image iconoscope" ("Superikonoskop" in Germany) was produced as a results of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the [[patent war]] between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their ''Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher'' (''Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television'') in Germany in 1925,&lt;ref name="DE450187"/&gt; two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States.&lt;ref name="US1773980"/&gt;

The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes.

===Operation===
The super-Emitron is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. The scene image is projected onto an efficient continuous-film semitransparent [[photocathode]] that transforms the scene light into a light-emitted electron image, the latter is then accelerated (and [[#Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes|focused]]) via electromagnetic fields towards a target specially prepared for the emission of [[secondary electrons]]. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced, and the resulting positive charge is proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the [[secondary emission]] is stored in the capacitor formed by the metallic granule and the common plate. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the scene light between each discharge event (as in the iconoscope).&lt;ref name="GB442666"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GB455123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GB475928"/&gt;

The image iconoscope is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. Therefore, secondary electrons are emitted from the surface of the isolating material when the electron image reaches the target, and the resulting positive charges are stored directly onto the surface of the isolated material.&lt;ref name="Vries"/&gt;

==Orthicon and CPS Emitron==
The original iconoscope was very noisy&lt;ref name="Winstor-media"/&gt; due to the secondary electrons released from the photoelectric mosaic of the charge storage plate when the scanning beam swept it across.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; An obvious solution was to scan the mosaic with a low-velocity electron beam which produced less energy in the neighborhood of the plate such that no secondary electrons were emitted at all. That is, an image is projected onto the photoelectric mosaic of a charge storage plate, so that positive charges are produced and stored there due to [[photoelectric effect|photo-emission]] and [[capacitance]], respectively. These stored charges are then "gently" discharged by a ''low-velocity electron scanning beam'', preventing the emission of secondary electrons.&lt;ref name="Burns-Blumlein"&gt;

''Low-velocity scanning beam'' tubes have several advantages; there are low levels of spurious signals and high efficiency of conversion of light into signal, so that the signal output is maximum. However, there are serious problems as well, because the electron beam "spreads" and accelerates in a direction parallel to the target when it scans the image's borders and corners, so that it produces secondary electrons and one gets an image that is well focused in the center but blurry in the borders.&lt;ref name="Rose-Iams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGee-review-television"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lubszynski and the [[EMI]] team were the first engineers in transmitting a clear and well focused image with such a tube.&lt;ref name="Abramson-Zworykin"/&gt; Another improvement is the use of a semitransparent charge storage plate. The scene image is then projected onto the back side of the plate, while the low-velocity electron beam scans the photoelectric mosaic at the front side. This configurations allows the use of a straight camera tube, because the scene to be transmitted, the charge storage plate, and the electron gun can be aligned one after the other.&lt;ref name="Webb3"/&gt;

The first fully functional low-velocity scanning beam tube, the CPS Emitron, was invented and demonstrated by the [[EMI]] team under the supervision of [[Isaac Shoenberg]]. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for ''television transmitting systems'' where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special [[control grid|grids]], a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away.&lt;ref name="GB446661"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GB446664"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US2182578"/&gt; The velocity and energy of the electrons in the scanning beam were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a low-velocity scanning beam tube was obtained.&lt;ref name="Burns-Blumlein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGee-Wilcock"&gt;

The image orthicon, (sometimes abbreviated IO) was common in American broadcasting from 1946 until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JMTnTBmt7F0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Abramson,+Albert,+The+History+of+Television,+1942+to+2000#v=onepage&amp;q=1968&amp;f=false Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000''], McFarland, 2003, p. 124. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of the [[#Image dissector|image dissector]] and the orthicon technologies, it replaced the [[#Iconoscope|iconoscope]] in the United States, which required a great deal of [[light]] to work adequately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Television |url=http://encarta.msn.com |work=Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2000 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=29 June 2012 |author=Staff |year=1997–2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWPcsSb?url=http://encarta.msn.com/ |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image orthicon tube was developed at RCA by Albert Rose, Paul K. Weimer, and Harold B. Law. It represented a considerable advance in the television field, and after further development work, RCA created original models between 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JMTnTBmt7F0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Abramson,+Albert,+The+History+of+Television,+1942+to+2000+orthicon#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000''], McFarland, 2003, pp. 7–8. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Defense Research Committee]] entered into a contract with RCA where the NDRC paid for its further development. Upon RCA's development of the more sensitive image orthicon tube in 1943, RCA entered into a production contract with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the first tubes being delivered in January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''Remington Rand Inc., v. U.S.'',
120 F. Supp. 912, 913 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; RCA began production of image orthicons for civilian use in the second quarter of 1946.&lt;ref name="AbramsonP18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aade.com/tubepedia/1collection/tubepedia1.htm aade.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129005531/http://www.aade.com/tubepedia/1collection/tubepedia1.htm |date=January 29, 2012}} RCA 2P23, One of the earliest image orthicons&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[#Iconoscope|iconoscope]] and the intermediate orthicon used capacitance between a multitude of small but discrete light sensitive collectors and an isolated signal plate for reading video information, the image orthicon employed direct charge readings from a continuous ''electronically charged'' collector. The resultant signal was immune to most extraneous signal "crosstalk" from other parts of the target, and could yield extremely detailed images. For instance, image orthicon cameras were still being used by [[NASA]] for capturing Apollo/Saturn rockets nearing orbit, although the television networks had phased the cameras out. Only they could provide sufficient detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html The University of Alabama] Telescopic Tracking of the Apollo Lunar Missions&lt;/ref&gt;

An image orthicon camera can take television pictures by candlelight because of the more ordered light-sensitive area and the presence of an electron multiplier at the base of the tube, which operated as a high-efficiency amplifier. It also has a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] light sensitivity curve similar to the [[human eye]]. However, it tends to [[lens flare|flare]] in bright light, causing a dark halo to be seen around the object; this anomaly is referred to as "[[blooming (CCD)|blooming]]" in the broadcast industry when image orthicon tubes were in operation.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/435563.pdf dtic.mil] Westinghouse Non-blooming Image Orthicon.&lt;/ref&gt; Image orthicons were used extensively in the early color television cameras, where the increased sensitivity of the tube was essential to overcome the very inefficient optical system of the camera.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0621683 oai.dtic.mil] Non-blooming Image Orthicon.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image orthocon tube was at one point colloquially referred to as an "Immy". [[Harry Lubcke]], the then-President of the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]], decided to have their award named after this nickname. Since the [[statuette]] was female, it was [[Feminization of language|feminized]] into "[[Emmy Award|Emmy]]".&lt;ref name="emmyOrigin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/academy/about/statuette |title=History of the Emmy Statuette |last=Parker |first=Sandra |date=August 12, 2013 |website=Emmys |publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation===
An image orthicon consists of three parts: a [[photocathode]] with an image store ("''target''"), a scanner that reads this image (an [[electron gun]]), and a multistage electron multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troysvintagevideo.741.com/ioproject.html roysvintagevideo.741.com] 3" image orthicon camera project&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image store, light falls upon the photocathode which is a photosensitive plate at a very negative potential (approx. -600&amp;nbsp;V), and is converted into an electron image (a principle borrowed from the image dissector). This electron ''rain'' is then accelerated towards the target (a very thin glass plate acting as a semi-isolator) at ground potential (0&amp;nbsp;V), and passes through a very fine wire mesh (near 200 wires per cm), very near (a few hundredths of cm) and parallel to the target, acting as a [[screen grid]] at a slightly positive voltage (approx +2&amp;nbsp;V). Once the image electrons reach the target, they cause a "splash" of electrons by the effect of [[secondary emission]]. On average, each image electron ejects several "splash" electrons (thus adding amplification by secondary emission), and these excess electrons are soaked up by the positive mesh effectively removing electrons from the target and causing a positive charge on it in relation to the incident light in the photocathode. The result is an image painted in positive charge, with the brightest portions having the largest positive charge.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/IMAGE_ORTHICON.html acmi.net.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404210016/http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/IMAGE_ORTHICON.html |date=April 4, 2004}} The Image Orthicon (Television Camera) Tube c. 1940 - 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

A sharply focused beam of electrons (a cathode ray) is generated by the [[electron gun]] at ground potential and accelerated by the anode (the first [[dynode]] of the [[electron multiplier]]) around the gun at a high positive voltage (approx. +1500&amp;nbsp;V). Once it exits the electron gun, its inertia makes the beam move away from the dynode towards the back side of the target. At this point the electrons lose speed and get deflected by the horizontal and vertical deflection coils, effectively scanning the target. Thanks to the [[#Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes|axial magnetic field of the focusing coil]], this deflection is not in a straight line, thus when the electrons reach the target they do so perpendicularly avoiding a sideways component. The target is nearly at ground potential with a small positive charge, thus when the electrons reach the target at low speed they are absorbed without ejecting more electrons. This adds negative charge to the positive charge until the region being scanned reaches some threshold negative charge, at which point the scanning electrons are reflected by the negative potential rather than absorbed (in this process the target recovers the electrons needed for the next scan). These reflected electrons return down the cathode ray tube toward the first dynode of the electron multiplier surrounding the electron gun which is at high potential. The number of reflected electrons is a linear measure of the target's original positive charge, which, in turn, is a measure of brightness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fazano.pro.br/ing/indi84.html fazano.pro.br] The Image Converter&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark halo===
The mysterious dark "orthicon halo" around bright objects in an IO-captured image is based on the fact that the IO relies on the emission of photoelectrons, but very bright illumination can produce more of them locally than the device can successfully deal with. At a very bright point on a captured image, a great preponderance of electrons is ejected from the photosensitive plate. So many may be ejected that the corresponding point on the collection mesh can no longer ''soak them up'', and thus they fall back to nearby spots on the target instead, much as water splashes in a ring when a rock is thrown into it. Since the resultant ''splashed'' electrons do not contain sufficient energy to eject further electrons where they land, they will instead neutralize any positive charge that has been built-up in that region. Since darker images produce less positive charge on the target, the excess electrons deposited by the splash will be read as a ''dark'' region by the scanning electron beam.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

This effect was actually "cultivated" by tube manufacturers to a certain extent, as a [[unsharp masking|small, carefully controlled amount of the dark halo]] has the effect of "crispening" the visual image due to the [[contrast effect]]. (That is, giving the illusion of being more sharply focused than it actually is). The later Vidicon tube and its descendants (see below) do not exhibit this effect, and so could not be used for broadcast purposes until special "detail correction" circuitry could be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morpheustechnology.com/ebooks/Multimedia/04%20Imaging.htm#_4.5.1_Camera_Tubes morpheustechnology.com] Morpheus Technology 4.5.1 Camera Tubes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vidicon==
A vidicon tube is a video camera tube design in which the target material is a photoconductor. The Vidicon was developed in the 1950s at RCA by P. K. Weimer, S. V. Forgue and R. R. Goodrich as a simple alternative to the structurally and electrically complex Image Orthicon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} While the initial photoconductor used was selenium, other targets–including silicon diode arrays–have been used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[File:Vidicon.png|thumb|400px|Schematic of vidicon tube.]]
The vidicon is a storage-type camera tube in which a charge-density pattern is formed by the imaged scene radiation on a [[photoconductor|photoconductive]] surface which is then scanned by a beam of low-velocity [[electron]]s. The fluctuating voltage coupled out to a video [[amplifier]] can be used to reproduce the scene being imaged. The electrical charge produced by an image will remain in the face plate until it is scanned or until the charge dissipates.  By using a [[Pyroelectric]] material such as Triglycene Sulphate (TGS) as the target, a vidicon sensitive over a broad portion of the [[infrared]] spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|Progress In IR Television Using The Pyroelectric Vidicon=Proc SPIE vol 510 Infrared Technology X}} is possible.  This technology was a precursor to modern microbolometer technology.

Prior to the design and construction of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] probe to [[Jupiter]] in the late 1970s to early 1980s, [[NASA]] used Vidicon cameras on nearly all the unmanned deep space probes equipped with the remote sensing ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spacecraft Imaging: III.

Vidicon tubes were popular in 1970s and 1980s after which they were rendered obsolete by CCD and CMOS sensors.

===Plumbicon===
Plumbicon is a registered trademark of [[Philips]] for its [[lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) target vidicons. Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. They have excellent resolution compared to Image Orthicons, but lack the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which cause some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images.&lt;ref name="nimaging_history"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Narragansett Imaging |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817073739/http://www.nimaging.com/about/history.html |archive-date=17 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |url=http://www.nimaging.com/about/history.html |work=Narragansett Imaging |publisher=Narragansett Imaging |accessdate=29 June 2012 |year=2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nimaging_index"&gt;{{cite web |title=Camera Tubes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531043252/http://www.nimaging.com/products/tubes/index.html |archive-date=31 May 2016 |dead-url=yes |url=http://www.nimaging.com/products/tubes/index.html |work=Narragansett Imaging |accessdate=29 June 2012 |year=2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nimaging_plumbicon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plumbicon Broadcast Tubes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715072049/http://www.nimaging.com/products/tubes/plumbicon_broadcast.html |archive-date=15 July 2016 |dead-url=yes |url=http://www.nimaging.com/products/tubes/plumbicon_broadcast.html |work=Narragansett Imaging |accessdate=29 June 2012 |year=2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plumbicon.jpg|thumb|400px|Schematic of a Plumbicon tube. (This image is schematic, not to scale; a Plumbicon has the same shape as a vidicon.)]]
Compared to Saticons, Plumbicons have much higher resistance to burn-in, and comet and trailing artifacts from bright lights in the shot. Saticons though, usually have slightly higher resolution. After 1980, and the introduction of the diode-gun Plumbicon tube, the resolution of both types was so high, compared to the maximum limits of the broadcasting standard, that the Saticon's resolution advantage became moot. While broadcast cameras migrated to solid-state charge-coupled devices, Plumbicon tubes remained a staple imaging device in the medical field.&lt;ref name="nimaging_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimaging_index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimaging_plumbicon"/&gt;

Until 2016, Narragansett Imaging was the last company making Plumbicons, using factories Philips built in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island, USA]]. While still a part of Philips, the company purchased EEV's ([[English Electric Valve]]) lead oxide camera tube business, and gained a monopoly in lead-oxide tube production.&lt;ref name="nimaging_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimaging_index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimaging_plumbicon"/&gt;

===Saticon===
Saticon is a registered trademark of [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] from 1973, also produced by [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] and [[Sony]]. It was developed in a joint effort by Hitachi and [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] ([[NHK]] is The Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Its surface consists of selenium with trace amounts of arsenic and tellurium added (SeAsTe) to make the signal more stable. SAT in the name is derived from (SeAsTe).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9aH92iLEZAC|title=TV and Video Engineering|last=Dhake|first=A.

===Pasecon===
Originally developed by [[Toshiba]] in 1972 as '''chalnicon''', Pasecon is a registered trademark of Heimann GmbH from 1977. Its surface consists of [[cadmium selenide|cadmium selenide trioxide]] (CdSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Due to its wide [[responsivity|spectral response]], it is labelled as ''panchromatic selenium vidicon'', hence the achronym 'pasecon'.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5-lCDuTR5AC&amp;q=pasecon+heimann&amp;dq=pasecon+heimann|title=Official Gazette of the United States Patent and Trademark Office: Patents|date=1977|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BtOAQAAIAAJ|title=Image tubes|last=Csorba|first=Illes P.|date=1985|publisher=H.W. Sams|isbn=9780672220234|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newvicon===
Newvicon is a registered trademark of [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] from 1974. The Newvicon tubes were characterized by high light sensitivity. Its surface consists of a combination of [[zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) and [[cadmium zinc telluride|zinc cadmium Telluride]] (ZnCdTe).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Trinicon===
Trinicon is a registered trademark of [[Sony]]. It uses a vertically striped RGB color filter over the faceplate of an otherwise standard vidicon imaging tube to segment the scan into corresponding red, green and blue segments. Only one tube was used in the camera, instead of a tube for each color, as was standard for color cameras used in television broadcasting. It is used mostly in low-end consumer cameras, though Sony also used it in some moderate cost professional cameras in the 1980s, such as the DXC-1800 and BVP-1 models.&lt;ref name="Trinicon"&gt;[http://www.labguysworld.com/Sony_DXC-1600.htm "Sony DXC-1600"], LabGuysWorld.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the idea of using color stripe filters over the target was not new, the Trinicon was the only tube to use the primary RGB colors. This necessitated an additional electrode buried in the target to detect where the scanning electron beam was relative to the stripe filter. Previous color stripe systems had used colors where the color circuitry was able to separate the colors purely from the relative amplitudes of the signals. As a result, the Trinicon featured a larger dynamic range of operation.

===Light biasing===
All the vidicon type tubes except the vidicon itself were able to use a light biasing technique to improve the sensitivity and contrast. The photosensitive target in these tubes suffered from the limitation that the light level had to rise to a particular level before any video output resulted. Light biasing was a method whereby the photosensitive target was illuminated from a light source just enough that no appreciable output was obtained, but such that a slight increase in light level from the scene was enough to provide discernible output. The light came from either an illuminator mounted around the target, or in more professional cameras from a light source on the base of the tube and guided to the target by light piping. The technique would not work with the baseline vidicon tube because it suffered from the limitation that as the target was fundamentally an insulator, the constant low light level built up a charge which would manifest itself as a form of 'fogging'. The other types had semiconducting targets which did not have this problem.

==Color cameras==
Early color cameras used the obvious technique of using separate red, green and blue image tubes in conjunction with a [[dichroic prism|color separator]], a technique still in use with [[3CCD]] solid state cameras today. It was also possible to construct a color camera that used a single image tube. One technique has already been described (Trinicon above). A more common technique and a simpler one from the tube construction standpoint was to overlay the photosensitive target with a color striped filter having a fine pattern of vertical stripes of green, cyan and clear filters (i.e. Green; Green+Blue &amp; Green+Blue+Red) repeating across the target. The advantage of this arrangement was that for virtually every color, the video level of the green component was always less than the cyan, and similarly the cyan was always less than the white. Thus the contributing images could be separated without any reference electrodes in the tube. If the three levels were the same, then that part of the scene was green. This method suffered from the disadvantage that the light levels under the three filters were almost certain to be different, with the green filter passing not more than one third of the available light.

Variations on this scheme exist, the principal one being to use two filters with color stripes overlaid such that the colors form vertically oriented lozenge shapes overlaying the target. The method of extracting the color is similar however.

===Field-sequential color system===
During the 1930s and 1940s, [[field-sequential color system]]s were developed which used synchronized motor-driven color-filter disks at the camera's image tube and at the television receiver. Each disk consisted of red, blue, and green transparent color filters. In the camera, the disk was in the optical path, and in the receiver, it was in front of the CRT. Disk rotation was synchronized with vertical scanning so that each vertical scan in sequence was for a different primary color. This method allowed regular black-and-white image tubes and CRTs to generate and display color images. A field-sequential system developed by [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] for [[CBS]] was demonstrated to the press on September 4, 1940,&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Achieves Realism".

==Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes==
The phenomenon known as ''magnetic focusing'' was discovered by A. A. Campbell-Swinton in 1896,
he found that a longitudinal magnetic field generated by an axial coil can focus an electron beam.&lt;ref name="Swinton_ESMF"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was immediately corroborated by [[John Ambrose Fleming|J. A. Fleming]], and Hans Busch gave a complete mathematical interpretation in 1926.&lt;ref name="Busch"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagrams in this article show that the focus coil surrounds the camera tube; it is much longer than the focus coils for earlier TV CRTs. Camera-tube focus coils, by themselves, have essentially parallel lines of force, very different from the localized semi-[[toroid]]al magnetic field geometry inside a TV receiver CRT focus coil. The latter is essentially a [[magnetic lens]]; it focuses the "crossover" (between the CRT's cathode and G1 electrode, where the electrons pinch together and diverge again) onto the screen.

The electron optics of camera tubes differ considerably. Electrons inside these long focus coils take [[helix|helical]] paths as they travel along the length of the tube. The center (think local axis) of one of those helices is like a line of force of the magnetic field. While the electrons are traveling, the helices essentially don't matter. Assuming that they start from a point, the electrons will focus to a point again at a distance determined by the strength of the field. Focusing a tube with this kind of coil is simply a matter of trimming the coil's current. In effect, the electrons travel along the lines of force, although helically, in detail.

These focus coils are essentially as long as the tubes themselves, and surround the deflection yoke (coils). Deflection fields bend the lines of force (with negligible defocusing), and the electrons follow the lines of force.

In a conventional magnetically deflected CRT, such as in a TV receiver or computer monitor, basically the vertical deflection coils are equivalent to coils wound around an horizontal axis. That axis is perpendicular to the neck of the tube; lines of force are basically horizontal. (In detail, coils in a deflection yoke extend some distance beyond the neck of the tube, and lie close to the flare of the bulb; they have a truly distinctive appearance.)

In a magnetically focused camera tube (there are electrostatically focused vidicons), the vertical deflection coils are above and below the tube, instead of being on both sides of it. One might say that this sort of deflection starts to create S-bends in the lines of force, but doesn't become anywhere near to that extreme.

==Size==
The size of video camera tubes is simply the overall outside diameter of the glass envelope. This differs from the size of the sensitive area of the target which is typically two thirds of the size of the overall diameter. Tube sizes are always expressed in inches for historical reasons. A one-inch camera tube has a sensitive area of approximately two thirds of an inch on the diagonal or about 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

Although the video camera tube is now technologically obsolete, the size of solid state sensors is still expressed as the equivalent size of a camera tube. For this purpose a new term was coined and it is known as the [[optical format]]. The optical format is approximately the true diagonal of the sensor multiplied by 3/2. &lt;!-- To say divided by 16 to give a mm result from inches although approximately valid is not technically correct. It is a bad idea to mix units.---&gt; The result is expressed in inches and is usually (though not always) rounded to a convenient fraction - hence the approximation. For instance, a {{cvt|6.4|x|4.8|mm|in|disp=x|(|) sensor}} has a diagonal of {{cvt|8.0|mm}} and therefore an optical format of 8.0*3/2={{cvt|12|mm}}, which is rounded to the convenient imperial fraction of {{convert|1/2|in|cm}}. The parameter is also the source of the "Four Thirds" in the [[Four Thirds system]] and its [[Micro Four Thirds system|Micro Four Thirds]] extension—the imaging area of the sensor in these cameras is approximately that of a {{convert|4/3|in|cm|adj=on}} video-camera tube at approximately {{convert|22|mm|inch}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Making (some) sense out of sensor sizes |url= http://www.dpreview.com/news/2002/10/7/sensorsizes |work= Digital Photography Review |publisher= Digital Photography Review |accessdate= 29 June 2012 |author= Staff |date=7 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the optical format size bears no relationship to any physical parameter of the sensor, its use means that a lens that would have been used with (say) a four thirds inch camera tube will give roughly the same angle of view when used with a solid-state sensor with an optical format of four thirds of an inch

==Decline==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
Modern [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] and [[active pixel sensor|CMOS-based sensors]] offer many advantages over their tube counterparts. These include a lack of image lag, high overall picture quality, high light sensitivity and dynamic range, a better [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and significantly higher reliability and ruggedness. Other advantages include the elimination of the respective high and low-voltage power supplies required for the electron beam and [[vacuum tube|heater filament]], elimination of the drive circuitry for the focusing coils, no warm-up time and a significantly lower overall power consumption. Despite these advantages, acceptance and incorporation of solid-state sensors into television and video cameras was not immediate. Early sensors were of lower resolution and performance than picture tubes, and were initially relegated to consumer-grade video recording equipment.

Also, video tubes had progressed to a high standard of quality and were "standard issue" equipment to networks and production entities. Those entities had a substantial investment in not only tube cameras, but also in the ancillary equipment needed to correctly process tube-derived video. A switch-over to solid-state image sensors rendered much of that equipment (and the investments behind it) obsolete and required new equipment optimized to work well with solid-state sensors, just as the old equipment was optimized for tube-sourced video.

}}
The '''Willy–Nicky correspondence''' was a set of messages relayed between [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]], and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], [[Emperor of Russia]] during the eve of the [[First World War]].

==Context and background==
Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II were third cousins (both were great-great-grandsons of [[Paul I of Russia]]) as well as being second cousins once removed (both were descended from [[Frederick William III of Prussia]]) and the Kaiser was a first cousin of Nicholas's wife, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alix of Hesse]]. The emperors corresponded in [[English language|English]] and were accustomed to calling each other "Willy" and "Nicky" but would use their counterparts' formal names in formal communications.

The source of the telegrams is ''The German White Book'',&lt;ref&gt;In full ''Das Deutsche Weißbuch über den Ausbruch des deutsch-russisch-französischen Krieges'', or ''The German White Book on the Outbreak of the German-Russian-French War''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World War I Document Archive: [http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_German_White_Book The German White Book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellery Cory Stowell|Stowell, Ellery Cory]] (1915) ''[https://archive.org/stream/diplomacyofwarof01stow The Diplomacy of the War of 1914: The beginnings of the war]''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Willy-Nicky_Telegrams Some sources] state that the source of these telegrams is Isaac Don Levine's book ''Letters from the Kaiser to the Tsar: copied from government archives in Petrograd unpublished before 1920'' but this is incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; a pamphlet of official documents published to justify the German Government's position after the outbreak of war.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/document_packs/p_whitebook.htm#top German White Book]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Willy-Nicky Telegrams'' is derived from ''The Willy-Nicky Correspondence'', the title of a book by [[Herman Bernstein]] published in 1918 which revealed the personal telegraphic correspondence between the two emperors during the period June 1904 to August 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Herman (1918) ''The Willy-Nicky Correspondence: Being the Secret and Intimate Telegrams Exchanged between the Kaiser and the Tsar.''. Knopf, New York. {{OL|23360533M}}, {{OCLC|332762}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And which, therefore, does not include the telegrams discussed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Correspondence==
The telegrams start with a plea from the Tsar to the Kaiser to try to stop the serious developments that led up to the World War. An excerpt:

{{quote|I foresee that very soon I shall be overwhelmed by the pressure forced upon me and be forced to take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such a calamity as a European war I beg you in the name of our old friendship to do what you can to stop your allies from going too far.  Nicky.}}

Ultimately, the correspondence changes tone and the two leaders warn each other of impending mobilization due to factors out of their control, while retaining the notion that mobilization does not mean war. An excerpt of the last telegram:

{{quote|Immediate affirmative clear and unmistakable answer from your government is the only way to avoid endless misery. Until I have received this answer alas, I am unable to discuss the subject of your telegram. As a matter of fact I must request you to immediatly {{sic}} order your troops on no account to commit the slightest act of trespassing over our frontiers. Willy}}

{{quote|Thanks for your telegram conciliatory and friendly. Whereas official message presented today by your ambassador to my minister was conveyed in a very different tone.

On July 29, 1914, Nicholas suggested submitting the Austro-Serbian problem to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conference]] (in [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Hague tribunal]]) – Wilhelm did not address this in his subsequent telegram. According to [[James M. Beck|Beck]],&lt;ref&gt;James M. Beck [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1630347&amp;pageno=1 ''The Evidence in the Case.  A Discussion of the Moral Responsibility for the War of 1914, as Disclosed by the Diplomatic Records of England, Germany, Russia,  France, Austria, Italy and Belgium''], ([http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1630347&amp;pageno=106 p.106])&lt;/ref&gt; the German Foreign Office omitted this telegram in publishing the correspondence between the Kaiser and the tsar. After the publication of this telegram by the Russian government on January 31, 1915 in the Official Gazette ''Governmental Herald'', the German Foreign Office explained that they regarded this telegram as too "unimportant". In contrast, Russian Foreign Ministry ([[Sergey Sazonov|Minister Sazonov]]), as well as the French Ambassador in Russia ([[Maurice Paléologue]]) believed the telegram very important.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Maurice Paléologue [http://militera.lib.ru/memo/french/paleologue/index.html ''Tsarist Russia during World War''.

'''''Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profits, Jobs and Security''''' is a 2005 book by [[Amory B. Lovins]], [[E. Kyle Datta]], Odd-Even Bustnes, [[Jonathan Koomey|Jonathan G. Koomey]], and Nathan J. Glasgow, published by the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].  It presents an independent, transdisciplinary analysis of four ways to reduce [[petroleum]] dependence in the United States:
*Using oil more efficiently, through smarter technologies that wring more (and often better) services from less oil (pp.&amp;nbsp;29–102).
*Substituting for petroleum fuels other liquids made from biomass or wastes (pp.&amp;nbsp;103–111).
*Substituting saved natural gas for oil in uses where they’re interchangeable, such as furnaces and boilers (pp.&amp;nbsp;111–122). 
*Replacing oil with hydrogen made from non-oil resources (pp.&amp;nbsp;228–242).

==Problems and solutions==

The authors explain that the problems of oil dependence are manageable, suggesting that oil dependence is a problem we need no longer have. The proposed solutions to oil dependence are profitable and U.S. oil dependence can be eliminated by proven and attractive technologies that create wealth, enhance choice, and strengthen common security. The authors argue that America can lead the world into the post-petroleum era and create a vibrant economy. (p.xiii)

==Reviews==

''Winning the Oil Endgame'' has received many positive reviews and the [[Wall Street Journal]] called the book "Perhaps the most rigorous and surely the most dramatic analysis of what it will take to wean us from foreign oil ... carried out by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a respected center of hard-headed, market-based research."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilendgame.com/Reviews.html A Declaration of Energy Independence]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ziki Shaked''' ({{lang-he|ציקי שקד}}; born 1955) is an [[Israel]]i [[Captain (nautical)|captain]], [[Sail training|sailing instructor]], and founder of the school of sailing in [[Eilat]].&lt;ref name="YediothAhronoth20140914"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mako20111010"/&gt;

In 2010–2012, he traveled around the world on his [[yacht]], "Lorraine-D", and joined a small group of Israeli captains who traveled around the world under the Israeli flag.&lt;ref name="Ereverev20110303"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ereverev20120507"/&gt;

The yacht "Lorraine-D" started from Eilat and two years later came back to Eilat. The route passed through the [[Suez Canal]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], through the [[Panama Canal]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Gulf of Aden]], and the [[Red Sea]].

The boat travelled to unique places, such as the [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Easter Island]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], and [[Vanuatu]]. At various times, people from different countries of the world, including Israel, [[Russia]], [[Finland]], and [[France]], joined this journey.&lt;ref name="Mako20120406"/&gt;
