The arid diagonal can be seen in the form of the almost contiguous zone of [[Desert_climate#Hot_desert_climates|BWh]] and [[Desert_climate#Cold_desert_climates|BWk]] climate running from Ecuador to Southern Patagonia.]]
The '''Arid Diagonal''' ({{lang-es|link=no|diagonal árida/arreica}}) is a contiguous zone of [[aridity|arid and semi-arid climate]] that traverses [[South America]] from coastal [[Peru]] in the Northwest to [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Patagonia]] in Southeast including large swathes of [[Bolivia]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=Bruniard&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bruniard |first=Enrique D. |date=1982 |title=La diagonal árida Argentina: un límite climático real |language=Spanish |journal=Revista Geográfica |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=5-20 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arid Diagonal encompasses a number of deserts, for example: [[Sechura Desert|Sechura]], [[Atacama Desert|Atacama]], [[Monte Desert|Monte]] and the [[Patagonian Desert]]. 

The Arid Diagonal acts to isolate the temperate and subtropical forests of Chile and southern Argentina from other forests of South America.&lt;ref name=villagranhinojosa&gt;{{cite journal |last=Villagrán |first=Carolina|last2=Hinojosa |first2=Luis Felipe |author-link1=Carolina Villagrán |date=1997 |title=Historia de los bosques del sur de Sudamérica, II: Análisis fitogeográfico |language=Spanish |journal=[[Revista Chilena de Historia Natural]] |publisher= |volume=70 |issue= |pages=241-267 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Quaternary glaciation]]s in the Southern Andes, the diagonal has controlled the distribution of vegetation throughout Chile and Argentina.&lt;ref name=VillagranHinojosa2005/&gt; 

==Cause and origin==
The northern portion of the Arid Diagonal is a result of the blocking of the [[trade winds]] by the barrier formed by the [[Andes|Central Andes]] and the [[South Pacific High]]&lt;ref name=Armestoetal&gt;{{Cite book

'''Arusha–Holili–Taveta–Voi Road''' (A23) is a road in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]], connecting the towns of [[Arusha]], [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]], and [[Holili]] in Tanzania with [[Taveta, Kenya|Taveta]] and [[Voi]] in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location=Tunis|

==Location==
The western end of the A23 road is in Arusha, Tanzania at its junction with the A104 road. The A23 road connects eastward with Moshi and the border town of Holili. Further east in Kenya, the [[A23 road (Kenya)|A23 road]] connects with Taveta and has its eastern terminus in Voi at the intersection with the A109 [[Nairobi–Mombasa Road]]. The A23 road from end to end measures approximately {{convert|230|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=26 March 2016| url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Tanzania_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Arusha%2C%20Tanzania&amp;toplace=Holilli%20Border%20Checkpoint%2C%20A23%2C%20Holili%2C%20Kilimanjaro%2C%20Tanzania%2C&amp;dt1=ChIJg3M48ogcNxgRUnFJ7PcHGbw&amp;dt2=ChIJizh8vde3ORgR7QizEEgoc2w | title=Distance between Arusha, Tanzania and Holilli Border Checkpoint, A23, Holili, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania | last=GFC | accessdate=26 March 2016 | publisher=Globefee.com (GFC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Globefeed.com (GFC) | url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Kenya_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Taveta%2C%20Taita%20Taveta%2C%20Kenya&amp;toplace=Voi%2C%20Taita%20Taveta%2C%20Kenya%2C&amp;dt1=ChIJ1e3t_lG2ORgR4EPr9DZET3E&amp;dt2=ChIJwUgHhFUpORgRaUxHbrd5KGE | title=Distance between Taveta, Taita Taveta, Kenya and Voi, Taita Taveta, Kenya | accessdate=26 March 2016 | last=GFC | date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upgrades and reconstruction==
The A23 road forms an important link in the Voi–[[Dodoma]] / [[Singida (town)|Singida]] corridor (consisting of the A23, A104, B141, and B143 roads).

The [[African Development Bank]] is lending US$232.5 million towards upgrading the A23 road, constituting 89.1 percent of the budgeted total cost. Kenya is contributing US$15.6 million, while Tanzania is contributing US$12.3 million.&lt;ref name="Fin"&gt;{{cite web | location=Tunis | url=http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/afdb-reinforces-regional-integration-support-with-usd-232-5-million-tanzania-kenya-road-financing-11676 | title=AfDB reinforces regional integration support with USD 232.5 million Tanzania-Kenya road financing | accessdate=3 March 2017 | last=AfDB | date=17 April 2013 | publisher=African Development Bank (AfDB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the A23 double carriage way between Arusha and Tengeru, Tanzania began in July 2013. The contractor is Hanil-Jiangsu JV, a South Korean construction company, The Cheil Engineering Company, also from South Korea, is the consulting engineer. Phase 2 of the project includes the upgrade to double carriage way of the road between Tengeru and [[Usa River, Tanzania|Usa River]], Tanzania. This work should be completed by December 2018.&lt;ref name="Completion"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=3 March 2017 | date=25 July 2015 | url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Tanzania-Kenya-highway-upgrade-to-boost-trade-/-/2560/2808552/-/4ysvuaz/-/index.html | title=Tanzania-Kenya highway upgrade to boost trade | first=Adam | last=Ihucha | location=Nairobi | newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstructing the two-lane road connecting Usa River, Moshi, and Holili was part of Phase 2 originally.&lt;ref name="Completion"/&gt; A lack of funds, however, means that the reconstruction "is not in the immediate implementation plan" except that realigning the approaches to the Kikafu River bridge is still planned.&lt;ref name="Delay"/&gt; The design for a replacement bridge has been completed.&lt;ref name="Delay"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201709040199.html | title=New Road Linking Arusha With Border Post Starts to Take Shape | author=Zephania Ubwani | publisher=The Citizen | location=[[Dar es Salaam]] | via=[[AllAfrica.com]] | date=4 September 2017 | accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the Kenyan side of the A23 road commenced in May 2014, with Tanzanian President [[Jakaya Kikwete]] and Kenyan President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] officially launching the project in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=3 March 2016 | url=https://www.redpepper.co.ug/eac-heads-of-state-to-launch-construction-of-arusha-tengeru-dual-carriageway-and-arusha-bypass-road/ | title=EAC Heads of State to Launch Construction of Arusha-Tengeru Dual Carriageway and Arusha Bypass Road | accessdate=3 March 2017 | location=Kampala | newspaper=[[Red Pepper (newspaper)|The Red Pepper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.coastweek.com/3840-Kenya-and-Tanzania-presidents-launch-Taveta-Mwatate-road-project.htm | title=Kenya and Tanzania Presidents launching Mwatate road project | accessdate=3 March 2017 | date=4 October 2015 | via=Coastweek | publisher=[[Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://citizentv.co.ke/news/kenyatta-kikwete-launch-new-road-to-improve-connectivity-102381 | title=Kenyatta, Kikwete launch new road to improve connectivity | date=4 October 2015 | first=Benjamin | last=Wafula | publisher=Citizen Television Online | location=Nairobi | accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion was scheduled for May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nation.co.ke/counties/taita-taveta/Taita-Taveta-KeNHA-roads/1183326-3498396-jrd0u6 | title=Major roads being built by the national government in Taita Taveta to be completed by May | date=26 December 2016 | publisher=[[Daily Nation]] | location=Nairobi | accessdate=3 March 2017 | author=Coast Nation Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bab-el-Mandeb''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|ar|باب المندب}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;"Gate of Tears")&lt;ref name="EB 1878, 179"&gt;{{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bab-el-Mandeb |volume=3  |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[strait]] located between [[Yemen]] on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and [[Djibouti]] and [[Eritrea]] in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It connects the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Gulf of Aden]].

{{anchor|Toponymy|Etymology}}

==Name==
[[File:Red Sea topographic map-en.svg|thumb|right|Bathymetric map of the [[Red Sea]] with the Bab-el-Mandeb at the bottom right]]
The strait derives its name from the dangers attending its navigation, or, according to an Arab [[legend]], from the numbers who were drowned by the [[earthquake]] which separated [[Arabia]] from the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref name="EB 1878, 179"/&gt;

==Geography==
The Bab-el-Mandeb acts as a strategic link between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] via the Red Sea and the [[Suez Canal]]. In 2006, an estimated {{convert|3.3|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil passed through the strait per day, out of a world total of about {{convert|43|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} moved by tankers.&lt;ref name="chokepoints"&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=wotc&amp;trk=p3 World Oil Transit Chokepoints] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218222232/http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=wotc&amp;trk=p3 |date=February 18, 2015 }}, Energy Information Administration, US Department of Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance across is about 20 miles (30&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Ras Menheli]] in Yemen to [[Ras Siyyan]] in Djibouti. The island of [[Perim]] divides the strait into two channels, of which the eastern, known as the [[Bab Iskender]] (Alexander's Strait), is 2 miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) wide and 16 [[fathom]]s (30 m) deep, while the western, or [[Dact-el-Mayun]], has a width of about 16 miles (25&amp;nbsp;km) and a depth of 170 fathoms (310 m). Near the coast of Djibouti lies a group of smaller islands known as the "[[Seven Brothers (islands)|Seven Brothers]]". There is a surface current inwards in the eastern channel, but a strong undercurrent outwards in the western channel.&lt;ref name="EB 1878, 179"/&gt;

==History==
Paleo-environmental and [[tectonics|tectonic]] events in the [[Miocene]] epoch created the Danakil Isthmus, a land bridge forming a broad connection between Yemen and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nile: Origin, Environments, Limnology and Human Use|author=Henri J. Dumont|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|series=Monographiae Biologicae|volume=89|isbn=9781402097263|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iF_U1NoknHoC|page=603}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last 100,000 years eustatic [[sea level]] fluctuations have led to alternate opening and closing of the straits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate in Earth History|publisher=National Academies|year=1982|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k0QrAAAAYAAJ|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[recent single origin hypothesis]], the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb were probably witness to the earliest migrations of [[modern humans]]. It is presumed that at this time, the oceans were much lower and the straits were much shallower or dry, allowing a series of emigrations along the southern coast of Asia.

According to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] tradition, the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb were witness to the earliest migrations of Semitic [[Ge'ez]] speakers into Africa, occurring {{circa|lk=no|1900}} BC, roughly around the same time as the Hebrew patriarch [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eotc-patriarch.org/teachings.htm Official website of EOTC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625174828/http://www.eotc-patriarch.org/teachings.htm |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] was a major regional power in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It extended its rule across the strait with the conquest of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] shortly before the [[rise of Islam]].

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] unilaterally seized the island of [[Perim]] in 1799 on behalf of its [[British India|Indian empire]]. Britain reasserted its ownership in 1857 and erected a lighthouse there in 1861, using it to command the [[Red Sea]] and the trade routes through the Suez Canal.&lt;ref name="EB 1878, 179"/&gt;

{{anchor|Bridge}}
On February 22, 2008, a company owned by [[Tarek bin Laden]] unveiled plans to build a bridge named [[Bridge of the Horns]] across the strait, linking [[Yemen]] with [[Djibouti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7259427.stm BBC NEWS | Africa | Tarek Bin Laden's Red Sea bridge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Middle East Development LLC has issued a notice to construct a bridge passing across the Red Sea that would be the longest suspended passing in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tom Sawyer |title=Notice-to-Proceed Launches Ambitious Red Sea Crossing |url=http://enr.construction.com/news/intl/archives/070501.asp |work=[[Engineering News-Record]] |date=May 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been assigned to engineering company [[COWI]] in collaboration with architect studio [[Dissing+Weitling]], both from Denmark. It was announced in 2010 that Phase 1 had been delayed and as of mid-2016 nothing more has been heard about the project.

'''Bradford Parkinson''' (February 16, 1935) is an American [[engineer]] and inventor, retired [[United States Air Force]] Colonel and recalled emeritus Professor at [[Stanford University]]. He is best known as the lead architect, advocate and developer, with early contributions from [[Ivan A. Getting|Ivan Getting]] and [[Roger L. Easton|Roger Easton]], of the Air Force NAVSTAR program, better known as [[Global Positioning System]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/news/magazine/aeroastro-no4/parkinson.html|title=MIT Aero-Astro Magazine - Parkinson|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/brad-parkinson-ieee-medal-of-honor-2018|title='Father of GPS' Brad Parkinson: IEEE Medal of Honor 2018|website=IEEE.tv|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Brad_Parkinson|title=Oral-History:Brad Parkinson - Engineering and Technology History Wiki|website=ethw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20121211181910/http://alum.mit.edu/news/AlumniProfiles/Archive/Bradford_Parkinson_SM_-2761.jsp|title=Bradford Parkinson SM '61 {{!}} MIT Alumni Association's Infinite Connect…|date=2012-12-11|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.gpsfaq.com/details.aspx?item=36|title=Bradford Parkinson Biography|website=articles.gpsfaq.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also the principal investigator and program manager on [[Gravity Probe B]], which tested [[gravitomagnetism]] and was the first ever direct mechanical test of Einstein’s [[General relativity|General Relativity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He has received numerous awards and honors for GPS and contributions to engineering and invention, including the [[Charles Stark Draper Prize]], [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]], and [[IEEE Medal of Honor]], among others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.invent.org/honor/inductees/inductee-detail/?IID=209|title=Inductee Detail {{!}} National Inventors Hall of Fame|work=National Inventors Hall of Fame|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carey|first1=Bjorn|title=Stanford engineer Bradford Parkinson, the ‘Father of GPS,’ wins prestigious Marconi Prize|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2016/05/16/stanford-engineer-bradford-parkinson-father-gps-wins-prestigious-marconi-prize/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=19 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422232547/https://news.stanford.edu/2016/05/16/stanford-engineer-bradford-parkinson-father-gps-wins-prestigious-marconi-prize/|archivedate=22 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nae.edu/Activities/Projects/Awards/DraperPrize/DraperWinners.aspx?id=55291|title=Recipients of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering|website=NAE Website|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
For his secondary education, the younger Parkinson attended the [[Breck School]], then a small, all-boys preparatory school, graduating in 1952. Parkinson has credited his experiences at the Breck School for inspiring in him an early love of math and science, an interest which eventually became his life's calling.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725062604/http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/news/magazine/aeroastro-no4/parkinson.html|title=MIT Aero-Astro Magazine - Parkinson|date=2008-07-25|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.breckschool.org/alumni/alumni-awards|title=Alumni Honors &amp; Awards - Breck School|website=www.breckschool.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkinson was a distinguished graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]], graduating in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. While studying there, Parkinson discovered he had a deep interest in controls engineering, which was introduced in a Senior Level course at the time. Fortunately, one of Parkinson's [[electrical engineering|Electrical Engineering]] professors was an Air Force officer who urged him to consider being [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] in the Air Force rather than the Navy. Parkinson also knew he wanted to get a Ph.D. later in life, and the Air Force was more receptive to graduate and post-graduate education at this time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After being commissioned in the Air Force, he was trained in electronics maintenance and supervised large [[ground radar]] installations in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]. He then was sponsored by USAF to attend [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], studying [[Control engineering|controls engineering]], [[inertial guidance]], [[astronautics]] and electrical engineering.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bradford Parkinson#cite%20note-Bradford%20Parkinson%20%7C%20''%5B%5BInside%20GNSS%5D%5D''-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Parkinson worked in the lab of [[Charles Stark Draper]], the namesake for the prestigious Draper Prize which Parkinson went on to win later in his life.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bradford Parkinson#cite%20note-Aero-Astro%20Magazine%20-%20Parkinson-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; At MIT, he received a [[Master of Science]] in [[Aeronautics]] and [[Astronautics]] in 1961 and was elected to the Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi honor Societies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bradford Parkinson#cite%20note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parkinson was then assigned to work at the Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]]. There he developed tests and was a Chief Analyst for the evaluation of the Air Force’s inertial guidance systems and continued work on electrical and controls engineering. In 1964, after three years at Holloman, Parkinson was assigned to a Ph.D. program at Stanford University graduating in 1966, with a degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Career==

===Air Force duty===
After graduating from the Naval Academy, Parkinson opted to perform regular Air Force duty in order to, as he put it, “find out what the Air Force was all about”.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bradford Parkinson#cite%20note-Aero-Astro%20Magazine%20-%20Parkinson-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He served two years as Chief Communications-Electronics officer at an early warning station In Washington State. After finishing his Ph.D. at Stanford, he was assigned to the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] (1966–68) as an academic instructor and was chief of their Simulation Division. He also was chief academic instructor to a class of USAF Astronauts, including many who later joined NASA and flew on the Space Shuttle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

He then attended the Air Force Command and Staff College for a year where he became a Distinguished Graduate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Next, he was assigned as a Professor and Deputy Head of the Air Force Academy Department of Astronautics and Computer Science. In the midst of his first year he was detached to help with the development of a brand-new version of the [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]]. In particular, he led the final development of the innovative digital [[fire-control system]]. After successful testing at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], he deployed to South East Asia during the [[Vietnam War]] and flew 26 combat missions to continue evaluation and refinement of the weapons system. During this deployment he logged more than 170 hours of combat missions, and was awarded a number of military honors including the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]], two [[Air Medal]]s and a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. He then returned to the Air Force Academy as the Head of the Department of Astronautics and Computer Science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He next was a student at the [[Naval War College]], in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]] for a year where he graduated with distinction and was followed by a brief assignment as the Chief Engineer of the Advanced Ballistic Re-Entry System Project, at [[Los Angeles Air Force Station]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===NAVSTAR Project===
In 1973, thanks in part to the influence of his mentor, General William W. Dunn, the Commander, Lt-Gen Kenneth Schultz, assigned Parkinson to a floundering Air Force program called Project 621B. This program had been trying to gain approval for a new [[satellite]]-based navigation system concept. Strong technical support was rendered by [[The Aerospace Corporation]]. Parkinson quickly recruited a small cadre of highly competent Air Force Officer-Engineers, with Masters and PhDs from top universities. After initially failing to gain approval in August 1973, Parkinson called a remote site meeting in [[The Pentagon]] over [[Labor Day]] 1973. At that meeting, attended only by his officer-engineers and two people from the Aerospace Corporation, he led the re-architecture of the concept. He then assumed lead responsibility to sell the new configuration to the Air Force and to top Pentagon Officials. By December 1973 he gained approval and budget for a four satellite, live demonstration of the new idea. This included the concept of flying Atomic clocks in high orbits that had been advocated by both the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]] and an earlier USAF Aerospace study by J. B. Woodford and H. Nakamura.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inventionandtech.com/content/%E2%80%9Ci-had-sell-air-force-because-air-force-didn%E2%80%99t-want-it%E2%80%9D-0|title="I Had To Sell This To The Air Force, Because The Air Force Didn’t Want It" {{!}} Invention and Technology|website=www.inventionandtech.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkinson them assumed full, direct control of the development of the demonstration system, which included satellites, a global ground control system, nine types of user receivers, and an extensive land, sea and air test program. He testified before congress and explained that there would be an “at-risk” signal to freely support civilian applications of precision positioning from the outset. In 1978, Parkinson was the launch Commander for the first prototype GPS satellite to be launched (forty-four months after go-ahead). Later that year, the test program verified every performance claim that Parkinson had made. Parkinson was then offered a job as the Air Force aid to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. Parkinson rather elected to retire from the Air Force.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Over the course of his 26-year military career, Parkinson served twenty-one years in the Air Force, from 1957 to 1978, and five years with the Navy. He retired at the rank of full colonel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Private sector===

After retiring from the Air Force in 1978, Parkinson spent one year as a professor of Mechanical Engineering at [[Colorado State University]], [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Soon after, he accepted a position as Vice President at the Space Systems Group of the [[Rockwell International]] (later absorbed into [[Boeing]]), where he was involved in strategic planning and developing advanced—and classified—space systems. From 1980 to 1984, he was Vice President and General Manager of the Boston software company [[Intermetrics]], which was responsible for creating the currently used [[HAL/S]] programming language for [[NASA]]’s [[Space Shuttle]] program. He was heavily involved in the company’s [[initial public offering]] in 1982. In 1984, he left Intermetrics to accept an appointment as a Research Professor at [[Stanford University]]. Shortly after, he became a tenured Professor and assumed Stanford’s “Edward C. Wells” Chair of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He taught [[Astrodynamics]], [[Control theory|Control Theory]], and developed a special course on “Managing Innovation.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999, he took a leave of absence for a year and served as the CEO of the [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] based company, [[Trimble Navigation]], a producer of advanced positioning systems. He then returned to his faculty position at Stanford. In 2001 he briefly retired from Stanford and named Emeritus, but was immediately recalled and is currently active, albeit at a lower activity level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He was also the co-principal investigator and program manager on the NASA/Stanford University endeavor [[Gravity Probe B]], which tested [[gravitomagnetism]] and was the first ever direct mechanical test of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]’s [[General relativity|General Relativity]]. Using orbiting [[gyroscope]]s in satellites, they measured the [[geodetic effect]] and [[frame-dragging]]. Under NASA sponsorship, this was successfully launched from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] on April 20, 2004. While the spaceflight phase completed in 2005, the results were announced and published from 2007 to as late as 2015. A Stanford-based analysis group and NASA announced on 4 May 2011 that the data from GP-B indeed confirms the two predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.&lt;sup&gt;[[Gravity Probe B#cite%20note-33|[33]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/may/gravity-probe-mission-050411.html|title=Stanford's Gravity Probe B confirms two Einstein theories|work=Stanford University|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://einstein.stanford.edu/highlights/status1.html|title=Gravity Probe B - MISSION STATUS|website=einstein.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been on many corporate and governmental boards and recently stepped down as Chairman of [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]’s Advisory Council after thirteen years in the position, long past the usual two-year tenure. He still serves as Co-Chair for the [[National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing|National Executive Committee for Space-Based PNT]] Advisory Board.

==Invention==
===Historical context===
Beginning with the landmark launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] in 1957, the first man-made satellite, members of the aeronautical and military spheres realized that satellite-based positioning was technically feasible, perhaps likely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[United States Navy]] experimented with the technology in 1960, launching the [[Transit (satellite)|Transit positioning satellites]] which was mainly used for [[submarine]] navigation, in particular for initializing their on-board [[ballistic missile]]s. However, Transit only provided two-dimensional, periodic fixes every several hours with an accuracy of about 1/10th to 1/4 mile. Additional, satellite-based, navigation systems were proposed or launched throughout the 1960s including by the USAF/Aerospace Corporation, the [[Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory]], and the Naval Research Laboratory. But because of the secrecy and competition for budgets, of such military endeavors, collaboration was minimal. Also, their collective promise of accuracy was not credible to Pentagon officials and they publicly voiced their skepticism of the whole premise. They did not believe the usefulness would justify the cost. Parkinson was met with extreme resistance, but used small-scale prototypes sell what would go on to become GPS.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Reception and impact===
With the advent of [[The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture|The Information Age]] and the accompanying mobile technology, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] has become a ubiquitous and life-changing technology to all sectors, critical even. For example, current cell phones include GPS receivers, and when used in conjunction with [[Geographic information system|GIS]] like [[Google Maps]], accurate and real-time directions can be used by pedestrian and civilian traffic alike. Indeed, with GPS, [[airplane]]s are now capable of landing on [[autopilot]], and doing so with better precision and safety than human pilots. Outside of military and standard civilian use, [[seismologists]] are testing GPS for use in earthquake detection and measurement. The timing systems—[[atomic clock]]s—made popular by GPS, are vital to the functionality of incalculable amounts of [[Internet]] services, including the [[banking]] and [[stock market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.galsys.co.uk/news/who-uses-atomic-clocks/|title=Who Uses Atomic Clocks? - Galleon Systems|date=2009-06-16|work=Galleon Systems|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, President Reagan stated that GPS would be guaranteed to the world, in response to the Soviet downing of a Korean Airliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/the-plane-crash-that-gave-americans-gps/382204/|title=The Plane Crash That Gave Americans GPS|last=Laskow|first=Sarah|date=2014-11-03|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study for the US government estimated the yearly benefit of GPS to be 37 to 74 billion dollars, excluding many of the applications, such as saving lives, that were difficult to quantify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gps.gov/governance/advisory/meetings/2015-06/leveson.pdf|title=The Economic Value of GPS|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cluster-2.svg|thumb|The result of a cluster analysis shown as the coloring of the squares into three clusters.]]
'''Cluster analysis''' or '''clustering''' is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a '''cluster''') are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory [[data mining]], and a common technique for [[statistics|statistical]] [[data analysis]], used in many fields, including [[machine learning]], [[pattern recognition]], [[image analysis]], [[information retrieval]], [[bioinformatics]], [[data compression]], and [[computer graphics]].

Cluster analysis itself is not one specific [[algorithm]], but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small [[Distance function|distances]] between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular [[statistical distribution]]s. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a [[multi-objective optimization]] problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the [[Metric (mathematics)|distance function]] to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of [[knowledge discovery]] or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.

Besides the term ''clustering'', there are a number of terms with similar meanings, including ''automatic [[Statistical classification|classification]]'', ''[[numerical taxonomy]]'', ''botryology'' (from Greek βότρυς "grape") and ''typological analysis''. The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.

Cluster analysis was originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932 and introduced to psychology by Zubin in 1938 and [[Robert Tryon]] in 1939&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bailey  | first = Ken | year = 1994 | title = Typologies and Taxonomies | chapter = Numerical Taxonomy and Cluster Analysis | page = 34 | isbn = 9780803952591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Cluster Analysis: Correlation Profile and Orthometric (factor) Analysis for the Isolation of Unities in Mind and Personality | first = Robert C. | last = Tryon | authorlink = Robert Tryon | publisher = Edwards Brothers | year = 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; and famously used by [[Raymond Cattell|Cattell]] beginning in 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cattell | first = R. B. | date = 1943 | title = The description of personality: Basic traits resolved into clusters | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 476–506 | doi=10.1037/h0054116}}&lt;/ref&gt; for trait theory classification in [[personality psychology]].

== Definition ==

The notion of a "cluster" cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms.&lt;ref name="estivill"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why so many clustering algorithms – A Position Paper | last = Estivill-Castro | first = Vladimir | journal=ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter |date=20 June 2002 | volume= 4 | issue=1 | pages=65–75 | doi=10.1145/568574.568575}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these "cluster models" is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms. Typical cluster models include:
* ''{{vanchor|Connectivity model}}s'': for example, [[hierarchical clustering]] builds models based on distance connectivity.
* ''{{vanchor|Centroid model}}s'': for example, the [[k-means algorithm]] represents each cluster by a single mean vector.
* ''{{vanchor|Distribution model}}s'': clusters are modeled using statistical distributions, such as [[multivariate normal distribution]]s used by the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]].
* ''{{vanchor|Density model}}s'': for example, [[DBSCAN]] and [[OPTICS]] defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.
* ''{{vanchor|Subspace model}}s'': in [[biclustering]] (also known as co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes.
* ''{{vanchor|Group model}}s'': some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information.
* ''{{vanchor|Graph-based model}}s'': a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]], that is, a subset of nodes in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster. Relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement (a fraction of the edges can be missing) are known as quasi-cliques, as in the [[HCS clustering algorithm]].
* ''{{vanchor|Neural model}}s'': the most well known [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[neural network]] is the [[self-organizing map]] and these models can usually be characterized as similar to one or more of the above models, and including subspace models when neural networks implement a form of [[Principal Component Analysis]] or [[Independent Component Analysis]].

A "clustering" is essentially a set of such clusters, usually containing all objects in the data set. Additionally, it may specify the relationship of the clusters to each other, for example, a hierarchy of clusters embedded in each other. Clusterings can be roughly distinguished as:
* ''{{vanchor|Hard clustering}}'': each object belongs to a cluster or not
* ''{{vanchor|Soft clustering}}'' (also: ''{{vanchor|[[fuzzy clustering]]}}''): each object belongs to each cluster to a certain degree (for example, a likelihood of belonging to the cluster)

There are also finer distinctions possible, for example:

* ''{{vanchor|Strict partitioning clustering}}'': each object belongs to exactly one cluster
* ''{{vanchor|Strict partitioning clustering with outliers}}'': objects can also belong to no cluster, and are considered [[Anomaly detection|outliers]]
* ''{{vanchor|Overlapping clustering}}'' (also: ''alternative clustering'', ''multi-view clustering''): objects may belong to more than one cluster; usually involving hard clusters
* ''{{vanchor|Hierarchical clustering}}'': objects that belong to a child cluster also belong to the parent cluster
* ''{{vanchor|[[Subspace clustering]]}}'': while an overlapping clustering, within a uniquely defined subspace, clusters are not expected to overlap

== Algorithms ==
{{main category|Cluster analysis algorithms}}

As listed above, clustering algorithms can be categorized based on their cluster model. The following overview will only list the most prominent examples of clustering algorithms, as there are possibly over 100 published clustering algorithms. Not all provide models for their clusters and can thus not easily be categorized. An overview of algorithms explained in Wikipedia can be found in the [[List of algorithms#Statistics|list of statistics algorithms]].

There is no objectively "correct" clustering algorithm, but as it was noted, "clustering is in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; The most appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular problem often needs to be chosen experimentally, unless there is a mathematical reason to prefer one cluster model over another. It should be noted that an algorithm that is designed for one kind of model will generally fail on a data set that contains a radically different kind of model.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; For example, k-means cannot find non-convex clusters.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt;

=== Connectivity-based clustering (hierarchical clustering) ===
{{Main|Hierarchical clustering}}
Connectivity-based clustering, also known as ''[[hierarchical clustering]]'', is based on the core idea of objects being more related to nearby objects than to objects farther away. These algorithms connect "objects" to form "clusters" based on their distance. A cluster can be described largely by the maximum distance needed to connect parts of the cluster. At different distances, different clusters will form, which can be represented using a [[dendrogram]], which explains where the common name "hierarchical clustering" comes from: these algorithms do not provide a single partitioning of the data set, but instead provide an extensive hierarchy of clusters that merge with each other at certain distances. In a dendrogram, the y-axis marks the distance at which the clusters merge, while the objects are placed along the x-axis such that the clusters don't mix.

Connectivity-based clustering is a whole family of methods that differ by the way distances are computed. Apart from the usual choice of [[distance function]]s, the user also needs to decide on the linkage criterion (since a cluster consists of multiple objects, there are multiple candidates to compute the distance) to use. Popular choices are known as [[single-linkage clustering]] (the minimum of object distances), [[complete linkage clustering]] (the maximum of object distances), and [[UPGMA]] or [[WPGMA]] ("Unweighted or Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean", also known as average linkage clustering). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (starting with single elements and aggregating them into clusters) or divisive (starting with the complete data set and dividing it into partitions).

These methods will not produce a unique partitioning of the data set, but a hierarchy from which the user still needs to choose appropriate clusters. They are not very robust towards outliers, which will either show up as additional clusters or even cause other clusters to merge (known as "chaining phenomenon", in particular with [[single-linkage clustering]]). In the general case, the complexity is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; for agglomerative clustering and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(2^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; for [[divisive clustering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = Cluster analysis | publisher = Wiley | location = Chichester, West Sussex, U.K | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780470749913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes them too slow for large data sets. For some special cases, optimal efficient methods (of complexity &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;) are known: SLINK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = R. | last = Sibson | title=SLINK: an optimally efficient algorithm for the single-link cluster method | journal=The Computer Journal | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=30–34 | year=1973 | publisher=British Computer Society | url=http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~wkim/index_files/papers/sibson.pdf | doi=10.1093/comjnl/16.1.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for single-linkage and CLINK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = D. | last = Defays | title=An efficient algorithm for a complete link method | journal=The Computer Journal | volume=20 | issue=4 | pages=364–366 | year=1977 | publisher=British Computer Society | doi=10.1093/comjnl/20.4.364}}&lt;/ref&gt; for complete-linkage clustering. In the [[data mining]] community these methods are recognized as a theoretical foundation of cluster analysis, but often considered obsolete{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. They did however provide inspiration for many later methods such as density based clustering.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Centroid-based clustering ===
{{Main|k-means clustering}}
In centroid-based clustering, clusters are represented by a central vector, which may not necessarily be a member of the data set. When the number of clusters is fixed to ''k'', [[k-means clustering|''k''-means clustering]] gives a formal definition as an optimization problem: find the ''k'' cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster center, such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized.

The optimization problem itself is known to be [[NP-hard]], and thus the common approach is to search only for approximate solutions. A particularly well known approximate method is [[Lloyd's algorithm]],&lt;ref name="lloyd"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lloyd | first1 = S. | title = Least squares quantization in PCM | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1982.1056489 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–137 | year = 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; often just referred to as "''k-means algorithm''" (although [[k-means clustering#History|another algorithm introduced this name]]). It does however only find a [[local optimum]], and is commonly run multiple times with different random initializations. Variations of ''k''-means often include such optimizations as choosing the best of multiple runs, but also restricting the centroids to members of the data set ([[K-medoids|''k''-medoids]]), choosing [[median]]s ([[k-medians clustering|''k''-medians clustering]]), choosing the initial centers less randomly ([[k-means++|''k''-means++]]) or allowing a fuzzy cluster assignment ([[Fuzzy clustering|fuzzy c-means]]).

Most ''k''-means-type algorithms require the [[Determining the number of clusters in a data set|number of clusters]] – ''k'' – to be specified in advance, which is considered to be one of the biggest drawbacks of these algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithms prefer clusters of approximately similar size, as they will always assign an object to the nearest centroid. This often leads to incorrectly cut borders of clusters (which is not surprising since the algorithm optimizes cluster centers, not cluster borders).

K-means has a number of interesting theoretical properties. First, it partitions the data space into a structure known as a [[Voronoi diagram]]. Second, it is conceptually close to nearest neighbor classification, and as such is popular in [[machine learning]]. Third, it can be seen as a variation of model based clustering, and Lloyd's algorithm as a variation of the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]] for this model discussed below.

File:KMeans-density-data.svg|K-means cannot represent density-based clusters
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Distribution-based clustering ===
The clustering model most closely related to statistics is based on [[Probability distribution|distribution models]]. Clusters can then easily be defined as objects belonging most likely to the same distribution. A convenient property of this approach is that this closely resembles the way artificial data sets are generated: by sampling random objects from a distribution.

While the theoretical foundation of these methods is excellent, they suffer from one key problem known as [[overfitting]], unless constraints are put on the model complexity. A more complex model will usually be able to explain the data better, which makes choosing the appropriate model complexity inherently difficult.

One prominent method is known as Gaussian mixture models (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]). Here, the data set is usually modeled with a fixed (to avoid overfitting) number of [[Gaussian distribution]]s that are initialized randomly and whose parameters are iteratively optimized to better fit the data set. This will converge to a [[local optimum]], so multiple runs may produce different results. In order to obtain a hard clustering, objects are often then assigned to the Gaussian distribution they most likely belong to; for soft clusterings, this is not necessary.

Distribution-based clustering produces complex models for clusters that can capture [[correlation and dependence]] between attributes. However, these algorithms put an extra burden on the user: for many real data sets, there may be no concisely defined mathematical model (e.g. assuming Gaussian distributions is a rather strong assumption on the data).

Similar to linkage based clustering, it is based on connecting points within certain distance thresholds. However, it only connects points that satisfy a density criterion, in the original variant defined as a minimum number of other objects within this radius. A cluster consists of all density-connected objects (which can form a cluster of an arbitrary shape, in contrast to many other methods) plus all objects that are within these objects' range. Another interesting property of DBSCAN is that its complexity is fairly low – it requires a linear number of range queries on the database – and that it will discover essentially the same results (it is [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] for core and noise points, but not for border points) in each run, therefore there is no need to run it multiple times.

The key drawback of [[DBSCAN]] and [[OPTICS]] is that they expect some kind of density drop to detect cluster borders. On data sets with, for example, overlapping Gaussian distributions – a common use case in artificial data – the cluster borders produced by these algorithms will often look arbitrary, because the cluster density decreases continuously. On a data set consisting of mixtures of Gaussians, these algorithms are nearly always outperformed by methods such as [[Expectation–maximization algorithm|EM clustering]] that are able to precisely model this kind of data.

[[Mean-shift]] is a clustering approach where each object is moved to the densest area in its vicinity, based on [[kernel density estimation]]. Eventually, objects converge to local maxima of density. Similar to k-means clustering, these "density attractors" can serve as representatives for the data set, but mean-shift can detect arbitrary-shaped clusters similar to DBSCAN. Due to the expensive iterative procedure and density estimation, mean-shift is usually slower than DBSCAN or k-Means. Besides that, the applicability of the mean-shift algorithm to multidimensional data is hindered by the unsmooth behaviour of the kernel density estimate, which results in over-fragmentation of cluster tails.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Recent developments ===
In recent years, considerable effort has been put into improving the performance of existing algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = D. | last = Sculley |title=Web-scale k-means clustering |conference=Proc. 19th WWW |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = Z. | year = 1998 | title = Extensions to the ''k''-means algorithm for clustering large data sets with categorical values | url = | journal = Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 283–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are ''CLARANS'' (Ng and Han, 1994),&lt;ref&gt;R. Ng and J. Han. "Efficient and effective clustering method for spatial data mining".

"An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases." In: Proc. Int'l Conf. on Management of Data, ACM SIGMOD, pp. 103–114.&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent need to process larger and larger data sets (also known as [[big data]]), the willingness to trade semantic meaning of the generated clusters for performance has been increasing. This led to the development of pre-clustering methods such as [[canopy clustering algorithm|canopy clustering]], which can process huge data sets efficiently, but the resulting "clusters" are merely a rough pre-partitioning of the data set to then analyze the partitions with existing slower methods such as [[k-means clustering]].

For [[high-dimensional data]], many of the existing methods fail due to the [[curse of dimensionality]], which renders particular distance functions problematic in high-dimensional spaces. This led to new [[clustering high-dimensional data|clustering algorithms for high-dimensional data]] that focus on [[subspace clustering]] (where only some attributes are used, and cluster models include the relevant attributes for the cluster) and [[correlation clustering]] that also looks for arbitrary rotated ("correlated") subspace clusters that can be modeled by giving a [[correlation]] of their attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kriegel|first1=Hans-Peter|authorlink1=Hans-Peter Kriegel|last2=Kröger|first2=Peer|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|authorlink3=Arthur Zimek|title=Subspace clustering|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=July 2012|volume=2|issue=4|pages=351–364|doi=10.1002/widm.1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples for such clustering algorithms are CLIQUE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Agrawal | first1 = R. | last2 = Gehrke | first2 = J. | last3 = Gunopulos | first3 = D. | last4 = Raghavan | first4 = P. | title = Automatic Subspace Clustering of High Dimensional Data | doi = 10.1007/s10618-005-1396-1 | journal = Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | volume = 11 | pages = 5–33 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SUBCLU]].&lt;ref&gt;Karin Kailing, [[Hans-Peter Kriegel]] and Peer Kröger.

== Evaluation and assessment ==
Evaluation (or "validation") of clustering results is as difficult as the clustering itself.&lt;ref name="pfitzner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pfitzner|first1=Darius|last2=Leibbrandt|first2=Richard|last3=Powers|first3=David|date=2009|title=Characterization and evaluation of similarity measures for pairs of clusterings|journal=Knowledge and Information Systems|publisher=Springer|volume=19|pages=361–394|doi=10.1007/s10115-008-0150-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular approaches involve "''internal''" evaluation, where the clustering is summarized to a single quality score, "''external''" evaluation, where the clustering is compared to an existing "ground truth" classification, "''manual''" evaluation by a human expert, and "''indirect''" evaluation by evaluating the utility of the clustering in its intended application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Internal evaluation measures suffer from the problem that they represent functions that themselves can be seen as a clustering objective. For example, one could cluster the data set by the Silhouette coefficient; except that there is no known efficient algorithm for this. By using such an internal measure for evaluation, one rather compares the similarity of the optimization problems,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and not necessarily how useful the clustering is.

External evaluation has similar problems: if we have such "ground truth" labels, then we would not need to cluster; and in practical applications we usually do not have such labels. On the other hand, the labels only reflect one possible partitioning of the data set, which does not imply that there does not exist a different, and maybe even better, clustering.

Neither of these approaches can therefore ultimately judge the actual quality of a clustering, but this needs human evaluation,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Text Mining Handbook: Advanced Approaches in Analyzing Unstructured Data|last=Feldman|first=Ronen|last2=Sanger|first2=James|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|year=|isbn=0521836573|location=|pages=|oclc=915286380}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is highly subjective. Nevertheless, such statistics can be quite informative in identifying bad clusterings,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Text Mining: Predictive Methods for Analyzing Unstructured Information|last=Weiss|first=Sholom M.|last2=Indurkhya|first2=Nitin|last3=Zhang|first3=Tong|last4=Damerau|first4=Fred J.|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=0387954333|location=|pages=|oclc=803401334}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one should not dismiss subjective human evaluation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Internal evaluation ===
{{see also|Determining the number of clusters in a data set}}
When a clustering result is evaluated based on the data that was clustered itself, this is called internal evaluation. These methods usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters. One drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is that high scores on an internal measure do not necessarily result in effective information retrieval applications.&lt;ref name="Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan &amp; Hinrich Schutze"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model. For example, k-means clustering naturally optimizes object distances, and a distance-based internal criterion will likely overrate the resulting clustering.

Therefore, the internal evaluation measures are best suited to get some insight into situations where one algorithm performs better than another, but this shall not imply that one algorithm produces more valid results than another.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; Validity as measured by such an index depends on the claim that this kind of structure exists in the data set. An algorithm designed for some kind of models has no chance if the data set contains a radically different set of models, or if the evaluation measures a radically different criterion.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; For example, k-means clustering can only find convex clusters, and many evaluation indexes assume convex clusters. On a data set with non-convex clusters neither the use of k-means, nor of an evaluation criterion that assumes convexity, is sound.

More than a dozen of internal evaluation measures exist, usually based on the intuition that items in the same cluster should be more similar than items in different clusters.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title=Knowledge Discovery in Databases – Part III – Clustering|date=2017|url=https://dbs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/files/Team/eschubert/lectures/KDDClusterAnalysis17-screen.pdf|place=[[Heidelberg University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|115–121}} For example, the following methods can be used to assess the quality of clustering algorithms based on internal criterion:

* '''[[Davies–Bouldin index]]'''
:The [[Davies–Bouldin index]] can be calculated by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
DB = \frac {1} {n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max_{j\neq i}\left(\frac{\sigma_i + \sigma_j} {d(c_i,c_j)}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
:where n is the number of clusters, &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[centroid]] of cluster &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; is the average distance of all elements in cluster &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to centroid &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(c_i,c_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between centroids &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_j&lt;/math&gt;. Since algorithms that produce clusters with low intra-cluster distances (high intra-cluster similarity) and high inter-cluster distances (low inter-cluster similarity) will have a low Davies–Bouldin index, the clustering algorithm that produces a collection of clusters with the smallest [[Davies–Bouldin index]] is considered the best algorithm based on this criterion.

*'''[[Dunn index]]'''
:The Dunn index aims to identify dense and well-separated clusters. It is defined as the ratio between the minimal inter-cluster distance to maximal intra-cluster distance. For each cluster partition, the Dunn index can be calculated by the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | last = Dunn | first = J.
 | title = Well separated clusters and optimal fuzzy partitions
 | journal = Journal of Cybernetics
 | year = 1974
 | volume = 4
 | pages = 95–104
 | doi = 10.1080/01969727408546059
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
D = \frac{\min_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} d(i,j)}{\max_{1 \leq k \leq n} d^{\prime}(k)} \,,
&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''d''(''i'',''j'') represents the distance between clusters ''i'' and ''j'', and ''d'' '(''k'') measures the intra-cluster distance of cluster ''k''. The inter-cluster distance ''d''(''i'',''j'') between two clusters may be any number of distance measures, such as the distance between the [[centroids]] of the clusters. Similarly, the intra-cluster distance ''d'' '(''k'') may be measured in a variety ways, such as the maximal distance between any pair of elements in cluster ''k''. Since internal criterion seek clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity, algorithms that produce clusters with high Dunn index are more desirable.
* [[Silhouette (clustering)|Silhouette coefficient]]
:The silhouette coefficient contrasts the average distance to elements in the same cluster with the average distance to elements in other clusters. Objects with a high silhouette value are considered well clustered, objects with a low value may be outliers. This index works well with k-means clustering, and is also used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

=== External evaluation ===
In external evaluation, clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering, such as known class labels and external benchmarks. Such benchmarks consist of a set of pre-classified items, and these sets are often created by (expert) humans. Thus, the benchmark sets can be thought of as a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for evaluation.&lt;ref name="pfitzner"/&gt; These types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes. However, it has recently been discussed whether this is adequate for real data, or only on synthetic data sets with a factual ground truth, since classes can contain internal structure, the attributes present may not allow separation of clusters or the classes may contain [[Anomaly detection|anomalies]].&lt;ref name="Faerberetal2010"&gt;{{Cite conference

A number of measures are adapted from variants used to evaluate classification tasks. In place of counting the number of times a class was correctly assigned to a single data point (known as [[true positive]]s), such ''pair counting'' metrics assess whether each pair of data points that is truly in the same cluster is predicted to be in the same cluster.&lt;ref name="pfitzner"/&gt;

As with internal evaluation, several external evaluation measures exist,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|125–129}} for example:
* '''Purity''': Purity is a measure of the extent to which clusters contain a single class.&lt;ref name="Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan &amp; Hinrich Schutze"/&gt; Its calculation can be thought of as follows: For each cluster, count the number of data points from the most common class in said cluster. Now take the sum over all clusters and divide by the total number of data points. Formally, given some set of clusters &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and some set of classes &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, both partitioning &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data points, purity can be defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{m\in M}\max_{d\in D}{|m \cap d|}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Note that this measure doesn't penalize having many clusters. So for example, a purity score of 1 is possible by putting each data point in its own cluster. Also purity doesn't work well for imbalanced data: if a size 1000 dataset consists of two classes, one class contains 999 points and the other has only 1 point. No matter how bad a clustering algorithm performs, it will always give a very high purity value. 
* '''[[Rand measure]]''' (William M. Rand 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:The Rand index computes how similar the clusters (returned by the clustering algorithm) are to the benchmark classifications. One can also view the Rand index as a measure of the percentage of correct decisions made by the algorithm. It can be computed using the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
RI = \frac {TP + TN} {TP + FP + FN + TN}
&lt;/math&gt;
:where  &lt;math&gt;TP&lt;/math&gt; is the number of true positives, &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[true negative]]s, &lt;math&gt;FP&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[false positives]], and &lt;math&gt;FN&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[false negatives]]. One issue with the [[Rand index]] is that [[false positive]]s and [[false negative]]s are equally weighted. This may be an undesirable characteristic for some clustering applications. The F-measure addresses this concern,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018|reason=it does not achieve the same for chance correction as ARI}} as does the chance-corrected [[adjusted Rand index]].
*'''[[F-measure]]'''
:The F-measure can be used to balance the contribution of [[false negative]]s by weighting [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] through a parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Let '''[[precision (information retrieval)|precision]]''' and '''[[recall (information retrieval)|recall]]''' (both external evaluation measures in themselves) be defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac {TP } {TP + FP }
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
R = \frac {TP } {TP + FN}
&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[precision (information retrieval)|precision]] rate and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] rate. We can calculate the F-measure by using the following formula:&lt;ref name="Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan &amp; Hinrich Schutze"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
F_{\beta} = \frac {(\beta^2 + 1)\cdot P \cdot R } {\beta^2 \cdot P + R}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Notice that when &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_{0}=P&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] has no impact on the F-measure when &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;, and increasing &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; allocates an increasing amount of weight to recall in the final F-measure.
:Also note that &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; is not taken into account and can vary from 0 upward without bound.
* '''[[Jaccard coefficient|Jaccard index]]'''
:The Jaccard index is used to quantify the similarity between two datasets. The [[Jaccard coefficient|Jaccard index]] takes on a value between 0 and 1. An index of 1 means that the two dataset are identical, and an index of 0 indicates that the datasets have no common elements. The Jaccard index is defined by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
J(A,B) = \frac {|A \cap B| } {|A \cup B|} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP + FN}
&lt;/math&gt;
:This is simply the number of unique elements common to both sets divided by the total number of unique elements in both sets.
:Also note that &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; is not taken into account and can vary from 0 upward without bound.
* '''[[Sørensen–Dice coefficient|Dice index]]'''
:The Dice symmetric measure doubles the weight on &lt;math&gt;TP&lt;/math&gt; while still ignoring &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; and is equivalent to F1 – the F-measure with &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
DSC = \frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}
&lt;/math&gt;
* '''[[Fowlkes–Mallows Index|Fowlkes–Mallows index]]''' (E. B. Fowlkes &amp; C. L. Mallows 1983)&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Fowlkes &amp; C. L. Mallows (1983), "A Method for Comparing Two Hierarchical Clusterings", Journal of the American Statistical Association 78, 553–569.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Fowlkes–Mallows index computes the similarity between the clusters returned by the clustering algorithm and the benchmark classifications. The higher the value of the Fowlkes–Mallows index the more similar the clusters and the benchmark classifications are. It can be computed using the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
FM = \sqrt{ \frac {TP}{TP+FP} \cdot \frac{TP}{TP+FN}  }

* The '''[[mutual information]]''' is an [[information theory|information theoretic]] measure of how much information is shared between a clustering and a ground-truth classification that can detect a non-linear similarity between two clusterings. [[Adjusted mutual information|Normalized mutual information]] is a family of corrected-for-chance variants of this that has a reduced bias for varying cluster numbers.&lt;ref name = "pfitzner"/&gt;
* '''[[Confusion matrix]]'''
:A confusion matrix can be used to quickly visualize the results of a classification (or clustering) algorithm. It shows how different a cluster is from the gold standard cluster.

=== Cluster tendency ===

To measure cluster tendency is to measure to what degree clusters exist in the data to be clustered, and may be performed as an initial test, before attempting clustering. One way to do this is to compare the data against random data. On average, random data should not have clusters.

*'''[[Hopkins statistic]]'''
:There are multiple formulations of the [[Hopkins statistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; data points in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensional space. Consider a random sample (without replacement) of &lt;math&gt;m \ll n&lt;/math&gt; data points with members &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Also generate a set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; uniformly randomly distributed data points. Now define two distance measures, &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the distance of &lt;math&gt;y_i \in Y&lt;/math&gt; from its nearest neighbor in X and &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the distance of &lt;math&gt;x_i \in X&lt;/math&gt; from its nearest neighbor in X. We then define the Hopkins statistic as:
:&lt;math&gt;
H=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^m{u_i^d}}{\sum_{i=1}^m{u_i^d}+\sum_{i=1}^m{w_i^d}} \,,
&lt;/math&gt;
:With this definition, uniform random data should tend to have values near to 0.5, and clustered data should tend to have values nearer to 1.
:However, data containing just a single Gaussian will also score close to 1, as this statistic measures deviation from a ''uniform'' distribution, not [[Multimodal distribution|multimodality]], making this statistic largely useless in application (as real data never is remotely uniform).

== Applications ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

===Biology, computational biology and bioinformatics===
; [[Plant]] and [[animal]] [[ecology]]
:Cluster analysis is used to describe and to make spatial and temporal comparisons of communities (assemblages) of organisms in heterogeneous environments. It is also used in [[Systematics|plant systematics]] to generate artificial [[Phylogeny|phylogenies]] or clusters of organisms (individuals) at the species, genus or higher level that share a number of attributes.
; [[Transcriptomics]]
:Clustering is used to build groups of [[genes]] with related expression patterns (also known as coexpressed genes) as in [[HCS clustering algorithm]]. Often such groups contain functionally related proteins, such as [[enzyme]]s for a specific [[metabolic pathway|pathway]], or genes that are co-regulated. High throughput experiments using [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs) or [[DNA microarray]]s can be a powerful tool for [[genome annotation]]—a general aspect of [[genomics]].
; [[Sequence analysis]]
:[[Sequence clustering]] is used to group homologous sequences into [[list of gene families|gene families]]. This is a very important concept in [[bioinformatics]], and [[evolutionary biology]] in general. See evolution by [[gene duplication]].
; High-throughput [[genotype|genotyping]] platforms
:Clustering algorithms are used to automatically assign genotypes.
; [[Human genetic clustering]]
:The similarity of genetic data is used in clustering to infer population structures.

===[[Medicine]]===
; [[Medical imaging]]
:On [[PET scan]]s, cluster analysis can be used to differentiate between different types of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in a three-dimensional image for many different purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Filipovych |first1=Roman |last2=Resnick |first2=Susan M. |last3=Davatzikos |first3=Christos|title=Semi-supervised Cluster Analysis of Imaging Data |journal=NeuroImage |date=2011|volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=2185–2197 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.074|pmc=3008313 |pmid=20933091}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Analysis of antimicrobial activity
:Cluster analysis can be used to analyse patterns of antibiotic resistance, to classify antimicrobial compounds according to their mechanism of action, to classify antibiotics according to their antibacterial activity.
; IMRT segmentation
:Clustering can be used to divide a fluence map into distinct regions for conversion into deliverable fields in MLC-based Radiation Therapy.

===Business and marketing===
; [[Market research]]
:Cluster analysis is widely used in market research when working with multivariate data from [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and test panels. Market researchers use cluster analysis to partition the general [[population]] of [[consumer]]s into market segments and to better understand the relationships between different groups of consumers/potential [[customers]], and for use in [[market segmentation]], [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]], [[new product development]] and selecting test markets.
; Grouping of shopping items
:Clustering can be used to group all the shopping items available on the web into a set of unique products. For example, all the items on eBay can be grouped into unique products (eBay does not have the concept of a [[Stock-keeping unit|SKU]]).

===[[World wide web]]===
; Social network analysis
:In the study of [[social network]]s, clustering may be used to recognize [[communities]] within large groups of people.
; Search result grouping
:In the process of intelligent grouping of the files and websites, clustering may be used to create a more relevant set of search results compared to normal search engines like [[Google]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. There are currently a number of web-based clustering tools such as [[Clusty]]. It also may be used to return a more comprehensive set of results in cases where a search term could refer to vastly different things. Each distinct use of the term corresponds to a unique cluster of results, allowing a ranking algorithm to return comprehensive results by picking the top result from each cluster.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"&gt;Antonio Di Marco - Roberto Navigili,[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/COLI_a_00148#.VW4sDc_tmko "Clustering and Diversifying Web Search Results with Graph Based Word Sense Induction"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
; Slippy map optimization
:[[Flickr]]'s map of photos and other map sites use clustering to reduce the number of markers on a map. This makes it both faster and reduces the amount of visual clutter.

===[[Computer science]]===
; [[Software evolution]]
:Clustering is useful in software evolution as it helps to reduce legacy properties in code by reforming functionality that has become dispersed. It is a form of restructuring and hence is a way of direct preventative maintenance.
; [[Image segmentation]]
:Clustering can be used to divide a [[Digital data|digital]] [[image]] into distinct regions for [[border detection]] or [[object recognition]].&lt;ref name="panSearch"&gt;Bewley, A., &amp; Upcroft, B.

In Australian Conference on Robotics and Automation [http://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2013/papers/pap148s1-file1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Evolutionary algorithms]]
:Clustering may be used to identify different niches within the population of an evolutionary algorithm so that reproductive opportunity can be distributed more evenly amongst the evolving species or subspecies.
; [[Recommender systems]]
:Recommender systems are designed to recommend new items based on a user's tastes.  They sometimes use clustering algorithms to predict a user's preferences based on the preferences of other users in the user's cluster.
; [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Markov chain Monte Carlo methods]]
:Clustering is often utilized to locate and characterize extrema in the target distribution.
; [[Anomaly detection]]
:Anomalies/outliers are typically – be it explicitly or implicitly – defined with respect to clustering structure in data.
; [[Natural language processing]]
:Clustering can be used to resolve [[lexical ambiguity]].&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"/&gt;

===Social science===
; Crime analysis
:Cluster analysis can be used to identify areas where there are greater incidences of particular types of crime. By identifying these distinct areas or "hot spots" where a similar crime has happened over a period of time, it is possible to manage law enforcement resources more effectively.
; [[Educational data mining]]
:Cluster analysis is for example used to identify groups of schools or students with similar properties.
; Typologies
:From poll data, projects such as those undertaken by the Pew Research Center use cluster analysis to discern typologies of opinions, habits, and demographics that may be useful in politics and marketing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="899">Since 2009, Argentina is not observing [[daylight saving time]] (DST) and the entire country stays on [[UTC-03:00]].

[[San Luis Province]], which was previously in a different time zone than most of the country and which formerly observed DST, decided in April 2010 not to change its clocks back and to stay on UTC-3 all year round.

The most recent history of Argentina observing DST was from 2007 to 2009. After a period of not observing DST, [[Argentina]] observed DST in some provinces in an attempt to save energy. For each period, the executive branch of the government set the specific start and end dates for DST, i.e. there was no fixed annual schedule.

'''Douglas''' (occasionally spelled ''[[Douglass (surname)|Douglass]]'') is a common surname of [[Scotland|Scottish]] origin, thought to derive from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] ''dubh glas'', meaning "black stream". There are numerous places in Scotland from which the surname is derived. The surname has developed into the [[given name]] ''[[Douglas (given name)|Douglas]]''. ''Douglas'' is a habitational name, which could be derived from any of the many places so-named. While there are numerous places with this name in Scotland, it is thought, in most cases, to refer to [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire]], the location of [[Douglas Castle]], the chief stronghold of the [[Earl of Douglas|Lords of Douglas]].&lt;ref name="a-last1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/default.aspx? |title=Learn about the family history of your surname |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Ancestry.com]] |accessdate=6 April 2010}} which cited {{cite book |title=Dictionary of American Family Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-508137-4 }} for the surname "Douglas".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Gaelic]] form of the given name is ''Dùbhghlas''; the [[Irish language]] form it is ''Dúghlas'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Irish Christian names: an A-Z of first names |author=Coghlan, Ronan |publisher=Johnston and Bacon |year=1979 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dubhghlas'', which are pronounced {{IPA-ga|duːɣləs}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A World of Baby Names |edition=Revised |author=Norman, Teresa |publisher=Perigee |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-399-52894-1 |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Fraser Black, in southern [[Argyllshire]] the surname is an [[Anglicised]] form of the surnames ''MacLucas'', ''MacLugash'' (which are derived from the Gaelic ''Mac Lùcais'').&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{citation |last=Black |first=George Fraser |title=The Surnames of Scotland: Their Origin, Meaning, and History |publisher=[[New York Public Library]] |location=New York |year=1946 |pages=217–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counts Douglas in continental Europe==

Field Marshal [[Robert Douglas, Count of Skenninge|Robert Douglas]] was firstly created baron, and then count, in Sweden. His main fief was the town of [[Skänninge]], and his wife brought in the estate where they had the manor of [[Stjärnorp Castle|Stjernorp]] erected. His descendants generally continued to reside in Sweden, some offshoots to Russia, Germany etc. The head of the house received in 1848 the title of Count (count of the entail of [[Mühlhausen]]) also in peerage of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].
The main lineage did not produce long-lasting branches (except the Russian branch, a few generations), until the ''[[riksmarskalk]]'' of Sweden (High Marshal), [[Ludvig Douglas|Count Ludvig Douglas]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the late 1800s, had several sons and yet more grandsons. Branches starting from his sons and so:

* von Douglas-Langenstein, descendants of count Robert, eldest son of the High Marshal Ludvig. They hold the castle of [[Langenstein Castle|Langenstein]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany
* von Reischach-Douglas, a cadet grandson of said count Robert
* Douglas-Gerstorp, the branch (settled to Sweden) descending from the youngest son of said Robert
* Douglas-Stjernorp, the branch descending from the Swedish general [[Archibald Douglas (1883–1960)|Archibald Douglas]], second son of the High Marshal Ludvig. In this branch, there's the castle of Stjärnorp, reacquired to the family in c. 1875
** [[Rosita Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Countess Dagmar Rosita Astrid Libertas Douglas-Stjernorp]] (born 1943), British artist and former wife the 11th Duke of Marlborough.
** [[Princess Elisabeth, Duchess in Bavaria]] (born 1940), heir presumptive to both the former Bavarian Royal House and the Jacobite Succession
** [[Gustaf Douglas|Count Gustaf Archibald Siegwart Douglas]] (born 1938), a Swedish businessman and politician
** [[Archibald Douglas (1883–1960)|Count Vilhelm Archibald Douglas]] (1883–1960), a Swedish nobleman and soldier
* Douglas-Kolfall, the branch descending from Oscar, youngest son of the High Marshal Ludvig.

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], a '''factorial moment measure''' is a [[mathematical]] quantity, [[Function (mathematics)|function]] or, more precisely, [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]  that is defined in relation to [[mathematical objects]] known as [[point process]]es, which are types of [[stochastic processes]] often used as [[mathematical model]]s of physical phenomena representable as [[random]]ly positioned [[Point (geometry)|points]] in [[time]], [[space]] or both. Moment measures generalize the idea of [[factorial moment]]s, which are useful for studying [[non-negative]] [[integer]]-valued [[random variables]].&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"&gt;D. J. Daley and D. Vere-Jones. ''An introduction to the theory of point processes. Vol. I''. Probability and its Applications (New York). Springer, New York, second edition, 2003.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first factorial moment measure of a point process coincides with its [[Moment_measure#First_moment_measure|first moment measure]] or ''intensity measure'',&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; which gives the [[Expected value|expected]]  or [[average]] number of points of the point process located in some region of space. In general, if the number of points in some region is considered as a random variable, then the moment factorial measure of this region is the factorial moment of this random variable.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"&gt;D. Stoyan, W. S. Kendall, J. Mecke, and L. Ruschendorf. ''Stochastic geometry and its applications'', volume 2. Wiley Chichester, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Factorial moment measures completely characterize a wide class of point processes, which means they can be used to uniquely identify a point process.

If a factorial moment measure is [[absolutely continuous]], then with respect to the [[Lebesgue measure]] it is said to have a ''density'' (which is a generalized form of a [[derivative]]), and this density is known by a number of names including '''factorial moment density''', '''product density''', '''coincidence density''',&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"/&gt; '''joint intensity'''&lt;ref name="hough2006determinantal"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Hough, J Ben, Krishnapur, Manjunath, Peres, Yuval, Vir{\'a}g, B{\'a}lint| title=Determinantal processes and independence| journal=Probability Surveys| year=2006| volume=3| pages=206–229| accessdate=| doi=10.1214/154957806000000078| arxiv=math/0503110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The first and second factorial moment densities of a point process are used in the definition of the ''pair correlation function'', which gives a way to statistically quantify the strength of interaction or [[correlation]] between points of a point process.&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"&gt;A.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point process notation==
{{Main|Point process notation}}

Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying [[mathematical space]]. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in space, time or both, the underlying space is usually ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] denoted here by '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;, but they can be defined on more [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstract]] mathematical spaces.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"/&gt;

Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of [[point process notation]].&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Błaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume II – Applications'', volume 4, No 1–2 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by ''N'', then this can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in {N},&lt;/math&gt;

and represents the point process being interpreted as a random [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. Alternatively, the number of points of ''N'' located in some [[Borel set]] ''B'' is often written as:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}(B), &lt;/math&gt;

which reflects a [[random measure]] interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baccelli|first1=François|title=Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks: Volume I Theory|journal=Foundations and Trends® in Networking|volume=3|issue=3-4|year=2009|pages=249–449|issn=1554-057X|doi=10.1561/1300000006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===''n'' th factorial power of a point process===

For some positive [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n=1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th factorial power of a point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {N}^{(n)}(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n)= \sum_{(x_1\neq\dots\neq x_n)\in {N} } \prod_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}_{B_i}(x_i) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B_1,...,B_n&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of not necessarily [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] Borel sets in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;, which form an &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-fold [[Cartesian product]] of sets denoted by:

:&lt;math&gt; B_1\times\cdots\times B_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; denotes an [[indicator function]] such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{1}_{B_1} &lt;/math&gt;is a [[Dirac measure]] for the set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B_n&lt;/math&gt;. The [[summation]] in the above expression is performed over all &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-[[tuples]] of distinct points, including [[permutations]], which can be contrasted with the definition of the [[Moment measure#n-th power of a point process|''n''-th power of a point process]]. The symbol  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Pi&lt;/math&gt; denotes  [[multiplication#Capital Pi notation|multiplication]] while the existence of various [[point process notation]] means that the ''n''-th factorial power of a point process is sometimes defined using other notation.&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

===''n'' th factorial moment measure===

The ''n'' th factorial moment measure or ''n'' th order factorial moment measure is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; M^{(n)}(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n)=E [{N}^{(n)}(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n)], &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''E'' denotes the [[Expected value|expectation]] ([[Operator (mathematics)#Probability theory|operator]]) of the point process ''N''. In other words, the ''n''-th factorial moment measure is the expectation of the ''n'' th factorial power of some point process.

The ''n'' th factorial moment measure of a point process ''N'' is equivalently defined&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{R}^{n d}}f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)  M^{(n)}(dx_1,\ldots,dx_n)=E \left[ \sum_{(x_1\neq\cdots\neq x_n)\in {N} } f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)   \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is any non-negative [[measurable function]] on &lt;math&gt; \textbf{R}^{n d}&lt;/math&gt;, and the above summation is performed over all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tuples of distinct points, including permutations. Consequently, the factorial moment measure is defined such that there are no points repeating in the product set,  as opposed to the moment measure.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"/&gt;

===First factorial moment measure===

The first factorial moment measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle M^1&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the [[Moment measure#First moment measure|first moment measure]]:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M^{(1)}(B)=M^1(B)=E [{N}(B)], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle M^1&lt;/math&gt; is known, among other terms, as the ''intensity measure''&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; or ''mean measure'',&lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"&gt;J. F. C. Kingman. ''Poisson processes'', volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992.

&lt;/ref&gt; and is interpreted as the expected number of points of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; found or located in the set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;

===Second factorial moment measure===

The second factorial moment measure for two Borel sets &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; M^{(2)}(A\times B)=M^2(A\times B)-M^1(A\cap B). &lt;/math&gt;

==Name explanation==

For some Borel set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;, the namesake of this measure is revealed when the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n\,&lt;/math&gt;th factorial moment measure reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; M^{(n)}(B\times\cdots\times B)=E [{N}(B)({N}(B)-1)\cdots ({N}(B)-n+1)], &lt;/math&gt;

which is the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n\,&lt;/math&gt;-th [[factorial moment]] of the random variable &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

==Factorial moment density==

If a factorial moment measure is [[absolutely continuous]], then it has a density (or more precisely, a [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] or density) with respect to the [[Lebesgue measure]] and this density is known as the ''factorial moment density'' or ''product density'', ''joint intensity'', ''correlation function'', or ''multivariate frequency spectrum''. Denoting the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th factorial moment density by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mu^{(n)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;,  it is defined in respect to the equation:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M^{(n)}(B_1\times\ldots\times B_n)=\int_{B_1}\cdots\int_{B_n}\mu^{(n)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) dx_1\cdots dx_n. &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, this means the following expression

:&lt;math&gt; E \left[ \sum_{(x_1\neq\cdots\neq x_n)\in {N} } f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \right]= \int_{\textbf{R}^{n d}} f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)  \mu^{(n)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) dx_1\cdots dx_n, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f&lt;/math&gt; is any non-negative [[Bounded function|bounded]] measurable function defined on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^{ n}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Pair correlation function==
In spatial statistics and stochastic geometry, to measure the statistical [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] relationship between points of a point process, the ''pair correlation function'' of a point process &lt;math&gt;{N}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(x_1,x_2)=\frac{\mu^{(2)}(x_1,x_2)}{\mu^{(1)}(x_1) \mu^{(1)}(x_2) }, &lt;/math&gt;

where the points &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\in R^d &lt;/math&gt;. In general, &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1,x_2)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; whereas  &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1,x_2)=1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to no correlation (between points) in the typical statistical sense.&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Poisson point process===

For a [[Poisson point process#General Poisson point process|general Poisson point process]] with intensity measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th factorial moment measure is given by the expression:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M^{(n)}(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n)=\prod_{i=1}^n[\Lambda(B_i)], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the intensity measure or first moment measure of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt;, which for some Borel set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda(B)=M^1(B)=E[{N}(B)]. &lt;/math&gt;

For a [[Poisson point process#Homogeneous Poisson point process|homogeneous Poisson point process]]  the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th factorial moment measure is simply:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M^{(n)}(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n)=\lambda^n \prod_{i=1}^n |B_i|, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |B_i|&lt;/math&gt; is the length, area, or volume (or more generally, the [[Lebesgue measure]]) of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th factorial moment density is:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^{(n)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\lambda^n. &lt;/math&gt;

The pair-correlation function of the homogeneous Poisson point process is simply

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(x_1,x_2)=1, &lt;/math&gt;

which reflects the lack of interaction between points of this point process.

==Factorial moment expansion==

The expectations of general [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]s of simple point processes, provided some certain mathematical conditions, have (possibly infinite) expansions or [[Series (mathematics)|series]] consisting of the corresponding factorial moment measures.&lt;ref name="fme"&gt;B. Blaszczyszyn. Factorial-moment expansion for stochastic systems. ''Stoch. Proc. Appl.'', 56:321–335, 1995.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fme_marked"&gt;D. P. Kroese and V. Schmidt. Light-traffic analysis for queues with spatially distributed arrivals. ''Mathematics of Operations Research'', 21(1):pp. 135–157, 1996.

&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the [[Taylor series]], which consists of a series of [[derivative]]s of some function, the ''n''th factorial moment measure plays the roll as that of the ''n'' th derivative the Taylor series.  In other words, given a general functional ''f'' of some simple point process, then this [[Taylor's theorem|Taylor-like theorem]] for non-Poisson point processes means an expansion exists for the expectation of the function ''E'', provided some mathematical condition is satisfied, which ensures convergence of the expansion.

[[File:Apis mellifera Tanzania.jpg|thumb|[[European honey bee]] collecting nectar and pollen]]
[[File:Apis mellifera flying.jpg|thumb|European honey bee flies back to the hive after collecting pollen. Pollen is temporarily stored in [[pollen basket]]s]]

For [[bee]]s, their '''forage''' or food supply consists of [[nectar]] and [[pollen]] from [[flower|blooming]] [[plant]]s within flight range. The forage sources for [[Western honey bee|honey bee]]s are an important consideration for [[beekeeper]]s.   In order to determine where to locate hives for maximum [[honey]] production and [[brood (honeybee)|brood]] one must consider the off-season. If there are no honey flows the bees may have to be fed. Bees that are used for pollination are usually fed in the holding yards. Forage is also significant for [[pollination management]] with other bee species.
Nectar contains [[sugar]]s that are the primary source of energy for the bees' wing [[muscle]]s and for heat for honey bee colonies for winter. Pollen provides the [[protein]] and [[trace mineral]]s that are mostly fed to the brood in order to replace bees lost in the normal course of life cycle and colony activity.

As a rule of thumb the foraging area around a [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]] extends for {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}}, although bees have been observed foraging twice and three times this distance from the hive. Experiments have shown that beehives within 4 miles of a food source will gain weight, but beyond that the energy expended is greater than that gained during the foraging flight.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, JE, The flight range of the honeybee, Journal of Agricultural Research, v. 47, no. 8, p 257-285 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Foraging at extreme distances wears out the wings of individual bees, reduces the life expectancy of foraging bees and therefore the efficiency of the colony.
The minimum temperature for active honeybee foraging is approximately {{convert|55|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Full foraging activity is not achieved until the temperature rises to {{convert|66|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. There are small differences in the races of the [[Western honey bee]]s at what temperature they will start foraging.

The main [[nectar source]] and main [[pollen source]] differ widely with the [[latitude]], region, [[season]] and type of vegetation. Bees are able to communicate direction and distance of a food source by means of the [[round dance (honey bee)|round dance]], [[waggle dance]] and shaking signals.

In addition to nectar and pollen, honey bees may forage for a [[honeydew source]] in certain coniferous trees and on [[oak]]s.
One Queen bee is essential to every hive as the only individual who can lay fertilized eggs necessary to rear workers and new queens and therefore continuation of the species.

[[File:Ireland (MODIS).jpg|thumb|Ireland is sometimes known as the "Emerald Isle" because of its green landscape, as can be seen in this satellite image.]]
&lt;!-- As it is hard to use this article's title (so it can be bolded), it's better to omit it. This is perfectly OK per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]]/Descriptive titles, and the article became featured in such a state. --&gt;

[[:Ireland]] is an island in [[Northwestern Europe]] in the north Atlantic Ocean. The island lies on the European continental shelf, part of the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The island's main [[geography|geographical]] features include low central [[plain]]s surrounded by coastal mountains. The highest peak is [[Carrauntoohil]] ({{lang-ga|Corrán Tuathail}}), which is {{convert|1041|meters|feet|0}} above sea level. The western [[coast]]line is rugged, with many islands, [[peninsula]]s, [[headlands and bays]]. The island is bisected by the [[River Shannon]], which at {{convert|360.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|102.1|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} [[estuary]] is the longest river in Ireland and flows south from [[County Cavan]] in [[Ulster]] to meet the Atlantic just south of [[Limerick]]. There are a number of sizeable lakes along Ireland's rivers, of which [[Lough Neagh]] is the largest.

Politically, the island consists of the [[Republic of Ireland]], with jurisdiction over about five-sixths of the island; and [[Northern Ireland]], a [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] (and an unconfirmed [[Enclave and exclave#"Practical" enclaves, exclaves and inaccessible districts|"practical" exclave]]) of the [[United Kingdom]], with jurisdiction over the remaining sixth. Located west of the island of Great Britain, it is located at approximately {{coord|53|N|8|W|type:isle|display=inline,title}}. It has a total area of {{convert|84421|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="irlgov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ie/en/essays/geography.html |title=Geography of Ireland |publisher=[[Government of Ireland]] |accessdate=15 October 2009 |last=Nolan |first=Professor William |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124012641/http://www.gov.ie/en/essays/geography.html |archivedate=24 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is separated from Great Britain by the [[Irish Sea]] and from [[mainland Europe]] by the [[Celtic Sea]].
Ireland and Great Britain, together with nearby islands, are known collectively as the [[British Isles]]; as [[British Isles naming dispute|the term British Isles is controversial]] in relation to Ireland, the alternative term 'Britain and Ireland' is increasingly preferred.&lt;ref name="postwarculture"&gt;{{citation|first1=Alistair|last1=Davies|first2=Alan|last2=Sinfield|title=British Culture of the Postwar: An Introduction to Literature and Society, 1945–1999|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-12811-0|page=9|quote=Many of the Irish dislike the 'British' in 'British Isles', while the Welsh and Scottish are not keen on 'Great Britain'. ...

==Geological development==
{{main article|Geology of Ireland}}

[[File:SlieveLeague1.jpg|thumb|[[Slieve League]] in western [[Banagh]]]]
The geology of Ireland is diverse. Different regions contain rocks belonging to different geologic periods, dating as far back almost 2 billion years. The oldest known Irish [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on [[Inishtrahull Island]] off the north coast of [[Inishowen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Synopsis (Inishtrahull) |publisher=National Parks and Wildlife Service |url=http://www.npws.ie/en/media/Media,3875,en.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121447/http://www.npws.ie/en/media/Media%2C3875%2Cen.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geological History of Britain and Ireland |last=Woodcock |first=N.

Ireland's geologic history covers everything from [[volcanism]] and tropical seas to the [[last glacial period]]. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics and the effect of ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed can be seen as a result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Foster | first = John Wilson | authorlink =  |author2=Helena C. G.

Lion's share of Ireland has with most likehood been above sea level during the [[Cenozoic|last 60 million years]]. As such its landscapes have been shaped by [[erosion]] and [[weathering]] on land.&lt;ref name="SimmsCoxon"/&gt; Protracted erosion does also means most of the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by [[Quaternary]] deposits.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1980&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=G.F. |date=1980 |title=The search for Tertiary Ireland |url= |journal=Journal of earth sciences Royal Dublin Society |volume=3 |pages=13–33 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Quaternary glaciation]]s affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered [[regolith]] on the uplands and [[karst]] in the lowlands.&lt;ref name="SimmsCoxon"/&gt; There have been some controversy regarding the origin of the [[planation surface]]s found on Ireland.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1980/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=A.A.  |date=1955 |title=The origin of the South Ireland Peneplane |url= |journal=Irish Geography |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=79-86 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some have argued for an origin in [[marine planation]] others regard these surfaces as [[peneplain]]s formed by weathering and [[cycle of erosion|fluvial erosion]].

==Physical geography==

===Mountain ranges===
{{see also|List of mountains in Ireland}}
[[File:Ireland physical medium.png|thumb|Mountains, lakes, rivers and other physical features of Ireland are shown on this map. ([[:Image:Ireland physical large.png|large version]]).]]

Ireland consists of a mostly flat low-lying area in the midlands, ringed by mountain ranges such as (beginning in County Kerry and working counter-clockwise) the [[Macgillycuddy's Reeks]], [[Comeragh Mountains]], [[Blackstairs Mountains]], [[Wicklow Mountains]], [[Mourne Mountains|the Mournes]], [[Glens of Antrim]], [[Sperrin Mountains]], [[Bluestack Mountains]], [[Derryveagh Mountains]], [[Ox Mountains]], [[Nephinbeg Mountains]] and the [[Twelve Bens]]/[[Maumturks]] group. Some mountain ranges are further inland in the south of Ireland, such as the [[Galtee Mountains]] (the highest inland range),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glen of Aherlow |publisher=Glen of Aherlow Fáilte Society|url=http://aherlow.com/walking/|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silvermine Mountains|Silvermine]] and [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]]. The highest peak [[Carrauntoohil]], 1,038&amp;nbsp;m (3,405&amp;nbsp;ft) high,&lt;ref name="OSIFAQS"/&gt; is in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, a range of glacier-carved sandstone mountains.

===Rivers and lakes===
{{see also|List of rivers in Ireland|List of loughs in Ireland}}
[[File:NunsTurgesius Castle isles Lough Lene.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lough Lene]], County Westmeath]]
The main river in Ireland is the [[River Shannon]]. {{convert|360.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} The longest river in Ireland, it separates the midlands of Ireland from the west of the island.  The river develops into three lakes along its course, [[Lough Allen]], [[Lough Ree]], and [[Lough Derg (Shannon)|Lough Derg]]. Of these, Lough Derg is the largest.&lt;ref name="OSIFAQS"/&gt; The River Shannon enters the Atlantic Ocean after [[Limerick]] city at the [[Shannon Estuary]]. Other major rivers include the [[River Liffey]], [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]], [[Munster Blackwater|River Blackwater]], [[River Nore]], [[River Suir]], [[River Barrow]], [[River Bann]], [[River Foyle]], [[River Erne]], and [[River Boyne]] (see the [[list of rivers in Ireland]]).

[[Lough Neagh]], in Ulster,&lt;ref name="OSIFAQS"/&gt; is the largest lake in Ireland and Britain. Other large lakes include [[Lough Erne]] and [[Lough Corrib]].&lt;ref name="OSIFAQS"/&gt;

===Inlets===
[[File:Topography Ireland.jpg|thumb|[[Topography]] of Ireland]]

[[File:Killary Harbour.jpg|thumb|left|[[Killary Harbour]] forms a natural border between [[County Galway|Galway]] and [[County Mayo|Mayo]] for 16km]]
Beginning with County Donegal, [[Lough Swilly]] separates one side of the [[Inishowen peninsula]]. [[Lough Foyle]] on the other side, is one of Ireland's larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and [[County Londonderry]].&lt;ref name="donegal"&gt;{{cite web | last= Joyce | first = P.W. | title = Description of County Donegal | work = Atlas and Cyclopedia of Ireland | publisher =   | year = 1900 | url = http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Donegal.php | accessdate = 2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further round the coast is [[Belfast Lough]], between County Antrim and County Down.&lt;ref name="down"&gt;{{cite web | last= Joyce | first = P.W. | title = Description of County Down | work = Atlas and Cyclopedia of Ireland | publisher =   | year = 1900 | url = http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Down.php | accessdate = 2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in County Down is [[Strangford Lough]], actually an inlet partially separating the [[Ards peninsula]] from the mainland. Further down the coast, [[Carlingford Lough]] is situated between Down and [[County Louth]].&lt;ref name="down"/&gt;

[[Dublin Bay]] is the next sizeable inlet, while the eastern coast of Ireland is mostly uniform until [[Wexford Harbour]] at the mouth of the [[River Slaney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Joyce | first = P.W. | title = Description of County Wexford | work = Atlas and Cyclopedia of Ireland | publisher =   | year = 1900 | url = http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Wexford.php | accessdate = 2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the southern coast, [[Waterford Harbour]] is situated at the mouth of the [[River Suir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Joyce | first = P.W. | title = Description of County Waterford | work = Atlas and Cyclopedia of Ireland | publisher =   | year = 1900 | url = http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Waterford.php | accessdate = 2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (into which the other two of the [[The Three Sisters (Ireland)|Three Sisters]] ([[River Nore]] and [[River Barrow]]) flow). The next major inlet is [[Cork Harbour]], at the mouth of the River Lee, in which [[Great Island]] is situated.

[[Dunmanus Bay]], [[Kenmare River|Kenmare estuary]] and [[Dingle Bay]] are all inlets between the peninsulas of [[County Kerry]]. North of these is the [[Shannon Estuary]]. Between north County Clare and County Galway is [[Galway Bay]]. [[Clew Bay]] is located on the coast of [[County Mayo]], south of [[Achill Island]], while [[Broadhaven Bay]], [[Blacksod Bay]] and [[Sruth Fada Conn]] bays are situated in northwest Connacht, in North Mayo. [[Killala Bay]] is on the northeast coast of Mayo. [[Donegal Bay]] is a major inlet between County Donegal and [[County Sligo]].&lt;ref name="donegal"/&gt;

===Headlands===
[[Malin Head]] is the most northerly point in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Malin Head | work = Weather Observing Stations | publisher = [[Met Éireann]] | url = http://www.met.ie/about/weatherobservingstations/malinhead.asp | accessdate = 2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mizen Head]] is one of the [[Extreme points of Ireland|most southern points]], hence the term "Malin head to Mizen head" (or the reverse) is used for anything applying to the island of Ireland as a whole. [[Carnsore Point]] is another [[extreme points of Ireland|extreme point of Ireland]], being the southeastern most point of Ireland. Further along the coast is [[Hook Head]] while the [[Old Head of Kinsale]] is one of many headlands along the south coast of Ireland.

[[Loop Head]] is the headland at which County Clare comes to a point on the west coast of Ireland, with the Atlantic on the north, and further inland on the south, the Shannon estuary. [[Hag's Head]] is another headland further up Clare's north/western coastline, with the [[Cliffs of Moher]] along the coastline north of the point.

[[Erris Head]] is the northwesternmost point of [[Connacht]].

===Islands and peninsulas===
{{see also|List of islands of Ireland}}
[[File:Dingle Peninsula.jpg|thumb|left|Dingle Peninsula as viewed from [[Banna Strand]]]]
Apart from Ireland itself, Achill Island to its northwest is now considered the largest island in the group. The island is inhabited, and is connected to the mainland by a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oileain: A Guide to the Irish Islands |last=Walsh |first=David |author2=Sean Pierce |year=2004 |publisher=Pesda Press |isbn=0-9531956-9-4 |page= 158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the next largest islands are the [[Aran Islands]], off the coast of southern [[Connacht]], host to an Irish-speaking community, or [[Gaeltacht]]. [[Valentia Island]] off the [[Iveragh peninsula]] is also one of Ireland's larger islands, and is relatively settled, as well as being connected by a bridge at its southeastern end.  [[Omey Island]], off the coast of [[Connemara]] is a [[tidal island]].

Some of the best-known peninsulas in Ireland are in County Kerry; the [[Dingle peninsula]], the aforementioned Iveragh peninsula and the [[Beara peninsula]]. The [[Ards peninsula]] is one of the larger peninsulas outside Kerry. The [[Inishowen]] peninsula in County Donegal includes Ireland's most northerly point, Malin Head and several important towns including [[Buncrana]] on [[Lough Swilly]], [[Carndonagh]] and [[Moville]] on [[Lough Foyle]]. Ireland's most northerly land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head. [[Rockall]] Island may deserve this honour but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, [[Denmark]] (for the [[Faroe Islands]]) and [[Iceland]]. The most southerly point is the [[Fastnet Rock]].

The [[Hebrides]] off [[Geography of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Anglesey]] off [[Geography of Wales|Wales]] were grouped with Ireland ("[[Hibernia]]") by the [[Greek people|Greco]]-[[Ancient Romans|Roman]] [[Ancient Greek geography|geographer]] [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Ptolemy]] |title=[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geog.]] |at=Bk. 2, Ch. 1 &amp; 2 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is no longer common.

{{main article|Climate of Ireland}}

The [[climate of Ireland]] is mild, moist and changeable with abundant [[rainfall]] and a lack of [[temperature extremes]].

It is considerably warmer than other areas at the same [[latitude]] on the other side of the Atlantic, such as in [[Newfoundland]], because it lies downwind of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is also warmer than maritime climates near the same latitude, such as the [[Pacific Northwest]] as a result of heat released by the Atlantic overturning circulation that includes the [[North Atlantic Current]] and [[Gulf Stream]]. For comparison, [[Dublin]] is 9&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] in Newfoundland in winter and 4&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than [[Seattle]] in the Pacific Northwest in winter.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, G.

The influence of the North Atlantic Current also ensures the coastline of Ireland remains ice-free throughout the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationinireland.com/en/Living-in-Ireland/Before-Arrival/Climate/|title=Climate|publisher=Education in Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate in Ireland does not experience extreme weather, with tornadoes and similar weather features being rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exceptional weather events |work= |publisher=Met Éireann |date=March 1995 |url=https://www.met.ie/climate-ireland/weather-events/Mar1995_Tornado.PDF |accessdate=14 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023215536/http://www.met.ie/climate-ireland/weather-events/Mar1995_Tornado.PDF |archive-date=23 October 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Met Éireann Weather Warning System Explained |publisher=Met Éireann |date=2017 |url=https://www.met.ie/nationalwarnings/warnings-explained.asp |accessdate=14 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ireland is prone to eastward moving cyclones which come in from the North atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Devoy, R.J.N.

The prevailing wind comes from the southwest, breaking on the high mountains of the west coast.&lt;ref name="marine climatology"/&gt; Rainfall is therefore a particularly prominent part of western Irish life, with [[Valentia Island]], off the west coast of [[County Kerry]], getting almost twice as much annual rainfall as Dublin on the east ({{convert|1400|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} vs. {{convert|762|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rainfall in Ireland |work=Climate |publisher=Met Éireann |date=2017 |url=http://www.met.ie/climate-ireland/rainfall.asp |accessdate=14 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929153142/http://www.met.ie/climate-ireland/rainfall.asp |archive-date=29 September 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an administrative viewpoint, 21 of the counties in the republic are units of local government. The other six have more than one local council area, producing a total of 31 county-level authorities. [[County Tipperary]] had two [[Riding (country subdivision)#Ireland|ridings]], [[North Tipperary]] and [[South Tipperary]], originally established in 1838, renamed in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Callanan |first=Mark |author2=Keogan, Justin F. |title=Local Government in Ireland: Inside Out |publisher=Institute of Public Administration |year=2003 |location=Dublin |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6OdT7MIflgC&amp;pg=PA45 |isbn=1-902448-93-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and amalgamated in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tipperary County Council: General News |publisher= |date=3 June 2014 |url=http://www.tipperarycoco.ie/news/tipperary-county-council |accessdate=7 June 2014 |quote=Tipperary County Council will become an official unified authority on 3 June 2014. The new authority combines the existing administration of North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of Dublin, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Galway]] have city councils and are administered separately from the counties bearing those names. The cities of [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] were merged with their respective county councils in 2014 to form new city and county councils. The remaining part of [[County Dublin]] is divided into [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal, Ireland|Fingal]], and [[South Dublin]].&lt;ref name="placenames"/&gt;

Electoral areas in Ireland (the state), called constituencies in accordance with [[law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]], mostly follow county boundaries. Maintaining links to the county system is a mandatory consideration in the re-organisation of constituency boundaries by a Constituency Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electoral Act 1997: Part II, Section 6 (2)c |work=Irish Statute Book |publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]] |date=15 May 1997 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/25/section/6/enacted/en/html#sec6 |accessdate=12 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation of local government in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two [[county borough]]s ([[Belfast]] and [[Derry]]) by 26 single-tier [[districts of Northern Ireland|districts]],&lt;ref name="doe-ni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/index/local_government/structure.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103003632/http://www.doeni.gov.uk/index/local_government/structure.htm |archivedate=3 January 2008 |title=Local Government Policy Division Structure|publisher=Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland|accessdate=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, apart from Fermanagh cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|Lieutenancy]].

===Bogs===
[[File:BordnaMona 2930.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bord na Móna]] peat-harvesting in the [[Bog of Allen]]]]
Ireland has 12,000&amp;nbsp;km² (4,633&amp;nbsp;miles²) of [[bog]]land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Abbot | first =Patrick | title =Ireland's Peat Bogs | work = | publisher =The Ireland Story | url =http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/geography/bogs.html | doi = | accessdate =21 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of two distinct types, blanket bogs and raised bogs. Blanket bogs are the more widespread of the two types. They are essentially a product of human activity aided by the moist Irish climate. Blanket bogs formed on sites where [[Neolithic]] farmers cleared trees for farming. As the land so cleared fell into disuse, the soil began to leach and become more acidic, producing a suitable environment for the growth of [[Calluna|heather]] and [[Juncaceae|rushes]]. The debris from these plants accumulated and a layer of [[peat]] formed.  One of the largest expanses of Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland is to be found in [[County Mayo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blanket Bogs |publisher=Irish Peatland Conservation Council |url=http://www.ipcc.ie/a-to-z-peatlands/blanket-bogs/ |accessdate=22 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised bogs are most common in the Shannon basin. They formed when depressions left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer at the bottom of the water. This eventually choked the lakes and raised above the surface, forming raised bogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raised Bogs |publisher=Irish Peatland Conservation Council |url=http://www.ipcc.ie/a-to-z-peatlands/raised-bogs/ |accessdate =22 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 17th century, peat has been cut for fuel for domestic heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called [[Bord na Móna]]. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used in a number of industries, especially electricity generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peat Energy History |publisher=[[Bord na Móna]] |url=http://www.bnm.ie/energy/index.jsp?nID=452&amp;pID=434 |accessdate=21 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511193055/http://www.bnm.ie/energy/index.jsp?nID=452&amp;pID=434 |archivedate=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though peat is being combined with [[biomass]] for dual-firing electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Replacement of peat with Biomass in Electricity Generation |work=Feedstock |publisher=[[Bord na Móna]] |year=2013 |url=http://www.bordnamona.ie/company/our-businesses/biomass/ |accessdate=2013-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the high level of bog being destroyed by cutting has raised environmental concerns. The problem is particularly acute for raised bogs as they yield a higher-grade fuel than blanket bogs. Plans are now in place in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve most of the remaining raised bogs on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Written Answers. – Raised Bog Conservation | work =Dáil Éireann Parliamentary Debates – Volume 487 | publisher =[[Oireachtas|Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas]] | date =26 February 1998 | url =http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/Debates%20Authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail1998022600092 | doi = | accessdate =21 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil, natural gas and minerals===
Offshore exploration for natural gas began in 1970.&lt;ref name="sch"&gt;Shannon, Corcoran &amp; Haughton (2001), ''The petroleum exploration of Ireland's offshore basins: introduction'', Geological Society, London Lyell Collection—Special Publications, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; The first major discovery was the [[Kinsale Head gas field]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major petroleum exploration conference: Conference on Ireland’s Deepwater Frontier |publisher=[[Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]] |date=16 September 2001 |url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Natural/Petroleum+Affairs+Division/Latest+News/Major+petroleum+exploration+conference.htm |accessdate=2014-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142834/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Natural/Petroleum%2BAffairs%2BDivision/Latest%2BNews/Major%2Bpetroleum%2Bexploration%2Bconference.htm |archivedate= 2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next was the smaller [[Ballycotton gas field]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="sch"/&gt; and the [[Corrib gas project|Corrib gas field]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Corrib Project |work=Natural Resources |publisher=[[Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]] |year=2015 |url=http://www.dccae.gov.ie/natural-resources/en-ie/Oil-Gas-Exploration-Production/Pages/History-of-the-Corrib-Project.aspx |accessdate=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of the Corrib project has yet to get off the ground because the [[Corrib gas controversy|controversial proposal]] to refine the gas onshore, rather than at sea has been met with [[Shell To Sea|widespread opposition]]. Gas from these fields is pumped ashore and used for both domestic and industrial purposes. The [[Helvick oil field]], estimated to contain over {{convert|28|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil, is a 2000 discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Providence sees Helvick oil field as key site in Celtic Sea |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=17 July 2000 |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/07/17/current/bpage_2.htm |accessdate=27 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119040533/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/07/17/current/bpage_2.htm |archivedate=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland is the largest European producer of [[zinc]] with three operating zinc-lead mines at [[Navan]], [[Galmoy]] and [[Lisheen]]. Other mineral deposits with actual or potential commercial value include gold, silver, [[gypsum]], [[talc]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]], roofing [[slate]], [[limestone]] aggregate, [[building stone]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mining in Ireland |work=Minerals Ireland: Exploration and Mining Division |publisher=[[Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]] |url=http://www.mineralsireland.ie/MiningInIreland |year=2009 |accessdate=17 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007 the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (now replaced by the [[Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]]) reported that there may be volumes over {{convert|130|Goilbbl|m3}} of petroleum and {{convert|50|Tcuft|km3}} of natural gas in Irish waters&lt;ref name="oilbonanza"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ireland on the verge of an oil and gas bonanza |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=20 May 2007 |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/ireland-on-the-verge-of-an-oil-and-gas-bonanza-26291757.html |accessdate=11 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – worth trillions of [[Euro]], if true. The minimum 'guaranteed' amount of oil in the Irish Atlantic waters is {{convert|10|Goilbbl|m3}}, worth over €450 billion. There are also areas of petroleum and natural gas on shore, for example the [[Lough Allen]] basin, with {{convert|9.4|Tcuft|km3}} of gas and {{convert|1.5|Goilbbl|m3}} of oil, valued at €74.4 billion. Already some fields are being exploited, such as the [[Spanish Point, County Clare|Spanish Point]] field, with {{convert|1.25|Tcuft|km3}} of gas and {{convert|206|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil, valued at €19.6 billion. The Corrib Basin is also quite large, worth anything up to €87 billion, while the [[Dunquin gas field]] contains {{convert|25|Tcuft|km3}} of natural gas and {{convert|4.13|Goilbbl|m3}} of petroleum.&lt;ref name="oilbonanza"/&gt;

In March 2012 the first commercial oil well was drilled 70&amp;nbsp;km off the Cork coast by Providence Resources. The Barryroe oil well is yielding 3500 barrels per day, at current oil prices at $120 a barrel Barryroe oil well is worth in excess of €2.14bn annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ireland's first oil well to yield 4,000 barrels per day |work=Northern Ireland |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=15 March 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17378943 |access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[geography]] of [[Malta]]''' is dominated by water. Malta is an [[archipelago]] of [[coralline limestone]], located in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], 81 kilometres south of [[Sicily]], [[Italy]],&lt;ref name="GMaps"&gt;From [[Żebbuġ]] in Malta, coordinates: 36°04'48.2"N 14°15'06.7"E to Cava d'Aliga ([[Scicli]]) in Italy, coordinates: 36°43'22.5"N 14°41'10.9"E – Google Maps&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly 300 km north (Libya) and northeast (Tunisia) of [[Africa]]. Although Malta is situated in Southern Europe, it is located farther south than [[Tunis]], capital of [[Tunisia]], [[Algiers]], capital of [[Algeria]], [[Tangier]] in [[Morocco]] and also [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]], and [[Mosul]] in [[Iraq]] in the [[Middle East]]. Only the three largest islands &amp;ndash; [[Malta Island|Malta]], [[Gozo Island|Gozo]] and [[Comino Island|Comino]] &amp;ndash; are inhabited. Other (uninhabited) islands are: [[Cominotto]], [[Filfla]] and the [[St.Paul's Islands]]. The country is approximately 316&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (122 sq mi) in area. Numerous [[Headlands and bays|bay]]s along the indented coastline of the islands provide harbours. The landscape of the islands is characterised by high hills with terraced fields. The highest point, at 253 metres, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/579611/Ta-Zuta Ta' Zuta] on mainland Malta. The capital is [[Valletta]].

'''[[Geographic coordinates]]:'''

Malta is slightly less than twice the size of Washington, DC. Excluding 56 km from the island of Gozo, Malta has a coastline of 196.8 km. It's maritime claims of territorial sea are {{Convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}, contiguous zone is {{Convert|24|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}, continental shelf is 200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation, and Malta's exclusive fishing zone spans {{Convert|25|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}.

The concept of a Geospatial Web may have first been introduced by Dr. Charles Herring in his [[United States Department of Defense|US DoD]] paper, ''An Architecture of Cyberspace: Spatialization of the Internet'', 1994, U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory ({{Coord|40|8|58.9|N|88|16|22.7|W|name=U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory}}).

Dr. Herring proposed that the problem of defining the physical domain in a computer or cyber-infrastructure, providing real time and appropriate fidelity, required a cyber-spatial reference or index combining both Internet Addressing and Hierarchical Spatial Addressing.

As such, the Geoweb would be characterized by the self synchronization of network addressing, time and location.  The Geoweb would allow location to be used to self organize all geospatially referenced data available through the Internet.{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.37.4604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in a Geoweb has been advanced by new [[technologies]], concepts and products, specifically the popularization of GPS positioning with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007.

[[Virtual globe]]s such as [[Google Earth]] and [[NASA World Wind]] as well as mapping websites such as [[Google Maps]], [[Live Search Maps]], [[Yahoo Maps]], and [[OpenStreetMap]] have been major factors in raising awareness towards the importance of [[geography]] and location as a means to index information.

The increase in advanced web [[Computer programming|development]] methods such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] are providing inspiration to move [[GIS]] (Geographical Information Systems) into the web.

[[Geographic Information Retrieval]] (GIR) has emerged as an academic community interested in technical aspects of helping people find information about places.  In order to make information accessible from geographically oriented applications, [[geographic coordinates|coordinate]] metadata must be created via some form of [[geocoding]] or [[geoparsing]] process.  After [[geographic coordinates (obtaining)|obtaining geographic coordinates]], they must be indexed in useful ways that allow people to interact with the non-geographic nature of the content, e.g. viewing photographs or keyword searching.

The semi-annual [http://geowebsummit.com Geoweb Summits] in New York have covered the emerging geoweb industry since 2010, connecting GIS and mobile LBS with Internet of Things and augmented reality.

'''Giambattista Nolli''' (or Giovanni Battista, April 9, 1701 – July 1, 1756) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[surveying|surveyor]]. He is best known for his [[ichnography|ichnographic]] plan of [[Rome]], the ''Pianta Grande di Roma'' which he began surveying in 1736 and engraved in 1748, and now universally known as the Nolli Map. The map is composed of 12 copper plate engravings that together measures {{convert|176|cm|in}} by {{convert|208|cm|in}} and was published in response to the commission of [[Pope Benedict XIV]] to survey Rome in order to help create demarcations for the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|14 traditional ''rioni'' or districts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tracing Architecture'', Dana Arnold, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was by far the most accurate description of Rome produced to date at a time when the architectural achievement of the Papacy was in full flower.

==Biography==
Born in 1701&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesco Dal Co]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VZRIAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Giovanni+Battista+Nolli+%281701%22&amp;dq=%22Giovanni+Battista+Nolli+%281701%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qGuYT7-PNM2cmQWUssCbBg&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ ''Storia dell'architettura italiana''], Electa, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Como]], he moved to [[Rome]] thanks to the patronage of members of the patrician [[Albani people|Albani]] and [[Corsini]] families.

As an architect, he worked on the churches of [[Santi Bonifacio e Alessio|Sant'Alessio]] on the [[Aventine Hill]] (1743) and [[Santa Dorotea]] in [[Trastevere]] (1751–1756).

==Nolli Map==
The Nolli map reflects Bufalini's map of 1551,  with which Nolli readily invited comparison, however Nolli made a number of important innovations. Firstly, Nolli reorients the city from east (which was conventional at the time) to magnetic north, reflecting Nolli's reliance on the compass to get a bearing on the city's topography. Secondly, though he follows Bufalini in using a [[figure-ground diagram|figure-ground representation]] of built space with blocks and building shaded in a dark poché, Nolli represents enclosed public spaces such as the colonnades in [[Saint Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] Square and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] as open civic spaces. Finally, the map was a significant improvement in accuracy, even noting the asymmetry of the [[Spanish Steps]].  The map was used in government planning for the city of Rome until the 1970s;&lt;ref&gt;see http://nolli.uoregon.edu/nuovaPianta.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was used as a base map for all Roman mapping and planning up to that date.

The map is framed with a ''vedute'' by [[Stefano Pozzi]].  A scaled-down edition, a collaboration between Nolli and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], was published in the same year the original map was finished.  Piranesi was instrumental in getting the work printed; [[Giuseppe Vasi]] also contributed.

The '''Great Banate of Craiova''' or ''Banship of Craiova'' was in the [[Middle Ages]] one of the most important political institutions of [[Wallachia]]. It was established during the last decades of the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, after the movement of the seat from [[Strehaia]] (1491).
     The Great [[Ban (title)|Ban]] of Craiova was the Viceroy of [[Lesser Wallachia]] and he was, as hierarchic order, the greatest Wallachian high official. His authority was extended to the area of [[Oltenia]]. Having the consent of the Wallachian ruler, the ban of Craiova could confiscate the fortune of one who made himself guilty of "betrayal". The ban of Craiova could punish by death the guilty persons.
     Since 1512, when the reign of [[Neagoe Basarab]] began, the Ban got similar powers to the [[hospodar]] in the territory on the right of [[Olt river]]. The title was held most by members of the [[Craioveşti]] family (from 1492 to 1532).
[[File:Craiova - Casa Baniei.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The last headquarters of the Banate]]
     In the second half of 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the institution met a moment of crisis, mainly due to aggressive attempts of the Turks to establish dominance over [[Wallachia]]. Oltenia had a high level of administrative, judicial and military independence, without any relation to central leadership of the country, except to pay tribute to the Wallachian ruler, who, in turn, sent it on to the Ottomans.
     The rôle of the institution increased during the rule of [[Michael the Brave]].
     In 1761 the permanent residence of the ban was moved to [[Bucharest]]. Up until 1831, the [[Ban (title)|Ban]] was the deputy of the voivode (Prince of Wallachia) in Oltenia.
     The headquarters of the Banate (''Băniei House'') is the oldest non-religious building that exists in [[Craiova]], dating from 1699. Today it hosts the Museum of Ethnography and Folk Art.

The '''Great Plains''' (sometimes simply "the Plains") is the broad expanse of flat land (a [[plain]]), much of it covered in [[prairie]], [[steppe]], and [[grassland]], that lies west of the [[Mississippi River]] [[tallgrass prairie]] in the United States and east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the U.S. and Canada. It embraces:
* The entirety of the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]
* Parts of the states of [[Colorado]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and [[Wyoming]]
* The southern portions of the [[provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Saskatchewan]] 
The region is known for supporting extensive cattle [[ranch]]ing and [[Dryland farming|dry farming]].

The Canadian portion of the Plains is known as the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]]. It covers much of Alberta and southern Saskatchewan, and a narrow band of southern Manitoba. Despite covering a relatively small geographic area, the Prairies are nevertheless home to the majority of each of the three provinces' respective populations.

==Usage==
[[File:On the Great Plains, Kansas, 294 miles west of Missouri River. (redo 2016).jpg|thumb|The Great Plains near a farming community in central Kansas]]
The term "Great Plains" is used in the United States to describe a sub-section of the even more vast [[Interior Plains]] physiographic division, which covers much of the interior of North America. It also has currency as a region of human geography, referring to the [[Plains Indians]] or the Plains States.

In Canada the term is little used; [[Natural Resources Canada]], the government department responsible for official mapping, treats the Interior Plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaux and plains. There is no region referred to as the "Great Plains" in ''[[Atlas of Canada|The Atlas of Canada]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/arm_physio_plains/1 Atlas.nrcan.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122000541/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/arm_physio_plains/1 |date=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of human geography, the term ''prairie'' is more commonly used in Canada, and the region is known as the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie Provinces]] or simply "the Prairies."

The [[North American Environmental Atlas]], produced by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]], a NAFTA agency composed of the geographical agencies of the Mexican, American, and Canadian governments, uses the "Great Plains" as an [[ecoregion]] synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724143053/http://www.cec.org/atlas/ CEC.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Great Plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions: Temperate Prairies, West-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, South-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, Texas Louisiana Coastal Plains, and Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain, which overlap or expand upon other Great Plains designations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions/na_eco.htm|title=About the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==

[[File:Johnson 1920 HighPlains.jpg|thumb|The Great Plains before the native grasses were ploughed under, [[Haskell County, Kansas]], 1897, showing a man sitting behind a [[buffalo wallow]]]]

The region is about {{convert|500|mi|abbr=on}} east to west and {{convert|2000|mi|abbr=on}} north to south. Much of the region was home to [[American bison]] herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the mid/late-19th century. It has an area of approximately {{convert|1300000|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Current thinking regarding the geographic boundaries of the Great Plains is shown by this [http://www.unl.edu/plains/about/map.shtml map] at the Center for Great Plains Studies, [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

The term "Great Plains", for the region west of about the [[96th meridian west|96th]] and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. [[Nevin M. Fenneman|Nevin Fenneman's]] 1916 study ''Physiographic Subdivision of the United States''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fenneman |first= Nevin M. |date=January 1917 |title= Physiographic Subdivision of the United States |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume= 3 |issue= 1 |pages= 17–22 |pmc= 1091163 |oclc= 43473694 |pmid=16586678 |doi=10.1073/pnas.3.1.17}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Before that the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Ralph Hall |title= Historical Geography of the United States |year= 1948 |publisher= Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co |location= New York |oclc= 186331193 |pages= 373–374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the term "[[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]]" is used for a subregion of the Great Plains.

==Geography==
The Great Plains are the westernmost portion of the vast [[North America]]n [[Interior Plains]], which extend east to the [[Appalachian Plateau]]. The [[United States Geological Survey]] divides the Great Plains in the United States into ten physiographic subdivisions:
* [[Coteau du Missouri]] or Missouri Plateau (which also extends into [[Canada]]), glaciated – east central South Dakota, northern and eastern North Dakota and northeastern Montana;
* Coteau du Missouri, unglaciated – western South Dakota, northeastern Wyoming, southwestern North Dakota and southeastern Montana;
* [[Black Hills]] – western South Dakota;
* [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] – southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska (including the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sand Hills]]), eastern Colorado, western Kansas, western Oklahoma, [[eastern New Mexico]], and northwestern Texas (including the [[Llano Estacado]] and [[Texas Panhandle]]);
* Plains Border – central Kansas and northern Oklahoma (including the [[Flint Hills|Flint]], [[Red Hills (Kansas)|Red]] and [[Smoky Hills]]);
* [[Colorado Piedmont]] – eastern Colorado;
* [[Raton, New Mexico|Raton]] section – northeastern New Mexico;
* [[Pecos River|Pecos Valley]] – eastern New Mexico;
* [[Edwards Plateau]] – south central Texas; and
* [[Central Texas]] section – central Texas.

The Great Plains consist of a broad stretch of country underlain by nearly horizontal [[stratum|strata]] extends westward from the [[97th meridian west]] to the base of the [[Rocky Mountains]], a distance of from {{convert|300|to|500|mi}}. It extends northward from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] boundary far into Canada. Although the [[altitude]] of the plains increases gradually from 600 or {{convert|1200|ft|m|abbr=on}} on the east to 4,000–5,000 or {{convert|6000|ft|m}} near the mountains, the local relief is generally small. The [[semi-arid climate]] excludes tree growth and opens far-reaching views.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=United States, The/Physical Geography |display=United States, The § ''Physical Geography'' |volume=27 |pages=619–620 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plains are by no means a simple unit. They are of diverse structure and of various stages of [[erosion]]al development. They are occasionally interrupted by [[butte]]s and [[escarpment]]s. They are frequently broken by [[valley]]s. Yet on the whole, a broadly extended surface of moderate relief so often prevails that the name, Great Plains, for the region as a whole is well-deserved.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The western boundary of the plains is usually well-defined by the abrupt ascent of the mountains. The eastern boundary of the plains is more [[climate|climatic]] than [[topography|topographic]]. The line of 20 in. of annual [[rainfall]] trends a little east of northward near the 97th meridian. If a boundary must be drawn where nature presents only a gradual transition, this rainfall line may be taken to divide the drier plains from the moister prairies. The plains may be described in northern, intermediate, central and southern sections, in relation to certain peculiar features.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== Northern Great Plains ===
The northern section of the Great Plains, north of [[44th parallel north|latitude 44°]], including eastern [[Montana]], north-eastern [[Wyoming]], most of [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], and the Canadian [[Prairie Provinces|Prairies]], is a moderately dissected [[peneplain]]. [[File:Missouri River Valley North Dakota 11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Missouri River Valley in Central North Dakota, near Stanton, ND]]This is one of the best examples of its kind. The strata here are [[Cretaceous]] or early [[Tertiary]], lying nearly horizontal. The surface is shown to be a plain of degradation by a gradual ascent here and there to the crest of a ragged escarpment, the escarpment-remnant of a resistant stratum. There are also the occasional [[lava]]-capped [[mesa]]s and [[dike (geology)|dike]] formed ridges, surmounting the general level by {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} or more and manifestly demonstrating the widespread [[erosion]] of the surrounding plains. All these reliefs are more plentiful towards the mountains in central Montana. The peneplain is no longer in the cycle of erosion that witnessed its production. It appears to have suffered a regional uplift or increase in elevation, for the upper [[Missouri River]] and its branches no longer flow on the surface of the plain, but in well graded, maturely opened valleys, several hundred feet below the general level. A significant exception to the rule of mature valleys occurs, however, in the case of the Missouri, the largest river, which is broken by several falls on hard sandstones about {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of the mountains. This peculiar feature is explained as the result of displacement of the river from a better graded preglacial valley by the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice sheet]]. Here, the ice sheet overspread the plains from the moderately elevated Canadian highlands far on the north-east, instead of from the much higher mountains near by on the west. The present altitude of the plains near the mountain base is {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The northern plains are interrupted by several small mountain areas. The [[Black Hills]], chiefly in western [[South Dakota]], are the largest group. They rise like a large island from the sea, occupying an oval area of about {{convert|100|mi}} north-south by {{convert|50|mi}} east-west. At [[Black Elk Peak]], they reach an altitude of {{convert|7216|ft|m}} and have an effective relief over the plains of 2000 or {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} This mountain mass is of flat-arched, dome-like structure, now well dissected by radiating consequent streams. The weaker uppermost strata have been eroded down to the level of the plains where their upturned edges are evenly truncated. The next following harder strata have been sufficiently eroded to disclose the core of underlying [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] crystalline rocks in about half of the domed area.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== Intermediate Great Plains ===
[[File:Niobrara valley, Nebraska.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Miocene epoch layers under late Pleistocene and Holocene layers(Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska]]In the intermediate section of the plains, between [[44th parallel north|latitudes 44°]] and [[42nd parallel north|42°]], including southern [[South Dakota]] and northern [[Nebraska]], the erosion of certain large districts is peculiarly elaborate. Known as the [[Badlands]], it is a minutely dissected form with a relief of a few hundred feet. This is due to several causes:
* the dry climate, which prevents the growth of a grassy turf
* the fine texture of the Tertiary strata in the badland districts
* every little rill, at times of rain, carves its own little valley.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== Central Great Plains ===
[[File:Western Kansas-High Plains Nicodemus.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The High Plains of Kansas, aka Smokey Hills near Nicodemus, Kansas]]The central section of the Great Plains, between [[42nd parallel north|latitudes 42°]] and [[36th parallel north|36°]], occupying eastern [[Colorado]] and western [[Kansas]], is, briefly stated, for the most part a dissected [[fluvial|fluviatile]] plain. That is, this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a [[piedmont (disambiguation)|piedmont]] deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains. Since then, it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys. The central section of the plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern section. While the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries, the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of aggrading rivers and their outgoing distributaries. The two sections are also alike in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section, while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the pre-existent relief. Exception to this statement must be made in the southwest, close to the mountains in southern Colorado, where some lava-capped mesas ([[Mesa de Maya]], [[Raton Mesa]]) stand several thousand feet above the general plain level, and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggraded.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== Southern Great Plains ===
The southern section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 35.5° and 25.5° lies in western [[Texas]] and eastern [[New Mexico]]. Like the central section, it is for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. However, the lower lands which surround it on all sides place it in so strong relief that it stands up as a table-land, known from the time of Mexican occupation as the [[Llano Estacado]]. It measures roughly {{convert|150|mi}} east-west and {{convert|400|mi}} north-south. It is of very irregular outline, narrowing to the south. Its altitude is {{convert|5500|ft}} at the highest western point, nearest the mountains whence its gravels were supplied. From there, it slopes southeastward at a decreasing rate, first about 12&amp;nbsp;ft., then about 7&amp;nbsp;ft per mile (1.3 m/km), to its eastern and southern borders, where it is {{convert|2000|ft}} in altitude. Like the High Plains farther north, it is extraordinarily smooth.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It is very dry, except for occasional shallow and temporary water sheets after rains. The Llano is separated from the plains on the north by the mature consequent valley of the [[Canadian River]], and from the mountains on the west by the broad and probably mature valley of the [[Pecos River]]. On the east, it is strongly undercut by the retrogressive erosion of the headwaters of the Red, Brazos and Colorado rivers of Texas and presents a ragged escarpment approximately 500 to {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, overlooking the central denuded area of that state. There, between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, occurs a series of isolated outliers capped by a limestone which underlies both the [[Llano Uplift]] on the west and the [[Grand Prairies]] escarpment on the east. The southern and narrow part of the table-land, called the [[Edwards Plateau]], is more dissected than the rest, and falls off to the south in a frayed-out fault scarp. This scarp overlooks the coastal plain of the [[Rio Grande]] [[embayment]]. The central denuded area, east of the Llano, resembles the east-central section of the plains in exposing older rocks. Between these two similar areas, in the space limited by the Canadian and Red Rivers, rise the subdued forms of the [[Wichita Mountains]] in [[Oklahoma]], the westernmost member of the Ouachita system.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Paleontology==
During the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145–66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. However, during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65–55 million years ago), the seaway had begun to recede, leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupied.

During the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread.  The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s and [[glires]], that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked. However, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes  in mammals, giving rise to the "grit, not grass" hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip E. Jardine, Christine M. Janis, Sarda Sahney, Michael J. Benton. "Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires." Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. December 2012:365–366, 1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paleontology|Paleontological]] finds in the area have yielded bones of [[mammoth]]s, [[Smilodon|saber-toothed cats]] and other ancient animals,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/ice_age_animals.html# Ice Age Animals]". Illinois State Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dozens of other [[megafauna]] (large animals over {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) – such as [[Ground sloth|giant sloths]], [[Evolution of the horse|horses]], [[mastodon]]s, and [[American lion]] – that dominated the area of the ancient Great Plains for thousands to millions of years. The vast majority of these animals became extinct in North America at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] (around 13,000 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061002154043.htm A Plan For Reintroducing Megafauna To North America]".

In general, the Great Plains have a wide variety of weather through the year, with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers. Wind speeds are often very high, especially in winter. Grasslands are among the least protected biomes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:-I2afk7pYy4J:www.npcn.net/images/uploads/Threats_Assessment_NGP_Report_Dec2012.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiRxMMGSyef12zJwfM3Pvfh5mnEL2ghyF2OGAy1005jjloP82vJYMbJcDvJdQb1sh7OGcoe18nQGXkiuLEMpYr8h3iTNW85fPXUBNo8T9K0e_3z_yfB3drjYlHdYVPKCFuXURA2&amp;sig=AHIEtbSOt7IjQ81Kl6ruNf4BjrrUbNLFbA Threats Assessment for the Northern Great Plains Ecoregion]&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures. The Great Plains have dust storms mostly every year or so.

The 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the Great Plains into an area that receive {{convert|20|in|abbr=on}} or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than {{convert|20|in|abbr=on}}. In this context, the High Plains, as well as [[Southern Alberta]], south-western Saskatchewan and [[Eastern Montana]] are mainly [[Semi-arid climate|semi arid]] steppe land and are generally characterised by [[ranch|rangeland]] or marginal [[Agriculture|farmland]]. The region (especially the High Plains) is periodically subjected to extended periods of [[drought]]; high winds in the region may then generate devastating [[dust storm]]s. The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone in the southern areas, and the northern and central areas fall in the [[humid continental climate]].

Many [[thunderstorm]]s occur in the plains in the spring through summer. The southeastern portion of the Great Plains is the most [[tornado]] active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as [[Tornado Alley]].

==Flora==
The Great Plains are part of the floristic [[North American Prairies Province]], which extends from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]].

===Original American contact===
{{Main|Plains Indians}}
{{See also|Paleo-Indians}}
[[File:BuffaloHunters.jpg|thumb|Buffalo hunt under the wolf-skin mask, [[George Catlin]], 1832–33.]]
The first Americans ([[Paleo-Indians]]) who arrived to the Great Plains were successive [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] cultures who are known to have inhabited the Great Plains for thousands of years, over 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20287-first-americans-arrived-2500-years-before-we-thought.html |title=First Americans arrived 2500 years before we thought – life – 24 March 2011 |publisher=New Scientist |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Bill |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/03/24/2947233/texas-artifacts-strongest-evidence.html |title=Texas artifacts 'strongest evidence yet' that humans arrived in North America earlier than thought |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans entered the North American continent in waves of migration, mostly over [[Beringia]], the [[Bering Strait]]s [[land bridge]].

Historically the Great Plains were the range of the bison and of the culture of the [[Plains Indians]], whose tribes included the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho]], [[Comanche]], and others. Eastern portions of the Great Plains were inhabited by tribes who lived in semi-permanent villages of [[earth house|earth lodges]], such as the [[Arikara]], [[Mandan]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and [[Wichita people|Wichita]].

===European contact===
[[File:Gascoyne, North Dakota.jpg|thumb|Great Plains in North Dakota {{circa}} 2007, where communities began settling in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Great Plains region |last= Rees |first= Amanda |authorlink= |year= 2004|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|location= |isbn= 0-313-32733-5 |page= 18|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=v0MpNai3xdMC|accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

With the arrival of [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]], a Spanish [[conquistador]], the first recorded history of encounter between Europeans and Native Americans in the Great Plains occurred in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska from 1540 to 1542. In that same time period, [[Hernando de Soto]] crossed a west-northwest direction in what is now Oklahoma and Texas. Today this is known as the De Soto Trail. The Spanish thought the Great Plains were the location of the mythological ''[[Quivira]] and [[Zuni-Cibola Complex|Cíbola]]'', a place said to be rich in gold.

Over the next one hundred years, founding of the [[fur trade]] brought thousands of ethnic Europeans into the Great Plains. Fur trappers from France, Spain, Britain, Russia and the young United States made their way across much of the region, making regular contacts with Native Americans. After the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and conducted the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1804–1806, more information about the Plains became available and various pioneers entered the areas.

[[Manuel Lisa]], based in [[St. Louis]], established a major fur trading site at his [[Fort Lisa (Nebraska)|Fort Lisa]] on the [[Missouri River]] in Nebraska. Fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements. Through the 19th century, more European Americans and Europeans migrated to the Great Plains as part of a vast [[United States territorial acquisitions|westward expansion]] of population. New settlements became dotted across the Great Plains.

The new immigrants also brought diseases against which the Native Americans had no resistance. Between a half and two-thirds of the Plains Indians are thought to have died of [[smallpox]] by the time of the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2008&amp;page=24 Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (1992)]".

===Pioneer settlement===
{{see also|Cattle drives in the United States}}
After 1870, the new [[History of rail transport in the United States|railroads across the Plains]] brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides. The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to European farmers, who rushed to settle the land. They (and Americans as well) also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms.  Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. In Kansas, for example, nearly 5000 towns were mapped out, but by 1970 only 617 were actually operating.  In the mid-20th century, closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for business.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860–1920'' (1985) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Great Plains became [[open range]], or [[rangeland]] where [[cattle]] roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. Between 1866 and 1895, cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as [[Dodge City, Kansas]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Dykstra, ''Cattle Towns: A Social History of the Kansas Cattle Trading Centers'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ogallala, Nebraska]]; from there, cattle were shipped eastward.&lt;ref&gt;John Rossel, "The Chisholm Trail," ''Kansas Historical Quarterly'' (1936) Vol. 5, No. 1 pp 3–14 [http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1936/36_1_rossel.htm online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cowboy1902.jpg|thumb|Cattle herd and cowboy, circa 1902]]

Many foreign investors, especially British, financed the great ranches of the era. Overstocking of the range and the terrible winter of 1886 resulted in a disaster, with many cattle starved and frozen to death. [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a rancher in the Dakotas, lost his entire investment; he returned east to reenter politics. From then on, ranchers generally raised feed to ensure they could keep their cattle alive over winter.

To allow for agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population, the US passed the [[Homestead Acts]] of 1862: it allowed a settler to claim up to {{convert|160|acre|abbr=on}} of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the [[Kinkaid Act]] of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]]. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building [[sod house]]s out of the very [[Sod|turf]] of their land. Many of them were not skilled [[dryland farming|dryland farmers]] and failures were frequent. Much of the Plains were settled during relatively wet years. Government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Germans from Russia]] who had previously farmed, under similar circumstances, in what is now [[Ukraine]] were marginally more successful than other homesteaders. The [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Frazier, ''Great Plains'' (2001) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social life===
[[File:Grange1873.jpg|thumb|Grange in session, 1873]]
The railroads opened up the Great Plains for settlement, for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling paperwork and financial details.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fink, ''Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880–1940'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping, and home economics courses in the schools.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Montrie, "'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp. 245–258. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/greatplainsquarterly/159 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife, plains residents created busy social lives for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food and entertainment such as [[barn raising]]s, corn huskings, quilting bees,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ronning, "Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880–1920", ''Uncoverings'', 1992, Vol. 13, pp. 169–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Grange meetings, church activities and school functions. Women organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan B. Sanderson, "More Than a Potluck", ''Nebraska History'', Fall 2008, Vol. 89 Issue 3, pp. 120–131.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] was a nationwide farmers' organization, they reserved high offices for women, and gave them a voice in public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Marti, ''Women of the Grange: Mutuality and Sisterhood in Rural America, 1866–1920'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 19th century===
[[File: High plains fresh groundwater usage 2000.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Withdrawal rates from the [[Ogallala Aquifer]].]]
The region roughly centered on the [[Oklahoma Panhandle]], including southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, the [[Texas Panhandle]], and extreme northeastern New Mexico was known as the [[Dust Bowl]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The effect of an extended drought, inappropriate cultivation, and financial crises of the [[Great Depression]], forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains.

From the 1950s on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive [[irrigation]] on large landholdings. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products. The southern portion of the Great Plains lies over the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata dating from the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]]. [[Center pivot irrigation]] is used extensively in drier sections of the Great Plains, resulting in [[aquifer]] depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.&lt;ref&gt;Bobby A. Stewart and Terry A. Howell, ''Encyclopedia of water science'' (2003) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

====Population decline====
{{main|Depopulation of the Great Plains}}
The rural Plains have lost a third of their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles of the Great Plains have fewer than {{convert|6|PD/sqmi|PD/sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}}—the density standard [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] used to declare the [[American frontier]] "closed" in 1893. Many have fewer than {{convert|2|PD/sqmi|PD/sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}}. There are more than 6,000 [[ghost town]]s in the state of Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian [[Daniel Fitzgerald (writer)|Daniel Fitzgerald]]. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable,&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Rees, ''The Great Plains region'' (2004) p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; and there has been a proposal – the "[[Buffalo Commons]]" – to return approximately {{convert|139000|sqmi|abbr=on}} of these drier parts to native prairie land.

==Wind power==
[[File:GreenMountainWindFarm Fluvanna 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Wind farm]] in the plains of [[West Texas]]]]
The Great Plains contribute substantially to [[wind power in the United States]]. In July 2008, [[T. Boone Pickens]], who developed wind farms after a long career as a petroleum executive, called for the U.S. to invest [[United States dollar|$]]1&amp;nbsp;trillion to build an additional 200,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] of [[wind power]] [[Intermittent energy source#Terminology|nameplate capacity]] in the Plains, as part of his [[Pickens Plan]]. Pickens cited [[Sweetwater, Texas]] as an example of economic revitalization driven by wind power development.&lt;ref name="oilman_wind_power"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweetwater was a struggling town typical of the Plains, steadily losing businesses and population, until [[wind turbine]]s came to surrounding [[Nolan County, Texas|Nolan County]].&lt;ref name="block_2008"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind power brought jobs to local residents, along with royalty payments to landowners who leased sites for turbines, reversing the town's [[population decline]]. Pickens claims the same economic benefits are possible throughout the Plains, which he refers to as North America's "wind corridor."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">'''Honorius Augustodunensis''' (c. 1080–1154?), commonly known as '''Honorius of Autun''', was a very popular 12th-century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology|theologian]] who wrote prolifically on many subjects. He wrote in a non-scholastic manner, with a lively style, and his works were approachable for the lay community in general. He was, therefore, something of a popularizer of clerical learning.

==Life==
Very little is known of his life. He says that he is ''Honorius Augustodunensis ecclesiae presbyter et scholasticus'', but nothing else is known. "Augustodunensis" was taken to mean [[Autun]] (''Augustodunum''), but that identification is now generally rejected. However, there is no solid reasoning for any other identification (such as [[Augst]]/''Augustodunensem praesulem'' near Basle, [[Augsburg]]/''Augusta Vindelicorum'' in [[Swabia]], or ''Augustinensis'', from [[St Augustine's Abbey]] at [[Canterbury]]), so his by-name has stuck. It is certain that he was a [[monk]] and that he traveled to [[Kingdom of England|England]] and was a student of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s for some time. Toward the end of his life, he was in the [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]], probably living as a recluse.

==Works==

Among Honorius's works are:
*''[[Elucidarium]]'': a survey of Christian beliefs (written in England). It was translated frequently into vernacular.
*''Sigillum sanctae Mariae'': a set of lessons for how to celebrate the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], together with a commentary on ''[[The Song of Songs]]'', which he sees as being principally about [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].
*''Gemma animae'': An allegorical view of the liturgy and its practices.
* A commentary on ''The Song of Songs,'' (preserved in a manuscript from c. 1170).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A long commentary on the [[Psalms]].
*''Clavis physicae'', the first part (1-315) is a summary of the first four books of [[Johannes Scotus Erigena]] ''Periphyseon'' ([[De divisione naturae]]), the second part (316-529) is a reproduction of the fifth book.
*''De luminaribus ecclesiae'': a bibliography of Christian authors, which ends with a list of twenty-one of his own works.

His most important work was the ''Imago mundi'', an encyclopedia of popular [[cosmology]] and geography combined with a chronicle of world history. It was translated into many different [[vernacular]] languages and was popular throughout the medieval period. It contained, among other things, a scheme for the operation of [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]]s.

A major scholar of Honorius is [[Valerie Flint]], whose essays on him are collected in ''Ideas in the Medieval West: Texts and their Contexts'' (London, 1988). See also her study of Honorius in Constant J. Mews and Valerie I. J. Flint, ''Peter Abelard; Honorius of Regensburg'' (Aldershot, 1995).

'''ISO 3166-2:PH''' is the entry for the [[Philippines]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for the Philippines, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[regions of the Philippines|17 regions]]
* [[provinces of the Philippines|81 provinces]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|PH}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the Philippines. The second part is either of the following:
* two digits: regions
* three letters: provinces

The codes for the provinces correspond to the Roman numerals used to represent the regions, except the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]], the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]], and the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]], which do not use Roman numerals for representation purposes.

The code for [[Cotabato]] ({{mono|PH-NCO}}) is assigned based on its former name, North Cotabato.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (en): [[English language|English]]
* (tl): [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]

The '''Kingdom of Tahiti''' was founded by paramount chief [[Pōmare I]], who, with the aid of [[England|English]] [[missionaries]] and traders, and European weaponry, unified the islands of [[Tahiti]], [[Moorea|Moʻorea]], [[Tetiaroa]], [[Mehetia]] and at its peak included the [[Tuamotus]], [[Tubuai]], [[Raivavae]] and other islands of eastern [[Polynesia]]. Their leaders were Christian following the [[baptism]] of Pomare II. Their progressive rise and recognition by Europeans allowed Tahiti to remain free from a planned [[Spain|Spanish]] [[colonization]] as well as English and earlier French claims to the islands. The Kingdom was one of a number of independent [[Polynesia]]n states in [[Oceania]], alongside [[Kingdom of Raiatea|Raiatea]], [[Kingdom of Huahine|Huahine]], [[Kingdom of Bora Bora|Bora Bora]], [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]], [[History of Samoa|Samoa]], [[Kingdom of Tonga|Tonga]], [[Kingdom of Rarotonga|Rarotonga]] and [[Niue]] in the 19th century. They are known for bringing a period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity to the islands over the reign of the [[List of monarchs of Tahiti|five Tahitian monarchs]].

Tahiti and its dependencies were made a French [[protectorate]] in 1842 and largely annexed as a colony of [[France]] in 1880. The monarchy was abolished by France shortly thereafter, though there are still [[pretender]]s.

== History ==
{{Expand French|Royaume de Tahiti|date=January 2012}}

===Beginning===
[[File:John Webber's oil painting of Otoo, 1777.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pōmare I, founder of the Pōmare dynasty and King of Tahiti]]
[[Pōmare I]] was born at Pare, ca. 1743. He was the second son of Teu Tunuieaiteatua by his wife, Tetupaia-i-Hauiri. He initially reigned under the [[regent|regency]] of his father. He succeeded on the death of his father as Ariʻi-rahi of Porionuʻu 23 November 1802.

In terms of European encroachment in the period immediately encompassing the period of Pomare I.

"The attempt at colonization by the Spaniards in 1774 was followed by the settlement of thirty persons brought in 1797 by the [[missionary]] ship [[Duff (1794 ship)|''Duff'']]. Though befriended by Pomare I. (who lived till 1805), they had many difficulties, especially from the constant wars, and at length they fled with Pomare II to Eimeo and ultimately to [[New South Wales]]. They returned in 1812 when Pomare renounced heathenism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tahitian Royal Family |url=http://www.janesoceania.com/tahiti_royals/index2.htm |work=The Tahitian Royal Family |accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomare was the Tahitian chieftain most friendly to the [[United Kingdom|British]]. The additional British captains arriving at Tahiti accepted his claim to hegemony. They gave him guns in trade and helped him in his battles. [[Captain Cook]] gave him the advantage in a number of battles with rival forces during his last stay in Tahiti, circa 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tahiti1.com/en/indentity/history.htm |title=History of French Polynesia |work=History of French Polynesia |accessdate=26 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926173056/http://www.tahiti1.com/en/indentity/history.htm |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; British missionaries arrived, sent by a non-denominational Protestant group called the [[London Missionary Society]]. Pomare befriended the missionaries, and the missionaries favored both peace and Pomare, but, with the British unwilling to apply force to create order among the islands, the missionaries were unable to stop the warring.

As king, Pōmare I succeeded in uniting the different chiefdoms of Tahiti into a single kingdom, composed of the islands of [[Tahiti]] itself, [[Moorea|Moʻorea]], [[Mehetia|Mehetiʻa]], and the [[Tetiaroa|Tetiʻaroa]] group. His service as the first king of unified Tahiti ended when he abdicated in 1791, but he remained the regent of Tahiti from 1791 until 1803. He married four times and had two sons and three daughters.

By now, islanders were passing to each other diseases that had arrived with the Europeans: diseases for which they had undeveloped immunities. Many islanders were dying. In 1803, Pomare died. His son, Otu, became head of the family, with the title [[Pomare II]]. Tū Tūnuiʻēʻaiteatua Pōmare II reigned 1803–1821. The missionaries remained allied with the Pomare family. Despite their pacifism, they wanted to see Pomare II successful in uniting the islanders under his rule.

===Consolidation===

====Pomare II====
[[File:Pomare II, engraving by R. Hicks.jpg|thumb|200px|King Pomare II]]
Pōmare II, King of Tahiti (1774 – December 7, 1821) was the second king of Tahiti between 1782 and 1821. He was installed by his father Pōmare I at Tarahoi, 13 February 1791. He ruled under regency from 1782 to 1803.

Initially recognised as supreme sovereign and Ariʻi-maro-ʻura by the ruler of Huahine, he was subsequently forced to take refuge in Moʻorea 22 December 1808, but returned and defeated his enemies at the Battle of Te Feipī. He was thereafter recognized as undisputed King of Tahiti, Moʻorea and its dependencies.

Other chieftains on Tahiti became fed up with what they saw as Pomare's pretensions of power, and in 1808 they drove him from Tahiti to the nearby island of Eimeo ([[Moorea]]). These other chieftains hostile towards the missionaries, which caused the missionaries to leave Tahiti for other islands.

[[File:Raveae saves his life from the idolaters.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A scene from the Battle of Te Feipī, by [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]]]]
Pomare organized military support from his kinsmen on the islands of [[Raiatea]], [[Bora Bora]] and [[Huahine]]. Warring resumed, with Pomare winning the decisive Battle of Te Fe’i Pī, on November 12, 1815. His victory was a victory also for the Christians. And, in victory Pomare surprised the Tahitians. He pardoned all who laid down their weapons. When defeated warriors returned from the hills, they found their homes had not been set afire and that their wives and children had not been slaughtered. The warfare culture of the islanders had been changed by the influence that the missionaries had on Pomare II.

&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[File:1Henry Nott.jpg|left|190px|Protestant missionary Henry Nott (1774&amp;ndash;1844).]]--&gt;
Centralized authority among chiefs was not [[traditional]] in Tahiti, but the missionaries welcomed Pomare's new power. Distress from disease, civil war and death won for them serious attention to their teachings. They launched a campaign to teach the islanders to read, so they could read scripture. There were mass conversions in hope of the supernatural protections that Christianity offered. The missionaries told the islanders how to dress. The climate was suitable to exposing the skin to the greater cool of open air, but for the missionaries cool was no consideration. Little clothing for them was indecent exposure.

Another lifestyle promoted by the missionaries was manufacturing, the missionaries setting up a sugar refinery and a textile factory. In 1817, Tahiti acquired its first printing press, and, in 1819, cotton, sugar and coffee crops were planted.

Pomare II asked the missionaries for advice on laws, and the missionaries, being monarchists and wanting Pomare to be a proper monarch, advised him that the laws would have to be his, not theirs. They did make suggestions, however, and in September 1819, Pomare produced Tahiti's first written law. There was protection of life and property, observance of [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]], a sanctification of marriage and a [[judiciary]] to maintain the laws.

Pōmare was married to Queen Tetua-nui Taro-vahine.

He was baptised 16 May 1819 at the Royal Chapel, Papeʻete. Three London Missionary Society missionaries, Henry Bicknell, William Henry, and Charles Wilson preached at the baptism of King Pomare II.

Pomare died of drink-related causes at Motu Uta, Moʻorea, 7 December 1821. Pomare II died in 1824 at the age of forty-two, leaving behind an eight-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son. The son, Teriʻi-ta-ria and [[Pōmare III]], ruled in name from 1821 to 1827 while being educated by the missionaries. He died in 1827 of an unknown disease, and the daughter, then eleven, became Queen [[Pōmare IV]].

====Pomare III====
Pōmare III was the king of Tahiti between 1821 and 1827. He was the second son of Pōmare II.

He was born at Papaʻoa, ʻArue, 25 June 1820 as Teri'i-ta-ria, and was baptised on 10 September 1820. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. He was crowned at Papaʻoa, ʻArue, 21 April 1824.

Pomare III's education took place at the South Sea Academy, Papetoai, Moʻorea. He reigned under a council of Regency until his death 8 January 1827. During his reign, the Kingdom's first flag was adopted.

He was succeeded by his sister, ʻAimata Pōmare IV Vahine-o-Punuateraʻitua, who reigned 1827–1877.

===Pōmare IV===
[[File:Portrait de la reine Pomaré, Charles Giraud, 1852, Musée du quai Branly.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Queen Pōmare IV]]
[[Pōmare IV]], Queen of Tahiti (28 February 1813 – 17 September 1877), more properly ʻAimata Pōmare IV Vahine-o-Punuateraʻitua (otherwise known as ʻAimata {meaning: eye-eater, after an old custom of the ruler to eat the eye of the defeated foe} or simply as Pōmare IV), was the queen of Tahiti between 1827 and 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BRIEF HISTORY |url=http://www.royalark.net/Tahiti/tahiti.htm |work=TAHITI |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HM Queen Pomare IV (Aimata) |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~royalty/tahiti/i15.html |work=HM Queen Pomare IV (Aimata) |publisher=Ancestry.com |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHLDtfkr?url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~royalty/tahiti/i15.html |archivedate=29 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the daughter of [[Pōmare II]]. She succeeded as ruler of Tahiti after the death of her brother [[Pomare III|Pōmare III]] when she was only 14 years old.

She succeeded in reuniting [[Raiatea|Ra{{Okina}}iatea]] and [[Bora Bora|Porapora]] (Borabora) with the kingdom of Tahiti. She hosted numerous Britons, including a [[Charles Darwin]].

====Return of the Pitcairn Islanders====
By 1829, of those who had arrived at [[Pitcairn]] on [[HMS Bounty]] in 1790, only seven remained, but with their offspring they numbered 86. The supply of [[timber]] on Pitcairn was decreasing and the availability of [[water]] was erratic.

Since the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]], the Pitcairn islanders had been discovered by and had friendly contact with the [[Royal Navy]] and British authorities. In 1830, Tahiti's Queen [[Pomare IV]] invited the Pitcairners to return to Tahiti, and in March 1831, a British ship transported them there. The Tahitians welcomed the Pitcairners and offered them land. But having been isolated and not having developed any immunity to the [[disease]]s now on Tahiti, the Pitcairners suffered from disease in alarming number. Fourteen of them died. The Tahitians took up a collection for the surviving Pitcairners, and for $500 a whaling captain took them back to Pitcairn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Return of the Pitcairn Islanders|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h43-pa.html|work=Return of the Pitcairn Islanders|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French Protectorate====
{{main|Franco-Tahitian War (1844–47)}}
[[File:DupetitThouarsAA.jpg|left|170px|thumb|Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]]
&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[File:-Protectorate of Tahiti 1842-1843-.gif|thumb|150px|Flag (1842&amp;ndash;1843).]]--&gt;
[[File:Flag of the Tahiti Protectorate 1843-1880.svg|thumb|150px|Flag (1843&amp;ndash;1880)]]
[[File:M. Radiguet, Proclamation du protectorat, Tahiti.jpg|200px|thumb|Proclamation ceremony for the Protectorate in 1842]]
In 1842, a European crisis involving [[Morocco]] escalated between [[France]] and [[Great Britain]] when Admiral [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars|Dupetit Thouars]], acting independently of the French government, convinced Tahiti's Queen Pomare IV to accept a French [[protectorate]]. [[George Pritchard (missionary)|George Pritchard]], a [[Birmingham]]-born missionary and acting British Consul, had been away at the time. However he returned to work towards indoctrinating the locals against the [[Roman Catholic]] French. In November 1843, Dupetit-Thouars (again on his own initiative) landed sailors on the island, annexing it to France. He then threw Pritchard into prison, subsequently sending him back to Britain.

During this time, Thouars managed to convince Pomare IV to sign to putting her country under the protection of France, although he was not empowered to do so, nor was he ever sanctioned in this regard. News of Tahiti reached Europe in early 1844. The French statesman [[François Guizot]], supported by King [[Louis-Philippe of France]], had denounced annexation of the island, and the treaty was never ratified by France.

However, the French did have an interest in the region, and the treaty was enforced from its signing by various factions. The [[Franco-Tahitian War (1844–47)|Franco-Tahitian War]] between the Tahitians and French went from 1843 to 1847. Pomare IV ruled under French administration from 1843 until 1877.

While the Dynasty retained their title for some time, they lost outright control of their country.

====Death of Pomare IV====
Pomare IV died from natural causes in 1877. She is buried in the Royal Mausoleum, Papa{{Okina}}oa, [[Arue, French Polynesia|{{Okina}}Arue]]. She was succeeded by [[Pomare V|Pōmare V]], who reigned 1877–1880.

===Pomare V and forced abdication===
[[File:Pomare V.jpg|thumb|Pōmare V, the last King of Tahiti (1877&amp;ndash;1880)]]
[[Pōmare V]], King of Tahiti (3 November 1839 – 12 June 1891) was the last king of Tahiti, reigning from 1877 until his forced abdication in 1880. He was the son of Queen Pōmare IV. He was born as Teri'i Tari'a Te-rā-tane and became Heir Apparent and Crown Prince (Ari'i-aue) upon the death of his elder brother on 13 May 1855. He became king of Tahiti on the death of his mother on 17 September 1877. His coronation was on 24 September 1877 at Pape'ete.

He married twice, first on 11 November 1857 to Te-mā-ri'i-Ma'i-hara Te-uhe-a-Te-uru-ra'i, princess of Huahine. He divorced her on 5 August 1861. His second marriage was to [[Johanna Marau Ta‘aroa|Joanna Mara'u-Ta'aroa Te-pa'u Salmon]] (thereafter known as Her Majesty The Queen Marau of Tahiti), at Pape'ete on 28 January 1875. He divorced her on 25 January 1888.

Pomare V had one son and two daughters.

The island of Tahiti and most of its satellites remained a French protectorate until the late 19th century, when King Pomare V (1842–1891) was forced to cede the sovereignty of Tahiti and its dependencies to France. On 29 June 1880, he gave Tahiti and its dependencies to France, whereupon he was given a pension by French government and the titular position of Officer of the Orders of the [[Legion of Honour]] and [[Order of Agricultural Merit|Agricultural Merit]] of France, on 9 November 1880.

[[File:Tahiti tomb for Pomare.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Tomb of the King, Utu'ai'ai, 'Arue.]]
He died from alcoholism at the Royal Palace, [[Papeete|Pape'ete]], and is buried at the Tomb of the King, Utu'ai'ai in 'Arue.

== Impact ==
The Dynasty left an indelible mark on Tahitian and surrounding cultures. At their height of power, the Pomares' managed to rule effectively from their base in Tahiti and Mo'orea a kingdom of islands spread over 3 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of sea and had diplomatic relations and influences from the Cook Islands to [[Rapa Nui]]. They experienced, and were indeed a part and product of the European [[Age of Exploration]] in the Pacific. They produced an unprecedented period of cultural ascendancy in Tahiti, and saw their people through a period of change, and foreign intervention. They both preserved traditions and independence for a time, while also serving as a conduit for suppression of culture and resigned to French demands, facilitating the subsequent colonization of Tahiti.

== Current status ==
As of February 2009, [[Tauatomo Mairau]] claimed to be the heir to the Tahitian throne, and attempted to re-assert the status of the monarchy in court. His claims were not recognised by France.&lt;ref name="RNZI_21731"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=21731 |title=Tahitian royal forms government |date=22 January 2006 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RNZI_44554"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=44554 |title=Tahitian land activist claims France disregards 19th century treaties |date=3 February 2009 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he became [[pretender]] to the throne and claimed the title Prince Marau of Tahiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New republic of Hau Pakumotu is the world's newest country |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=e60d8e6c-bd26-4787-8a72-ad4a1831f052 |work=New republic of Hau Pakumotu is the world's newest country |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110160433/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=e60d8e6c-bd26-4787-8a72-ad4a1831f052 |archivedate=10 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was working to have royal trust lands returned to him and his family. The French government mortgaged the land after [[World War II]], and in doing so violated the terms of the agreement signed with [[Pomare V]] in 1880 which reserved control of the trust lands for the royal family of Tahiti. The banks may be in the process of freezing the assets, and Mairau sued to prevent [[Tahitians|native Tahitians]] from being evicted from his trust lands, and wished for them to retain their usage rights over the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King’ Mairau forged links between Tahiti and Cooks |url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=18775/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl |work=King’ Mairau forges links between Tahiti and Cooks |accessdate=9 June 2011 |date=17 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308071600/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace%3DMiddleMiddle/focusModuleID%3D130/focusContentID%3D18775/tableName%3DmediaRelease/overideSkinName%3DnewsArticle-full.tpl |archivedate= 8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in May 2013.

'''Laduviken''' ({{lang-sv|Barn Bay}}) is a [[lake]] in [[Norra Djurgården]], a semi-rural area in north-eastern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], forming part of the [[Royal National City Park]]. It is one of six lakes in [[Djurgården]], the others being: [[Lillsjön, Djurgården|Lillsjön]], [[Uggleviken]], [[Isbladskärret]], [[Lappkärret]], and [[Spegeldammen]].

== Catchment area ==
[[File:Husarviken Norra Djurgården 1600-talet.jpg|thumb|left|Historical map showing the area in the 17th century.]]
Most of the catchment area is composed of open grassland with scattered oaks and other [[hardwood]].  West of the lake, the buildings of the [[Stockholm University]] take up some 20 per cent of the surface and a few roads, a traffic route, the suburban railway [[Roslagsbanan]], and the subterranean metro passes through the area.  East of the lake are some minor one-family houses and commercial buildings.  The terrain north of the lake is flat while the southern shore is steep and, as the area west of the lake is drained by a ditch dug through a filled-up wetland, most of the catchment area is located there and most of the inflow comes from an ooze and oil separator treating water from human-made structures.  A tiny river guides the outflow east to the bay [[Husarviken]] which is part of the strait [[Lilla Värtan]].  In the late 1970s, the lake was deepened by dredging to prevent it from becoming choked-up during the 21st century, and a system of canals was then created in the western end of the lake.  As part of a national park, the lake is considered as of great recreational value.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-1.1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-1.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 1.3-1.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
Most of the [[phosphorus]] reaching the lake are most likely derived from the university, while [[nitrogen]] contribution is derived from surrounding landscape and equal shares of [[copper]] input stems from all surrounding areas and structures.  Generally the lake is considered as in good health with low levels of most metals and [[organic compound]]s, even though presence of [[hydrogen sulphide]] has been recorded relatively frequently, levels of copper in top sediments did increase during the 1990s, and analysis's of subsoil water in 1997 showed signs of environmental contamination.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-1.3" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
[[File:Laduviken 070610 lily B.JPG|thumb|left|Water lilies]]
[[File:Laduviken 070610 swan B.JPG|thumb|left|A swan]]
Presence of [[phytoplankton]] is low in August with exceptional [[blue green algae]], [[green algae]], and [[golden algae]].  Occurrence of [[zooplankton]] is more varied with several species of [[rotifer]]s, [[cladocera]]ns, and [[copepod]]s.  Among the [[aquatic plant]]s in the lake [[Potamogeton|fennel pondweed]] is notable as it normally only occurs in sea bays. Other aquatic plants and [[nymphoides]] include [[Hornwort|rigid hornwort]], [[Potamogeton|broad-leaved pondweed]], [[Potamogeton|perfoliate pondweed]], [[Callitriche|water-starwort]], ''[[Nymphaea alba]]'', ''[[Lemna]]'', and ''[[Chara (alga)|Chara]] tomentosa'' (for which the lake is, together with [[Kyrksjön]], the only locale in Stockholm).&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-1.4"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 1.4-1.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The sparse fauna before the dredging of the lake, after 1995 evolved into a pretty considerable variety of species typical for shallow lakes rich in nutrients.  Two species of freshwater snails, ''[[Bithynia leachii]]'' and ''[[Gyraulus crista]]'', were earlier considered as endangered.  Noteworthy is also the population of several freshwater mussels, [[duck mussel]] and [[swan mussel]], and ''[[Hippeutis complanatus]]'', the latter two declining.  A species of [[Oligochaeta]] new in Sweden has been reported in the lake just like did the rare [[hairy dragonfly]].  An inventory of dragonfly larvae in 2000 unveiled several other species (mostly [[red-eyed damselfly]] but also [[common blue damselfly]], [[azure damselfly]], [[variable damselfly]], and [[northern damselfly]] (''Coenagrion hastulatum'').  Fish population reflects the shortage of oxygen with an absence of [[carp bream]] and [[Abramis|silver bream]] and an abundance of [[perch]], [[Rutilus|roach]], and [[crucian carp]] dating back to before the dredging.  The outlet forms a threshold for migrating species.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-1.4" /&gt;

[[Mallard]] and [[great crested grebe]] are breeding in the lake, just like are occasionally [[common moorhen]] and [[Canada goose]] (introduced in Sweden in the 1930s).  [[Marsh warbler]] and [[gray heron]] are often seen among the reed. Even though reed have been cleared to attract [[wader]]s, as a locale for birs, the lake hasn't meat expectations much due to neglected attention of the canals and islands.  There are three species of protected [[frog]]s in the lake: [[common frog]], [[common toad]], and [[smooth newt]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-1.4" /&gt; The deers once abundant in the area have been superseded by [[roe deer]]s.&lt;ref name="SNF"&gt;SNF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visiting ==
The lake and the national city park are easily accessible by bus, metro, bicycle, or by foot.  Nearest metro station is [[Universitetet metro station|Universitetet]].&lt;ref Name="SNF" /&gt;

The North American xeric region of over {{convert|95751|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} includes: three major deserts; numerous smaller deserts; and large non-desert arid regions;  &lt;!---dead end link---&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=84+600+1000+0+0+3270+0+47100+4000+24000+0+14000+0+305+0+980+0+412+0&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=h1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=dc2dbe7b32b754f6|title=Google|author=|date=|website=www.google.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt; in the [[western United States]] and in northeast, central, and northwest Mexico.

==Overview==
The following are three major hot and dry [[desert]]s in North America, all located in the [[southwestern United States]] and [[northern Mexico]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/deserts.php |title=Desert Biome |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Chihuahuan Desert]] is the largest hot desert in North America, located in the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. Its total area is {{cvt|140000|sqmi}}.
*The [[Sonoran Desert]] is a desert located in the [[Southwestern United States]] and northwest Mexico. It is the second largest hot desert in North America. Its total area is {{cvt|120000|sqmi}}.
*The [[Mojave Desert]] is the hottest desert in North America, located primarily in southeastern [[California]]. Its total area is {{cvt|22000|sqmi}}.

The largest cold desert is the [[Great Basin Desert]], which encompasses much of the northern [[Basin and Range Province]], north of the Mojave Desert.

Other smaller cold deserts lie within the [[Columbia Plateau]]/[[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]], the [[Snake River Plain]], and the [[Colorado Plateau]] regions.

==Western arid regions of North America==
The separately defined '''western arid regions of North America''' are continental regions of aridity based on available water in addition to [[rain shadow]]-diminished rainfall&lt;ref&gt;(1953 [[Peveril Meigs|Meigs]] criteria)&lt;/ref&gt; and which have many non-desert [[shrub-steppe]] (EPA) and [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]] (WWF) in addition to desert [[ecosystem]]s and ecoregions. This large arid region of {{convert|190000|sqmi|abbr=on}} includes: deserts, such as the [[Great Basin Desert]] and Sonoran Desert; and the non-desert arid region areas (with greater than {{convert|10|in}} annual precipitation) in the [[Great Basin#western arid region of North America|Great Basin arid region]], [[Colorado Plateau]], [[Mexican Plateau]], and others. This arid region extends &lt;!---only a google search list link---[http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=meigs+1953+desert&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=2edb0d09f429b650 depicted]---&gt; from the top of the North American Desert in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Idaho]] southward into Mexico in the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13256">This is a '''list of countries by net oil exports''' based on ''[[The World Factbook]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2243rank.html |title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency |website=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/index.cfm?topL=imp |title=International - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |website=Eia.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Net export" refers to the export minus the import. Note that the net export is approximate, since the import and export data are generally not for same year (though year-to-year changes are generally small). Many countries are missing data for either imports or exports, but this generally indicates that the missing number is small.

An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. [[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

[[Africa]] is the world's second-largest and second most-populous [[continent]]. At about 30.2 million km² (11.7 million sq&amp;nbsp;mi) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of the [[Earth]]'s total surface area and 20.4% of the total land area.&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;Sayre, April Pulley.

The continent is surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Indian Ocean]] to the southeast, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Mali:

'''[[Mali]]''' &amp;ndash; [[Landlocked country|landlocked]] [[List of sovereign states|sovereign country]] located in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 3, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ml.html|title=Mali|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mali is the seventh most extensive country in [[Africa]], bordering [[Algeria]] on the north, [[Niger]] on the east, [[Burkina Faso]] and the [[Côte d'Ivoire]] on the south, [[Guinea]] on the south-west, and [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]] on the west.

Consisting of eight regions, Mali's borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the [[Sahara]], while the country's southern region, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the [[Niger river|Niger]] and [[Senegal river|Senegal]] rivers. The country's economic structure centers around [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. Some of Mali's natural resources include [[gold]], [[uranium]], and [[salt]]. Due to a high incidence of poverty, Mali is considered to be one of the poorest nations in the world.

Present-day Mali was once part of three West African empires that controlled [[trans-Saharan trade]]: the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]] (from which Mali is named), and the [[Songhai Empire]]. In the late 19th century, Mali fell under French control, becoming part of [[French Sudan]]. Mali gained independence in 1959 with Senegal, as the [[Mali Federation]] in 1959. A year later, the Mali Federation became the independent nation of Mali in 1960.  After a long period of one-party rule, a 1991 coup led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state.

'''Pietro Amat di San Filippo''' ([[Cagliari]], 22 October 1826 – [[Rome]], February 15, 1895) was an Italian geographer, historian and bibliographer.

== Family ==
He was born to a noble [[Sardinia]]n [[Marquess of Saint Philip|family]] of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;''Elenco ufficiale (definitivo) delle famiglie nobili e titolate della Sardegna'' (''Official list of noble and titled families of Sardinia''), Civelli, Rome, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the fourth of fifteen siblings, the children of Giuseppe Amat di San Filippo.  [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Luigi Amat di San Filippo e Sorso]] was his uncle.  He married Donna Angela Musio, daughter of a judge and [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy|Senator]], and they had seven children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.araldicasardegna.org/genealogie/alberi_genealogici/albero_famiglia_amat.htm See the genealogical tree (Table II)].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
He studied at the [[Barnabites]] High School in [[Bologna]], then undertook a diplomatic career as a [[Diplomatic rank|secretary of legation]] to the [[Holy See]] in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Amat di San Filippo, "Una iniziativa per un accordo tra governo Piemontese e Santa Sede", in Francesco Amat di San Filippo, Nicola Gabriele e Marco Pignotti, ''Lealtà ecclesiastica e politica unitaria. Luigi Amat di San Filippo: vita e politica di un cardinale di Pio IX'', Cagliari, AM&amp;D, 2012, p. 167, note 6. {{ISBN|978-88-95462-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later he left diplomacy and became an officer of the Sardinian National Archive (Archivio di Stato) in his hometown.  In these years he undertook studies in [[geography]] and became a member of the [[Italian Geographical Society]].  Due to his interest and his publications in [[economics]], he was appointed a secretary of the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Finance]] in Rome, where he ended his career.&lt;ref&gt;"L'Unione Sarda", 25 novembre 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
All Amat's works were printed in [[Italian language|Italian]]; in order to provide a better understanding of their content to the English reader, in the following list titles are translated into [[English language|English]].

* ''Trade and navigation of the island of Sardinia in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: with some unreleased or rare documents'' (1865)
* ''The colonies in Sardinia: especially those established under the government of Savoy (1738-1824) and the convenience of promoting colonization as the primary tool of economic refurbishing on islands'' (1867)
* ''General Statistical Yearbook and the island of Sardinia for calendar year 1868'' (1868, editor)
* ''Illustrated Bibliography of Italian travelers in chronological order'' (1874)
* ''The planisphere of Bartolomeo Pareto 1455 and four other charts have just been found in the library of Vittorio Emanuele in Rome'' (1878, from "Memoirs of the Geographical Society" excerpt)
* ''World Map, drawn in 1436 by the Venetian Bianco (preserved in the Marciana in Venice): the notes'' (1879, excerpt from "Maritime Magazine”)
* ''Navigations and maritime discoveries in West Africa by Italians along the XIII, XIV and XV centuries'' (1880, excerpt from the "Bulletin of the Italian Geographical Society”)
* ''World maps, nautical charts, pilot books and other cartographic monument, especially Italian, of the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries'' (1882, with Gustavo Uzielli: second part of the biographical and bibliographical studies on the history of geography in Italy, published on the occasion of the third International Geographical Society Congress)
* ''Two unpublished letters of Italian adventurers in America'' (1534) (1885, excerpt from the "Bulletin of the Italian Geographical Society”)
* ''The distinguished Italian travelers: with an anthology of their writings'' (1885)
* ''Of ancient and modern relations between Italy and India'' (1886, awarded by the Accademia dei Lincei)
* ''Recent finds of nautical charts in Paris, London and Florence'' (1888)
* ''The real discoverers of the Azore Islands'' (1892, excerpt from the "Bulletin of the Italian Geographical Society")
* ''Italian bibliography on Christopher Columbus, the discovery of the New World and traveling in America'' (1893, collaboration with Giuseppe Fumagalli: the sixth volume of the collection of published documents and studies by the Royal Colombian Commission)
* ''Of slavery and serfdom in Sardinia'' (1894, from the "Italian history Miscellaneous" excerpt)
* ''Surveys and studies on the economic history of Sardinia'' (1902, posthumous)

== Legacy ==
Pietro Amat has given valuable contributions to three main lines of study:
* in the [[history of Sardinia]], he has been the first researcher in modern time to emphasize the importance of [[Spain|Spanish]] and Catalan archives;&lt;ref&gt;See R.  Ciasca, in bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;
* as far as the [[history of geography]] and [[History of cartography|cartography]] is concerned, he published for the first time several relics and original studies; he was [[Ludovico di Varthema|Ludovico de Varthema]]'s first [[biographer]];
* in the field of [[bibliography]] he has also published complete and detailed studies on geography and on Italian [[geographers]].&lt;ref&gt;See F.C.  Casula, in bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, he was in contact with contemporary cultural milieu&lt;ref&gt;As an example of this contact, referred to by the studies quoted in the bibliography, see ''Lettera d'Ignazio Pillito al cav. Pietro Amat di San Filippo'' (''Letter by Ignazio Pillito to [[knight]] Pietro Amat di San Filippo''), published on the "Gazzetta popolare" in 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; and his main legacy is in following a [[scientific method]] in his research, in which he was one among the first scholars: he based his studies on original, usually unpublished, documents.

The '''Regional Aviation Association of Australia''' ('''RAAA''') is an organisation representing the interests of regional [[aviation]] in [[Australia]].

It was formed in 1980 as the '''Regional Airline Association of Australia''' and amended its name in 2001 when its [[charter]] was widened to include "aerial work operators" as well as [[regional airline]]s and [[air charter]] companies "and the businesses that support them".&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;Quotes from the [http://www.raaa.com.au/ RAAA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its stated aim is "to promote the maintenance of a viable regional aviation industry".&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

A '''shut-in''' is a type of rock formation found in [[Ozark|Ozarks]] streams where they carve through a mountain range, causing a complex of pools, rivulets, [[rapids]] and [[plunge pool|plunge pools]]. Shut-ins are inherently confined to a narrow valley or canyon, with the river valley widening out both above and below the formation. Because the rock resists [[downcutting]], streams typically descend at relatively steep gradient through shut-ins, with the downstream terminus of the formation often marked by a very large plunge pool. The river becomes unnavigable at shut-ins even by canoe due to the rapids and narrow channels.

[[Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park]] in Missouri, with its hard [[rhyolite]] and a [[diabase]] [[Dike (geology)|dike]] that divert the [[Black River (Arkansas)|Black River]] into many small streamlets following a complex [[Joint (geology)|joint system]], is the most well known example.&lt;ref name="Beveridge"&gt;Beveridge, p.39 - 62&lt;/ref&gt; More than ninety other shut–ins occur within and around the [[St. Francois Mountains]] region of southeast Missouri.&lt;ref name="Beveridge" /&gt;

The term has an origin in [[Appalachia]], where it was used to refer to a narrow river [[gorge]] confined by resistant rock layers.&lt;ref name="Beveridge" /&gt; In southern Illinois, the [[Burden Falls Wilderness]] area includes a narrow canyon below a waterfall that is confined by a resistant [[sandstone]] layer. The gorge is referred to as a ''shut–in'', following the Appalachian usage for the term.

It is named after the [[Slide Mountain Terrane]], which is composed of rocks from the ancient oceanic floor.&lt;ref name="Burke Museum"/&gt; There was a [[subduction zone]] on the Slide Mountain Ocean's floor called the [[Intermontane Trench]] where the [[Intermontane Plate]] was being subducted under North America. The floor of the Slide Mountain Ocean was pushed up onto the ancient margin of North America.

'''Table Mountain''' ([[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]]: ''Huri ‡oaxa'',  ''mountain rising from the sea''; [[Afrikaans]]: ''Tafelberg'') is a flat-topped [[mountain]] forming a prominent landmark overlooking the city of [[Cape Town]] in South Africa. It is a significant [[tourist attraction]], with many visitors using the [[Table Mountain Aerial Cableway|cableway]] or hiking to the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibescout.com/za/cape-town/table-mountain|title=Table Mountain in Cape Town|website=www.vibescout.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain forms part of the [[Table Mountain National Park]]. Table Mountain is home to a large array of fauna and flora, most of which is [[Endemism|endemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/table-mountain-facts|title=15 Things You Didn’t Know About Table Mountain|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:BRENDON WAINWRIGHT - Table Mountain 1.jpg|thumb|right|Table Mountain seen from [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] with low-lying cloud cover over Cape Town.]]

[[File:Cape Town under the clouds.webm|thumb|Cape Town under the clouds]]
The main feature of Table Mountain is the level plateau approximately {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} from side to side, edged by impressive cliffs. The plateau, flanked by [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] to the east and by [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] to the west, forms a dramatic backdrop to Cape Town. This broad sweep of mountainous heights, together with [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]], forms the natural [[amphitheatre]] of the [[City Bowl]] and [[Table Bay]] harbour.  The highest point on Table Mountain is towards the eastern end of the plateau and is marked by [[Maclear's Beacon]], a stone cairn built in 1865 by Sir [[Thomas Maclear]] for trigonometrical survey. It is {{convert|1086|m|ft|0}} above sea level, and about {{convert|19|m|ft|0}} higher than the [[#Cableway|cable station]] at the western end of the plateau.

The cliffs of the main plateau are split by Platteklip Gorge ("Flat Stone Gorge"), which provides an easy and direct ascent to the summit and was the route taken by [[António de Saldanha]] on the first recorded ascent of the mountain in 1503.&lt;ref name=bootsnall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bootsnall.com/travelstories/africa/dec02table.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102070413/http://www.bootsnall.com/travelstories/africa/dec02table.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-02|title=Table Mountain|date=December 2002|publisher=BootsnAll Travel|accessdate=2006-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flat top of the mountain is often covered by [[Orographic lift|orographic]] clouds, formed when a south-easterly wind is directed up the mountain's slopes into colder air, where the moisture condenses to form the so-called "table cloth" of cloud.

Table Mountain is at the northern end of a [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|sandstone mountain]] range that forms the spine of the [[Cape Peninsula]] that terminates approximately 50&amp;nbsp;km to the south at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Cape Point]]. Immediately to the south of Table Mountain is a rugged "plateau" at a somewhat lower elevation than the Table Mountain Plateau (at about 1000&amp;nbsp;m), called the "Back Table". The "Back Table" extends southwards for approximately 6&amp;nbsp;km to the [[Constantia Nek]]-[[Hout Bay]] valley. The [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] side of the Back Table, is known as the Twelve Apostles, which extends from Kloof Nek (the saddle between Table Mountain and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]]) to [[Hout Bay]]. The eastern side of this portion of the Peninsula's mountain chain, extending from [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], the eastern side of Table Mountain (Erica and Fernwood Buttresses), and the Back Table to [[Constantia Nek]], does not have single name, as on the western side. It is better known by the names of the conservation areas on its lower slopes: Groote Schuur Estate, [[Newlands Forest]], [[Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens]], [[Cecilia Park]], and [[Constantia Nek]].

The upper approximately 600&amp;nbsp;m portion of the 1&amp;nbsp;km high table-topped mountain, or [[mesa]], consists of 450-510&amp;nbsp;million years old ([[Ordovician]]) rocks belonging to the two lowermost layers of the [[Cape Fold Mountains]].&lt;ref name=compton /&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite book |last=McCarthy |first=T. |last2=Rubidge |first2=B. |year=2005 |title=The Story of Earth and Life |pages=188–192 |publisher=Struik |location=Cape Town |isbn=1-77007-148-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The uppermost, and younger of the two layers, consists of extremely hard [[quartz]]itic [[sandstone]], commonly referred to as "[[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|Table Mountain Sandstone]]" (TMS), or "[[Cape Fold Belt#Table Mountain Group|Peninsula Formation Sandstone"]] (as it is known as at present), which is highly resistant to erosion and forms characteristic steep grey crags. The 70&amp;nbsp;m thick lower layer, known as the "Graafwater Formation", consists of distinctively maroon-colored mudstones, which were laid down in much thinner horizontal strata than the Table Mountain Sandstone strata above it.&lt;ref name=compton /&gt; The Graafwater rocks can best be seen just above the contour path on the front of Table Mountain, and around [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devils Peak]]. They can also been seen in the cutting along [[Chapman's Peak]] Drive. These rocks are believed to have originated in shallow tidal flats, in which a few Ordovician fossils, and fossil tracks have been preserved.&lt;ref name=compton /&gt;&lt;ref name=tankard&gt;{{cite book |last=Tankard |first=A.

The Cape Granite and Malmesbury shales form the lower, gentler slopes of the Table Mountain range on the Cape Peninsula.

The basement rocks are not nearly as resistant to weathering as the TMS, but significant outcrops of the Cape Granite are visible on the western side of Lion's Head, and elsewhere on the Peninsula (especially below Chapman's Peak Drive, and The Boulders near [[Simon's Town]]).&lt;ref name=compton /&gt;&lt;ref name=uct-geology&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/geolsci/cape.htm | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719105740/http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/geolsci/cape.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-19 | title=Geology of the Cape Peninsula | work=[[University of Cape Town|UCT]] Department of Geological Sciences | accessdate=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geology&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capetown.at/heritage/history/prehistory_geo_geol_art.htm | title=The Geology of Table Mountain | work=CapeConnected | accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weathered granite soil of the lower slopes of the Peninsula Mountain range are more fertile than the nutrient-poor soils derived from TMS. Most of the vineyards found on the Cape Peninsula are therefore found on these granitic slopes of the Table Mountain range.

The mountain owes it table-top flatness to the fact that it is a [[syncline]] mountain, meaning that it once was the bottom of a valley (see diagram on the right). The [[anticline]], or highest point of the [[Cape Fold Belt|series of folds that Table Mountain was once part of]], lay to the east, but that has been weathered away, together with the underlying softer Malmesbury shale and granite basement, to form the "Cape Flats". The "Cape Flats" form the isthmus that connects the Cape Peninsula to the Mainland. The Fold Mountains reappear as the [[Hottentots-Holland]] Mountain range on the mainland side of the "Cape Flats".&lt;ref name=compton /&gt; What has added to the mountain's table-top flatness is that it consists entirely of the very hard, lower layer of the [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|Table Mountain Sandstone Formation]]. Originally this was topped by a thin glacial tillite layer, known as the Pakhuis Formation (see the diagram above, left), above which was the upper layer of Table Mountain Sandstone. Both these layers, but especially the tillite layer, are softer than the lower layer of Table Mountain Sandstone.  When these softer layers eroded away, like a cream-topping on a cake, they left a very hard, flat erosion-resistant quartzitic sandstone platform behind which, today, forms Table Mountain's top.

Table Mountain is the northernmost end of a 50&amp;nbsp;km long, and roughly 6–10&amp;nbsp;km wide, Cape Fold Mountain range that forms the back bone of the Cape Peninsula, stretching from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the south to Table Mountain and its flanking Devil's Peak (to the east) and Lion's Head-Signal Hill (to the west) in the north. Table Mountain forms the highest point of this range. The range runs parallel to the other Cape Fold Mountain ranges on the mainland to the east.

Table Mountain and the Back Table have an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape [[fynbos]]. The main vegetation type is endangered [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]],  but [[critically endangered]] [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Shale Renosterveld]] and [[Afromontane|Afromontane forest]] occur in smaller portions on the mountain.

Table Mountain's vegetation types form part of the [[Cape Floral Region]] protected areas. These protected areas are a [[World Heritage Site]], and an estimated 2,285 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain and the Cape Peninsula range, of which a great proportion, including many species of [[protea]]s, are endemic to these mountains and valleys and can be found nowhere else.&lt;ref name=manning1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=In: Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|pages=8–23|url= |lpg= |chapter=The World of Fynbos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maytham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trinder-Smith|first1=Terry|title=In: Wild Flowers of the Table Mountain National Park|date=2006|publisher=Botanical Society of South Africa|location=Cape Town| isbn=1874999600|pages=19–35|url= |lpg= |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 2,285 species on the Peninsula 1,500 occur in the 57&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area comprising Table Mountain and the Back Table, a number at least a large as all the plant species in the whole of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=manning1 /&gt; The [[Disa uniflora]], despite its restricted range within the [[Western Cape]], is relatively common in the perennially wet areas (waterfalls, streamlets and seeps) on Table Mountain and the Back Table, but hardly anywhere else on the Cape Peninsula.&lt;ref name=terry /&gt;&lt;ref name=manning2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=In: Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|pages=162–163|url= |lpg= |chapter=Disa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a very showy orchid that blooms from January to March on the [[Cape Peninsula#Geology|Table Mountain Sandstone regions of the mountain]]. Although they are quite widespread on the Back Table, the best (most certain, and close-up) place to view these beautiful blooms is in the "Aqueduct" off the Smuts Track, halfway between Skeleton Gorge and Maclear's Beacon.

Remnant patches of [[Southern Afrotemperate Forest|indigenous forest]] persist in the wetter ravines. However, much of the indigenous forest was felled by the early European settlers for fuel for the lime kilns needed during the construction of [[Castle of Good Hope|the Castle]].&lt;ref name=Dan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sleigh|first1=Dan|title=Islands|date=2002|publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg|location=London| isbn=0436206323|page=429|url= |lpg= |chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact extent of the original forests is unknown, though most of it was probably along the eastern slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], Table Mountain and the Back Table where names such as Rondebosch, Kirstenbosch, Klassenbosch and Witteboomen survive (in Dutch "bosch" means forest; and "boomen" means trees). Hout Bay (in Dutch "hout" means wood) was another source of timber and fuel as the name suggests.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt; In the early 1900s commercial pine plantations were planted on these slopes all the way from the Constantiaberg to the front of Devil's Peak, and even on top of the mountains, but these have now been largely cleared allowing fynbos to flourish in the regions where the indigenous Afromontane forests have not survived, or never existed.

Fynbos is a fire adapted vegetation, and providing fires are not too frequent, regular or intense, they are important drivers of fynbos diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fire and Plants|last=Bond|first=William J.|publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1996|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular fires have dominated fynbos for at least the past 12&amp;nbsp;000 years largely as a result of human activity.&lt;ref name=maytham /&gt;&lt;ref name=kraaij&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kraaij |first1= Tineke |last2=van Wilgen |first2=Brian W.|chapter= Drivers, ecology, and management of fynbos fires.|editor1-last=Allsopp |editor1-first=Nicky |editor2-last= Colville|editor2-first=Jonathan F. | editor3-last=Verboom |editor3-first=G.

[[File:Table Mountain Dassies.JPG|thumb|Dassies (rock hyrax)]]
==Fauna==
The most common mammal on the mountain was the ''[[dassie]]'' (the South African name, from [[Afrikaans]], pronounced "dussy"), or [[rock hyrax]]. Between about 2000 and 2004 (no one is certain about the exact year or years) their numbers suddenly plummeted for unknown reasons. They used to cluster around the restaurant at the upper cable station, near areas where tourists discarded or (inadvisably supplied) food. The population crash of the dassies was in all probability responsible for the decline in the [[Verreaux's eagle]] population on the [[Cape Peninsula|Peninsula]], which is believed to have consisted of 3 breeding pairs during the period 1950 to 1990, with only 2 pairs, maximally, ever having been reported to fledge a chick each in any given year.&lt;ref&gt;Information gleaned from reports in the Cape Bird Club's newsletters from the 1950s onwards&lt;/ref&gt; With the commencement of formal monitoring in 1993, two breeding pairs were recorded on the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain]] in 2004: one below the upper cable station at the western end of Table Mountain, in Blinkwater Ravine, the other on the cliffs below Noordhoek Peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=A.R. |last2=van Zyl |first2=A.J. |title=Conservation status and community structure of cliff-nesting raptors and ravens on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa |journal=Ostrich | publication-date=2005 |volume=76 |pages=175–184 |ISSN=  0030-6525 |doi=10.2989/00306520509485490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nest near the cable station was abandoned in 2006, leaving only the Noordhoek pair, which continued to fledge chicks reasonably regularly till 2013, at which point one member of the pair disappeared. From 2013 till January 2017 only a single Verreaux's Eagle, presumed to be a female, remained on the Peninsula. She continued to maintain the nest under Noordhoek Peak, but seemed unable to attract a mate. But in early 2017 a pair of eagles was seen by at least 7 independent observers during the course of 10 days (27 January - 5 February). It remains to be seen whether they will breed later in the year.

Table Mountain is also home to [[Cape porcupine|porcupines]], [[mongoose]]s, [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[tortoise]]s, and a rare endemic species of [[amphibian]] that is only found on Table Mountain, the [[Table Mountain ghost frog]]. The last [[lion]] in the area was shot circa 1802. [[Leopard]]s persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the ''rooikat'' ([[caracal]]) and the ''vaalboskat'' (also called the vaalkat or [[Southern African wildcat]]) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the [[jackal buzzard]], [[booted eagle]] (in summer), [[African harrier-hawk]], [[peregrine falcon]] and the [[rock kestrel]].&lt;ref name=hockey /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=Andrew |last2=van Zyl |first2=Anthony |title=Home on the range.

Their numbers in 2017 is unknown.

Up until the late 1990s [[Chacma baboon|baboon]]s occurred on all the mountains of the Peninsula, including the Back Table immediately behind Table Mountain. Since then they have abandoned Table Mountain and the Back Table, and only occur south of Constantia Nek. They have also abandoned the tops of many of the mountains, in favor of the lower slopes, particularly when these were covered in pine plantations which seemed to provide them with more, or higher quality food than the [[fynbos]] on the mountain tops. However these new haunts are also within easy reach of Cape Town's suburbs, which brings them into conflict with humans and dogs, and the risk of traffic accidents. There are now (2014) a dozen troops on the Peninsula, varying in size from 7 to over 100 individuals, scattered on the mountains from the Constantiaberg to Cape Point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baboonsonline.org/bru/ Cape Peninsula Baboon Research Unit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811215937/http://www.baboonsonline.org/bru/ |date=11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baboon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncc-group.co.za/case-studies/managing-baboon-human-conflict-city-cape-town|title=Managing baboon-human conflict: City of Cape Town - Case Studies- NCC Environmental Services|website=www.ncc-group.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baboon troops are the subject of intense research into their physiology, genetics social interactions and habits. In addition, their sleeping sites are noted each evening, so that monitors armed with paint ball guns can stay with the troop all day, to ward them off from wandering into the suburbs. From when this initiative was started in 2009 the number of baboons on the Peninsula has increased from 350 to 450, and the number of baboons killed or injured by residents has decreased.&lt;ref name=baboon /&gt;

[[File:Rau Quagga on Devils Peak.jpg|thumb|left|Rau quagga in the animal camp on the slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], above Groote Schuur Hospital.]]
[[Himalayan tahr]]s, fugitive descendants of tahrs that escaped from [[Groote Schuur Zoo]] in 1936, used to be common on the less accessible upper parts of the mountain. As an exotic species, they were almost eradicated through a culling programme initiated by the [[South African National Parks]] to make way for the reintroduction of indigenous [[klipspringer]]s. Until recently there were also small numbers of [[fallow deer]] of European origin and [[sambar deer]] from southeast Asia. These were mainly in the [[Rhodes Memorial]] area but during the 1960s they could be found as far afield as Signal Hill. These animals may still be seen occasionally despite efforts to eliminate or relocate them.

On the lower slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], above [[Groote Schuur Hospital]]  an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by [[Cecil John Rhodes]] has been used in recent years as part of the [[Quagga Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quaggaproject.org/|title=The Quagga Project|website=The Quagga Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[quagga]] used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the [[Karoo]] and the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] in large numbers, but were hunted to extinction during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by [[Reinhold Rau]] to [[back-breeding|back-breed]] the quagga, after it had been established, using [[mitochondrial DNA]] obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the [[plains zebra]], and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping, was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one can be certain that they are anything more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.

==History==
[[File:Hodges cape-good-hope.jpg|thumb|Table Mountain from [[James Cook|Capt. Cook]]'s ship [[HMS Resolution (1769)|''HMS Resolution'']] by [[William Hodges]] (1772)]]
[[File:De Villiers reservoir.jpg|thumb|De Villers reservoir, just to the left as the Bridle Path reaches the top of the Back Table]]

Prehistoric inhabitation of the district is well attested (see for example the article on [[Fish Hoek]]). About 2000 years ago the [[Khoikhoi]] migrated towards the Cape Peninsula from the north, displacing the San and bringing with them their herds of cattle and sheep. It was the Khoikhoi who were the dominant local tribe when the Europeans first sailed into Table Bay.

António de Saldanha was the first European to land in Table Bay. He climbed the mighty mountain in 1503 and named it '''Taboa do Cabo''' (''Table of the Cape'', in his native [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). The great cross that the Portuguese navigator carved into the rock of Lion's Head is still traceable.

In 1796, during the [[History of South Africa#British at the Cape|British occupation of the Cape]], [[James Henry Craig|Major-General Sir James Craig]] ordered three [[blockhouse]]s to be built on Table Mountain: the King's blockhouse, Duke of York blockhouse (''later renamed Queen's blockhouse'') and the Prince of Wales blockhouse. Two of these are in ruins today, but the King's blockhouse is still in good condition.&lt;ref name="fsg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsgfort.com/DB/F034/04/Text.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711045554/http://www.fsgfort.com/DB/F034/04/Text.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-11 |title=The First British Occupation (1795–1803) |publisher=The [[Fortress Study Group]] |accessdate=2009-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeofgoodhope.org/test/kings.htm |title=Kings Block House |publisher=Cape of Good Hope Living Heritage |accessdate=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118173345/http://www.capeofgoodhope.org/test/kings.htm |archivedate=18 November 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE BATTLE OF BLAAUWBERG - 200 YEARS AGO|journal=Military History Journal |publisher=The South African Military History Society|volume=13|issue=4|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol134ws.html|accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and easily accessible from the [[Rhodes Memorial]].

Between 1896 and 1907, five dams, the Woodhead, Hely-Hutchinson, De Villiers, Alexandria and Victoria reservoirs, were opened on the Back Table to supply Cape Town's water needs. A ropeway ascending from [[Camps Bay]] via Kasteelspoort ravine was used to ferry materials and manpower (the anchor points at the old top station can still be seen). There is a well-preserved steam locomotive from this period housed in the [[Waterworks Museum]] at the top of the mountain near the Hely-Hutchinson dam. It had been used to haul materials for the dam across the flat top of the mountain. Cape Town's water requirements have since far outpaced the capacity of the dams and they are no longer an important part of the water supply.

Arguments for a national park on the Cape Peninsula, centred on Table Mountain, began in earnest in the mid-1930s. Following a big fire in 1986, the ''Cape Times'' started a 'save the mountain' campaign, and in 1989 the Cape Peninsula Protected Natural Environment (CPPNE) area was established. However, environmental management was still bedeviled by the fragmented nature of land ownership on the Peninsula. Following another big fire in 1991, Attorney General Frank Kahn was appointed to reach consensus on a plan for rationalizing management of the CPPNE. In 1995, Prof. Brian Huntley recommended that SANParks be appointed to manage the CPPNE, with an agreement signed in April 1998 to transfer around 39,500 acres to SANParks. On 29 May 1998, then-president Nelson Mandela proclaimed the Cape Peninsula National Park. The park was later renamed to the [[Table Mountain National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burning Table Mountain: an environmental history of the Cape Peninsula|last=Pooley|first=Simon|publisher=Palgrave / UCT Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-349-49059-2|location=London / Cape Town|pages=135–161|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fires are common on the mountain. The [[2006 Table Mountain fire|most recent major fire]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s include those of January 2006, which burned large amounts of vegetation and resulted in the death of a tourist (a charge of arson and culpable homicide was laid against a British man who was suspected of starting the blaze), and March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/importance-of-fire-to-fynbos-1828492|title=Independent Online|last=Pooley|first=Simon|date=6 March 2015|work=|access-date=10 January 2017|via=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Table Mountain was named one of the [[New7Wonders of Nature]].&lt;ref name="new7wonders.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.new7wonders.com| title=  The Provisional New 7 Wonders of Nature | publisher= new7wonders.com| accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cableway==
[[File:Tablemountain kabelkar.jpg|thumb|Table Mountain "Rotair" Aerial Cable Car (1997)]]

The [[Table Mountain Aerial Cableway]]&lt;ref name=cableway&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tablemountain.net|title=Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company|accessdate=2006-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes passengers from the lower cable station on Tafelberg Road, about 302&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, to the plateau at the top of the mountain, at 1067&amp;nbsp;m. The upper cable station offers views overlooking [[Cape Town]], [[Table Bay]], [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] and [[Robben Island]] to the north, and the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] seaboard to the west and south.

The original construction was awarded in 1926 to the former world-renowned cable way company Adolf [[Bleichert]] &amp; Co. of Leipzig, Germany &lt;ref&gt; Bleichert Passenger Cable Way Order Book: Order November 16, 1926 – Exhibit No.3013&lt;/ref&gt;, taking more than two years to build the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway, due to infrastructural works, official opening was on October 4, 1929.  

The Table Mountain Aerial Cableway has been refurbished three times since its first inauguration in 1929. The first refurbishment occurred in 1958, the second in 1974, whereas the third, latest and most important reconstruction has been started in 1996, which began operation in 1997 and included a "Rotair" panorama gondola manufactured by the Swiss company Garaventa AG - CWA ([[Doppelmayr Garaventa Group]]). 

Many improvements have been introduced since 1929, with new and bigger gondolas that increased capacity from 20 up to 65 passengers per gondola. However, both the valley and mountain station buildings are original, even they have been extensively upgraded. The new cable cars give a faster journey to the summit, and rotate through 360 degrees during the ascent or descent, giving a panoramic view over the city.

The top cable station offers viewpoints, curio shops, a restaurant and walking trails of various lengths.

==Activities==

===Hiking on Table Mountain===
[[File:Hiking trail going up Table Mountain.jpg|thumb|Winter ascent of Table Mountain. Hikers set out on one of the many popular trails]]
[[File:Maclear's Beacon text.jpg|thumb|The plaque at [[Thomas Maclear|Maclear's]] beacon at the highest point on Table Mountain (and the [[Cape Peninsula]]) at 1084&amp;nbsp;m. It commemorates Maclear's recalculation of the curvature of the earth in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1750, Abbé [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] had measured the curvature of a [[meridian arc]] northwards from Cape Town, to determine the [[figure of the earth]], and found that the curvature of the earth was less in southern latitudes than at corresponding northern ones (i.e. that the earth was slightly pear-shaped, with the wider bulge south of the equator). However, when Sir [[George Everest]] visited the Cape in 1820 and inspected the site of La Caille's measurements in Cape Town, he suggested to Maclear that the gravitational effect of Table Mountain could have caused a miscalculation of the curvature of the meridian. This was based on Everest's experience in the [[Himalayas]]. Taking this factor into account [[Thomas Maclear|Maclear]] established the curvature of the Southern Hemisphere was in fact the same as that of the Northern Hemisphere.]]

Hiking on Table Mountain is popular amongst locals and tourists, and a number of trails of varying difficulty are available. Because of the steep cliffs around the summit, direct ascents from the city side are limited. Platteklip Gorge, a prominent gorge up the centre of the main table, is a popular and straightforward direct ascent to the summit. Par for the course is about 2.5 hours but is done between 1–3 hours depending on one's fitness level. This route is very hot in summer, as it is located on the north facing slope of the mountain, with almost no shade along the 600&amp;nbsp;m climb from Tafelberg Road to the Table Mountain plateau.

[[File:Table Mountain Eastern Slopes - Natural Areas - Cape Town.png|thumbleft|Map showing the conservation areas and forests of the eastern slopes of Table Mountain and the Back table. e.g. [[Cecilia Park]], [[Kirstenbosch]], [[Newlands Forest]],  and Groote Schuur Estate. The north face of the mountain (Table Mountain flanked by [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] to the east and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] to the west, as well as the "Twelve Apostles" on the Atlantic side are also shown.]]
Longer routes to the summit go via the Back Table, a lower area of Table Mountain to the south of the main, northern, plateau (which constitutes "Table Mountain" as seen from the Cape Town City Centre and Table Bay). From the Southern Suburbs side, the Nursery Ravine and Skeleton Gorge routes start at [[Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden]]. The route via Skeleton Gorge to Maclear's Beacon is known as Smuts Track in memory of [[Jan Smuts]], who was a keen hiker. The Bridle Path, or Jeep Track, makes a more gradual ascent from [[Constantia Nek]] along the road used to service the dams on Back Table. There are many other paths in popular walking areas on the lower slopes of the mountain accessed from [[Constantia Nek]], [[Cecilia Park]], [[Kirstenbosch]], [[Newlands Forest]] and [[Rhodes Memorial]].

On the Atlantic side, the most popular ascent is Kasteelspoort, a gorge overlooking [[Camps Bay]], but there are a few others, but not as many as on the east side of the mountain.

There is a popular "Contour Path" that runs from [[Constantia Nek]], and then, in succession, above [[Cecilia Park]], [[Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens]], [[Newlands Forest]], and from there, above Groote Schuur Estate, past the King's Blockhouse, at the north-east corner of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], immediately below the Mowbray Ridge cliffs, to the front of Devil's Peak and the north face of Table Mountain, ending at the bottom of Kloof Corner Ridge at the western end of the Table Mountain cliffs.&lt;ref name=slingsby&gt;{{cite book |last1=Slingsby |first1=Peter | title=Table Mountain, the map|location=Muizenberg |publisher=Baardskeerder |publication-date=2010|isbn= 978-1-920377-10-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Hugh|last2=Mackenzie|first2=Bruce|title=Common wild flowers of Table Mountain|pages=12–13, 96–98|publication-date=2007|publisher=Struik Publications|location=Cape Town|isbn=978 1 77007 383 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starts at Constantia Nek at 250&amp;nbsp;m, but immediately gradually climbs to around 320&amp;nbsp;m at Angela's Memorial and the look-out point above [[Cecilia Park]]. It then undulates down and up again at about this elevation as far the north-western corner of Kirstenbosch, when the path suddenly climbs quite steeply to 470&amp;nbsp;m to the scree (or Dassieklip) below the cliffs of Fernwood Buttress. It then descends again to 350&amp;nbsp;m, only to ascend again to 400&amp;nbsp;m, 1&amp;nbsp;km later. It remains at this level, as a true 'contour path', to the King's Blockhouse, and from there, eventually, to Tafelberg Road (at 400&amp;nbsp;m). From the King's Blockhouse it is possible to choose a footpath that will lead to the "upper contour path" which traverses the front (north face) of Devil's Peak and Table Mountain at 500&amp;nbsp;m, to just beyond the Lower Cable Station. From there it is possible, from either contour path, to join up with the "Pipe Track" which starts from Kloof Nek, and then runs at an elevation of about 300&amp;nbsp;m, below the cliffs of the Twelve Apostles, on the Atlantic side of the mountain range as far as the Oudekraal Ravine, where the path goes up the ravine to join the "Apostles Path" on top of the Back Table at an elevation of 685&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; There are innumerable paths which join the contour path from below (at least five from Kirstenbosch alone), and somewhat fewer that join it from above.&lt;ref name=slingsby /&gt;&lt;ref name=clark /&gt;

On top of the mountain, and particularly on the Back Table, there is an extensive network of well marked footpaths offering hiking opportunities over a wide variety of terrains, and distances which can be covered in 30&amp;nbsp;minutes to several hours (or even all day if so desired).&lt;ref name=slingsby /&gt; Good maps of all the routes are available at bookshops and outdoor recreation stores, which hikers are advised to use, as dense mist and cold weather (or extreme heat) can descend without warning at any time of the year.

The Hoerikwaggo Trails&lt;ref name=hoerikwaggo_trail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/ht/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217093556/http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/ht/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-17|title=Hoerikwaggo Trails|publisher=SANParks|accessdate=2006-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; were four hiking trails on the Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain ranging from two to six days, operated by South African National Parks (SANPARKS) between the [[Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront]] and [[Cape Point]]. Today (2017) the trails can no longer be undertaken with an official SANPARKS guide, and only four of the original accommodation facilities are operational (the Overseer's Cottage on the Back Table, the Orange Kloof Tented Camp, the Slangkop Tented Camp and the Smitswinkel Tented Camp). These camps are "self-catering", each with communal ablution facilities, with large communal kitchen/lounge areas, fully equipped for 12 persons.&lt;ref name=Hoerikwaggo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnp.co.za |title=Hoerikwaggo Tented Camps |publisher=Table Mountain National Park |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; SANPARKS arranges for luggage and provisions to be transported to the operational cottages and tented camps, so that the hikers can ascend the mountain unencumbered by heavy backpacks.

The original inhabitants of the area, the [[Khoikhoi|Khoekhoen]] and [[San people|San]] tribes, called Table Mountain Hoerikwaggo – "sea mountain". The four Table Mountain Hoerikwaggo hiking trails were called the People's Trail, Table Mountain Trail, Orangekloof Hiking Trail and Top to Tip Trail.&lt;ref name="Table Mountain_Trails"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown-direct.com/43things/table-mountain-national-park-hoerikwaggo-trails |title=Table Mountain Trails |publisher=Cape Town Direct |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403104101/http://www.capetown-direct.com/43things/table-mountain-national-park-hoerikwaggo-trails |archivedate=3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock climbing===
[[Rock climbing]] on Table Mountain is a very popular pastime. There are well-documented climbing routes of varying degrees of difficulty up the many faces of the mountain. The main climbs are located on cliffs below the upper cable station. No bolting can be done here and only [[traditional climbing]] is allowed. Commercial groups also offer abseiling from the upper cable station.

===Caving===
Most of the world's important caves occur in [[limestone]] but Table Mountain is unusual in having several large cave systems that have developed in sandstone. The biggest systems are the Wynberg Caves, located on the Back Table, not far from the Jeep Track, in ridges overlooking [[Orange Kloof]] and [[Hout Bay]].

===Mountain biking===
The slopes of Table Mountain have many jeep tracks that allow mountain biking. The route to the Block House is a popular route for bike riding. Plum Pudding Hill is the name of a very steep jeep track. Bike riders should follow the directional signs on display for mountain bike riders.

=="Mensa" constellation==
Table Mountain is the only [[Earth|terrestrial]] feature to give its name to a [[constellation]]:  ''[[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]]'', meaning ''The Table''. The constellation is seen in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], below [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], around midnight in mid-July. It was named by the French [[astronomy|astronomer]] [[Nicolas de Lacaille]] during his stay at the Cape in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagman |first=Morton |date=2003 |title=Lost Stars |publisher=McDonald &amp; Woodward |page=207 |isbn=0-939923-78-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tanapag''' is a settlement on the island of [[Saipan]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. It is located close to Tanapag Beach on the northwest coast, just to the north of [[Capital Hill, Saipan|Capital Hill]], the island group's centre of government. It lies on the Marpi Road ([[Northern Mariana Islands Highway 30|Highway 30]]), which stretches the length of the island's northwest coast.

The area around Tanapag Beach was the site of major fighting during the [[Battle of Saipan]] in 1944.

The '''Tapiche Reserve''' is a private conservation property located in [[Tapiche District]], [[Requena Province]], [[Loreto Region]] in [[Peru]]. The 1,540 hectare reserve, accessible only by waterway, is located 340&amp;nbsp;km up river from [[Iquitos]] on the [[:es:Río Tapiche|Tapiche River]]. The reserve comprises several types of [[:es:Selva baja|lowland Amazonian forests]], including [[Freshwater swamp forest|igapo]], [[:pt:Várzea|varzea]], and terra firme. The reserve represents one of the few areas in the Amazon basin where these forest types can be found in close proximity. The reserve spans both sides of the Tapiche River east of the Ucayali River; and is home to endangered species such as [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), [[bald uakari]] (''Cacajao calvus''), [[giant armadillo]] (''Priodontes maximus''), the [[Brazilian tapir]] (''Tapirus terrestris''), the [[Amazonian manatee]] (Trichechus inunguis), [[harpy eagle]] (''Harpia harpyja''), [[Cedrela odorata|cedar]] (''Cedrela odorata''), [[Swietenia macrophylla|mahogany]] (''Swietenia macrophylla'') and others. Inside the reserve, there are bodies of water and swamps including lakes, canals, [[Oxbow lake|oxbows]], [http://amazonwiki.org/index.php/Palm_swamp_/_Aguajal aguajales], and [[restinga]]s. It has annual temperatures ranging from 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F) to 33&amp;nbsp;°C (91&amp;nbsp;°F) and an annual rain fall of about 3 meters, permitting an immense variety of species to thrive in the area. A land survey and rapid species inventory of Tapiche Ohara’s Reserve was performed in 2011. The species inventory is reproduced below in table format. The reserve is designated by the Peruvian government as a Private Conservation Area (PCA).

== Location ==
The reserve can be reached from ports in [[Iquitos]] or [[Nauta]]. [[Requena, Loreto|Requena]], is the last public port to buy gasoline and supplies. Travel by water from Iquitos to Requena includes navigating up the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Ucayali River]]s. With a 25&amp;nbsp;hp motor boat, the trip takes 6 hours. A slower vessel such as a larger cargo vessel can take 16 hours. From Nauta to Requena by water, one takes the [[Marañón River]] briefly to the Amazon River and then the Ucayali River. This trip takes 4 hours in a 25&amp;nbsp;hp motor boat. From Requena to Tapiche Reserve, a private or rental boat is needed to go up the Tapiche River. In a 25&amp;nbsp;hp motor boat, the trip takes 5 hours. An alternative to boat travel is to take a flight from Iquitos to the reserve in a seaplane. There is a private plane in Iquitos available for rental.

== Hydrography ==
The reserve is located in the basin of the [[:es:Río Tapiche|Tapiche River]], the main tributary of the [[Ucayali River]]. Coming down from the eastern sub-Andean foothills of Sierra de Moa, the [[:es:Río Tapiche|Tapiche River]] originates near the Peruvian border with Brazil. The Blanco and Umaita Rivers empty into the Tapiche River in the basin area. Other tributaries are the Contea, Capanahua, and Lamayacu Rivers. The Tapiche River is regarded as a "black water" river because of its dark sepia waters. Possessing little material in suspension, its color comes from the decomposition of organic material forming [[Humic acid|humic and fulvic acids.]] These waters are acidic, with pH around 4.0 and a temperature from 24&amp;nbsp;°C (75&amp;nbsp;°F) to 32.0&amp;nbsp;°C (90&amp;nbsp;°F). The Tapiche River has a strictly sub-Andean and origin, which eliminates a direct relationship with rainfall in the mountains. Within the reserve there are small bodies of water (oxbows, channels, [[meander]]s, and lakes) that communicate with each other and with the Tapiche River. Channels that connect curved river-bends create navigable shortcuts during flooded season. The largest internal body of water is called Quebrada Chambiria. Quebrada Chambiria has little flow which creates habitat for a host of species.

== Weather ==
The climate is warm and wet with mean annual temperatures between 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F) and 33&amp;nbsp;°C (91&amp;nbsp;°F) and [[relative humidity]] of 78% to 96%. In the rainy season from October to May there is tropical rainfall. The average annual precipitation is 3 meters. During the months of June or July a particular weather phenomenon called a “cold spell” occurs in the region. The cold spell is related to penetration of air masses coming from the southern polar latitudes and entering the South American tropics shortly after reaching Southeast Brazil. This cold spell lasts about 2–4 days, where temperatures can reach 13&amp;nbsp;°C (55&amp;nbsp;°F).

== Terrain ==
The Tapiche River basin in the area of the reserve exhibits a landscape containing [[alluvial plain]]s and associated [[floodplain]]s. The floodplains of the alluvial landscape encompass [[swamp]]s or aguajales; while the non-flooded plains appear as undulating terraces. There are hilly landscapes within the reserve which appear as gently sloping lowland terrain. Swamps have developed on flat land and in depressions formed by fibric [[Histosol|histosol soils]] with pH values varying between 3.5 and 5. In these swamps, there are four representative botanical families, including: [[Moraceae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Annonaceae]] and [[Arecaceae]]. Also found are [[Hura crepitans|catahua]] (''Hura crepitans''), [[strangler fig]] (''Ficus'' sp.), [[Eschweilera|machimango]] (''Eschweilera'' sp.), and [[Virola pavonis|caupuri]] (''Virola pavonis''), [[Mauritia flexuosa|aguaje]] (''Mauritia flexuosa''), [[Attalea phalerata|shapaja]] (''Attalea phalerata''), [[Socratea exorrhiza|cashapona]] (''Socratea exorrhiza''), renaco (''Ficus trigona''), espintana ([http://tropicos.org/Name/1600379 ''Oxandra espintana'']) and huimba (''[[Pachira aquatica]]'').

== Aquatic ecosystems ==
The reserve houses ecosystems formed by conditions that create microhabitats. The ecosystems present on the reserve encompass cochas and [[:es:Selva baja|tahuampas]]. Primary plant species found in these aquatic ecosystems are species belonging to the family [[Poaceae]]; especially the Gramalote blanco (''[[Paspalum]] fasciculatum'') and others of the genera ''[[Echinochloa]]'' and ''Paspalum''. Also present is [[Gynerium sagittatum|caña brava]] (''Gynerium sagittatum''), [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]] (''putu putu'', ''Eichhornia crassipes''), and [[Pistia stratiotes|huama]] (''Pistia stratiotes'').

[[image:Tribrach for surveying instruments.JPG|right|thumb|A tribrach with an optical plummet (the black cylinder pointing to the left lower corner of the image).]]
A '''tribrach''' is an attachment plate used to attach a [[surveying]] instrument, for example a [[theodolite]], [[total station]], [[GNSS]] antenna or [[target (surveying)|target]] to a [[tripod]]. A tribrach allows the [[Surveying|survey]] instrument to be repeatedly placed in the  same position over a surveying marker point with sub-[[millimetre]] [[Accuracy and precision|precision]], by just loosening and re-tightening a locking handle or lever to adjust the instrument base in a horizontal plane.

== Components of a tribrach ==
[[Image:View through optical plummet.jpg|right|thumb|View through an optical plummet of a prism adapter.]]
[[Image:Surveyors tripod head.jpg|right|thumb|The head of a [[Tripod (surveying)|surveyor's tripod]] with the screw for mounting the tribrach.]]
The device consists of two triangular metal plates connected at their corners by leveling [[Thumbscrew (fastener)|thumbscrews]], a [[bubble level]], a locking [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] and often an [[Optics|optical]] [[Plumb bob|plummet]]. The centre of the bottom plate of the tribrach has a 5/8-11 UNC thread bolt hole which is used to attach the tribrach to the [[tripod]]. The top plate of the tribrach has three small holes or slots spaced at 120 degrees above leveling thumbscrews, and a locking mechanism which enables a survey instrument or target to be accurately placed on the tribrach and locked in place.

The [[Optics|optical]] [[Plumb bob|plummet]] has either a bullseye or [[Cross-hair|cross hair]] sight for positioning the instrument over a [[Surveying|survey]] marker or ground control point. The older tribrachs required a [[Plumb bob|plumb line]] to allow them to be positioned vertically over a point and were slower to set up.

Some modern [[total station]]s have an integral  [[laser]] [[Plumb bob|plummet]] built in.

== Using a tribrach ==
[[File:Optisches Lot ZEISS JENA (4483).jpg|thumb|Using an optical plummet. Here the tribrach is not central on the tripod plate as it is being aligned over the marker]]
[[File:Reflector on tribranch.jpg|thumb|Laser reflector target on tribrach and marker column.]]
The process is iterative between horizontal position and top plate level, because they are interactive. The following general process is followed:
* The tribrach is attached to the [[tripod]] and placed over the marker. 
* Looking through the [[Optics|optical]] [[Plumb bob|plummet]] pick up two of the [[tripod]] legs and position the [[Cross-hair|cross hairs]] over the marker. Tread all three legs into the grass, [[Asphalt|bitumen]], concrete. 
* Look through the [[Optics|optical]] [[Plumb bob|plummet]] and using the [[Thumbscrew (fastener)|thumbscrews]] put the [[Cross-hair|cross hairs]] back over the marker. 
* Adjust the level of the tribrach by slackening the [[tripod]] screws and sliding the legs. Re-center the [[Cross-hair|cross hairs]] using the thumb screws, then fine-tune the level using the [[tripod]] legs. Once the tribrach is nearly centered over the marker, level the tribrach the last little bit using the [[Thumbscrew (fastener)|thumbscrews]]. 
* Slacken the tribrach from the [[tripod]] head and slide it the last 4-5mm so that it is centered over the marker and is level.  

If the target over which the instrument is to be placed is roughly at the same elevation as the tripod feet, the preceding technique is applicable.  However, if there is a considerable difference between the elevation of the target and the elevation of the marker and the instrument bottom plate, such as when the target is in a deep hole, or on a [[Bilby tower]]  for instance, the target will appear to move laterally by a large distance in the optical plummet as the tribrach level is adjusted.

Tribrachs are [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] instruments and should be checked regularly to ensure they do not become a source of error.

[[File:Trinity House Maritime Museum - geograph.org.uk - 626296.jpg|thumb|Trinity House, Leith]]
'''Trinity House''', 99 Kirkgate, is a category A [[listed building]]&lt;ref name= "historic scotland"&gt;[http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:27834 Historic Scotland - Listed Buildings - 99 New Kirkgate, Trinity House]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leith]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which was a [[guild hall]], [[customs house]], and centre for maritime administration and [[poor relief]]. In the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]] and [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|Early Modern Era]] it also served as an [[almshouse]] and [[Hospital#Medieval Europe|hospital]]. Now in [[Historic Scotland|state care]], it houses a [[maritime museum]].

Trinity House was the headquarters of the Incorporation of Masters and Mariners, a [[Guild|trade incorporation]] and charitable organisation founded in the 14th century when the shipowners and shipmasters of Leith formed a [[Fraternity]] (from which the name, ''Trinity'', may derive). The present Trinity House is a Category A [[Listed building|listed]] [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] house, designed by [[Thomas Brown (architect)|Thomas Brown]] and built in 1816-8, using the existing basement and vaults of the former Trinity House and mariners' hospital of 1555.&lt;ref name= "historic scotland" /&gt;

Concerned to improve safety at sea, Trinity House established the first formal [[Seamanship|nautical training]] in the country and licensed [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]s for the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] and around the [[Geography of Scotland|Scottish coast]]. By collecting Licht Money (light money), by the 17th century they were maintaining primitive coal-fired lights in the Forth. In the 19th century, Trinity House was involved in the planning and funding of new and more reliable [[lighthouse]]s that took advantage of improvements in technology. These included the [[Bell Rock lighthouse]], [[Fidra lighthouse]] and the [[Isle of May lighthouse]].

The Masters and Mariners invested in land, which became known as Trinity Mains, near the village of [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]]. This land later developed into a suburb of Leith and is now the modern-day district of [[Trinity, Edinburgh|Trinity]].

The medieval Incorporation served as a blueprint for the establishment of Trinity Houses in other maritime centres, including Dundee, [[Hull Trinity House|Hull]], [[Trinity House, London|London]] and [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].

==History==
[[File:Convening Room Trinity House, Leith N wall.JPG|thumb|Convening Room Trinity House]]
The Masters and Mariners of the Trinity House in the Kirkgate was the oldest and wealthiest of the [[trade guild]]s of Leith. The guilds were divided into four groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/11.htm The Story of Leith - The Trade Guilds of Leith]&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Sea captain|skipper]]s and [[Sailor|mariner]]s of the Trinity House
# [[Maltman|maltmen]], [[brewer]]s, and [[sled]]ders or [[cart]]ers
# [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and meal men (''[[Cereal|corn merchants]]'')
# traffickers (''[[merchant]]s''), and all other gentlemen and residents of Leith not members of any of the other corporations

In 1380 [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] granted the Incorporation of Master and Mariners of Leith the right to levy a [[Duty (economics)|duty]], called prime gilt, of 12 [[Scottish coinage|pennies]] on each [[ton]] of goods landed at Leith. An additional voluntary contribution, called crown money, was also collected. Trade was largely conducted over the [[North Sea]], with the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and [[Baltic region]]s, the [[Low Countries]] and France. The funds raised by the prime gilt and crown money were then used for the [[Poor relief|relief]] of the sick, the poor and the widows and orphans of lost or captured mariners; and to care for aged mariners.

In 1555 the Incorporation had sufficient funds to build a hospital at the Kirkgate. The basement of this building survives under the current Trinity House.

Following a series of disputes over payments, in 1566 [[Mary Queen of Scots]] confirmed the right of the Incorporation to collect payments: ratifying "the gift, foundation, erection and institution of the hospital and of the prime gilt". Refusal to pay would result in the [[confiscation]] of sails and anchor.

In 1680, funded by fees and by a levy on Leith shipmasters, the Masters and Mariners appointed a professor to teach the mathematics of navigation to the sons and apprentices of shipmasters. This training for future officers was subsequently extended across Scotland.

On 29 June 1797 the Corporation of the Trinity House of Leith was granted a [[royal charter]].

As a result of the requirement for formal qualifications stipulated in the [[Merchant Seamen Act 1844]], in 1855 Trinity House and other Leith organisations founded the Leith Navigational School (also called the Government Navigation School), based at a room at [[St Ninian's Church, Leith|St Ninian's Church]] (also called the Mariners' Church), on Commercial Street. In 1903 Leith Navigation School came under the control of the [[Scottish Education Department]], and the name was changed to [[Leith Nautical College]] (since merged to become part of [[Jewel &amp; Esk College]], which in 2012 merged to become [[Edinburgh College]]).

Prime gilt was abolished in 1862, so Trinity House had to depend on property income to meet pension payments.

Currently Trinity House is in the care of [[Historic Environment Scotland]].
