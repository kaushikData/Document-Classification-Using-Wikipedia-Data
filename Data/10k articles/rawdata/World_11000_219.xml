The '''Atlantic Institute''' (full name, '''Atlantic Institute for International Affairs''') was an independent, non-governmental institute that promoted economic, political, and cultural relations among [[NATO]] alliance members and the international community in general.  Based in [[Paris]], France, it was founded in 1961 and closed in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott-Smith |first=Giles |date=2014 |title=Maintaining Transatlantic Community: US Public Diplomacy, the Ford Foundation and the Successor Generation Concept in US Foreign Affairs, 1960s–1980s |journal=Global Society |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=90–103 |doi=10.1080/13600826.2013.848189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was approved by the NATO Parliamentarians
Conference in June 1959 and opened formally on January 1, 1961.  Former Belgian Prime Minister [[Paul van Zeeland]] was the first Chairman of the institute, while [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]] became Director-General later that year.  Headquarters initially were at the [[Hôtel de Crillon]], site of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]].  Funding of $250,000 over five years was supplied by the [[Ford Foundation]], with a further $800,000 given between 1969 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1978, talks were held to consider a merger between the Atlantic Institute and the  [[Trilateral Commission]], a similar private institution promoting American, European, and Japanese cooperation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On July 12, 1984, the offices of the Institute were bombed by the left-wing guerrilla group [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]], who described the institute as  an "imperialist" organization working for NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The AAD uses an air transport system, both for transport to and from Antarctica, and for transport within the continent. Aircraft for this system are provided and operated under contract by private sector operators. Services to and from Antarctica are provided, between November and February each year, by an [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A319-115LR]] operated by [[Skytraders]]. This aircraft operates to and from the [[Wilkins Runway|Wilkins ice runway]], situated some {{convert|65|km}} from Casey Station.&lt;ref name=awnov10&gt;{{cite news | first = Scmitz | last = Sebastian | title = From Oz to Ice: Flight Operations of the Australia Antarctic Division | work = Airliner World | publisher = Key Publishing Ltd | date = November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aadair&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.antarctica.gov.au/living-and-working/travel-and-logistics/aviation | title = Aviation | publisher = Australian Antarctic Division | accessdate = 16 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101004145005/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/living-and-working/travel-and-logistics/aviation| archivedate= 4 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services within Antarctica are provided by a mixture of [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopter]]s. Fixed-wing services are provided by a pair of [[CASA C-212 Aviocar|CASA 212–400]] aircraft, equipped with skis, that are also operated by Skytraders. These aircraft operate from Wilkins runway and from smaller snow runways at each of the three permanent stations, as well as any field locations which provide the necessary flat area of snow or ice. Helicopter services are provided by three [[Eurocopter AS350|Eurocopter AS 350 BA Squirrel]] helicopters, operated by [[Helicopter Resources]].&lt;ref name=awnov10/&gt;&lt;ref name=aadairint&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.antarctica.gov.au/living-and-working/travel-and-logistics/aviation/intra-continental-operations | title = Intra-continental operations | publisher = Australian Antarctic Division | accessdate = 16 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100929041909/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/living-and-working/travel-and-logistics/aviation/intra-continental-operations| archivedate= 29 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Antarctic Flight RAAF]] operated from 1948 to 1963. Since its withdrawal, aircraft from the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] operated infrequently in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands in the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate=24 March 2010|title=Antarctic Flight|url=http://www.raaf.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/antarctic.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613173237/http://www.raaf.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/antarctic.htm|archivedate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|1991|pp=110–114}} and more recently in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RAAF operates C-17 proof of concept flights to Antarctica|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2015/11/raaf-operates-c-17-proof-of-concept-flights-to-antarctica/|work=Australian Aviation|date=22 November 2015|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipping ===
The AAD uses the icebreaker ''RSV [[Aurora Australis (icebreaker)|Aurora Australis]]'', a multi-purpose marine research and resupply ship chartered from [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O Polar]]. The ''Aurora Australis'' was launched in 1989 and built by [[Forgacs Shipyard|Carrington Slipways]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=aadauraus&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.antarctica.gov.au/living-and-working/travel-and-logistics/ships/aurora-australis | title = Aurora Australis | publisher = Australian Antarctic Division | accessdate = 16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late October 2015 the Australian government announced a plan to acquire a new ice-breaker to replace ''Aurora Australis'' by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ikin|first1=Sam|last2=Bolger|first2= Rosemary|last3=Gamenz|first3=Emilie|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-29/pm-turnbull-releases-details-of-new-500-million-icebreaker/6893848|title=New $500&amp;nbsp;million icebreaker Australia's biggest investment the Antarctic program, Prime Minister says|publisher=ABC News|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Territorial administration ==
The AAD is responsible, on behalf of the Australian Government, for administering the two Australian federal territories that lie in Antarctic or sub-Antarctic latitudes:

*[[Australian Antarctic Territory]]
*[[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]]

Although the AAD maintains a base on [[Macquarie Island]], that island is not a federal territory but is rather part of the Australian state of [[Tasmania]].

{{Taxation}}

[[File:Treasury Department rear view.JPG|thumb|The [[United States Department of the Treasury]] decided against signing the 2016 OECD anti–BEPS MLI initiative from the {{slink|#OECD BEPS Project}}, stating that the U.S.: "has a low degree of exposure to base erosion and profit shifting".&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt;
  International tax academics showed in 2018 that U.S. multinationals are the largest users of BEPS tools in the world;&lt;ref name="zucwright"/&gt; while U.S tax academics demonstrated, even as early as 1994, that the U.S. exchequer is a net beneficiary from the use of tax havens and BEPS by U.S. multinationals.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dryng"/&gt;]]

'''Base erosion and profit shifting''' or '''BEPS''' refers to corporate [[tax planning]] strategies used by [[multinational companies|multinationals]] to "shift" profits from higher–tax jurisdictions to lower–tax jurisdictions, thus "eroding" the "tax–base" of the higher–tax jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/|title=OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OECD defines BEPS strategies as also: "exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules";&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/|title=OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, academics proved corporate [[tax havens]] (e.g. Ireland, the Caribbean, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and Hong Kong),{{efn|These are also the largest [[offshore financial centres]] ("OFCs"); a term considered by academics to be synonymous with the term [[tax haven]]}} who are the largest [[Corporate haven#Global BEPS hubs|global BEPS hubs]], use OECD–whitelisted tax structures and OECD–compliant BEPS tools.&lt;ref name="zux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="be"/&gt;  [[Corporate tax haven]]s offer BEPS tools to "shift" profits to the haven, and additional BEPS tools to avoid paying taxes within the haven (e.g. Ireland's "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]").{{efn|''Green Jersey'' was the BEPS tool Apple used in Q1 2015 to restructure its non–U.S. IP.

Research in September 2018, by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], using repatriation tax data from the TCJA, said that: "In recent years, about half of the foreign profits of U.S. multinationals have been booked in tax haven affiliates, most prominently in Ireland (18%), Switzerland, and Bermuda plus Caribbean tax havens (8%–9% each).&lt;ref name="zucwright"/&gt;  One of the authors of this research was also quoted as saying: “Ireland solidifies its position as the #1 tax haven.”; and also that: “U.S. firms book more profits in Ireland than in China, Japan, Germany, France &amp; Mexico combined.

==Tools and techniques==
{{main|Corporate haven#Global BEPS hubs}}

Research identifies three main BEPS techniques used for "shifting" profits to a [[corporate tax haven]] via OECD–compliant BEPS tools:&lt;ref name="zew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp13078.pdf|title=Profit Shifting and "Aggressive" Tax Planning by Multinational Firms|publisher=[[Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung|Centre for European Economic Research]], (ZEW)|author1=Clemens Fuest|author2=Christoph Spengel|author3=Katharina Finke|author4=Jost Heckemeyer|author5=Hannah Nusser|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tilburg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=143915| title=Intellectual Property Tax Planning in the light of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  | publisher=University of Tilburg | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

BEPS tools could not function if the corporate tax haven did not have a network of bilateral tax treaties that accept the haven’s BEPS tools, which "shift" the profits to the haven.  Modern corporate tax havens, who are the main global BEPS hubs, have extensive networks of bilateral tax treaties.&lt;ref name="dhh"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article/24/4/661/547359#|title=What Problems and Opportunities are Created by Tax Havens?|author=[[Dhammika Dharmapala]]|journal=[[Oxford Review of Economic Policy]]|page=3|date=December 2008|volume=24|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.K. is the leader with over 122, followed by the Netherlands with over 100.&lt;ref name="ukx"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Tax Treaty Network of the United Kingdom|url =http://www.fieldtax.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2013-9-ILT-247-The-Tax-Treaty-Network-of-the-United-Kingdom1.pdf|journal=International Taxation|volume=9|issue=13|quote=The United Kingdom has 122 bilateral, comprehensive, double taxation conventions in force.

Ireland was the first major corporate tax haven to be ''blacklisted'' by a G20 economy; Brazil, in September 2016.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ireland-brazil-funds/blacklisted-by-brazil-dublin-funds-find-new-ways-to-invest-idUSL8N1MK2NX|title=Blacklisted by Brazil, Dublin funds find new ways to invest|agency=Reuters|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/04/10/tax-haven-blacklisting-13-latin-american-countries/|title=Tax haven blacklisting in Latin America|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important academic study in July 2017 published in ''[[Nature (Magazine)|Nature]]'', "[[Conduit and Sink OFCs]]", showed that the pressure to maintain OECD–compliance had split corporate–focused tax havens into two different classifications: [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFCs]], which act as the ''terminus'' for BEPS flows, and [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]], which act as the ''conduit'' for flows from higher–tax locations to the Sink OFCs.  It was noted that the 5 major Conduit OFCs, namely, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Switzerland, all have a top–ten ranking in the 2018 ''[[Global Intellectual Property Center|Global Innovation Property Centre]] (GIPC) IP Index".&lt;ref name="ip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=GIPC IP Index 2018|date=February 2018|author=[[United States Chamber of Commerce]]|quote=Figure I: U.S. Chamber International IP Index 2018, Overall Scores|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once profits are "shifted" to the corporate tax haven (or Conduit OFC), additional tools are used to avoid paying ''headline'' tax rates in the haven.  Some of these tools are OCED–compliant (e.g. [[patent box]]es, [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] ("CAIA") or "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]"), others became OECD–proscribed (e.g. [[Double Irish]] and [[Corporate haven#Dutch "Double Dip"|Dutch Double–Dipping]]), while others have not attracted OECD attention (e.g. [[double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|Single Malt]]).

Because of the need for BEPS hubs (or Conduit OFCs) to have extensive bilateral [[tax treaties]] (e.g. so that their BEPS tools will be accepted by the higher–tax locations), they go to great lengths to obscure the fact that ''effective tax rates'' paid by multinationals in their jurisdiction are close to zero percent, rather than the ''headline'' corporate tax rate of the haven (see [[#Table 1|Table 1]]).  Higher–tax jurisdictions do not enter into full bilateral tax treaties with obvious tax havens (e.g. the Cayman Islands, a major Sink OFC).  This is achieved with [[Financial Secrecy Index|financial secrecy]] laws, and by the avoidance of ''country–by–country reporting'' ("CbCr") or the need to file public accounts, by multinationals in the haven's jurisdiction.  BEPS hubs (or Conduit OFCs) strongly deny they are corporate tax havens, and that their use of IP is as a tax avoidance tool.&lt;ref name="straits"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/spore-is-no-tax-haven-govt-experts-here|title=MOF rejects claim of Singapore as tax haven|work=The Straits Times|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They call themselves "[[Corporate haven#The "Knowledge Economy"|knowledge economies]]".&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Singapore's government says it's not a tax haven, it's a value–adding IP hub|url = https://www.smh.com.au/business/singapores-government-says-its-not-a-tax-haven-its-a-valueadding-hub-20150430-1mwvdu.html|work=Sydney Morning Hearald|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Ireland as a tax haven#Impact of TCJA}}
{{see also|Double Irish arrangement#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act}}

The [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] ("TCJA") moved the U.S. from a "worldwide" corporate tax system to a hybrid{{efn|The TCJA system is described as ''hybrid'', because it still forces minimum U.S. tax rates on foreign income under the TCJA GILTI regime}} "territorial" tax system.  The TCJA includes anti–BEPS tool regimes including the GILTI–tax and BEAT–tax regimes.  It also contains its own BEPS tools, namely the FDII–tax regime.{{efn|The FDII regime allows U.S. multinationals to charge-out [[intellectual property]] ("IP") direct from the U.S., at a preferential 13.125% U.S. tax rate}}  The TCJA could represent a major change in Washington's tolerance of U.S. multinational use of BEPS tools.  Tax experts in early 2018 forecast the demise of the two major U.S. corporate tax havens, Ireland and Singapore, in the expectation that U.S. multinationals would no longer need foreign BEPS tools.&lt;ref name="harvd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://harvardmagazine.com/2018/05/mihir-desai-tax-reform|title=Tax Reform: Round One|work=Harvard Magazine|author=[[Mihir A.

However, by mid–2018, U.S. multinationals had not repatriated any BEPS tools,{{efn|This is not to be confused with the repatriation of the circa USD 1 trillion in offshore untaxed cash; these are the [[intellectual property]] ("IP") assets that U.S. multinationals house in locations like Ireland which are the ''raw materials'' for the BEPS tools.

In March–May 2018, Google committed to doubling its office space in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/google-to-pay-over-115m-to-buy-treasury-building-37154126.html|title=Google, Facebook and Salesforce.com dramatically expand their Dublin office hubs|date=26 July 2018|work=Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in June 2018 it was shown that Microsoft is preparing to execute Apple's Irish BEPS tool, the "Green Jersey" (see [[Ireland as a tax haven#Technical issues with TCJA|Irish experience post–TCJA]]).&lt;ref name="em"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.businesspost.ie/news/irish-microsoft-firm-worth-100bn-ahead-merger-419721|title=Irish Microsoft firm worth $100bn ahead of merger|work=Sunday Business Post|date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2018, one of Ireland's leading tax experts forecasted a potential boom in U.S. multinationals on–shoring their BEPS tools from the Caribbean to Ireland, and not to the U.S. as was expected after TCJA.&lt;ref name="seamus coffey green jersey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.com/2018/07/when-can-we-expect-next-wave-of-ip.html|title=When can we expect the next wave of IP onshoring?|quote=IP onshoring is something we should be expecting to see much more of as we move towards the end of the decade.

'''''Bosta''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Autobus'' [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Bosta'' &amp;mdash; بوسطة) is a 2005 [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[film]] by the director [[Philippe Aractingi]]. Bosta is a story of young Lebanese artists who meet again, after being separated, and tour different cities of [[Lebanon]] in an old bus, performing a techno version of the [[dabkeh]] that shocks conservatives, but moves forward towards the future. [[Simon Emmerson]] and [[Martin Russell]] from the group, [[Afro Celt Sound System]] composed original music for the [[dabkeh]] (dance) sequences and composed the film's underscore respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psfilmfest.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=11801&amp;FID=29 Bosta | 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival | Philippe Aractingi | Lebanon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212045145/http://www.psfilmfest.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=11801&amp;FID=29 |date=February 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quoting from the official site: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Bosta'' is a road musical that takes the audience on a wonderful journey across various Lebanese regions... a journey accompanied by a groundbreaking soundtrack and, of course, this truly pioneering dance, the electro-dabkeh.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Bosta'' was the best selling film in Lebanon in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.club-internet.fr/film/anecdote_gen_cfilm=121497.html AOL Neuf Cegetel - Club Internet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185650/http://cinema.club-internet.fr/film/anecdote_gen_cfilm%3D121497.html |date=September 27, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie was submitted as the official [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] entry in the [[79th Academy Awards|79th Academy Awards (Oscars)]] in the Best Foreign Language Film category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscarguy.com/History/Oscars/79th/Foreign.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213022935/http://www.oscarguy.com/History/Oscars/79th/Foreign.html |archivedate=2007-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brigasca''', {{lang-fr|'''Brigasque'''|italic=no}}, is a [[breed]] of [[sheep]] from [[Liguria]] in north-west Italy&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; and the [[département]] of [[Alpes-Maritimes]] in south-western France. It takes its name from the town of [[La Brigue]] ({{lang-it|{{noitalics|Briga Marittima}}}}), which was until 1947 in the Italian [[province of Cuneo]].&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; The Brigasca is raised in the provinces of [[province of Imperia|Imperia]] and [[province of Savona|Savona]] in Italy, and neighbouring areas in France. It appears to have origins in common with the [[Frabosana]] and [[Delle Langhe]] breeds.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; It is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt;

In 2013 total numbers recorded in Italy for the breed were 3008;&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt; the French population was reported in 2001 to be 570.&lt;ref name=dad2/&gt;

'''Chain ganging''' is a term in the field of international relations describing the elevated probability for interstate conflict or conflagration due to several states having joined together in alliances or coalitions.

The agreed principles of such alliances typically include [[Mutual Defense Treaty|mutual defence clauses]] requiring that, in the case of one member state suffering military attack from another power, all members must declare hostilities against that offending power. The result of such an arrangement is an elevated probability for an international conflagration, since the case of an actor attacking another power would almost certainly trigger, whether intentionally or not, a multinational conflict potentially involving many more actors than the original two states which had attacked and been attacked, respectively. According to sworn agreements or treaties no member state has the option to refuse to participate in this involvement: once the states have agreed to the alliance, they are bound by obligation to join in the hostilities or conflagration as soon as they have begun in one state (though this obligation is not always honoured).

==Historical examples==
An empirical example of the chain ganging dilemma is [[World War I]]. When [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] decided to part from the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], both [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[German Empire|Germany]] were alone for the most part in [[Europe]] (though [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined Austria-Hungary and Germany to form the [[Central Powers]]), and surrounded by the [[Allies (World War I)|Allied Powers]]. The defeat of either of the two would severely weaken the remaining member. According to [[Kenneth Waltz]], "The defeat or defection of a major ally would have shaken the balance, each state was constrained to adjust its strategy and the use of its forces to the aims and fears of its partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Waltz|first = Kenneth|title = Theory of International Politics|publisher = McGraw-Hill Humanities|year = 1979|isbn = 0-07-554852-6|page = 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term is a metaphor deriving from [[chain gang]]s, groups of people, usually prisoners or slaves, bound together with chains or other devices as they work or march. Like a real-life chain gang, the states joined together in a chain gang, according to bound obligation, have no option to refuse to follow along with the intent of the others. However, in reality, the members of a chain gang coalition can and sometimes do choose to refuse to acquiesce, in which case they may face international ostracism (at least from the other members of their former alliance), and possibly courtship on the part of rival coalitions. This is because, typically, few punitive actions exists in the realm of [[international law]] that can sufficiently compel a power to follow its obligations at all costs, and therefore, the incentives to breaking ranks can sometimes be rather high, especially when the state does not agree with the actions taken by the other members of its coalition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1598">'''ECAPS''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] space company, established in 2000 by the [[Swedish Space Corporation]] (SSC) and [[Volvo Aero]] with the primary purpose of developing [[rocket propellant]]s safer than [[hydrazine]], but with the same application areas. The company was acquired in 2017 and is currently part of the Bradford group of space systems companies, which is itself part of the larger AIAC group of manufacturing companies

One of the developed propellants is [[HPGP]], a name for a propellant blend consisting primarily of [[ammonium dinitramide]], [[ammonia]], [[methanol]] and [[water]]. Another name for the propellant is LMP-103S, which refers to the specific blend. Propellant is currently being produced in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden with production of thruster systems primarily produced within Bradford facilities (which include ECAPS facilities) in [[Solna]], Sweden and [[Heerle]], Netherlands.

ECAPS HPGP systems have been used on the European [[PRISMA]] mission and is currently being used by [[Planet]] for its SkySat line of spacecraft. Twelve spacecraft to date have been launched with HPGP systems. HPGP is also planned to be used on the [[Lunar Flashlight]] and [[ArgoMoon]] missions to the [[Moon]], on [[Astroscale]] space debris removal spacecraft, on the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s [[STPSat-5]] technology demonstrator spacecraft and on the [[Astranis]] microGEO bus.

'''Eager Lion''' is a two-week multinational [[military exercise]] held annually in [[Jordan]] since 2010. It is organized by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/05/19/United-States-joins-17-nations-for-war-games-in-Jordan/8061432058426/&lt;/ref&gt; 18 countries participated in the exercise in 2015 including, Jordan, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], [[Australia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], the [[UAE]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/eager-lion-2015-concludes-joint-drill&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise revolves around troop deployments, chemical warfare, border security, command and control, cyber defense and battlespace management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/759235/us-jordan-partner-in-eager-lion-exercise&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise "amounts to an outgrowth of the annual bilateral 'Infinite Moonlight' US-Jordan exercise that stretches back to the 1990s."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0529/US-18-other-nations-wrap-up-Eager-Lion-military-exercise-in-Jordan|title=US, 18 other nations, wrap up Eager Lion military exercise in Jordan|date=2012-05-29|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-12-10|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12573">{{Life in the Arab League}}
The [[Arab League]] is rich in resources, with enormous oil and natural gas reserves. The region's instability has not affected its tourism industry, which is considered the fastest growing sector in the region, with [[Egypt]], the [[UAE]], [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]] leading the way. Another industry that is growing steadily in the Arab League is [[telecommunications]]. Within less than a decade, local companies such as [[Orascom]] and Etisalat have managed to successfully compete internationally as global power players.

Economic achievements among member states have been low in the League's history. Other smaller Arab organizations, such as the GCC, have achieved more than the League has. However, lately there has emerged several major economic projects that slated to be completed soon that appear promising. Of these, the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]], a project which hopes to funnel Egyptian and Iraqi gas to Jordan, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], and then to [[Turkey]] and [[Europe]], is scheduled to reach completion by the year 2010. The [[Council of Arab Economic Unity#Greater Arab Free Trade Area|GAFTA]] free trade agreement is to be completed by the January 1, 2008, effectively rendering 95% of all [[Arab]] products free of customs tax.

The economic development in the [[Arab League]] exhibits a great diversity. There is a significant difference between, on the one hand, the rich oil states of the [[UAE]], [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], and on the other hand, the poor countries like the [[Comoros]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Djibouti]]. For instance, the GDP per capita of the wealthiest Arab country, [[Qatar]] at purchasing power parity, is 35 times higher than that of Djibouti.&lt;ref name="IMF PPP per capita"&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&amp;ey=2017&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=55&amp;pr1.y=9&amp;c=512%2C946%2C914%2C137%2C612%2C546%2C614%2C962%2C311%2C674%2C213%2C676%2C911%2C548%2C193%2C556%2C122%2C678%2C912%2C181%2C313%2C867%2C419%2C682%2C513%2C684%2C316%2C273%2C913%2C868%2C124%2C921%2C339%2C948%2C638%2C943%2C514%2C686%2C218%2C688%2C963%2C518%2C616%2C728%2C223%2C836%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C142%2C156%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C359%2C960%2C453%2C423%2C968%2C935%2C922%2C128%2C714%2C611%2C862%2C321%2C135%2C243%2C716%2C248%2C456%2C469%2C722%2C253%2C942%2C642%2C718%2C643%2C724%2C939%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C726%2C646%2C199%2C648%2C733%2C915%2C184%2C134%2C524%2C652%2C361%2C174%2C362%2C328%2C364%2C258%2C732%2C656%2C366%2C654%2C734%2C336%2C144%2C263%2C146%2C268%2C463%2C532%2C528%2C944%2C923%2C176%2C738%2C534%2C578%2C536%2C537%2C429%2C742%2C433%2C866%2C178%2C369%2C436%2C744%2C136%2C186%2C343%2C925%2C158%2C869%2C439%2C746%2C916%2C926%2C664%2C466%2C826%2C112%2C542%2C111%2C967%2C298%2C443%2C927%2C917%2C846%2C544%2C299%2C941%2C582%2C446%2C474%2C666%2C754%2C668%2C698%2C672&amp;s=PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a= World Economic Outlook Database, January 2018], [http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28 International Monetary Fund].

The '''Embassy of Turkey in Washington, D.C.''' is the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] to the [[United States]].  It is located at 2525 [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]] in the [[Embassy Row]] neighborhood.

The chancery is housed in a new building, inaugurated by Turkish [[President of Turkey|President]] [[Süleyman Demirel]] on April 23, 1999.  Designed by [[Shalom Baranes Associates]], it reflects aspects of Turkish [[vernacular architecture]] while harmonizing with the styles of the [[Kalorama, Washington, D.C.|Sheridan-Kalorama]] neighborhood.

Previously, the embassy had been housed in a mansion farther south, at [[Sheridan Circle]] and 23rd Street, N.W.  The building today serves as the Turkish ambassador's residence.  It was originally built for [[Edward Hamlin Everett]], a bottling millionaire, in 1915.  The Everett House was designed by [[George Oakley Totten, Jr.]], a Washingtonian who had spent a brief period in Turkey as the official architect for [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]]. The Turkish government leased the building in 1932 and purchased it four years later.

The '''Energy Efficiency Rating''' (EER) is a score applied to dwellings in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. It ranges from zero to six system– the higher the number of stars, the better. This is mandatory for all dwellings offered for sale in the ACT.

The term can also refer to a rating given to household goods sold in the EU. The rating shown on a [[EU energy label|label]] displayed at the point of sale.

It is also a term relating to EU directive 2002/91/EC by which the energy efficiency of all buildings in England and Wales have to be stated when the building is sold as part of the [[Energy Performance Certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Engelsborgskolen''' is a public primary school in the western part of [[Kongens Lyngby]], [[Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Inaugurated in 1909, it is the oldest active school in Lyngby-Taarbæk. It has been used as a location in a number of films and television series, including as Little Per's school in the original [[Father of Four]] films.

==History==
[[File:Engelsborgskolen.jpg|thumb|left|Engelsborgskolen]]
The first school in Kongens Lyngby, a ''[[rytterskole]]'', was built next to the village pond in 1722. Ut was expanded with a two-storey brick building in 1882.  The old rytterskole building from 1722 was replaced by a new residence for the school principal in 1904. The local population was growing steadily and Lyngby School soon became too small. It was therefore decided to built a new school at Engelsborgsvej.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thorshoj.dk/Rytterskoler_Koebenhavn.HTM|title=Rytterskolerne i Københavns Rytterdistriktn|language=Danish|website=Rytterskoler_Koebenhavn.HTM|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was founded on 30 January 1909. Exams were introduced in 1918.&lt;ref name=danskefilm&gt;{{cite web|url=https://danskefilm.dk/lokation.php?id=173|title=Engelsborgskolen|language=Danish|website=danskefilm.dk|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has later been expanded several times, for instance with the construction of a new main building in 1935 and again in 1978. The school was refurbished and expanded by Rubow Arkitekter in 2008..

==Premises==
Yje new main building from 1935  contains classrooms for the older students. The old main building contains science rooms and is also home to the school dentist. Building B from 1978 and contains workshops and classrooms for mid-level students. Building H contains administration and facilities for teachers. A new sports hall was built in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engelsborgskolen.skoleporten.dk/sp/263693/foreside?pageId=c5ae43e8-afc5-4da5-9bf9-878801380726|title=Om skolen|language=Danish|publisher=Engelsborgskolen|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Engelsborgskolen has been used for all schoolyard scenes in the seven original ''[[Far til fire]]'' (''Father of Four'') film in the period 1953 to 1961. The school has also been used as a location in the films ''[[Lise kommer til byen]]'' (1947), ''[[Vejrhanen]]'' (1952), ''[[Sunes familie]]'' (1997) and ''[[Bølle Bob og Smukke Sally]]'' (2005) as well as in the [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2]] [[Nordic Christmas calendar|Christmas calendar]] ''[[Brødrene Mortensens jul]]'' (1998,2002).&lt;ref name=danskefilm/&gt;

'''Estonian Swedish''' ({{lang-sv|estlandssvenska}}, {{lang-et|rannarootsi keel}}) describes the eastern dialects of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] that were spoken in the formerly Swedish-populated areas of [[Estonia]] (locally known as ''[[Aiboland]]'') on the islands of [[Ormsö]] (Vormsi), [[Ösel]] (Saaremaa), [[Hiiumaa|Dagö]] (Hiiumaa) and [[Runö]] (Ruhnu), and the peninsula (former island) of [[Nuckö]] (Noarootsi), by the local Estonian Swedes.

Until the evacuation of the [[Estonian Swedes]] near the end of [[World War II]], both Swedish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] were commonly spoken on the named islands. After Estonia's reestablishment of independence following the fall of the Soviet Union, Estonian Swedish experienced a revival, with courses in the language being offered on Dagö and Ösel.

Estonian Swedish comprises a number of sub-dialects, for example ''nuckömål'' and ''rågömål''.

An example of the ''nuckömål'' dialect from the ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'', compared with standard modern Swedish:

:''Stick tälknin i stolpan o hälvtor stolpan topa kalkan, säte Halmen o Hälma färe kalkan o ker te Nuckö toka.''

Standard Swedish:

:''Stick täljkniven i stolpen och vält stolpen på kälken, sätt Hjälmen och Hjälma för kälken och kör till Nuckö.''

'''Germa''' ({{lang-ar|جرمة}}), known in ancient times as '''''Garama''''', is an archaeological site in [[Libya]]. It was the capital of the [[Garamantian Kingdom]].

The Garamantes were a [[Berbers|Berber]] people living in the [[Fezzan]] in the northeastern [[Sahara Desert]]. Garamantian power climaxed during the second and the third centuries [[Common Era|AD]], often in conflict with the [[Roman Empire]] to the north. Garama had a population of some four thousand and another six thousand living in villages within a 5 km radius.

The Garamantes often conducted raids across Rome's African frontier, the ''[[Limes Tripolitanus]]'', and retreat back to the safety of the desert. In 203 the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Septimius Severus]] launched a campaign deep into the Sahara, capturing Garama, but he abandoned it soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Anthony. ''Septimius Severus, the African emperor''. (2000), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was conquered by [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] in 49 [[Hijri year|A.H.]] (c. 669).&lt;ref&gt;Salem Mohammed ez Zawam, "Mu’jam al Amakin al Jughrafiya fi Libia", Dar wa Maktabat ash Sha’b, Misratah, 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological work at Germa has most recently been conducted by Prof. [[David Mattingly (author)|David Mattingly]]'s Fazzan Project, which has continued the work of Charles Daniels and Mohammed Ayoub. The Fazzan Project is about to publish the second of four planned volumes based on its work.

{{refimprove|date=November 2010}}
'''Goodwife''' ([[Scots language|Scots]]: ''Guidwife''), usually abbreviated '''Goody''', was a polite form of address for women, formerly used where "Mrs.", "Miss" and "Ms." would be used today. Its male counterpart is [[Goodman (title)|Goodman]]. However, a woman addressed by this title was of a lesser social rank than a woman addressed as [[Mistress (form of address)|Mistress]]. 

"Goodwife" and "Goody" were used in [[England]], [[Scotland]], and [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial America]], with the earliest known use circa 1325.&lt;ref&gt;"Goodwife", ''Oxford England Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-18th century they had become [[archaism|archaic]] outside Scotland, and they are perhaps best known today as the forms of address used in [[Arthur Miller]]'s historical fiction ''[[The Crucible]]'', in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s short story "[[Young Goodman Brown]]", the novels ''[[Magnus (novel)|Magnus]]'' by [[George Mackay Brown]], ''[[The Witch of Blackbird Pond]]'' (name Goodwife Cruff) by [[Elizabeth George Speare]], and [[Mossflower]] by [[Brian Jacques]].

Although the expression "Goody Two-Shoes" is sometimes credited to the children's book ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'' (1765), the expression appears as far back as a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Goody Two-Shoes|journal=American Notes and Queries|volume=5|issue=1|date=May 3, 1890|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Hemel en aarde"''' ("Heaven and earth") was the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]], performed in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] by [[Edsilia Rombley|Edsilia]].

The song is a moderately up-tempo ballad, with Edsilia describing her feelings on discovering love in what was seemingly an unexpected place. She tells her lover that "Heaven and earth are opening/When you touch me", as well as singing that she "never wanted to believe" that such a thing was possible.

The song was recorded in English as "Walking On Water".

The song was performed eighteenth on the night (following [[Cyprus]]' [[Michael Hajiyanni]] with "[[Genesis (Michalis Hatzigiannis song)|Genesis]]" and preceding [[Sweden]]'s [[Jill Johnson]] with "[[Kärleken är]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 150 points, placing 4th in a field of 25.  This was the Netherlands' best result in the contest since their win in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]], until [[The Common Linnets]] reached a second place in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]] with their song "[[Calm After the Storm]]".

It was succeeded as [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Dutch representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]] by [[Marlayne]] with "[[One Good Reason (song)|One Good Reason]]".

The [[song]] has also been covered by artist [[Ruth Jacott]].

==Hemel-en-Aarde==
There is a valley just beyond Hermanus (South Africa) called the Hemel-en-Aarde valley. Some of the most southern vineyards in South Africa are found here.

[[San Marino]] has a [[multi-party]] system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.

==The parties==
&lt;!--:''The general rule on naming applies. That means: the parties are named in the English translation and the original native name is placed on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the English form. Rationale and specifics: See: [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]''.--&gt;

===Parties with official representation===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2768">'''Politique étrangère''' is the oldest French [[Academic journal|journal]] dedicated to the study of [[international relations]]. Created in 1936 by the French Council on Foreign Relations, this [[quarterly]] was taken over and published by the [[Institut français des relations internationales]] — French Institute for International Relations — when it was founded in 1979.

Open to world debates, Politique étrangère is the first distributor of French analysis for foreign countries. Politique étrangère is a long-term reference for academics, opinion leaders and members of civil society. It aims at highlighting all the key elements as to foreign affairs and offering deep analyses of today's international context.

Each edition offers at least two dossiers about an event or an aspect of the international debate, as well as several articles deciphering the emerging issues. Politique étrangère also places great interest in the latest French and foreign publications dealing with international relations.

We can mention [[Raymond Aron]], [[André Beaufre]], [[Jacques Berque]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Louis Massignon]] or even [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] among the authors who wrote articles for Politique étrangère.

{{For|the BBC Television docudrama adaptation|The Worst Journey in the World (docudrama)}}

'''''The Worst Journey in the World''''' is a memoir of the 1910–1913 [[Terra Nova Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition]] led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]]. It was written and published in 1922 by a member of the expedition, [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]], and has earned wide praise for its frank treatment of the difficulties of the expedition, the causes of its disastrous outcome, and the meaning (if any) of human suffering under extreme conditions.

== Preparations and the ''Worst Journey'' ==
In 1910, Cherry-Garrard and his fellow explorers travelled by sailing vessel, the [[Terra Nova (ship)|''Terra Nova'']], from [[Cardiff]] to [[McMurdo Sound]], [[Antarctica]]. 'Cherry' was teased at first by some of the other members of this expedition because of his lack of Antarctic experience, his lack of specialised credentials for the position of 'assistant [[zoologist]]' to which he had been named, and persistent suspicions among some of his comrades that he had in fact bought his way on board by contributing £1,000 to the expedition's troubled funds.{{sfn|Wheeler|p=59}}

Cherry-Garrard responded to these taunts with modesty, a self-sacrificial ability to work hard, and acute observational skills. He was also, according to novelist, biographer, and socialite [[Nancy Mitford]], the only [[intellectual]] amongst the crew.{{sfn|Wheeler|p=269}} These traits were to serve him well when it came time for him to write down his memories of the expedition. They also caught the eye of the expedition's second-in-command, [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Dr Edward 'Bill' Wilson]], who adopted Cherry-Garrard as a [[Mentorship|protégé]].{{sfn|Wheeler|pp=68, 145}}

Dr Wilson's personal goal in Antarctica was to recover eggs of the [[Emperor penguin]] for scientific study.{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|1989|p=281}} It was thought at the time that the flightless (and "primitive") penguin might shed light on an evolutionary link between reptiles and birds through its [[embryo]].{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|1989|p=282}} As the bird nests during the Antarctic winter, it was necessary to mount a special expedition in July 1911, from the expedition's base at [[Cape Evans]], to the penguins' [[rookery]] at [[Cape Crozier]]. Wilson chose Cherry-Garrard to accompany him and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|'Birdie' Bowers]] across the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] under conditions of complete darkness and temperatures of −40&amp;nbsp;°C and below. All three men, barely alive, returned from Cape Crozier with their egg specimens, which were stored. 

It was this "Winter Journey", not the later expedition to the [[South Pole]], that Cherry-Garrard later described as ''The Worst Journey in the World''.{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|1989|pp=277–356}}

== Later: the tragedy and the book ==
The expedition then swung into preparations for a march from Cape Evans to the as-yet-unreached South Pole. This march was to be done during the Antarctic summer in 1911–1912. Scott's strategy called for a large team of men, ponies, motor sledges and dogs to start out southward from their base, hauling food and fuel on sledges. As the team progressed southward, the leader would successively send support groups back home, leaving a small "Pole party" of the fittest men to make the final advance to the South Pole.

Cherry-Garrard accompanied the initial team across the Ross Ice Shelf and up the [[Beardmore Glacier]], the slide that discharges ice from the [[Antarctic Plateau]] down onto the shelf. At the edge of the polar plateau Scott told him that he would have to return northward.{{sfn|Wheeler|pp=127–29}} The men not chosen to go on to the Pole all returned to the base camp at Cape Evans. Some returned by ship to Britain; others, including Cherry-Garrard, stayed in the Antarctic and prepared to meet Scott and his four companions on the return journey. But for a variety of reasons, partly described in ''The Worst Journey in the World'', the rendezvous failed.&lt;ref&gt;On the return journey from the Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry had been given the task of using the dog teams to meet Scott's party and assist them home,&lt;ref&gt;Cherry Garrard 1992 ''The Worst Journey'', ch XIII "The primary object of this journey with the dog team[s] was to hurry Scott and his companions home" but they "were never meant to be a relief journey".&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact Cherry-Garrard did not penetrate beyond One Ton Depot, only 11 miles distant from Scott's final location where he and his companions froze to death.

In 1912–1913 Cherry-Garrard and other expedition members once again marched southward, this time to try to find traces of their lost comrades. Cherry-Garrard's description of the frozen tent that contained three of them is one of the most dramatic sections of the book. Inside the tent were the remains of Scott and Cherry-Garrard's two companions on the ''Worst Journey'', Bowers and Wilson.{{sfn|Wheeler|pp=142–46}}

In his book, Cherry-Garrard extensively defends his actions and non-actions, and polar historian [[Roland Huntford]] has diagnosed the ''Worst Journey'' as "an immature but persuasive, highly charged [[apologia]]".&lt;ref&gt;R. Huntford (2010) ''Race for the South Pole. The Expedition Diaries of Scott and Amundsen'', p307&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry Garrard closes with a written meditation on the themes of self-sacrifice and heroism.

Although ''The Worst Journey in the World'' was published only nine years after the end of the ''Terra Nova'' expedition, that short length of time had made clear that new technology, particularly [[Snowcat|caterpillar-tread vehicles]] (proposed for snow travel by Scott in a 1908 memorandum and developed by his engineer [[Reginald Skelton]] for the 1910 expedition), and later aeroplanes, would revolutionise future work in the Antarctic and make much of the suffering endured by Scott and his men unnecessary. The next visitors to the South Pole ice surface (in October 1956) would [[George J. Dufek#Antarctic experience|arrive and depart by airplane]].

''The Worst Journey in the World'' asks, but does not answer, the question of whether this suffering was futile, or whether it would inspire future human beings facing very different challenges.{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|1989|pp=606–43}}

== An epilogue ==
The ''Winter Journey'' to the penguin rookery eventually became a case study on how a [[paradigm shift]] in scientific methodology can devalue data that had begun to be gathered before the shift. At the time the ''Terra Nova'' expedition sailed, many biologists believed in [[recapitulation theory]]. They believed that examining the embryos of key species, such as the Emperor penguin, would show how the species—and, by extension, how the family of [[bird]]s as a whole—had evolved. The expedition's chief scientist Wilson determined to try to collect specimens based upon this theory.{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|1989|p=282}}

As the survivors of the ''Terra Nova'' returned to England several years later, recapitulation theory had begun to be discredited. Cherry-Garrard turned over the egg specimens to [[embryologist]]s at London's [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], who were largely uninterested in the donation.{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|1989|pp=351–52}} Cherry-Garrard describes how he was told that the retrieved eggs had not added much to their knowledge of [[penguin]] [[embryology]], nor to scientific knowledge as a whole.{{sfn|Wheeler|p=161}}

== Honours ==
In 1994 ''The Worst Journey in the World'' was published as the first numerical entry in the [[Picador Travel Classics]].  The July/August 2001 issue of ''[[National Geographic Adventure]]'' listed "The 100 Best Adventure Books of All Time", with ''The Worst Journey in the World'' named first.{{sfn|National Geographic, 100 Greatest}}

== Adaptations ==
A drama documentary, also entitled ''[[The Worst Journey in the World (docudrama)|The Worst Journey In The World]]'', written by and starring [[Mark Gatiss]], was broadcast on [[BBC Four]] in April 2007.

The book was also adapted by Stef Penney for the BBC as a two-part radio drama in the [[Classic Serial]] strand&amp;nbsp;– it was first broadcast on 21 and 28 September 2008 and directed by [[Kate McAll]].{{sfn|BBC, Classic Serial}} It featured specially-composed music written by [[Will Gregory]], orchestrated by [[Ian Gardiner (composer)|Ian Gardiner]] and performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] under [[Grant Llewellyn]]. Cherry-Garrard was played by [[Matt Green (actor)|Matt Green]] and Scott by [[John McAndrew (actor)|John McAndrew]], with [[Carl Prekopp]] playing Dr Atkinson, [[Mark Meadows (actor)|Mark Meadows]] as Captain Oates and [[Peter Callaghan]] as Lieutenant Bowers. Other cast included [[Simon Lee Phillips]] (Charles Wright), [[Richard Mitchley]] (Dr Edward Wilson), [[Jack Reynolds (actor)|Jack Reynolds]] (PO Tom Crean) and [[Huw Davies (actor)|Huw Davies]] (Taff Evans).

'''USA-168''', also known as '''GPS IIR-9''' and '''GPS SVN-45''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the ninth [[GPS Block IIR|Block IIR]] GPS satellite to be launched, out of thirteen in the original configuration, and twenty one [[GPS Block IIRM|overall]]. It was built by [[Lockheed Martin]], using the [[AS-4000]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

USA-168 was launched at 22:09:01 UTC on 31 March 2003, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D297, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Space Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-168 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37FM]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2r.htm|title=GPS-2R (Navstar-2R)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 3 April 2003, USA-168 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20063|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20433|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 720.64 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to broadcast the PRN 21 signal, and operates in slot 3 of plane D of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a mass of {{convert|2032|kg}}, and a design life of 10 years.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; As of 2012 it remains in service.

'''Van Rensselaer Potter II''' (August 27, 1911 &amp;ndash; September 6, 2001) was  an [[United States|American]] [[biochemist]].  He was professor of [[oncology]] at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] for more than 50 years.

In 1970, Dr. Potter coined the term ''[[bioethics]]'' to describe a new philosophy that sought to integrate biology, ecology, medicine, and human values. Bioethics is often linked to [[environmental ethics]] and stands in sharp contrast to [[biomedical ethics]]. Because of this confusion (and appropriation of the term in medicine), Potter chose to use the term ''[[global bioethics]]'' in 1988. Awarded the [[Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry]] in 1947.
