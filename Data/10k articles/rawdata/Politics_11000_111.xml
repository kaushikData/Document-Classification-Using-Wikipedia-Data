'''''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life''''' (2007) is a non-fiction book by [[Barbara Kingsolver]] detailing her family's attempt to eat only locally grown food for an entire year.

==Description==
The book revolves around the concept of improving the family's diet by eating only foods that her family was able to grow themselves or obtain locally (save for grains and [[olive oil]]). Kingsolver, along with her husband and daughters, start a farm in [[Virginia]] where they grow and [[canning|can]] different varieties of tomatoes, learn about rooster [[husbandry]], make cheese, and adjust to eating foods only when they are locally in season. The book contrasts this with the ecological costs of growing food in [[factory farm]]s, transporting it thousands of miles, and adding chemical [[preservatives]] so it will not spoil.&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0508/p13s02-bogn.html|title=A Year of Eating Locally in 'Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'|last=Kehe|first=Marjorie|date=May 8, 2007|publisher=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2007/05/20/the_constant_gardener/|title=The Constant Gardener|last=Bass|first=Rick|date=May 20, 2007|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt was published in the May/June 2007 issue of ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/05/seeing_red.html Excerpt of ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life'' at motherjones.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also audio files of a May 16, 2007 discussion between Kingsolver and her husband at an hour-long presentation at a bookstore in [[Corte Madera, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=May 16, 2007 |title=Barbara Kingsolver's "Animal, Vegetable, Miracle" |url=http://globalpublicmedia.com/barbara_kingsolvers_animal_vegetable_miracle |publisher=Global Public Media |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at #7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1691789,00.html Grossman, Lev; Top 10 Nonfiction Books; time.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rick Bass wrote in ''The Boston Globe'' that "this text will fold quietly into the reader's consciousness, with affecting grace and dignity, because of its prose and sensibilities."&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; and that "Kingsolver is no pious soapboxer, but instead explores these ideas with enthusiasm and the awe of discovery."&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;

'''Celebration''' is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) and a [[master-planned community]] in [[Osceola County, Florida]], United States, located near [[Walt Disney World Resort]] and originally developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. As part of the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]–[[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]] [[Greater Orlando|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], Celebration's population was 7,427 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Celebration CDP, Florida |website=U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder 2 |accessdate=August 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=September 11, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to founding Celebration, Disney followed its plans&lt;ref name="nyt01"&gt;{{cite news| title = Disney Is Selling a Town It Built to Reflect the Past| newspaper = The New York Times| author = Goodnough, Abby| date = January 16, 2004| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E5D91E30F935A25752C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=celebration%20florida%20disney&amp;st=cse| accessdate = January 16, 2004}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to divest most of its control of the town. Several Disney business units continue to occupy the town's office buildings, and two utility companies, Smart City Telecom and [[Reedy Creek Energy Services]], both operated from Walt Disney World, provide services to the town.  The town itself remains directly connected to the Walt Disney World resorts via one of its primary streets, World Drive, which begins near the [[Magic Kingdom]].

Downtown Celebration's post office was designed by [[Michael Graves]], the adjacent Welcome Center by [[Philip Johnson]], and the Celebration Health building by [[Robert A. M. Stern]].&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news  | title = At Celebration, Some Reasons to Celebrate  | newspaper = The New York Times|author= Riddle, Lyn|date=March 7, 1999| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/07/realestate/at-celebration-some-reasons-to-celebrate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other nearby buildings are designed by well-known architects including: [[Charles Willard Moore|Charles Moore]] (Preview Center), [[Graham Gund]] (Bohemian Hotel), [[Cesar Pelli]] (movie theatre), [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]] (SunTrust Bank).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebration.fl.us/walking-tour-2/|title=Architectural walking tour description|website=Celebration.fl.us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730040007/http://www.celebration.fl.us/walking-tour-2/|archivedate=July 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 1990s, the [[Disney Development Company]] (DDC) established the Celebration Company to spearhead its development within approximately {{convert|4900|acre|km2}} of land in the southern portion of the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Brandy (April 1997). "[http://www.impactpress.com/articles/aprmay97/celebrat.htm New Urbanism: Cause for Celebration?]", Impact Press. Retrieved on October 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Total investment for the project is estimated at US$2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frantz|first=Douglas|author2=Catherine Collins|title=Celebration, U.S.A.: Living in Disney's Brave New Town|date=September 9, 1999|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=0-8050-5560-6|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The master plan was developed by [[Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners]] and [[Robert A. M. Stern]], and the extensive landscape, parks, trails and pathways were designed by the San Francisco firm EDAW (now [[AECOM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edaw.com/ |title=Design, Planning and Environments Worldwide |publisher=EDAW |date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925090624/http://www.edaw.com/ |archivedate=September 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celebration is planned in an early 20th-century architectural style and is not zoned for high-density residences. Celebration was named the "New Community of the Year" in 2001 by the Urban Land Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnati.uli.org/AwardsAndCompetitions/AwardsForExcellenceProgram/2001/Celebration.aspx |title=The Urban Land Institute |publisher=Cincinnati.uli.org |accessdate=October 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819051127/http://www.cincinnati.uli.org/AwardsAndCompetitions/AwardsForExcellenceProgram/2001/Celebration.aspx |archivedate=August 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of residential development occurred in the summer of 1996 with Celebration Village, West Village, and Lake Evalyn; this was followed by the North Village, South Village, East Village and Aquila Reserve and the final Artisan Park phases.&lt;ref name="generalinfo"&gt;[http://www.celebration.fl.us/celpress/celebrationpress.pdf Celebration, Florida – General Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104095739/http://www.celebration.fl.us/celpress/celebrationpress.pdf |date=January 4, 2007 }} (December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] took an especially keen interest in the development of the new town in the early days, encouraging the executives at Disney Development Company to "make history" and develop a town worthy of the Disney brand and legacy that extended to Walt Disney's vision of an [[Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]] (EPCOT). DDC executives collaborated extensively with leaders in education, health, and technology in addition to planners and architects to create the vision and operating policies for the town.

[[Image:OSB - Celebration 33.jpg|thumb|225px|Low-density housing located in a primarily residential village.]]{{Advert|section|date=December 2016}}
Celebration is separated into areas referred to as "villages." The main village, closest to downtown, is where the first homes were constructed. North Village, closest to U.S. 192, houses the Georgetown Condos as well as Acadia Estate Homes. East Village includes [[Roseville Corner]] and Aquila Loop. Lake Evalyn, generally considered its own area of Celebration but not quite its own village, includes a small lake where one can find a multitude of ducks, alligators, and the occasional river otter. South Village houses the Spring Park Loop estate homes and Heritage Hall. Additionally, Siena Condos complete the outer edge of South Village by Celebration Blvd. Mirasol includes condos with concierge service and a day spa. [[Artisan Park]] is at the end of Celebration Ave and houses condos, townhomes, single-family residences as well as a clubhouse consisting of a pool, gym, and restaurant.

===Events===
[[File:Celebration, Florida.jpg|thumb|A gathering in Celebration on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]]]
Celebration hosts many events every year, including community-wide yard sales, an art show, an exotic car festival, an annual Radio Disney Holiday concert, an Oktoberfest Celebration, the "Great American Pie Festival" (televised on [[The Food Network]]),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.piecouncil.org/Events/GreatAmericanPieFestival/ Great American Pie Festival] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111014514/http://www.piecouncil.org/Events/GreatAmericanPieFestival/ |date=November 11, 2013 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; a "Posh Pooch" festival, and downtown events for the Fall and Christmas seasons when autumn leaves and "snow" (small-scale soap flakes) are released into the Town Center.

==Civil suit==
In 2016, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Celebration Town Center condominium owners "are battling leaky roofs, balconies that have become separated from the sides of buildings and mold spreading in their walls. Their properties have become so dilapidated, they say, they're having trouble selling them."

An April 2016 civil suit seeks to force the Town Center Foundation, "which took control of part of Celebration in 2004, to pay for upward of $15 million to $20 million in repairs" which were deferred over ten years.&lt;ref name="mold"&gt;{{cite web |title=Leaks and Mold Are Ruining the Disney Magic in Celebration, Florida |work=The Wall Street Journal |author=Laura Kusisto |date=November 15, 2016 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/leaks-and-mold-are-ruining-the-disney-magic-in-celebration-florida-1479249246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
91% of residents who work outside their homes drive to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite triumph|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main roads going through the center of the Celebration's downtown area are Market Street and Front Street. Other streets in Celebration include:

;Celebration Avenue: This is considered the main road in the town. The road stretches from [[U.S. Route 192|U.S. 192]] to Artisan Park where it ends in a [[traffic circle]]. Starting from U.S. 192 near the Disney Parks and the Celebration water tower, you can find a small shopping plaza. From there, Celebration Avenue passes the North Village, splits the Celebration golf course, winds through a few down-town shops and schools, and then proceeds into the parks and homes in the newer sections of Celebration.
;Celebration Boulevard: Celebration Boulevard has two sections. The most public section is an avenue parallel to [[Interstate 4|I-4]] that includes many commercial businesses and [[Celebration High School]]. The architecture on the street is mostly Celebration Modern style. This style reflects art [[Streamline Moderne]] and  [[Art Deco]] influences with its sleek lines, sparse but effective ornamentation, and ample opportunities for individually expressive special features. The entire street is lined with two rows of [[Arecaceae|Washington Palms]]. The buildings on the street include sitting areas under the shade of trees and trellises along their frontage. The other section of Celebration Boulevard lies on the other side of the golf course, closer to the Celebration Water Tower in the North Village. Here, Celebration Boulevard is almost completely residential. In addition to the homes perched behind white picket fences, this section of Celebration Boulevard flows past the Georgetown condominiums, the community pool, and soccer fields.
;Celebration Place: Celebration Place nearly spans the gap between the two sections of Celebration Boulevard, except that its eastern end terminates at the Water Tower Plaza instead of at the entrance to North Village on the other side of [[Florida State Road 417|State Road 417]]. Celebration Place is a commercial road.

The '''Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|316}}; {{USPL|113|122}}) is a U.S. public law that was introduced into the [[113th United States Congress]], which passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on February 12, 2013. The bill allows the town of [[Canton, Connecticut]] to take over two lapsed licenses from the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) in order to refurbish two old local dams. The dams would be used to produce [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]].

==Background==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt7/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt7.pdf House Report 113-7], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=housereport113-7&gt;{{cite web |title=House Report 113-7 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt7/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt7.pdf |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Upper and Lower Collinsville [[Dam]]s on the [[Farmington River]] were built to provide [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] to an [[Axe|ax]] factory, which was shut down in 1966. The dams have not produced power since that time, but continue to block upstream fish passage.

On February 23, 2001, FERC issued original licenses to Summit Hydropower to redevelop hydroelectric power capacity at these dams. The Upper Collinsville Dam project was to have a generation capacity of 373 [[Watt|kilowatts]], while the Lower Dam was to have a capacity of 920 kilowatts. As part of this licensing process, an environmental assessment was completed. The licenses required Summit to commence project construction within two years from the issuance of the licenses.

Section 13 of the [[Federal Power Act]] requires licensees to commence construction of hydroelectric projects within the time fixed in the license, which shall be no more than two years from the issuance of the license, and authorizes the Commission to issue one extension of the deadline, for no more than two years.

On November 26, 2002, FERC granted Summit a two-year extension to commence project construction at both sites, moving the deadline to February 23, 2005. Because construction did not commence by that date, the Commission sent Summit a notice of probable termination of the licenses on November 2, 2007. Summit did not respond to the notice. FERC terminated the licenses on December 4, 2007. Summit did not seek rehearing of the termination order.

The town of [[Canton, Connecticut]] intends to proceed with the two hydroelectric projects that Summit originally had proposed. On January 9, 2009, FERC granted the town a preliminary permit to undertake the necessary feasibility studies. The town has stated that it intends to pursue [[Low Impact Hydropower Institute]] certification for the projects and to provide for [[Fish ladder|fish passage]].

Identical legislation passed the House of Representatives in both the [[111th United States Congress|111th]] and [[112th United States Congress|112th Congresses]] as H.R. 4451 and H.R. 5625, respectively. H.R. 4451 was agreed to in the House by [[voice vote]], under [[Suspension of the rules in the United States Congress|suspension of the rules]], on June 16, 2010. H.R. 5625 passed the House by voice vote, under suspension of the rules, on June 26, 2012.

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=316sum&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R 316 – 113th Congress |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/316 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act would authorize the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) to:&lt;ref name="316sum" /&gt;
:(1) reinstate the license for either or each of the projects numbered 10822 and 10823, and
:(2) extend for two years after the date on which either or each such project is reinstated the time period during which the licensee must commence project construction.

The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act also directs the FERC to:&lt;ref name="316sum" /&gt;
:(1) transfer the reinstated licenses to the town of [[Canton, Connecticut]], if it reinstates them and extends the time period during which the licensee is required to commence project construction; and
:(2) complete an environmental assessment for the projects and update the environmental analysis performed during the licensing process.

Finally, the Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act sets a deadline for the FERC to:&lt;ref name="316sum" /&gt;
:(1) reach a final decision concerning the projects, and
:(2) complete the license transfer if it decides to reinstate either or both licenses.

The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act provides a variety of exemptions from provisions of the [[Federal Power Act]] to the two projects listed in the bill.&lt;ref name=316text&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 316 – Text |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/316/text |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural history==
The bill was introduced to the House by [[Elizabeth Esty|Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-CT)]] on January 18, 2013.&lt;ref name="316sum" /&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]. The bill had no co-sponsors and was not amended while in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="316sum" /&gt; On February 12, 2013, the bill was passed under a motion to [[Suspension of the rules in the United States Congress|suspend the rules]] with a [[voice vote]]. This procedure typically indicates that a bill is broadly non-controversial. The bill was freshman Representative Esty's first bill in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elizabeth Esty's first bill, reintroduced Collinsville dams legislation, passes House |url=http://www.foothillsmediagroup.com/articles/2013/02/18/canton/news/doc51228c29d578e656011125.txt |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Avon News |date=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was received by the [[United States Senate]] on February 13, 2013 and then referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]]. The Senate passed the bill by [[unanimous consent]] on May 22, 2014 after making an amendment in the nature of a substitute.&lt;ref name=316allactions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 316 – All Actions |url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/316/all-actions |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House voted on June 23, 2014 to agree to the Senate's amendment of the bill. The vote was 379-3 in [https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/316/actions Roll Call Vote 340].&lt;ref name="316allactions" /&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law on June 30, 2014.

==Public perception==
The bill received very little attention from the national press. It was briefly covered in local media of Canton, Connecticut and the surrounding areas. One op-ed writer was strongly opposed to the bill, claiming that it was locally known as the "Collinsville White Elephant Act."&lt;ref name=opedMar4&gt;{{cite news |last=Budnick |first=Chris |title=Avon Letters to the Editor |url=http://www.foothillsmediagroup.com/articles/2013/03/04/opinion/doc513502478cd78681754770.txt?viewmode=fullstory |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Avon News |date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The op-ed writer argued that rather than being a win-win situation, the new power plants would only serve to increase the electricity bills of local residents and provide additional revenue for the local government (potentially for them to misspend).&lt;ref name="opedMar4" /&gt; He based this assessment on existing state electricity laws and problems associated with [[net metering]].

The '''Cologne Central Mosque''' ({{lang-de|DITIB-Zentralmoschee Köln}}, {{lang-tr|Merkez-Camii}}) is a building  commissioned by [[Islam in Germany|German Muslims]] of the Organization [[DITIB]] for a large, representative ''Zentralmoschee'' (central mosque)&lt;ref name=architect&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boehmarchitektur.de/deutsch/hochbau/hochbau_zentralmoschee.html |title=ZENTRALMOSCHEE KÖLN |accessdate=2007-09-16 |work= |last=Böhm |first=Plul |language=german}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.boehmarchitektur.de/deutsch/hochbau/hochbau_zentralmoschee.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.boehmarchitektur.de/deutsch/hochbau/hochbau_zentralmoschee.html%26hl%3Den English translation])&lt;/ref&gt; in Cologne, Germany.

The mosque is designed in [[Ottoman Empire|non-Ottoman]] architectural style, with glass walls, two minarets and a dome. The mosque is proposed to have a bazaar as well as other secular areas intended for interfaith interactions.

== Opening ==
The inauguration of the mosque was controversial as the [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs]] neglected to invite mayor of Cologne [[Henriette Reker]] to the event. The failure to invite officials of Cologne municipality was interpreted as the mosque representing a growing Turkish parallel society in Germany and lacking respect for German institutions. President of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] attended and held a speech at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.5812065|title=Kölner Oberbürgermeisterin: Reker beklagt mangelnden Respekt von Ditib|last=Burger|first=Reiner|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-10-12|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article181682982/Erdogan-in-Koeln-Reker-wirft-Ditib-mangelnden-Respekt-vor.html|title=Erdogan in Köln: Reker wirft Ditib mangelnden Respekt vor|last=Frigelj|first=Kristian|date=2018-09-27|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The project has been opposed by author [[Ralph Giordano (writer)|Ralph Giordano]],&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; right-wingers, Jörg Uckermann, then local district's deputy mayor, has criticized the project saying that "We don't want to build a Turkish ghetto in Ehrenfeld.

On June 16, 2007, 200 people gathered in a protest organized by Pro Cologne against the mosque including representatives from the [[Austrian Freedom Party]] and the Belgian [[Vlaams Belang]].&lt;ref name = "OLN" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/05/world/europe/05cologne.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all Germans Split Over a Mosque and the Role of Islam].

[[Chicago Tribune]]. August 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent author [[Ralph Giordano (writer)|Ralph Giordano]] stated that he opposed the project as the mosque would be “an expression of the creeping [[Islamization]] of our land”, a “declaration of war”,&lt;ref name = TwoMosques/&gt; and that he wouldn't want to see women wearing headscarfs on German streets, likening their appearance to “human penguins”. [[Henryk M. Broder]], a journalist, disagrees with Giordano's metaphor but said that “A mosque is more than a church or a synagogue. It is a political statement.”&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt; Giordano's remarks have turned the local dispute into a national debate about the place of [[Islam in Germany]].&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt; and other prominent Germans criticized the project as well. District mayor Uckermann stated that Giordano's comments “broke down the wall. Before if you criticised this monstrous mosque you were a [[Nazi]]. But we have a problem with the integration of Muslims. It's a question of language and culture.”&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; Uckermann left the conservative CDU for right-wing Pro Cologne in 2008 after being voted out of office as the district's deputy mayor and reportedly facing party exclusion.&lt;ref name="KStA_2008_05_20"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1209912089325.shtml|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120803104624/http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1209912089325.shtml|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 3 August 2012|title = Jörg Uckermann: Eine zweifelhafte Karriere|first = Detlef|last = Schmalenberg|date = 20 May 2008|work = www.ksta.de|publisher = [[Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger]]|language = German|trans-title = Jörg Uckermann: a dubious career|accessdate = 29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ditib-Zentralmoschee Köln - April 2011 (3561-63).jpg|thumb|The state of construction of the Cologne Mosque in April 2011|277x277px]]The city's official for integration Marlis Bredehorst stated that "it is important that the Muslims here get dignified houses of prayer" and added that "two hundred years ago, the Protestants had to pray secretively in Catholic Cologne [...] that is something we can't imagine anymore today."&lt;ref name="OLN"/&gt; The city's mayor, [[Fritz Schramma]], who supports the project said that “For me, it is self-evident that the Muslims need to have a prestigious place of worship, but it bothers me when people have lived here for 35 years and they don’t speak a single word of German.”&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt; Christian leaders have taken similarly ambivalent stances: the Catholic Church has long supported the project, though recently Cardinal [[Joachim Meisner]], Archbishop of Cologne, has been more cautious: when asked if he was afraid of the mosque, he said, “I don't want to say I'm afraid, but I have an uneasy feeling.”&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;''[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/03/news/cologne.php Effort to build a large mosque rattles some in Cologne]''.

Public opinion seems “guardedly supportive, with a majority of residents saying they favor it”.&lt;ref name = "IHT" /&gt; A poll taken by a local newspaper among 500 Cologne residents showed that the project is supported by 63%, of whom 27% want its size to be reduced.&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Omniquest: [http://www.ksta.de/ks/images/mdsLink/umfrage_moschee.pdf Neubau einer Zentralmoschee in Ehrenfeld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928104945/http://www.ksta.de/ks/images/mdsLink/umfrage_moschee.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} ([[PDF]]), published ''Kölner Stadtanzeiger'', Juni 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2008, the [[Cologne City Hall|Cologne City Council]] voted to approve the construction of the mosque. this position was taken by all parties except the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian democrats]] (CDU). Outside the hall, a group of 30 protesters demonstrated against the approval, while 100 demonstrated in favor of it.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

The Cologne mosque project has been contrasted with a less controversial project in [[Duisburg]], Germany: in Duisburg, there was co-operation and good communication from an early stage between German politicians, church and community leaders and the developers of the mosque.&lt;ref name = TwoMosques/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Constructing conflict |url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9725332 |work= |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Communist Party of the Basque Homelands''' ({{lang-eu|Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista}}, '''EHAK'''; {{lang-es|Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas}}, '''PCTV''') was a [[communist]] [[Basque separatist]] party in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Spain]]. The party was outlawed by the [[Spanish Supreme Court]] after it was judicially proven to be part of [[Batasuna]] and, ultimately, [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].

==History==

EHAK was legally registered for the first time in 2002 but had no known activity until 2005, remaining inactive during these years. In this year, within weeks of the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2005|regional Basque election]] EHAK suddenly rose to national prominence when it publicly announced that it would assume the program of the banned [[abertzale]] lists of [[Aukera Guztiak]] and [[Batasuna]]. EHAK was then widely considered to be a proxy to circumvent the recent ruling which had outlawed Batasuna. Like Batasuna, their representatives refused to explicitly condemn the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] attacks, being the only important political party not to do so in the Basque Country and Spain. Batasuna representatives asked their supporters to vote for EHAK, which obtained 150,188 votes (12.5%), entering the [[Basque Parliament]] with nine seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2005/eleccionesvascas/ |title=Elecciones vascas 2005 |publisher=El Pais |date=2009-01-02 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] requested that the Spanish government conducted investigations to ban EHAK too, though the initially State Legal Service (''Abogacía General del Estado'') and the Attorney General's Office (''Fiscalía General del Estado'') found no evidence to support legal actions against the party.

On 18 September 2008 the party was outlawed by the [[Spanish Supreme Court]]. According to the legal inquiry, EHAK was "instrumental in continuing the illegal action designed by ETA/Ekin/Batasuna", rapidly losing its autonomy to replace Batasuna's role in the institutional front of ETA's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Procesados/cargos/PCTV/pertenecer/ETA/elpepunac/20090718elpepinac_12/Tes |title=El Pais 18 July 2007 |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batasuna got, via EHAK, 837,000 [[euro]]s corresponding to the public funding given to political parties with parliamentary representation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Procesados/cargos/PCTV/pertenecer/ETA/elpepunac/20090718elpepinac_12/Tes |title=Procesados cinco cargos del PCTV por pertenecer a ETA · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no less than 34 Batasuna members (including some of their top officers) were hired by EHAK and paid with this public funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=D.

On 4 August 2009 the judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] announced his intention to put a number of PCTV members on trial for ETA membership. Among them were two former Basque parliament deputies Karmele Berasategi and Nekane Erauskin; the party president Juan Carlos Ramos and the two party treasurers Jesús María Aguirre and Sonia Jacinto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Procesadas/ex/diputadas/PCTV/ser/ETA/elpepunac/20090804elpepinac_12/Tes |title=El Pais 4 August 2009 |language=Spanish |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Damning with faint praise''' is an [[English idiom]], expressing [[oxymoron]]ically that half-hearted or insincere praise may act as oblique criticism or condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;Ichikawa, Sanki. (1964). ''The Kenkyusha Dictionary of Current English Idioms,'' pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ammer153"&gt;Ammer, Christine. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=  ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms,'' p. 153.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
The concept can be found in the work of the Hellenistic [[sophist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Favorinus]] (c. 110 AD) who observed that faint and half-hearted praise was more harmful than loud and persistent abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, William Shepard. (1908). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xAQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA586&amp;dq=  ''The International Encyclopedia of Prose and Poetical Quotations from the Literature of the World,'' p. 586], citing [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae.'' xi, 3, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit phrasing of the modern English idiomic expression was first published by [[Alexander Pope]] in his 1734 poem, "[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]" in ''Prologue to the Satires.''&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, William Shepard. (1909). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrJkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=  ''Handy-book of Literary Curiosities,'' p. 211.]&lt;/ref&gt;
::Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,
::And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;
::Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,
::Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike.
::::— "Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot" by Alexander Pope (1688–1744)&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Alexander. (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=xXciKdpaH0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=  ''The Rape of the Lock: An Essay on Man and Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,'' p. 97;] n.b., ''see'' line 201 in "Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Shepard Walsh, "There is a faint anticipation in [[William Wycherley]]'s 'Double Dealer,' 'and libels everybody with dull praise,' But a closer parallel is in [[Phineas Fletcher]],&amp;nbsp;—"
::When needs he must, yet faintly then he praises,
::Somewhat the deed, much more the means he raises:
::So marreth what he makes, and praising most, dispraises.
::::— "The Purple Island" by Phineas Fletcher&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, William Shepard, ''Handy-book of Literary Curiosities,''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hrJkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=  pp. 211–212; n.b., ''see'' Canto vii in "The Purple Island."]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">'''Democratic Left Scotland''' is the continuation in Scotland of [[Democratic Left (United Kingdom)|Democratic Left]], the organisation formed when the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was dissolved in 1991. DLS was founded in May 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laybourn|first=Keith|title=Marxism in Britain: dissent, decline and re-emergence 1945-c.2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2006|series=Volume 3 of Routledge studies in modern British history|isbn=0-415-32287-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4_q46RCeJQC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While DLS's sister organisation in England and Wales later renamed itself the [[New Politics Network]] and has since merged into the think tank [[Unlock Democracy]], DLS is still active as part of the left. It publishes an occasional magazine, ''Perspectives''.

The organisation's slogan is ''"There's more to politics than parties"'', but some of its members do participate in other parties, such as the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] and [[Scottish Green Party]], including [[Mark Ballard]], former Green Party [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] for [[Lothians]]. Two City of Edinburgh councillors are members of DLS.

'''Emphyteusis''' is a right, susceptible of assignment and of descent, charged on productive [[real estate]], the right being coupled with the enjoyment of the property on condition of taking care of the estate and paying [[tax]]es and sometimes a small [[renting|rent]].

It started in the early [[Roman Empire]] and was initially granted by the state for the purposes of [[agriculture]] or building on land. In essence it was a long-term lease of an imperial domain of private land for a rental in kind. The title existing before emphyteusis was ''ius in agro vectigali''. The emphyteusis gave the lease-holder (emphyteuta) rights similar to those of a proprietor, although the real owner remained the person to whom the rent (''canon'' or ''pensio'') was paid. Nevertheless,  the tenant gained most of the rights of the owner. Accordingly, he could maintain ''actio vectigalis in rem'' against any one to recover possession of the land thus leased to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutes of Roman Law by Gaius|last=Poste|first=Edward|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1904|isbn=|location=|pages=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under certain circumstances, the land returned to the owner (as in the case of the death of the emphyteuta without an heir, non-payment of the rent or taxes for three years (or 2 years in case of land held of the [[Church and state in medieval Europe|Church]]), lapse of time if a term was fixed in the original agreement, ''contractus emphyteuseos'', which was a specific contract and neither an ordinary lease nor a sale. The rights of the emphyteuta embraced the full use of the land and its products; they were alienable and transferable by testament or ''ab intestato''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law|last=Berger|first=Adolf|publisher=French University|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Police''' ('''''Bundespolizei''''' or '''BPOL''') is a (primarily) uniformed [[Federal police|federal police force]] in [[Germany]]. It is subordinate to the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] (''Bundesministerium des Innern (BMI)'').&lt;ref&gt;OSCE Entry on BPOL http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17#Country_Profile_Section_211 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524060329/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17 |date=2009-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary police forces, meanwhile, are under the administration of the individual German states (''[[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]'') and are known as the ''[[Landespolizei]]''.

The ''Bundespolizei'' was formerly known as the ''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (BGS) ("Federal Border Guard"), which had a more restricted role. Prior to 1994 BGS members also had military combatant status due to their historical foundation and border-guard role in West Germany. In July 2005 the law renaming the BGS as the BPOL was enacted.

==Missions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The BPOL has the following missions:

* Border security (''Grenzpolizei'' or [[Grepo]]), to include passport control (only at borders with non-EU member countries prior to September 2015) and the provision of [[German Federal Coast Guard|coast guard]] services along Germany's {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline.
* Protection of [[federal government|federal]] buildings such as Schloss Bellevue, the residence of the German [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]]; they also protect the two highest German courts, both in [[Karlsruhe]]:
** The [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') and
** The [[Federal Court of Justice]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'')
* Providing the federal government's [[Bereitschaftspolizei|mobile response force]] for internal security events.
* Providing transportation security at [[international airport]]s and on German railways.
* Providing counter-[[terrorism]] forces ([[GSG 9]]).
* Providing [[Air Marshal (civil aviation)|air (or sky) marshals]].
* Supporting international police missions for the [[United Nations]] and EU in [[Kosovo]], [[Sudan]], [[Liberia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Gaza Strip]], [[Moldova]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].
* Providing in-house security for some German embassies.
* Providing rescue [[helicopter]] service.

The ''Bundespolizei'' can also be used to reinforce [[landespolizei|state police]] if requested  by a state ''(Land)'' government. The BPOL maintains these reserve forces to deal with major demonstrations, disturbances or emergencies, supplementing the capabilities of the [[Bereitschaftspolizei|State Operational Support Units]].  Several highly trained detachments are available for crisis situations requiring [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s, [[water cannon]] or other special equipment.

BPOL has investigators conduct criminal investigations only within its jurisdiction; otherwise the cases are referred to the appropriate state police force or to the federal criminal investigative agency, the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police]] (''Bundeskriminalamt'', BKA).

In addition, the ''Bundespolizei'' cooperates closely with German state executive authorities, such as prosecutor's offices (''[[Staatsanwaltschaft]]'') in pursuing criminal investigations.

===Restoration of border control tasking on all borders (2015)===

On the night of 13 September 2015 Germany unilaterally reintroduced [[border controls]], under emergency provisions of the [[Schengen Agreement]], due to the [[European migrant crisis|2015 European migrant crisis]] overwhelming Germany's available resources, law enforcement and otherwise. The nominally temporary border controls were initially put in place just on the border with Austria, but by the following day (Monday 14 September 2015) they were being put in place at all borders with fellow EU members. The same day, Austria and other EU members who were part of the [[Schengen Area]] began to put in place their own border controls (again meant to be temporary) in response to Germany's actions.

The new German border controls are to be primarily enforced both by the various ''[[Landespolizei]]'' of those German states that adjoin external borders, and in particular by the ''Bundespolizei''.

==Strength==
The ''Bundespolizei'' consists of around 40,000 personnel:
*30,000 are fully trained police officers.
**21,000 provide border, railway and aviation security.
**6,000 serve in the [[Bereitschaftspolizei|Alert Police]].
**3,000 serve in the following special units:
*** The Central Office for Communications and Information.
*** [[GSG 9]].
*** The Aviation Wing.
*10,000 salaried civilian (unarmed) support personnel, including:
**6,800 [[civil service|civil servants]] who perform administrative and support services.
**2,000 [[Immigration to Germany|Immigration]] inspectors (called the Individual Service) who perform operational duty handling border protection and immigration matters and airline passenger checks.

==Organization==
[[Image:Bundespolizei-Standortkarte.pdf|thumb|''Bundespolizei'' districts of Germany]]
[[Image:Federal Police Patch.svg|thumb|130px|''Bundespolizei'' patch]]

The BPOL national headquarters (BPOL-''Präsidium'') in [[Potsdam]] performs all central control functions. Eight regional headquarters (BPOL-''Direktion'') control the BPOL stations conduct rail police and border protection missions. These areas of responsibility conform to the federal state boundaries which they did not do prior to 1 March 2008.

The regional headquarters are as follows:
* [[Bad Bramstedt]] covering [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].
* [[Hanover]] covering [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Lower Saxony]].
* [[Sankt Augustin]] covering [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].
* [[Koblenz]] covering [[Saarland]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Hesse]].
* [[Stuttgart]] covering [[Baden-Württemberg]].
* [[Munich]] covering [[Bavaria]].
* [[Pirna]] covering [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]].
* [[Berlin]] covering [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]].

These regional headquarters each have an investigation department and a mobile inspection and observation unit. Moreover, they control the 67 BPOL stations (BPOL-''Inspektion'') which in turn control the ''Bundespolizeireviere'' or precincts located in places that require a 24-hour presence by BPOL officers.

A special ''Direktion'' is responsible for [[Frankfurt International Airport]].

The central school for advanced and vocational training is in Lübeck and controls the six basic training schools in [[Swisttal]], [[Neustrelitz]], [[Oerlenbach]], [[Walsrode]], [[Eschwege]] and [[Bamberg]]. It is also in charge of the Federal Police Sport School in [[Bad Endorf]] and a competitive sport project in Kienbaum near Berlin. The sport school specialises in winter sport events and has trained many of Germany's top skiers and skaters such as [[Claudia Pechstein]].

The ''Zentrale Direktion Bundesbereitschaftspolizei'' controls the mobile support and rapid reaction battalions located in [[Bayreuth]], [[Deggendorf]], Blumberg (near Berlin), [[Hünfeld]], [[Uelzen]], [[Duderstadt]], [[Sankt Augustin]], [[Bad Bergzabern]], [[Bad Düben]] and [[Ratzeburg]]. The number of ''[[Bereitschaftspolizei]]'' companies increased in March 2008 from 28 to 29 comprising approx. 25 percent of Germany’s police support units.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundespolizei.de/cln_049/nn_249932/DE/Home/__Startseite/Neuorganisation/070426__konzept__neuorganisation,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/070426_konzept_neuorganisation.pdf Official BPOL news release on reorganisation (in German)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175600/http://www.bundespolizei.de/cln_049/nn_249932/DE/Home/__Startseite/Neuorganisation/070426__konzept__neuorganisation%2CtemplateId%3Draw%2Cproperty%3DpublicationFile.pdf/070426_konzept_neuorganisation.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BPOL Special Units===
The following special units also exist:

* The BPOL Aviation Group is directly subordinate to the BPOL HQ in Potsdam. It controls the five aviation squadrons around the country that operate the force's helicopters. These are located in [[Fuhlendorf, Schleswig-Holstein|Fuhlendorf]] (north, with satellite airfield in [[Gifhorn]]), Blumberg (east), Fuldatal (centre), [[Oberschleißheim]] (south) and Sankt Augustin (west). Its duties include;  border surveillance, monitoring installations belonging to German Rail, helping in serious accidents and disasters in Germany and abroad, searching for missing persons, searching for criminals on the run, supporting the [[Landespolizei|police forces of the federal states]], providing transportation for persons whose security is endangered, providing transportation for guests of the Federal government, supporting federal and state authorities, and providing air search and rescue services in coordination with the 12 air rescue centers throughout Germany.
* The [[GSG 9]] [[counter-terrorism]] group is directly subordinate to the BPOL HQ.
* The BPOL Information and Communications Center is now a department of the BPOL HQ in Potsdam.
* The [[water police]] stations with 16 patrol craft&lt;ref name=vessels&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Ausstattung/Boote/boote_node.html |title=Einsatzschiffe sowie Kontroll- und Streifenboote |trans-title=Cruise and patrol vessels |publisher=Bundespolizei |language=German |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724140040/http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Ausstattung/Boote/boote_node.html |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and helicopters are part of the [[German Federal Coast Guard]] and assigned to coastal BPOL stations. The watercraft include six offshore patrol vessels, e.g. those of the [[Bad Bramstedt class patrol vessel|''Bad Bramstedt'' class]], as well as a number of fast inshore vessels and one [[tugboat]].&lt;ref name=vessels/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Bundesadler.bgs.JPG|thumb|120px|''Bundesgrenzschutz'' patch (1952 to 1976)]]

In 1951 the West German government established a Federal Border Protection Force (''Bundesgrenzschutz'' or BGS) composed of 10,000 men under the Federal Interior Ministry’s jurisdiction.  The force replaced allied military organisations such as the [[U.S. Constabulary]] then patrolling West Germany’s borders.  The BGS was described as a mobile, lightly armed police force for border and internal security despite fears that it would be the nucleus of a new German army.  When West Germany did establish an army, the [[Bundeswehr]], BGS personnel were given the choice of staying in the BGS or joining the army.  Most decided to join the army.

In 1953, the BGS took control of the German Passport Control Service. In 1972 the  [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] was enacted by the parliament, which - in theory - is still in force, but suspended, similar to the conscription for the [[Bundeswehr]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/brd/1994/D840+94.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.at/books?id=RcPPBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Grenzschutzdienstpflicht&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dI2L9pnpEV&amp;sig=evQ1ihN3bdIYICFjdNFr8fdlWgY&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBirvW4ZTdAhXqkIsKHbh3DHA4ChDoATAAegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Grenzschutzdienstpflicht&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the state police grades replaced the military rank structure and BGS training was modified to closely match that of the state police forces (''[[Landespolizei]]''). The West German Railway Police (''[[Bahnpolizei]]''), formerly an independent force, and the East German ''[[Transportpolizei]]'' were restructured under the BGS in 1990.

In July 2005, the BGS was renamed the ''Bundespolizei'' or BPOL (Federal Police) to reflect its transition to a multi-faceted federal police agency.  The change also involved a shift to blue uniforms and livery for vehicles and helicopters. The German Interior Ministry reviewed the structure of the BPOL in 2007 and in March 2008 made the structure leaner to get more officers out of offices and onto patrol.

==Vehicles==
[[Image:BPOL-BMW-blau-silber.JPG|thumb|right|BMW standard patrol car]]
[[Image:BG34-71.JPG|right|thumb|A ''Bundespolizei'' van]]

''Bundespolizei'' vehicles have number plates that are based on the BP XX-YYY system. BP stands for ''Bundespolizei.'' Older vehicles may still have the BGS "BG" plates.

XX is a number from 10 to 55 indicating the type of vehicle:

*10 to 12: Motorcycle
*15 to 19: Car
*20 to 24: Four wheel drive car
*25 to 29: Car
*30 to 39: Medium four wheel drive vehicle
*40 to 49: Trucks and buses
*50 to 54: Armoured cars.
*55: Trailers

YYY is a combination of up to three numbers.

The ''Bundespolizei'' have favoured, and in some cases still favor (where the model is still in production), the following types of car:

* [[BMW]] [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series sedans and station wagons]]
* [[Volkswagen Passat]] sedans and Variant station wagons
* [[Volkswagen Golf]]
* [[Volkswagen Transporter]] vans

[[Image:2006-08 Frankfurt (Oder) 11.jpg|thumb|right|BMW R 1150 RT motorcycle]]

==Weaponry== 
This is some of the weaponry utilized by the Federal Police: 
* [[H&amp;K G36]]
* [[H&amp;K MP5]]
* [[H&amp;K P30]]

==Aircraft inventory==
The Federal Police now has been reduced to three flight amenities pattern of 87 helicopters. This is the largest civilian helicopter fleet in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Historie/historie_node.html |title=Historie der Bundespolizei |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928045244/http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Historie/historie_node.html |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==K-9 support==
Approximately 500 working dogs are used in the Federal Police at present. Most of the dogs are [[German shepherd]]s. Other dog breeds are also used such as [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)|malinois]], [[Dutch shepherd]], [[German wirehaired pointer]], [[giant schnauzer]], and [[rottweiler]]. They accompany their handlers on daily missions in railway facilities, at airports, at the border or in physical security. Most working dogs live with the families of their handlers. Basic and advanced training is performed under the supervision of the Federal Police Academy at the Federal Police canine schools in [[Bleckede]] (Lower Saxony) and [[Neuendettelsau]] (Bavaria) where dogs and handlers go through patrol dog and explosive detection courses.

'''Hacienda Luisita''' is a 6,453-hectare sugar plantation located in the province of [[Tarlac|Tarlac, Philippines]]. The [[hacienda]] spans 11 [[villages]] in three towns of Tarlac [[province]]. Most of the original farmworkers reside in 10 villages – Barangays Balete, Cutcut (or Sta. Catalina), Lourdes (formerly Texas), Mapalacsiao (formerly Luisita), Asturias, and Bantog in [[Tarlac City]]; Barangay Motrico in La Paz town; and [[Barangay|Barangays]] Parang (formerly San Sebastian), Mabilog (formerly Pasajes) and Pando in Concepcion town. The original estate includes the Central Azucarera de Tarlac (CAT) sugar mill and a golf course. The eleventh village is Barangay Central in [[Tarlac City]] which houses the CAT sugar mill, the St. Martin de Porres Hospital and the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] Church. It features Luisita Golf and Country Club, a [[golf course]] and Las Haciendas de Luisita Subdivision, a 5-interconnected luxury subdivision.&lt;ref name="UMA2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA) |title=For Land and Justice: The Continuing Agrarian Struggle in Hacienda Luisita.

Originally owned by the [[Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas]], it is now owned by the [[Cojuangco]] family who acquired the hacienda in the late 1950s. The estate's incorporators, who control 70 percent of Hacienda Luisita's stock shares, are Pedro Cojuangco, Josephine C. Reyes's heirs, Teresita C. Lopa's heirs, José Cojuangco, Jr., and María Paz C. Teopaco, all siblings of the late former President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazón C. Aquino]] who, on the day she became President of the Philippines, bequeathed her shares to her children and the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]] and other non-profit organizations. The remaining 30 percent of the stock shares was given to farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program's stock distribution option scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cervantes |first=Ding |title=DAR set to raffle off Hacienda Luisita land |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/01/05/1539399/dar-set-raffle-hacienda-luisita-land |website=Philstar Global |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=4 January 2016 |access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
   
=== Spanish era (1521-1898) === 
[[File:Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas Historical Marker.jpg|thumb|Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas Historical Marker]]
Hacienda Luisita was once part of the holdings of Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas, Sociedad Anónima, better known as Tabacalera. The land was owned by [[Spain]], by virtue of the country's [[Colony|colonial]] relationship to the Philippines. The [[tobacco]] company was founded on 26 November 1881 by the Spaniard Antonio López y López from Comillas, Cantabria and Santiago de Cuba, and Don Guillermo Rubio born in Santander, Cantabria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History |url=https://tabacalera.com.ph/pages/our-history |website=Tabacalera |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1780, the popularity of [[cigars]] in the Philippines prompted Spanish authorities to impose a tobacco [[monopoly]], such that the only ones able to plant, manufacture, and sell cigars were the colonial government. Tabacalera was a private enterprise Lopez y Lopez founded with the sole intention of taking over the Philippine Tobacco Monopoly from the Spanish colonial government; the monopoly was abolished a year after Lopez y Lopez acquired the estate. This included the Hacienda Antonio (named after his eldest son), Hacienda San Fernando and Hacienda Isabel (named after his eldest daughter) in Cagayán and Isabela provinces where the La Flor de Isabela cigar was cultivated.&lt;ref name="sison2011"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sison |first1=Norman |title=Tabacalera: 130 years of cigars and Philippine history |url=https://www.philstar.com/business/business-as-usual/2011/12/05/754678/tabacalera-130-years-cigars-and-philippine-history |website=Philstar Global |publisher=The Philippine Star |date=5 December 2011 |access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high profits of sugar and tobacco in the Philippines, Antonio López y López and his son, Claudio López Bru, the second to hold the title, donated some of the profits to the Jesuits to create the Pontifical University of Comillas, a university outside Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY |url=http://www.comillas.edu/en/comillas-university-icai-icade/collaborate-with-us/80-comillas/history-and-facts |website=comillas.edu |publisher=Comillas Pontifical University |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American period (1898-1946) ===
During the American period, the hacienda supplied almost 20% of America's sugar from 1898 to the 1940s (from the Spanish–American War until World War II) back when the Tabacalera still owned it.&lt;ref name="mcmurray1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=McMurray |first=Marisse Reyes |title=Tide of Time |publisher=Jose Cojuangco and Sons, Inc. |date=1996 |location=[[Makati City, Philippines]] |pages=263-309 |isbn=9719161000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the Luisita sugar became popular locally as well. The Spanish-owned hacienda flourished mainly because of America's obsession with sugar. In the 20's, Tabacalera then left the tobacco business to focus on the growing sugar industry to cater to US’ needs since this product was more profitable at the time.&lt;ref name="sison2011" /&gt; They invested heavily on the business by constructing a sugar refinery known as "Central Azcurarera de Tarlac" (CAT) which used America's [[Centrifuge|centrifugal]] machinery technology in order to double the production and lessen the cost of shipping sugar to a refinery in [[Laguna, Philippines|Laguna]] owned by the Roxas Family.&lt;ref name="mcmurray1996" /&gt; 

The [[refinery]] became the largest sugar central in the Philippines thus increasing Tabacalera's profits. With a new production line, the refinery required a new system for more efficiency. Workers were laid off or forced to retire since old farm workers were not familiar with the new technology. This then resulted to continuous protests for a year. The Hacienda produced 126,129 tons of sugar in 1928 as well as allegedly receiving additional tons of sugar with current prices of Php 23,450. The workers then found out that the hacienda was receiving multiple fines that were deducted from the workers’ wages, which sparked outrage.&lt;ref name="mcmurray1996" /&gt;

=== Japanese regime (1941-1945) ===
During the Japanese period, the Hacienda still continued all operations in sugar production. A Japanese policy was put in place to ensure that supplies in commodities such as rice &amp; sugar were not interrupted and were made available to Filipinos in order to avoid insurgencies or rebellions. The continuation of the production both served the Japanese and the Spanish's interests at that time.&lt;ref name="UMA2013" /&gt;

In 1942, [[Luis Taruc]] and 200 members formed [[HUKBALAHAP]], a peasant based [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla army]] to fight the Japanese forces. Many of these members were farmers of Hacienda Luisita because of their discontent with Tabacalera, advocating for the distribution of land. On 25 January 1945, General Douglas Macarthur set up his headquarters at Hacienda Luisista to fight Japanese forces in the Philippines.

In 1947, a farmer's wife was reported to be [[Rape|raped]] by one of the remaining Spanish directors of the hacienda. In support of her, other wives lay themselves on the railroad tracks to stop the trains carrying sugar from being delivered. The Spanish director immediately left for Spain which pushed the Huks to execute Spanish "encargados" or managers in front of the guest house when they refused to admit to the crime.&lt;ref name="mcmurray1996" /&gt;

=== José Cojuangco period (1957-1976) ===
[[File:02045jfCentral San Miguel Tarlac City Hacienda Luisita Park Hotel Roadsfvf 06.JPG|thumb|The Tarlac Training Center, along Hacienda Luisita Road (San Miguel, Capehan, Balite, Lourdes, Central and Mapalacsiao, Tarlac City).]]
In 1957, the owners of the Tabacalera decided to sell Hacienda Luisita as well as the sugar mill, Central Azcurarera de Tarlac (CAT), because of the [[HUKBALAHAP]] rebels who were causing them problems.&lt;ref name="UMA2013" /&gt; The CAT was supposed to be sold to the Lopez family of Iloilo but then the purchase was vetoed by [[Ramon Magsaysay|President Ramon Magsaysay]] due to the clan owning multiple businesses such as Meralco, ABS-CBN, the Manila Chronicle, Negros Navigation, as well as a number of substantial agricultural holdings, which the president deemed to problematic because the Lopez's were becoming too powerful.&lt;ref name="UMA2013" /&gt; 
President Magsaysay then offered the Central Azcurarera de Tarlac to Jose Cojuangco Sr. through [[Ninoy Aquino|Ninoy Aquino Jr]] (Jose's son-in-law) in early 1957. Ninoy Aquino was Magsaysay's political prodigy and personal assistant at that time, which helped the Cojuangcos in purchasing the CAT.&lt;ref name="mcmurray1996" /&gt; As agreed upon, the hacienda would be paid for in pesos, while the CAT would be paid for in US dollars. The Philippine government aided the Cojuangcos in obtaining the loans needed to pay the price.&lt;ref name="SC5July2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=G.R. No. 171101.  July 5, 2011. |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2011/july2011/171101.htm |website=sc.judiciary.gov.ph |publisher=Supreme Court of the Philippines |date=5 July 2011 |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1957, the clan took control of the CAT and the hacienda through Manufacturer's Trust Co New York. endorsed by the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as well as Government System Insurance Service (GSIS).&lt;ref name="UMA2013" /&gt; The BSP then approved the loan on August 1957 under two conditions, one of which states that the CAT be bought together with Hacienda Luisita and that the hacienda shall be distributed to farmers under the Magsaysay's social justice program.&lt;ref name="SC5July2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hacienda Luisita Timeline |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/182081/hacienda-luisita-timeline |website=Inquirer.net |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=25 April 2012 |access-date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government then authorized a P 5.9 million loan from GSIS which was approved on November 1957. The Cojuangcos were given a ten-year window to distribute the lands to farmers as stipulated.&lt;ref name="UMA2013" /&gt; Finally on 1958, Jose Cojuangco Sr.’s Tarlac Development Corporation (TADECO) became the new owner of Hacienda Luisita as well as the CAT. Ninoy Aquino then became Luisita’s first administrator.&lt;ref name="mcmurray1996" /&gt;

=== Presidency of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] (1965-1986) ===

The year 1967 marked the end of the 10-year window given to the Cojuangcos that the Philippine government gave in order to distribute the land. However, the Cojuangcos failed to distribute any land. In response, farmers’ organizations began to form in order to push for the distribution.This was combined with political unrest in the nation. The United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) was created because of this. This year was also when Benigno Aquino Jr. was elected senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dychiu |first1=Stephanie |title=Ghosts of Hacienda Luisita back to haunt Noynoy candidacy |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/177574/ghosts-of-hacienda-luisita-back-to-haunt-noynoy-candidacy/story/ |website=GMA News Online |publisher=[[GMA Network|GMA]] |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dychiujan2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dychiu |first1=Stephanie |title=Hacienda Luisita's past haunts Noynoy's future |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/181877/hacienda-luisita-s-past-haunts-noynoy-s-future/story/ |website=GMA News Online |publisher=GMA |date=10 January 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nationwide [[Philippine Martial Law referendum, 1973|Martial Law]] was declared on 21 September 1972, and [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], the son-in-law of Jose "Pepe" Cojuangco, was among the first to be imprisoned for treason, murder, subversion and weapons possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benigno Aquino Jr. |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benigno-Aquino-Jr |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the Marcos administration took an interest in enforcing land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kerkvliet |first1=Benedict |title=Land Reform in the Philippines Since the Marcos Coup |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2755767.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ac23ba63e94d758618ac4251a86bf34fa |website=JSTOR |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jose Cojuangco died on 21 August 1976, five years from the day of the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]]. On 7 May 1980, the government filed a case against Tarlac Development Corporation, or TADECO (a Cojuangco company) before the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC). The case (Republic of the Philippines vs. TADECO, Civil Case No. 131654, Manila Regional Trial Court, Branch XLIII) sought the surrender of the hacienda to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform in order to properly distribute the land to the qualified farm workers. The Cojuangcos responded to the case saying that there were no such [[tenants]] or farm workers qualified to receive such land.&lt;ref name="SC5July2011" /&gt; This was during the same time that Ninoy Aquino and his family were to leave for exile in the United States. At the time, the anti-Marcos block portrayed this lawsuit as an attack on the Aquino family by the Marcoses, while the farmers viewed it as the government taking action to help them.&lt;ref name="dychiujan2010" /&gt;

Ninoy Aquino was shot on 21 August 1983, as he was descending the plane. On 2 December 1985, the Manila RTC ordered TADECO to surrender Hacienda Luisita to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR, now the Department of Agrarian Reform, or DAR) due to noncompliance of the land reform act. TADECO alleged that the hacienda housed no tenants, and that the hacienda's sugar lands are not covered by existing agrarian reform legislations. The Cojuangcos brought the case to the Court of Appeals due to their belief that the case was an act of harassment by the Marcos administration because Corazon Aquino took her late husband's place to run against Marcos in the 1986 snap elections. Of note is that land reform was one of the issues her campaign focused on. The snap elections were fraught with anti-Marcos allegations, and led to the [[People Power Revolution]].&lt;ref name="SC5July2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GMAaug2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Holding on: A Hacienda Luisita timeline from the Spanish to the Noynoy eras |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/198854/holding-on-a-hacienda-luisita-timeline-from-the-spanish-to-the-noynoy-eras/story/ |website=GMA News Online |publisher=GMA |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elections of 1986 |url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/74713-elections-of-1986/ |website=Malacañan Palace: Presidential Museum and Library |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidency of [[Corazon Aquino|Corazón “Cory” C. Aquino]] (1986-1992) ===

Despite the installation of Corazon Aquino as president, the farmland was not being distributed. Thousands of farmers marched to [[Malacañang Palace]] on 22 January 1987. 13 protesting farmers were shot in what is now known as the "[[Mendiola Massacre]]." On 22 July 1987, Aquino issues Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order No. 229, which outlines her agrarian reform program. In 18 May 1988, the case the Marcos administration filed against TADECO was dismissed by the Court of Appeals, and the Philippine government, under the Aquino administration, moved to dismiss its own case. In 10 June 1988, the Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) is signed into law by President Aquino. The law includes a Stock Distribution Option (SDO) which would allow landowners to distribute the stock shares of the land to the farmers, instead of actual land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 229 July 22, 1987 |url=https://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1987/eo_229_1987.html |website=The LawPhil Project |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In compliance with the CARP, 4915.75 hectares of Hacienda Luisita were folded into Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) on 23 August 1988, in order to comply with a stock distribution agreement between the landowners and farm workers. The hacienda's farmers voted 92.9% in favor of the SDO route with regards to the land reform act. This agreement was implemented on 11 May 1989. The farm workers' therefore now owned 33% of the plantation, while the Cojuangcos retained ownership of the remaining 67% of stocks. In accordance with the SDO agreement, there would be a 30-year schedule for distributing and transferring the stocks to the farmers.&lt;ref name="GMAaug2010" /&gt;

=== Present period (1992-onwards) ===

In 1 September 1995, 3,290 hectares of the hacienda was reclassified from [[agricultural]] to commercial, industrial, and residential land. This was passed by the Provincial Board of Tarlac, the governor of which was Margarita "Tingting" Cojuangco, wife of Jose “Peping" Cojuangco, Jr., brother of Cory Aquino. The [[Department of Agrarian Reform]] (DAR) approved the conversion of 500 hectares in 1996.&lt;ref name="GMAaug2010" /&gt; 

In 2003, hacienda workers filed a [[petition]] to have the SDO agreement revoked, and in 2005, the DAR cancelled the stock distribution agreement. It was cited that the SDO had failed to improve the lives of the more than 5,000 farmer [[beneficiaries]]. HLI appealed this decision, but in May 2006, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council rejected with finality the motion of HLI to reconsider the revocation of the stock distribution agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://la.indymedia.org/news/2009/09/230275.php |title=Landlordism in the Philippines: Hacienda Luisita as large as Makati and Pasig Cities combined |website=la.indymedia.org |publisher=Los Angeles Independent Media Center |date=13 September 2009 |access-date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Supreme Court issued a temporary [[restraining order]], stopping the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council from parceling out the land to the workers.&lt;ref name="calonzo2009"&gt;{{cite web |last=Calonzo |first=Andreo |date=12 September 2009 |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/172172/sen-noynoy-eyes-giving-up-family-s-rights-over-luisita/story/ |title=Sen.

== Criticisms of Ownership ==
The Cojuangcos have often garnered criticism for their ownership of the estate with some critics comparing the situation to problems seen in oligarchy based systems.&lt;ref&gt;Doronila, Amando (14 September 2009).

== Current Issues and Problems ==

=== Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) ===

The signing into law of Republic Act No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) on 10 June 1988 signaled the beginning of the [[Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program]] (CARP) under former President Corazon Aquino. One of the clauses of the CARP provided for a Stock Distribution Option (SDO), which would allow for compliance with the agrarian reform law by distributing stocks of the hacienda to the farm workers rather than actual land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Makabenta |first=Yen |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/arroyos-and-coronas-ordeal-it-was-always-about-hacienda-luisita/100454/ |title=Arroyo’s and Corona’s ordeal: It was always about Hacienda Luisita |website=manilatimes.net |publisher=[[The Manila Times]] |date=30 May 2014 |access-date=9 July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 1989, a referendum was held among the farm workers of Hacienda Luisita to determine whether stocks or land would be the means by which the hacienda would be distributed. The results of the May 1989 referendum, as well as a second referendum held in October of the same year, found that a great majority of the Hacienda farm workers voted in favor of distribution of stock rather than land.&lt;ref name="GMAaug2010" /&gt; The terms of the SDO agreement of the Hacienda are quoted as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“At the end of each fiscal year, for a period of 30 years, the SECOND PARTY (HLI) shall arrange with the FIRST PARTY (TADECO) the acquisition and distribution to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers) on the basis of number of days worked and at no cost to them of one-thirtieth (1/30) of 118,391,976.85 shares of the capital stock of the SECOND PARTY (HLI) that are presently owned and held by the FIRST PARTY (TADECO), until such time as the entire block of 118,391,976.85 shares shall have been completely acquired and distributed to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers)."&lt;ref name="SC5July2011" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The SDO agreement however was met with considerable criticism, most notably in 2003 when hacienda workers (farmers, HLI supervisory group workers, union officers) began filing petitions to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to have the SDO agreement revoked due to their dividends and other promised benefits not being given. Daily wage was at P194.50, and there was only one working day per week, due to the mechanizing of some tasks in the hacienda. A petition with more than 5,300 signatures was filed to revoke the SDO agreement and stop land conversion in the hacienda.

In 2004, the workers' union tried to negotiate with the management to increase daily wages to P225 and increase work days to 2-3 days weekly. Management refused. In 1 October of that year, 327 workers (farm workers and union officers) were retrenched.&lt;ref name="GMAaug2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pastrana |first1=Dante |title=Hacienda Luisita haunts Philippine presidential candidate Aquino |url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/05/phil-m07.html |website=World Socialist Web Site |publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International |accessdate=9 July 2018 |date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land Reform Disputes ===

==== November 2004 Massacre ====
On 6 November 2004, United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) and the Central Azucarera de Tarlac Labor Union (CATLU) launched a strike near Gate 1 of the Central Azucarera de Tarlac sugar mill. The protesters were pushing for an increase in their P9.50 weekly wage, increased worker benefits and, more broadly, a greater commitment for national land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cepeda |first=Cody |url=https://thelasallian.com/2016/07/15/within-confines-a-farmers-life-in-hacienda-luisita/ |title=Within confines: A farmer's life in Hacienda Luisita |date=15 July 2016 |website=thelasallian.com |publisher=[[The LaSallian]] |access-date=8 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simbol |first=Dax |url=https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/152595-hacienda-luisita-12-years-justice |title=12 years on, still no justice for Hacienda Luisita massacre victims |date=16 November 2016 |website=Rappler.com |publisher=[[Rappler]] |access-date=16 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a thousand farmers, and another several thousand union members attended the demonstration. 

On 16 November 2004, ten days after the start of the said strike, police and soldiers were dispatched by then Labour Secretary Patricia Santo Tomás, to storm and disperse the blockade. The enforcers utilized tear gas, water cannons, guns, and military vehicles to disseminate the crowd. Seven of the people participating in the rally were killed, an estimated number of 121 people, adults and children, were injured, and 133 people were arrested and detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dychiu |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/182515/how-a-workers-strike-became-the-luisita-massacre/story/ |title=How a workers' strike became the Luisita Massacre |date=26 January 2010 |website=GMA News Online |publisher=GMA |access-date=6 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident has sparked a national outcry, however, then Deputy Speaker [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno ‘Noynoy’ Aquino III]], Representative of Tarlac, claims that the dispersal done by the enforcers was justified. A case was filed against the police and military with regards to the injuries and deaths, however it was dismissed by the office of the Ombudsman in 2010. Proceeding that, a motion to reopen the case was filed by the families of the victims, however, it was declined by the Office of the Ombudsman on 2 October 2014.

The November 2004 massacre or more popularly known as the Hacienda Luisita massacre is one of the most prominent instances of protest related deaths of Filipinos in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalist.org/philippinesluisitamassacre0412.html |title=Over a Dozen Hacienda Luisita Strikers and Their Children Killed |date=December 2004 |website=internationalist.org |publisher=[[League for the Fourth International|Internationalist Group]]|access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the months following the Hacienda Luisita massacre, eight more people who either supported or provided evidence to the farmers’ cause were found murdered, beginning with the assassination of peasant leader Marcelino Beltran just before he was to testify about the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dychiu |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/183662/after-luisita-massacre-more-killings-linked-to-protest/story/ |title=After Luisita massacre, more killings linked to protest |date=11 February 2010 |website=GMA News Online |publisher=GMA |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Revocation of the Stock Distribution Option Agreement ====

In the aftermath of the November 2004 massacre, the DAR established Task Force Luisita to conduct further investigations and conduct focus group discussions among the farmers. On 22 September 2005, based on the findings of its investigations, Task Force Luisita recommended the revocation of the SDO agreement forged between Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) and the farm workers.&lt;ref name="GMAaug2010" /&gt; Three months later, on December of the same year, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) issued a resolution ordering the revocation of the SDO agreement and the distribution of the hacienda's land among the farm workers. Land distribution and the cancellation of the SDO agreement was halted however in June 2006 when the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] granted the petition of HLI and issued a temporary restraining order on the PARC resolution.&lt;ref name="calonzo2009" /&gt;

On 18 August 2010, oral arguments on the Hacienda Luisita case were heard by the Supreme Court for the first time since the dispute was brought to its doors in 2006. A landmark decision was ultimately reached on 5 July 2011, wherein the Supreme Court lifted the temporary restraining order on the 2005 PARC resolution and upheld both the distribution of land to the hacienda's farm workers and the revocation of the SDO agreement forged in 1989.&lt;ref name="SC5July2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GMAaug2010" /&gt; In acknowledgement of the fact that 93% of the hacienda's farm workers voted in favor of SDO in the 1989 referendum, included in the July 2011 decision was the further mandating of the DAR to hold another referendum to determine which among the hacienda's farm workers would wish to receive land or to remain as stockholders of HLI. This decision to hold another referendum was met with considerable criticism however as critics asserted that agrarian reform laws stipulate that land distribution should be the only viable option and alternatives such as the SDO violate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dedace |first=Sophia |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/225323/stocks-or-land-sc-calls-for-new-luisita-referendum/story/ |title=Stocks or land? SC calls for new Luisita referendum |date=5 July 2011 |website=GMA News Online |publisher=GMA |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2011, the Supreme Court modified its July 2011 decision and revoked the option for the hacienda farm workers to remain as stockholders of HLI, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Upon a review of the facts and circumstances, We realize that the FWBs [Farmer-Worker Beneficiaries] will never have control over these agricultural lands for as long as they remain as stockholders of HLI…

In line with Our finding that control over agricultural lands must always be in the hands of the farmers, We reconsider our ruling that the qualified FWBs should be given an option to remain as stockholders of HLI, inasmuch as these qualified FWBs will never gain control given the present proportion of shareholdings in HLI.”&lt;ref name="SC22Nov2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=G.R.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Disputes over Landowner Compensation ====

In compliance with agrarian reform laws, the Supreme Court decisions further stated that HLI was entitled to payment by the government as just compensation for distributing the hacienda's lands to the farm workers.&lt;ref name="SC5July2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC22Nov2011" /&gt; The corporation was to receive compensation for the distributed land based on its valuation on the date of its taking from HLI. 

In line with this, HLI presented 2 January 2006 as the appropriate date of taking based on when a [http://www.dar.gov.ph/notice-of-coverage Notice of Coverage] was issued by the DAR placing the hacienda's land under compulsory acquisition. However the Supreme Court maintained its initial stance that the date of taking be marked at 21 November 1989, based on when the original stock distribution plan was approved, stating this was when ownership of the lands was initially relinquished to make way for its distribution to the farm workers via stock.&lt;ref name=""SC24Apr2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=G.R.

==== April 2012 Supreme Court Ruling ====

On 24 April 2012, the Supreme Court released a final and executory decision regarding Hacienda Luisita:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To recapitulate, the Court voted on the following issues in this manner:

1.    In determining the date of taking, the Court voted 8-6 to maintain the ruling fixing November 21, 1989 as the date of taking, the value of the affected lands to be determined by the LBP and the DAR;

2.    On the propriety of the revocation of the option of the FWBs [Farmer-Worker Beneficiaries] to remain as HLI stockholders, the Court, by unanimous vote, agreed to reiterate its ruling in its November 22, 2011 Resolution that the [stock distribution option] granted to the FWBs stays revoked;

3.    On the propriety of returning to the FWBs the proceeds of the sale of the 500-hectare converted land and of the 80.51-hectare SCTEX land, the Court unanimously voted to maintain its ruling to order the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the said land to the FWBs less the 3% share, taxes and expenses specified in the &lt;i&gt;fallo&lt;/i&gt; of the November 22, 2011 Resolution;

4.    On the payment of just compensation for the homelots to HLI, the Court, by unanimous vote, resolved to amend its July 5, 2011 Decision and November 22, 2011 Resolution by ordering the government, through the DAR, to pay to HLI the just compensation for the homelots thus distributed to the FWBS.

WHEREFORE, the Motion to Clarify and Reconsider Resolution of November 22, 2011 dated December 16, 2011 filed by petitioner Hacienda Luisita, Inc. and the Motion for Reconsideration/Clarification dated December 9, 2011 filed by private respondents Noel Mallari, Julio Suniga, Supervisory Group of Hacienda Luisita, Inc. and Windsor Andaya are hereby DENIED with this qualification: the July 5, 2011 Decision, as modified by the November 22, 2011 Resolution, is FURTHER MODIFIED in that the government, through DAR, is ordered to pay Hacienda Luisita, Inc. the just compensation for the 240-square meter homelots distributed to the FWBs.

The July 5, 2011 Decision, as modified by the November 22, 2011 Resolution and further modified by this Resolution is declared FINAL and EXECUTORY. The entry of judgment of said decision shall be made upon the time of the promulgation of this Resolution.

No further pleadings shall be entertained in this case.

SO ORDERED."&lt;ref name=""SC24Apr2012" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Current Status of the Hacienda ==
The Supreme Court ruling states that the 4,916 hectares of Hacienda Luisita is to be redistributed to 6,296 registered farm-worker beneficiaries, while the Hacienda Luisita Incorporated (HLI) will be receiving 40,000 pesos per hectare as compensation.&lt;ref name="pedrasa2012" /&gt; This is based on the 1989 valuation of the Hacienda Luisita that the Supreme Court had voted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=de Santos |first=Jonathan |title=SC votes for 1989 rates valuation of Luisita land |url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/sc-votes-for-1989-rates-valuation-of-luisita-land.html |website=Yahoo! News |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |date=24 April 2012 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But from the 4,916 hectares to be redistributed, 500 hectares were converted into non-agricultural use in 18 August 1996 by the Department of Agrarian Reform, while 80.5 hectares was also subtracted for the development of the Subic Clark Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ranada |first=Pia |title=Two years on, Luisita land distribution a failure – farmers |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/56274-hacienda-luisita-land-distribution-failure |website=Rappler.com |publisher=Rappler |date=24 April 2014 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other inconsistencies within area size have caused conflicting numbers, but according to the DAR this then leaves only 4,099.92 hectares of land to be distributed.&lt;ref name="UMA2013" /&gt;

The process of land distribution was decided to be through lottery system, wherein the names of the beneficiaries are placed into a drum, and those chosen will be given the Lot Allocation Certificate (LAC).&lt;ref name="gutierrez2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gutierrez |first=Natashya |title=Hacienda Luisita land distribution begins |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/34192-hacienda-luisita-land-distribution-begins |website=Rappler.com |publisher=Rappler |date=18 July 2013 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer-worker Beneficiaries then sign the  Application to Purchase and Farmers' Undertaking (APFU), for the registry of their Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA), which is the actual land title. The lottery system had started on 18 July 2013 in Barangay Cutcut, Tarlac City with 340 farmers being given the first batch of Lot Allocation Certificates.&lt;ref name="gutierrez2013" /  But it was on 30 September 2013, where DAR Secretary Virgilio de los Reyes started awarding the actual Certificate of Land Ownership (CLOA) to 600 Farmer-worker beneficiaries in Barangay Pando. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cruz |first=Efren S. |title=Hacienda Luisita and agrarian reform |url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/03/1240790/hacienda-luisita-and-agrarian-reform |website=Philstar Global |publisher=The Philippine Star |date=3 October 2013 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 12 July 2016, 4,099 hectares have been already distributed to farmers, but the sales shares from the Hacienda Luisita's converted land to be paid to the farmer-worker beneficiaries have been left unpaid which amounts to 1.3 billion pesos. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mia |first=Ian Benedict |title=28 years of agrarian reform in Hacienda Luisita |url=https://thelasallian.com/2016/07/12/28-years-of-agrarian-reform-in-hacienda-luisita/ |website=thelasallian.com |publisher=The LaSallian |date=12 July 2016 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2017, protesters consisting of the Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA) and other militant organizations had gone to Hacienda Luisita to protest against the 348 hectare land that was turned over to Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) back in 25 November 2004 for a 431.7 million peso loan obligation. &lt;ref name="simbol2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Simbol |first=Dax |title=Farmers break Hacienda Luisita walls |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/167805-farmers-break-hacienda-luisita-walls |website=Rappler.com |publisher=Rappler |date=24 April 2017 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest led to property damage, where protesters had destroyed over 100 meters of a wall surrounding the contested lot. On 21 February 2018, Luisita Land Corporation has since filed a case against 15 farmers for the protest, for malicious mischief and trespassing of the RCBC owned land. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Orejas |first1=Tonette |title=Luisita firm sues farmers for breaking into bank lot |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/970201/luisita-firm-sues-farmers-for-breaking-into-bank-lot |website=Inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=21 February 2018 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 4 July 2018, the Hacienda Luisita has fully complied with distributing the sales shares to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hacienda Luisita done distributing sale shares to farmers – SC |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/206506-supreme-court-decision-hacienda-luisita-sales-shares-distribution-farmers |website=Rappler.com |publisher=Rappler |date=4 July 2018 |access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.3 billion peso was broken down as such: P500 million received from Luisita Realty Inc. for a 200 hectare lot sold in 1996, P750 million for the selling of Luisita Industrial Park, and around P80 million for the 80.51 hectares used for the SCTEX road network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pedrasa |first1=Ira |title=SC orders distribution of Hacienda Luisita |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/11/23/11/sc-orders-distribution-hacienda-luisita |website=ABS-CBN News |publisher=ABS-CBN |date=23 November 2011 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling also states that 3% of the earlier stock transfers that were paid to the farmers will be deducted from the 1.3 billion to be received.

The history of the [[Jews]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] has been well-recorded and preserved.

==Background and legal standing==

After the decline of the Greek-speaking [[Hellenistic Judaism]] in ancient times, the use of the Greek language and the integration of the Greek culture into Judaism continued to be an integral part of the life in Jewish communities in the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;De Lange, N. R. M. "Greek Jewish Texts from the Cairo Genizah". 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The legal standing of the Jews of the Byzantine Empire was unique during the entire history of the Empire; they did not belong to the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith, which was the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion]], nor were they—in most circumstances—grouped together with [[heresy|heretics]] and [[pagan]]s. They were placed in a legal position somewhere between the two worlds. The place along the spectrum of social freedom in which Byzantine Jews found themselves varied somewhat—though far from drastically—with time, and depended largely on three factors: the [[theology|theological]] desire of the state to maintain the Jews as a living testament to the victory of Christianity, the desire of the state to strengthen its control, and the ability of centralized rule from [[Constantinople]] to enforce its [[legislation]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Foundations of the legal position of Jews: 330–404==

In 212, [[Caracalla]] bestowed [[Constitutio Antoniniana|citizenship]] on all its residents, including the Jews. This granted Jews [[legal equality]] to all other citizens, and formed the foundation of their legal status in Byzantium following the founding of Constantinople in 330.&lt;ref name = "Sharf20"&gt;Sharf, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Jews enjoyed the right to practice their faith under the rule of the Byzantines, as long as they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus]]. For example, [[circumcision]], which was considered [[mutilation]] and therefore [[death penalty|punishable by death]] if performed on a non-Jewish child, and by [[exile]] if performed on a non-Jewish adult, was legally permitted within Jewish religious practices. Byzantine law recognized [[synagogue]]s as places of worship, which could not be arbitrarily molested, Jewish courts had the force of law in [[civil case]]s, and Jews could not be forced to violate ''[[Shabbat]]'' and their [[Jewish festivals|festivals]].&lt;ref name="Sharf20-1"&gt;Sharf, pp. 20-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the year 390 nearly all of the territory of present-day Israel came under Byzantine suzerainty. The area was divided into the following provinces: [[Palestina Prima]], [[Palestina Secunda]] and [[Palestina Salutaris|Palestina Tertia]]. These provinces were part of the [[Diocese of the East]].&lt;ref name = "Lehmann"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090811054625/http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm | archivedate = 2009-08-11 &lt;!-- 054625 --&gt; | title = Palestine: History: 135–337: Syria Palaestina and the Tetrarchy| accessdate = 2014-08-24| last = Lehmann| first = Clayton Miles|date=Summer 1998| work = The On-line Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces| publisher = University of South Dakota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theodosian Code: 404–527==

In 404, Jews were excluded from certain governmental posts.&lt;ref name="Sharf21"&gt;Sharf, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In 418, they were barred from the [[civil service]], and from all military positions.&lt;ref name="Linder281"&gt;Linder, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; In 425, they were excluded from all remaining public offices, both civilian and military—a prohibition which [[Justinian I]] repeated.&lt;ref name="Sharf21" /&gt; Such restrictions, however, inevitably compromised the theological arguments for restricting the Jewish [[religion]]; although they empowered the Christian citizens of the empire at the expense of its Jews, all laws dealing with the Jews implicitly recognized the continued existence and legality of the Jewish religion.&lt;ref name="Brewer135"&gt;Brewer, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Emperor [[Theodosius II]] found that he had to balance the first two of the three factors governing the treatment of Jews in the empire—theology, political [[pragmatism]] and enforceability. He could not, however, effectively control the third. In 438, Theodosius had to reaffirm the prohibition on Jews holding public office, because it had been poorly enforced.&lt;ref name="Brewer130"&gt;Brewer, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 527, a decree which renewed this prohibition began by observing that "heedless of the laws' command [they have] infiltrated public offices".&lt;ref name="Linder360"&gt;Linder, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

There was one office, however, that Jews were not forbidden from assuming. This was the office of [[decurion (administrative)|decurion]], a tax collector who was required to pay all deficits in [[revenue]] from his own pocket. Theodosius II, who laid out much of the legal [[precedent]] and foundation for Byzantine law in his [[Theodosian Code]], permitted Jews, like other citizens, to hire a substitute to perform the duties of decurion in their place.&lt;ref name="Sharf21"&gt;Sharf, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian, whose legal code included 33 laws relating to the Jews,&lt;ref name="Brewer127"&gt;Brewer, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; initially maintained this ability, but it was abolished in 537.&lt;ref name="Sharf21" /&gt; Sharf explains that the purpose of this was so that the Jews "never enjoy the fruits of office, but only suffer its pains and penalties".&lt;ref name="Sharf21" /&gt;

In addition to the matter of holding public office, Jews were also unequal to Christians with respect to the ownership of [[slave]]s. Restrictions on the ownership of Christian slaves by Jews were in place through the reign of many emperors, under the fear that Jews would use conversion of slaves as a means to increase their number. Additionally, this was designed to provide an incentive for non-Christian slaves to convert into Christianity, and an economic restriction on the Jews. Restrictions on slave-owning could not, however, be excessively burdensome, because slaves, although numerous, were between 10-15% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Slavery in the Late Ancient World, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–60, Kyle Harper, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Theodosian Code, therefore, ownership of Christian slaves by Jews was not prohibited, although their purchase was. Thus, one who gained possession of a slave by means such as inheritance would remain his or her owner. Purchase of slaves was usually penalized by compelled sale at the original purchase price.&lt;ref name="Sharf22"&gt;Sharf, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave ownership produces another example of the threefold balancing act of Legislation dealing with the Jewish minority of Byzantium: ownership of Christian slaves undermined the "living testament" theology, but was a pragmatic requirement of the time, and the prohibition thereof could not be entirely enforced, since freedom may not necessarily have been a desirable option for a slave who was well-treated by his masters.&lt;ref name="Fieldman394"&gt;Fieldman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

The third important restriction on Judaism—in addition to the limitations on public service and slave ownership—was that the Jewish religion, though allowed to survive, was not allowed to thrive. Theologically, the victory of Christianity could be successfully asserted by maintaining a small contingent of Jews within the empire, although allowing them to become too sizable a minority would threaten the theological monopoly of [[Orthodox Christianity]] within the Empire.&lt;ref name="Sharf22" /&gt;

One important ramification of this policy was the prohibition on the construction of new synagogues within the Empire, though the repair of old synagogues was permitted. This prohibition was difficult to enforce, as archaeological evidence in Israel indicates that illegal synagogue construction continued throughout the sixth century.&lt;ref name="Gray262-3"&gt;Gray, pp. 262-3&lt;/ref&gt; The synagogue did continue to be respected as an inviolable [[place of worship]] until the reign of Justinian.

Beginning at this time, most legislation regarding the Jews—even laws which expanded the rights which they were afforded—were "prefaced by unambiguous expressions of hatred and contempt for Judaism".&lt;ref name="Sharf23" /&gt;

==Justinian Code: 527–565==

The [[Justinian Code|Civil Code]] of Justinian tightened the regulations on the ownership of Christian slaves by non-Christians. It abolished compensation for illegal purchases of Christian slaves, and added a 30&amp;nbsp;lb gold fine for this offense. Jews owning Christian slaves during the time of Justinian could be punished by execution.&lt;ref name="Sharf22" /&gt;

In 545, Justinian legislated that the right of existence of any synagogue on land belonging to an [[Christian Church|ecclesiastical institution]] be nullified.&lt;ref name="Sharf22" /&gt; He was also the first emperor to order that existing synagogues be converted into [[Church (building)|church]]es. There is, however, only one example of such a conversion taking place by force: the synagogue in [[Borem]]. This synagogue was most likely converted for military reasons, in light of its strategic position on the frontier with the territory of the Berber tribes.&lt;ref name="Brewer131" /&gt; In fact, Justinian banned all non-Christian places of worship in [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|northern Africa]], in legislation that grouped Jews with pagans and heretics. This legislation was hardly enforced, but set a precedent for the violability of synagogues and the blurring of the difference between Jews and other non-Christians.&lt;ref name="Sharf26"&gt;Sharf, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Once more, this represents the divergence between the Empire's theological objectives, its pragmatic goals and its capability to enforce its legislation. The poor efficacy of legislation points to the dominating power of the latter in restraining the two former factors, which, in this case, coincided.

In terms of symbolic legal roles, the Jews also found that they were positioned somewhere between other non-Christians and the Christian majority. For instance, Justinian demanded that [[Passover]] be shown as subservient to [[Easter]]; in cases in which the former would fall before the latter, the Jews were forbidden from celebrating it on its appointed day, and were compelled to delay it.&lt;ref name="Sharf23"&gt;Sharf, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were also forbidden from giving testimony concerning Christians in a [[court of law]]—a restriction already present in the Theodosian code—although Justinian eased this restriction in 537 to allow them to testify in cases between Christian individuals and the state. This privilege was not enjoyed by any other non-Christian group.&lt;ref name="Brewer131"&gt;Brewer, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Once more, the state sacrificed the doctrinal subordination of the Jews in order to gain practical benefits, in this case testimony against those who faced it in court.

Questions of internal Jewish discourse—which could, under the Theodosian Code, be arbitrated only by Jewish courts—could, under the [[Justinian Code]], be officiated by the state,&lt;ref name="Brewer132-3"&gt;Brewer, pp. 132-3&lt;/ref&gt; a power which Justinian did not shy away from utilizing. In 553 for instance, Justinian required that the public reading of the [[Pentateuch]] proceed in [[vernacular]], rather than [[Hebrew]], and forbade altogether the reading of the ''[[Mishna]]''.&lt;ref name="Sharf24-5"&gt;Sharf, pp. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Justinian not only restricted the religious freedom of the Jews, but also expanded his own power in order to reinforce the principle that, "in theory, there is no area that falls outside of the Empire's legislative power".&lt;ref name="Brewer135"&gt;Brewer, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian's restrictions were, however, poorly enforced. Ironically, what little enforcement they did enjoy contributed to a notable growth in Jewish culture and [[liturgy]]. For instance, the banning of the reading of ''Mishna'' prompted Jewish scholars to write the ''[[piyutim]]'', important works of poetry which refer strongly to the ''Mishna''. Because these were not banned by the Civil Code, they afforded Jews the ability to circumvent it. Accordingly, this form of religious expression flourished under Justinian.&lt;ref name="Weinberger143"&gt;Weinberger, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punctuated tolerance, Jewish Revolts, and the Crusades: 565–1204==

Although the Justinian Code remained in force in the Eastern Empire until the ninth century,&lt;ref name="Brewer127"&gt;Brewer, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; the period following Justinian's reign was generally characterized by toleration of non-Christians, particularly the Jews. However, during the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]] many Jews sided against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]], which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria. In reaction to this, anti-Jewish measures were enacted throughout the Byzantine realm and as far away as [[Merovingian]] France.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamson et al. The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 compared with Islamic conquest of 638.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, in 634 the [[Muslim conquests]] began, during which many Jews initially rose up again against their Byzantine rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara H.

Accordingly, there were no recorded legal persecutions of the Jews for nearly two and a half centuries following his reign.&lt;ref name="Charnis75" /&gt;

In fact Samuel Krauss writes in his famous work on Byzantine Jewry that Constantinople at the time of the Byzantine Empire was "the center of the Jewish, [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] and Karaite scholarship". [[Eleazar ben Killir]] a Byzantine Jew from a Greek-speaking area wrote his famous piyutim, which are still in use in the most [[Machzor]]im and became the teacher of all paytanim who came after him.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Krauss (Studien zur byzantinisch-jüdischen Geschichte 1914 p. 99 et 127-129)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asaph the Jew]]  wrote in Byzantium the first Hebrew medical treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Holo, J. Byzantine Jewry in the Mediterranean Economy 2009, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Josippon|Sefer Yosippon]]'' was written down in the 10th century in the Byzantine [[Catepanate of Italy|south Italy]] by the [[Romaniote Jews|Greek-speaking Jewish community]] there. [[Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi]], a Romaniote Jew from [[Ohrid|Achrida]] edited and expanded the ''Sefer Josippon'' later.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Jewish Civilisation: An Encyclopedia, Norman Roth, 2014 p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bonfil, ''Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures'', 2011, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; This community of Byzantine Jews of southern Italy produced such prominent works like the ''Sefer Ahimaaz'' of [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]], the ''Sefer Hachmoni'' of [[Shabbethai Donnolo]], the ''[[Aggadath Bereshit]]'' and many [[piyyut]]im.&lt;ref&gt;Magdalino, P. and Mavroudi, M.

A Companion to Josephus, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The liturgical writings of these [[Romaniote Jews]], especially the piyyut were eminent for the development of the [[Nusach Ashkenaz|Ashkenazi]] [[Mahzor]], as they found their way through Italy to [[Ashkenaz]] and are preserved to this day in the most ashkenazi mahzorim.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, S.

The language of this manuscripts is not in [[Koine Greek|Ancient Greek]], but rather in an [[Medieval Greek|older form]] of [[Modern Greek]]. These texts are the oldest known written texts in Modern Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, E. and Röhl, S. "Language of Religion, Language of the People: Medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Beside these Rabbanites and as a part of the Empire's Romaniote Jews, important [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] communities like the [[Constantinopolitan Karaites]] and the Karaites of [[Adrianople]] flourished and produced eminent personalities for the Karaite movement like [[Caleb Afendopolo]], [[Elijah Bashyazi]], [[Aaron ben Joseph of Constantinople]], [[Aaron ben Elijah]], [[Judah Hadassi]] and other.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Ankori, Karaites in Byzantium (New York, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twelfth century, there were about 2,500 Jews in [[Constantinople]], 2,000 Jews in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and 500 Jews in [[Thessalonica]]. [[Demetrias|Halmyrus]], [[Tekirdag|Rhaedestus]], [[Chios]], and [[Rhodes]] each housed 400 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, p. 701&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there were about 300 Jews each in [[Corinth]] and [[Samos]], and 200 Jews in [[Gallipoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, p. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 12th century that the passing [[Crusades|Crusader]]s wrought havoc upon the Jewish communities of Byzantium, in a foretaste of what the later [[Latinokratia|Latin occupation]] would bring upon the Byzantine Christians. Although most crusading bands did not adopt a policy of violence or forced conversion against the Jews, the [[First Crusade]] certainly undertook an anti-Jewish face in certain communities. Because the Crusade was undertaken with the goal of "subjugating all non-believers to the faith," many crusaders compelled Jews to convert on pain of death, and there is a large number of recorded cases of mass suicides within Jewish communities—particularly among Jewish maidens—in order to avoid such conversions.&lt;ref name="Chazan10"&gt;Chazan, pp. 10-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin occupation: 1204–1261==
{{further|Latin Empire|Latinokratia}}

The [[Fourth Crusade]] further degraded the position of Byzantine Jews. As smaller states separated from a weakened empire, the rulers of these states found themselves more capable of enforcing legislation than their Byzantine counterparts. The most powerful protection on the rights of Jews—governmental impotence to enforce laws—was thus abolished. [[Theodore Doukas]], who crowned himself emperor of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epiros]] after he conquered [[Thessalonica]], was known for his persecution of the Jews, which began in 1229, a year before the end of his reign.&lt;ref name="Charnis75" /&gt; Theodore's disdain for the Jews is well-established. Still, his waiting until 1229—five years after capturing Thessalonica and declaring himself emperor—indicates that antisemitism may not have been the cause of his anti-Jewish edicts. Rather, they appear to have been motivated by a desire to confiscate Jewish property at a time when his empire was short of funds. This explains the expropriations of Jewish property under Theodore, as well as his regime's abstention from religious persecution for its own sake.&lt;ref name="Bowman14"&gt;Bowman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Vatatzes]], the emperor of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], commenced legal persecution of the Jews in 1253.&lt;ref name="Charnis75" /&gt; Unlike Theodore, Vatatzes ordered that the Jews within the Empire of Nicaea be converted to Christianity, though he did not order the expropriation of Jewish property.&lt;ref name="Bowman18"&gt;Bowman, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Although these measures began only a year before Vatatzes' death, they seemed to have set a precedent of persecution which his son, [[Theodore II Laskaris]], followed.&lt;ref name="Charnis75" /&gt;

It was in this environment of persecution that the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologoi]] rose to the imperial throne. [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] largely ended persecution of the Jews. Bowman writes the following:

:Michael VIII summoned the Jewish leaders in his realm and invited them to support him as emperor. Thus Michael's first act toward the Jews […] was the revocation of John Vatatzes's order of forced baptism. At the same time, however, he made it clear to the Jews that he expected them to show their appreciation for his assistance.&lt;ref name="Bowman18" /&gt;

Michael's road to the throne had been of questionable legality, and that fact earned him many enemies. Additionally, he oversaw an empire which was strongly dependent on foreign powers, and had an immense need for gold to fund its great military expenses. It is not surprising, therefore, that he turned to the Jews and other minorities (most notably the Armenians) as a source of support in an embattled state of affairs, and when the ethnic majority and the mainstream elite had grown unfriendly toward him.&lt;ref name="Bowman19"&gt;Bowman, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] followed his father's precedent. The tolerance of Andronikos was quite notable, even drawing condemnation from [[Patriarch Athanasius III of Alexandria]], against what he saw as "excessive" tolerance of Jews and other non-Christians, in particular for permitting them to live amongst Christians.&lt;ref name="Charnis75-6"&gt;Charnis, pp. 75-6&lt;/ref&gt; The patriarch's complaint indicates that, in spite of the tolerance of the Palaiologoi, the norm of imperial law was to require non-Christians to live separately from Christians. This apparent trend of segregation between the peoples of Byzantium, which certainly included the Jews, is confirmed in a letter by John, bishop of Citrus, in the latter half of the twelfth century, which declared that, "People of alien tongues and alien beliefs, such as Jews, [[Armenians]], [[Muslims|Ishmaelites]], [[Hagarite]]s and other such as these were permitted from of old to dwell in Christian countries and cities, except that they had to live separately and not together with the Christians".&lt;ref name="Charnis76-7"&gt;Charnis, pp. 76-7&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fourteenth century, the Jewish question of Byzantium seemed to be most concerned with [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Jews. Venetians had come to reside in the Empire in large numbers by the early 14th century, and treaties between the Empire and Venice granted the Venetians living in the empire, including Jews of Venetian origin, special privileges, though they also carried certain minor economic prohibitions. Under the [[aegis]] of these treaties, Venetian Jews could buy, sell or rent land anywhere in Constantinople. They also enjoyed a more favorable tax structure than Byzantine citizens, as well as the freedom of movement and settlement anywhere in the Empire.&lt;ref name="Bowman20-1"&gt;Bowman, pp. 20-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complicating this legal status, some Jews obtained Venetian citizenship either "by coming from areas subject to the [[Republic of Venice|Republic]] or by purchasing naturalization", thus obtaining the same privileges as Venetian nationals in the Empire.&lt;ref name="Bowman23"&gt;Bowman, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the Empire was in rapid decay, and could not seriously enforce laws intended to curtail these rights and regain economic control within its borders. Thus, an exception to the general trend of Byzantine history emerged during this century, whereby Jews were entitled to a broader set of rights than Christians. However, it is important to note that these liberties were conferred based on their being Venetian, not based on their Jewish identity. Non-Venetian Jews did not profit from the Venetian-Byzantine treaties, and non-Jewish Venetians enjoyed the same liberties as their Jewish compatriots.

ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations: [[irreducible complexity]] and [[specified complexity]]. These arguments assert that certain features (biological and informational, respectively) are too complex to be the result of natural processes. As a positive argument against evolution, ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and [[Cultural artifact|human artifacts]], a version of the [[Theology|theological]] [[Teleological argument|argument from design]] for the [[existence of God]].&lt;ref name="Numbers 373" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kitzruling-IDandGod" group="n"&gt;{{cite court

"the argument for ID is not a new scientific [[argument]], but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God.

Sometimes examples are quoted that are said to require an 'intelligent designer'. However, many of these have subsequently been shown to have a scientific explanation, for example, the immune system and blood clotting mechanisms.&lt;br&gt;Attempts to establish an idea of the 'specified complexity' needed for intelligent design are surrounded by complex mathematics.

==History==

===Origin of the concept===
{{See also|Creation science|Teleological argument|Watchmaker analogy}}
By 1910 [[evolution]] was not a topic of major religious controversy in America, but in the 1920s the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy]] in theology resulted in [[Christian fundamentalism|Fundamentalist Christian]] opposition to teaching evolution, and the origins of modern creationism.&lt;ref name="PM 09" /&gt; Teaching of evolution was effectively suspended in U.S. public schools until the 1960s, and when evolution was then reintroduced into the curriculum, there was a series of court cases in which attempts were made to get creationism taught alongside evolution in science classes. [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationists]] (YEC) promoted creation science as "an alternative scientific explanation of the world in which we live". This frequently invoked the argument from design to explain complexity in nature as demonstrating the existence of God.&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

The argument from design, the [[teleological argument]] or "argument from intelligent design", has been advanced in [[theology]] for centuries.&lt;ref name="Ayala 6"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayala |first=Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |year=2007 |title=Darwin's Gift to Science and Religion |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Joseph Henry Press]] |pages=6, 15–16, 138 |isbn=978-0-309-10231-5 |lccn=2007005821 |oclc=83609838 |ref=Ayala 2007}} Ayala writes that "Paley made the strongest possible case for intelligent design", and refers to "Intelligent Design: The Original Version" before discussing ID proponents reviving the argument from design with the pretence that it is scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be summarised briefly as "Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer." [[Thomas Aquinas]] presented it in his [[quinque viae|fifth proof]] of God's existence as a [[syllogism]].&lt;ref name="kitzruling-IDandGod" group="n" /&gt; In 1802, [[William Paley]]'s ''Natural Theology'' presented examples of intricate purpose in organisms. His version of the [[watchmaker analogy]] argued that, in the same way that a watch has evidently been designed by a craftsman, complexity and [[adaptation]] seen in nature must have been designed, and the perfection and diversity of these designs shows the designer to be omnipotent, the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 60, 68–70, 242–245

Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 24 of 139|Context, pp. 24–25]].&lt;/ref&gt; Like creation science, intelligent design centers on Paley's religious argument from design,&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt; but while Paley's natural theology was open to [[deism|deistic]] design through God-given laws, intelligent design seeks scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of life.&lt;ref name="PM 09" /&gt; Creation science prefigured the intelligent design arguments of irreducible complexity, even featuring the bacterial [[flagellum]]. In the United States, attempts to introduce creation science in schools led to court rulings that it is religious in nature, and thus cannot be taught in public school science classrooms. Intelligent design is also presented as science, and shares other arguments with creation science but avoids literal [[Bible|Biblical]] references to such things as the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]] story from the [[Book of Genesis]] or using [[Chronology of the Bible|Bible verses to age the Earth]].&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

[[Barbara Forrest]] writes that the intelligent design movement began in 1984 with the book ''The Mystery of Life's Origin: Reassessing Current Theories'', co-written by creationist [[Charles Thaxton|Charles B. Thaxton]], a chemist, with two other authors, and published by Jon A. Buell's [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]]. Thaxton held a conference in 1988, "Sources of Information Content in DNA", which attracted creationists such as [[Stephen C. Meyer]].&lt;ref name="DarkSyde"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Forrest |first=Barbara C. |interviewer=Andrew Stephen |title=Know Your Creationists: Know Your Allies |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/03/11/193288/-Know-Your-Creationists-Know-Your-Allies |work=[[Daily Kos]] |publisher=Kos Media, LLC |location=Berkeley, Calif. |date=March 11, 2006 |oclc=59226519 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1986, a review by Meyer used [[information theory]] to suggest that messages transmitted by [[DNA]] in the cell show "specified complexity" specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.&lt;ref name="meyermolo"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Meyer |first=Stephen C. |date=March 1986 |title=We Are Not Alone |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/meyer/sm_notalone.htm |journal=Eternity |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Evangelical Foundation Inc. |issn=0014-1682 |accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, Thaxton described his reasoning as a more sophisticated form of Paley's argument from design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.origins.org/articles/thaxton_dnadesign.html |title=DNA, Design and the Origin of Life |last=Thaxton |first=Charles B. |authorlink=Charles Thaxton |date=November 13–16, 1986 |conference=Jesus Christ: God and Man |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203913/http://www.origins.org/articles/thaxton_dnadesign.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |location=Dallas |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the "Sources of Information Content in DNA" conference in 1988, he said that his intelligent cause view was compatible with both [[metaphysical naturalism]] and [[supernatural]]ism.&lt;ref name="picshb" /&gt;

Intelligent Design steps boldly into the scientific arena to build a case based on empirical data. It takes Christianity out of the ineffectual realm of value and stakes out a cognitive claim in the realm of objective truth. It restores Christianity to its status as genuine knowledge, equipping us to defend it in the public arena."&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this lack of specificity about the designer's identity in public discussions is a genuine feature of the concept, or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science, has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' court ruling held the latter to be the case.

===Origin of the term===
{{See also|Timeline of intelligent design}}

Since the [[Middle Ages]], discussion of the religious "argument from design" or "[[teleological argument]]" in [[theology]], with its concept of "intelligent design", has persistently referred to the theistic Creator God. Although ID proponents chose this provocative label for their proposed alternative to evolutionary explanations, they have de-emphasized their religious antecedents and denied that ID is [[natural theology]], while still presenting ID as supporting the argument for the existence of God.&lt;ref name="Haught Witness Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/expert_reports/2005-04-01_Haught_expert_report_P.pdf |title=Report of John F.

While intelligent design proponents have pointed out past examples of the phrase ''intelligent design'' that they said were not creationist and faith-based, they have failed to show that these usages had any influence on those who introduced the label in the intelligent design movement.&lt;ref name="Dao" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matzke 007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/the-true-origin.html |title=The true origin of 'intelligent design' |last=Matzke |first=Nick |date=August 14, 2007 |website=[[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston |type=Blog |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matzke gives as examples the August 21, 1847, issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', and an 1861 letter in which [[Charles Darwin]] uses "intelligent Design" to denote [[John Herschel]]'s view that the overlapping changes of species found in geology had needed "intelligent direction":

Variations on the phrase appeared in [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] publications: a 1967 book co-written by [[Percival Davis]] referred to "design according to which basic organisms were created". In 1970, [[A. E. Wilder-Smith]] published ''The Creation of Life: A Cybernetic Approach to Evolution'' which defended Paley's design argument with computer calculations of the improbability of genetic sequences, which he said could not be explained by evolution but required "the abhorred necessity of divine intelligent activity behind nature", and that "the same problem would be expected to beset the relationship between the designer behind nature and the intelligently designed part of nature known as man." In a 1984 article as well as in his affidavit to ''Edwards v. Aguillard'', [[Dean H. Kenyon]] defended creation science by stating that "biomolecular systems require intelligent design and engineering know-how", citing Wilder-Smith. Creationist Richard B. Bliss used the phrase "creative design" in ''Origins: Two Models: Evolution, Creation'' (1976), and in ''Origins: Creation or Evolution'' (1988) wrote that "while evolutionists are trying to find non-intelligent ways for life to occur, the creationist insists that an intelligent design must have been there in the first place."&lt;ref name="Forrest expert report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/expert_reports/2005_04_01_Forrest_expert_report_P.pdf |title=Expert Witness Report |last=Forrest |first=Barbara |date=April 1, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-05-30}} Forrest's expert report in ''Kitzmiller v.

==Concepts==

===Irreducible complexity===
{{Main|Irreducible complexity}}
[[Image:MichaelBehe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The concept of [[irreducible complexity]] was popularised by [[Michael Behe]] in his 1996 book, ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]''.]]
The term "irreducible complexity" was introduced by biochemist [[Michael Behe]] in his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', though he had already described the concept in his contributions to the 1993 revised edition of ''Of Pandas and People''.&lt;ref name="pandafounds" /&gt; Behe defines it as "a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apologetics.org/MolecularMachines/tabid/99/Default.aspx |title=Molecular Machines: Experimental Support for the Design Inference |last=Behe |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Behe |year=1997 |website=Apologetics.org |publisher=The Apologetics Group;[[Trinity College (Florida)|Trinity College of Florida]] |location=Trinity, Fla. |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801101947/http://www.apologetics.org/MolecularMachines/tabid/99/Default.aspx |archivedate=August 1, 2012 |df= }} "This paper was originally presented in the Summer of 1994 at the meeting of the C.S. Lewis Society, Cambridge University."&lt;/ref&gt;

Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces—the base, the catch, the spring and the hammer—all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include the bacterial flagellum of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', the [[Coagulation|blood clotting cascade]], [[Cilium|cilia]], and the adaptive [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;Irreducible complexity of these examples is disputed; see {{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District |vol=04 |reporter=cv |opinion=2688 |date=December 20, 2005}} [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 76 of 139|Whether ID Is Science, pp. 76–78]], and [[Kenneth R. Miller]]'s January 3, 2006, lecture at [[Case Western Reserve University]]'s Strosacker Auditorium, {{YouTube|id=Ohd5uqzlwsU|title="The Collapse of Intelligent Design: Will the Next Monkey Trial be in Ohio?"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/design2/article.html |title=The Flagellum Unspun: The Collapse of 'Irreducible Complexity' |last=Miller |first=Kenneth R. |website=Biology by Miller &amp; Levine |publisher=Miller and Levine Biology |location=Rehoboth, Mass. |accessdate=2014-02-28}} "This is a pre-publication copy of an article that appeared in 'Debating Design from Darwin to DNA,' edited by [[Michael Ruse]] and William Dembski."&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics point out that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially.&lt;ref name="reducibly complex mousetrap, Ussery" /&gt; They argue that something that is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change. Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is sometimes called the "scaffolding objection" by an analogy with scaffolding, which can support an "irreducibly complex" building until it is complete and able to stand on its own.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bridgham |first1=Jamie T. |last2=Carroll |first2=Sean M. |last3=Thornton |first3=Joseph W. |authorlink3=Joseph Thornton (biologist) |date=April 7, 2006 |title=Evolution of Hormone-Receptor Complexity by Molecular Exploitation |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/312/5770/97.abstract |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |volume=312 |issue=5770 |pages=97–101 |bibcode=2006Sci...312...97B |doi=10.1126/science.1123348 |pmid=16601189 |accessdate=2014-02-28}} Bridgham, ''et al.'', showed that gradual evolutionary mechanisms can produce complex protein-protein interaction systems from simpler precursors.&lt;/ref&gt;
Behe has acknowledged using "sloppy prose", and that his "argument against [[Darwinism]] does not add up to a logical proof."&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[#Orr 2005|Orr 2005]]. This article draws from the following exchange of letters in which Behe admits to sloppy prose and non-logical proof:

Dover Area School District|Dover trial]], the court held that "Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."&lt;ref name="Kitzmiller v p. 64" /&gt;

===Specified complexity===
{{Main|Specified complexity}}
In 1986, Charles B. Thaxton, a physical chemist and creationist, used the term "specified complexity" from [[information theory]] when claiming that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.&lt;ref name="meyermolo" /&gt;
The intelligent design concept of "specified complexity" was developed in the 1990s by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian [[William A. Dembski]].&lt;ref name="Time-15-Aug-2005"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia |date=August 7, 2005 |title=The Evolution Wars |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090909-3,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dembski states that when something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and "specified", simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following examples: "A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A [[Sonnet#English (Shakespearean) sonnet|Shakespearean sonnet]] is both complex and specified."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dembski 1999|Dembski 1999]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the "patterns" of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as DNA.

[[Image:Dembski head shot.jpg|thumbnail|left|140px|[[William A. Dembski]] proposed the concept of specified complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Photograph of William A. Dembski  taken at lecture given at [[University of California, Berkeley]], March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]
Dembski defines [[complex specified information]] (CSI) as anything with a less than 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt; chance of occurring by (natural) chance. Critics say that this renders the argument a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: complex specified information cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitelson |first1=Branden |last2=Stephens |first2=Christopher |last3=Sober |first3=Elliott |authorlink3=Elliott Sober |date=September 1999 |title=How Not to Detect Design |url=http://sober.philosophy.wisc.edu/selected-papers/ID-1999-HowNotToDetectDesign_DembskiReview.pdf?attredirects=0 |format=PDF |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |type=Book review |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=472–488 |issn=0031-8248 |jstor=188598 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |doi=10.1086/392699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_anotherwaytodetectdesign.htm |title=Another Way to Detect Design? |last=Dembski |first=William A. |authorlink=William A.

John Wilkins and [[Wesley R. Elsberry]] characterize Dembski's "explanatory filter" as ''eliminative'' because it eliminates explanations sequentially: first regularity, then chance, finally defaulting to design. They argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific inference because the asymmetric way it treats the different possible explanations renders it prone to making false conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilkins |first1=John S. |last2=Elsberry |first2=Wesley R. |date=November 2001 |title=The Advantages of Theft over Toil: The Design Inference and Arguing from Ignorance |url=http://www.talkdesign.org/cs/theft_over_toil |journal=[[Biology and Philosophy]] |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=709–722 |doi=10.1023/A:1012282323054 |issn=0169-3867 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]], another critic of intelligent design, argues in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006) that allowing for an intelligent designer to account for unlikely complexity only postpones the problem, as such a designer would need to be at least as complex.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dawkins 2006|Dawkins 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have argued that evolution through selection is better able to explain the observed complexity, as is evident from the use of selective evolution to design certain electronic, aeronautic and automotive systems that are considered problems too complex for human "intelligent designers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=July 28, 2007 |title=Evolutionary algorithms now surpass human designers |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526146.000-evolutionary-algorithms-now-surpass-human-designers.html |journal=[[New Scientist]] |location=London |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |issue=2614 |pages=26–27 |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine-tuned Universe===
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed to broader teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument based on the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning of universal constants]] that make matter and life possible and which are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These include the values of [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constants]], the relative strength of [[nuclear force]]s, [[electromagnetism]], and [[Gravitation|gravity]] between [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]], as well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and Center for Science and Culture fellow [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, making it impossible for many [[chemical element]]s and features of the [[Universe]], such as [[galaxy|galaxies]], to form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gonzalez 2004|Gonzalez 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, proponents argue, an intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present to achieve that particular outcome.

Scientists have generally responded that these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stenger 2011|Stenger 2011]], p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Susskind 2005|Susskind 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor J. Stenger]] and other critics say both intelligent design and the [[Anthropic principle#Variants|weak form]] of the [[anthropic principle]] are essentially a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]; in his view, these arguments amount to the claim that life is able to exist because the Universe is able to support life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf |title=Is The Universe Fine-Tuned For Us? |last=Stenger |first=Victor J |authorlink=Victor J.

A number of critics also suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite probable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Huchingson 1993|Feinberg &amp; Shapiro 1993]], "A Puddlian Fable", pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent designer===
{{Main|Intelligent designer}}

The contemporary intelligent design movement formulates its arguments in [[secular]] terms and intentionally avoids identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in ''[[The Design Inference]]'' (1998), speculates that an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture could fulfill these requirements. ''Of Pandas and People'' proposes that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science [[Robert T. Pennock]] suggested the [[Raëlian beliefs and practices|Raëlian]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] religion as a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that "make[s] many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 229–229, 233–242&lt;/ref&gt; The authoritative description of intelligent design,&lt;ref name="DI-topquestions" /&gt; however, explicitly states that the ''Universe'' displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the [[paradox]], Dembski concludes that "no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/119 |title=The Act of Creation: Bridging Transcendence and Immanence |last=Dembski |first=William A. |date=August 10, 1998 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle |accessdate=2014-02-28}} "Presented at Millstatt Forum, Strasbourg, France, 10 August 1998."&lt;/ref&gt; The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the Christian God, to the exclusion of all other religions.&lt;ref name="dembski_logos" /&gt;

Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, [[Jerry Coyne]] asks why a designer would "give us a pathway for making [[vitamin C]], but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes" (see [[pseudogene]]) and why a designer would not "stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species". Coyne also points to the fact that "the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different" as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.&lt;ref name="CoyneTNR"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |date=August 22, 2005 |title=The Case Against Intelligent Design: The Faith That Dare Not Speak Its Name |url=http://www.edge.org/conversation/the-case-against-intelligent-design |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in ''Darwin's Black Box'', Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, "...have been placed there by the designer for a reason—for artistic reasons, for variety, to show off, for some as-yet-undetected practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason—or they might not."&lt;ref name="odd_design"&gt;[[#Behe 1996|Behe 1996]], p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, "either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved."&lt;ref name="CoyneTNR" /&gt;

Intelligent design proponents such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]] avoid the [[Argument from poor design|problem of poor design in nature]] by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He says that "Another problem with the argument from imperfection is that it critically depends on a psychoanalysis of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you specifically what those reasons are."&lt;ref name="odd_design" /&gt; This reliance on inexplicable motives of the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. Retired [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] law professor, author and intelligent design advocate [[Phillip E. Johnson]] puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose, giving the example that in his view [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] was created to punish immorality and [[HIV/AIDS denialism|is not caused by HIV]], but such motives cannot be tested by scientific methods.&lt;ref name="Pennock 245"&gt;[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 245–249, 265, 296–300&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent design theory cannot address the identity or origin of the designer—it is a philosophical / religious question that lies outside the domain of scientific inquiry. Christianity postulates the religious answer to this question that the designer is God who by definition is eternally existent and has no origin.

The movement is headquartered in the Center for Science and Culture, established in 1996 as the creationist wing of the [[Discovery Institute]] to promote a religious agenda&lt;ref name=wedge_doc group="n"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf |title=The Wedge |year=1999 |publisher=[[Center for Science and Culture|Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] |location=Seattle |format=PDF |quote=The social consequences of materialism have been devastating. As symptoms, those consequences are certainly worth treating. However, we are convinced that in order to defeat materialism, we must cut it off at its source. That source is ''scientific'' materialism. This is precisely our strategy. If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a 'wedge' that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points. The very beginning of this strategy, the 'thin edge of the wedge,' was Phillip Johnson's critique of Darwinism begun in 1991 in ''Darwinism on Trial'', and continued in ''Reason in the Balance'' and ''Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds''. Michael Behe's highly successful ''Darwin's Black Box'' followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions. |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for broad social, academic and political changes. The [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|Discovery Institute's intelligent design campaigns]] have been staged primarily in the United States, although efforts have been made in other countries to promote intelligent design. Leaders of the movement say intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and of the secular philosophy of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Intelligent design proponents allege that science should not be limited to naturalism and should not demand the adoption of a naturalistic philosophy that dismisses out-of-hand any explanation that includes a [[supernatural]] cause. The overall goal of the movement is to "reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist [[World view|worldview]]" represented by the theory of evolution in favor of "a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions".&lt;ref name=wedge_doc group="n" /&gt;

Phillip E. Johnson stated that the goal of intelligent design is to cast creationism as a scientific concept.&lt;ref name=wedge2 group="n" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PJC group="n"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp |title=How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E |authorlink=Phillip E.

Leading intelligent design proponents have made conflicting statements regarding intelligent design. In statements directed at the general public, they say intelligent design is not religious; when addressing conservative Christian supporters, they state that intelligent design has its foundation in the Bible.&lt;ref name=PJC group="n" /&gt; Recognizing the need for support, the Institute affirms its Christian, evangelistic orientation:

{{quotation|Alongside a focus on influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians.

Barbara Forrest, an expert who has written extensively on the movement, describes this as being due to the Discovery Institute's obfuscating its agenda as a matter of policy. She has written that the movement's "activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pennock 2001|Forrest 2001]], [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm "The Wedge at Work: How Intelligent Design Creationism Is Wedging Its Way into the Cultural and Academic Mainstream"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905230611/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm |date=September 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer are [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestants]]; Michael Behe is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]; and [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]] is a member of the [[Unification Church]].

The [[wedge strategy|strategy]] of deliberately disguising the religious intent of intelligent design has been described by William A. Dembski in ''The Design Inference''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dembski 1998|Dembski 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Dembski lists a [[god]] or an "[[extraterrestrial life|alien life force]]" as two possible options for the identity of the designer; however, in his book ''[[Intelligent Design (book)|Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology]]'' (1999), Dembski states:

{{quotation|Christ is indispensable to any scientific theory, even if its practitioners don't have a clue about him. The pragmatics of a scientific theory can, to be sure, be pursued without recourse to Christ. But the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dembski 1999|Dembski 1999]], p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dembski also stated, "ID is part of God's [[general revelation]] [...] Not only does intelligent design rid us of this ideology {{Square bracket open|1}} [[materialism]] {{Square bracket close|1}}, which suffocates the human spirit, but, in my personal experience, I've found that it opens the path for people to come to Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.02.Reply_to_Henry_Morris.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729035206/http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.02.Reply_to_Henry_Morris.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 29, 2012 |title=Intelligent Design's Contribution to the Debate Over Evolution: A Reply to Henry Morris |last=Dembski |first=William |date=February 1, 2005 |website=DesignInference.com |publisher=William Dembski |location=Pella, Iowa |accessdate=2014-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Johnson and Dembski cite the Bible's [[Gospel of John]] as the foundation of intelligent design.&lt;ref name=dembski_logos/&gt;&lt;ref name=PJC group="n" /&gt;

They involve the supernatural.}} — Barbara Forrest, 2005, testifying in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial.&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that the leading proponents of intelligent design are closely allied with the ultra-conservative [[Christian Reconstructionism]] movement. She lists connections of (current and former) Discovery Institute Fellows Phillip E. Johnson, Charles B. Thaxton, Michael Behe, [[Richard Weikart]], Jonathan Wells and [[Francis J. Beckwith]] to leading Christian Reconstructionist organizations, and the extent of the funding provided the Institute by [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]], a leading figure in the Reconstructionist movement.&lt;ref name="ForrestMay2007Paper" /&gt;

===Reaction from other creationist groups===
Not all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design movement. According to Thomas Dixon, "Religious leaders have come out against ID too. An open letter affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and the teaching of evolution, first produced in response to controversies in Wisconsin in 2004, has now been signed by over ten thousand clergy from different Christian denominations across America. In 2006, the director of the [[Vatican Observatory]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] astronomer [[George Coyne]], condemned ID as a kind of 'crude creationism' which reduced God to a mere engineer."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dixon 2008|Dixon 2008]], p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]] of [[Reasons to Believe]], a proponent of [[Old Earth creationism]], believes that the efforts of intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical Christianity make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002, he wrote: "Winning the argument for design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy origins model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of scientists and other scholars. [...] ...the time is right for a direct approach, a single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based, scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ross |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Ross (creationist) |date=July 2002 |title=More Than Intelligent Design |url=http://www.reasons.org/articles/more-than-intelligent-design |magazine=Facts for Faith |location=Glendora, Calif. |publisher=[[Reasons to Believe]] |issue=10 |oclc=52894856 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, two of the most prominent YEC organizations in the world have attempted to distinguish their views from those of the intelligent design movement. [[Henry M. Morris]] of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, "even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work!

In 2001, the Discovery Institute published advertisements under the heading "[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]", with the claim that listed scientists had signed this statement expressing skepticism:

{{quotation|We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life.

The ambiguous statement did not exclude other known evolutionary mechanisms, and most signatories were not scientists in relevant fields, but starting in 2004 the Institute claimed the increasing number of signatures indicated mounting doubts about evolution among scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2114 |title=Doubts Over Evolution Mount With Over 300 Scientists Expressing Skepticism With Central Tenet of Darwin's Theory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 1, 2004 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement formed a key component of [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|Discovery Institute campaigns]] to present intelligent design as scientifically valid by claiming that evolution lacks broad scientific support,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/doubting-darwinism-creative-license |title=Doubting Darwinism Through Creative License |last=Evans |first=Skip |date=April 8, 2002 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, Calif. |type=Blog |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=February 21, 2006 |title=Few Biologists But Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/sciencespecial2/21peti.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Institute members continued to cite the list through at least 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/16911 |title=A Scientific Analysis of Karl Giberson and Francis Collins' ''The Language of Science and Faith'' |last=Luskin |first=Casey |date=June 1, 2011 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a strategy to counter these claims, scientists organised [[Project Steve]], which gained more signatories named Steve (or variants) than the Institute's petition, and a counter-petition, "[[A Scientific Support for Darwinism]]", which quickly gained similar numbers of signatories.

===Polls===
Several surveys were conducted prior to the December 2005 decision in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover School District'', which sought to determine the level of support for intelligent design among certain groups. According to a 2005 [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris poll]], 10% of adults in the United States viewed human beings as "so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |title=Nearly Two-thirds of U.S. Adults Believe Human Beings Were Created by God |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 6, 2005 |website=The Harris Poll |publisher=[[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] |location=Rochester, N.Y. |id=#52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217080148/http://harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |archivedate=December 17, 2005 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[John Zogby|Zogby polls]] commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls suffer from considerable flaws, such as having a very low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing [[leading question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmsr.org/id-poll.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories says that the Intelligent Design Network (IDNet-NM/Zogby) 'Lab Poll' is BOGUS! |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=New Mexicans for Science and Reason |publisher=NMSR |location=Peralta, N.M. |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polling_for_ID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/polling/ |title=Polling for ID |last=Mooney |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Mooney (journalist) |date=September 11, 2003 |website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |location=Amherst, N.Y. |type=Blog |publisher=Center for Inquiry |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041611/http://csicop.org/doubtandabout/polling/ |archivedate=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.salon.com/0001092/2003/07/30.html |title='Intelligent Design'-ers launch new assault on curriculum using lies and deception |last=Harris |first=David |date=July 30, 2003 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=San Francisco |type=Blog |publisher=Salon Media Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030816135718/http://blogs.salon.com/0001092/2003/07/30.html |archivedate=August 16, 2003 |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] creationism survey found that 38% of adults in the United States hold the view that "God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years" when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which was noted as being at the lowest level in 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx|title=In U.S., Belief in Creationist View of Humans at New Low|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, a series of Gallup polls in the United States from 1982 through 2014 on "Evolution, Creationism, Intelligent Design" found support for "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced formed of life, but God guided the process" of between 31% and 40%, support for "God created human beings in pretty much their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so" varied from 40% to 47%, and support for "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in the process" varied from 9% to 19%.

===Allegations of discrimination against ID proponents===
{{Main|Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed}}

There have been allegations that ID proponents have met discrimination, such as being refused tenure or being harshly criticized on the Internet. In the [[documentary film]] ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', released in 2008, host [[Ben Stein]] presents five such cases. The film contends that the mainstream science establishment, in a "scientific conspiracy to keep God out of the nation's laboratories and classrooms", suppresses academics who believe they see evidence of intelligent design in nature or criticize evidence of evolution.&lt;ref name="Cornelia_Dean"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dean |first=Cornelia |date=September 27, 2007 |title=Scientists Feel Miscast in Film on Life's Origin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/science/27expelled.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp; |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2014-05-14 |ref=Dean 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premise_pressrelease"&gt;{{cite press release |last=Burbridge-Bates |first=Lesley |date=August 14, 2007 |title=What Happened to Freedom of Speech? |url=http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/55281599.html |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Motive Entertainment; Premise Media Corporation |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation into these allegations turned up alternative explanations for perceived persecution.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iastate.edu/~nscentral/news/2007/jun/statement.shtml |title=Statement from Iowa State University President Gregory Geoffroy |last=Geoffroy |first=Gregory |authorlink=Gregory L.

The film portrays intelligent design as motivated by science, rather than religion, though it does not give a detailed definition of the phrase or attempt to explain it on a scientific level.

==Criticism==

===Scientific criticism===
{{Main|Intelligent design and science}}

Advocates of intelligent design seek to keep God and the Bible out of the discussion, and present intelligent design in the language of science as though it were a scientific hypothesis.&lt;ref name="IDstatementOnCreator" group="n" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson-Touchstone" /&gt; For a theory to qualify as scientific,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[#Gauch 2003|Gauch 2003]], Chapters 5–8. Discusses principles of induction, deduction and probability related to the expectation of consistency, testability, and multiple observations. Chapter 8 discusses parsimony (Occam's razor).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elmes, Kantowitz &amp; Roediger 2006|Elmes, Kantowitz &amp; Roediger 2006]]. Chapter 2 discusses the scientific method, including the principles of falsifiability, testability, progressive development of theory, dynamic self-correcting of hypotheses, and parsimony, or "Occam's razor".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kitzruling_pg64" group="n"&gt;{{cite court

|date=December 20, 2005
}} [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 64 of 139|Whether ID Is Science, p. 64]]. The ruling discusses central aspects of expectations in the scientific community that a scientific theory be testable, dynamic, correctible, progressive, based upon multiple observations, and provisional.&lt;/ref&gt; it is expected to be:

*Consistent
*Parsimonious (sparing in its proposed entities or explanations; see [[Occam's razor]])
*Useful (describes and explains observed phenomena, and can be used in a predictive manner)
*Empirically testable and [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] (potentially confirmable or disprovable by experiment or observation)
*Based on multiple observations (often in the form of controlled, repeated experiments)
*Correctable and dynamic (modified in the light of observations that do not support it)
*Progressive (refines previous theories)
*Provisional or tentative (is open to experimental checking, and does not assert certainty)

For any theory, hypothesis or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, and ideally all, of these criteria. The fewer criteria are met, the less scientific it is; and if it meets only a few or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word. Typical objections to defining intelligent design as science are that it lacks consistency,&lt;ref name="Perakh2005b"&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal |last=Perakh |first=Mark |year=2005 |title=The Dream World of William Dembski's Creationism |url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Skeptic_paper.cfm |journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |location=Altadena, Calif. |publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=54–65 |issn=1063-9330 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; violates the principle of parsimony,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;See, e.g., [[#Pennock 2001|Fitelson, Stephens &amp; Sober 2001]], "How Not to Detect Design–Critical Notice: William A.

Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, ''the designer'', intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data, which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ljworld.com/pdf/2005/09/15/nobel_letter.pdf |title=Nobel Laureates Initiative |date=September 9, 2005 |publisher=The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity |type=Letter |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051007161950/http://media.ljworld.com/pdf/2005/09/15/nobel_letter.pdf |archivedate=October 7, 2005 |accessdate=2014-02-28}} The September 2005 statement by 38 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]] stated that: "...intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific; it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/2005/intelligent.html |title=Intelligent Design is not Science: Scientists and teachers speak out |date=October 2005 |website=Faculty of Science |publisher=[[University of New South Wales]] |location=Sydney |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614003243/http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/2005/intelligent.html |archivedate=June 14, 2006 |accessdate=2009-01-09}} The October 2005 statement, by a coalition representing more than 70,000 Australian scientists and science teachers said: "intelligent design is not science" and "urge all Australian governments and educators not to permit the teaching or promulgation of ID as science."&lt;/ref&gt;

Further criticism stems from the fact that the phrase ''intelligent'' design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable intelligence, a concept that has no [[scientific consensus]] definition. The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be observable without specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should be. Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{cite court

"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon [[empirical evidence]] that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments from ignorance===
[[Eugenie Scott|Eugenie C. Scott]], along with [[Glenn Branch]] and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are [[Argument from ignorance|arguments from ignorance]].
In the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that "we don't know yet" is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science. Particularly, Michael Behe's demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a false dichotomy, where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.&lt;ref name="Scott and Branch"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists |title='Intelligent Design' Not Accepted by Most Scientists |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=August 12, 2002

In his conclusion to the Kitzmiller trial, Judge John E. Jones III wrote that "ID is at bottom premised upon a false dichotomy, namely, that to the extent evolutionary theory is discredited, ID is confirmed." This same argument had been put forward to support creation science at the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' (1982) trial, which found it was "contrived dualism", the false premise of a "two model approach". Behe's argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments against evolution but does not make any positive scientific case for intelligent design. It fails to allow for scientific explanations continuing to be found, as has been the case with several examples previously put forward as supposed cases of irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

===Possible theological implications===
Intelligent design proponents often insist that their claims do not require a religious component.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Merriman 2007|Merriman 2007]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=l_8VFygyaDYC&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=intelligent%20design%20science%20can%20test%20religion&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=intelligent%20design%20science%20can%20test%20religion&amp;f=false p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt; However, various philosophical and theological issues are naturally raised by the claims of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=George L. |year=2002 |title=Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/nrcse/IDTHG.html |journal=Covalence: the Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science and Technology |location=Chicago |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Division for Ministry |volume=IV |issue=2 |oclc=52753579 |accessdate=2014-02-28}} Reprinted with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent design proponents attempt to demonstrate scientifically that features such as irreducible complexity and specified complexity could not arise through natural processes, and therefore required repeated direct miraculous interventions by a Designer (often a Christian concept of God). They reject the possibility of a Designer who works merely through setting natural laws in motion at the outset,&lt;ref name="PM 09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Padian |first1=Kevin |authorlink1=Kevin Padian |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Darwin, Dover, 'Intelligent Design' and textbooks |url=http://www.ntskeptics.org/news/4170029.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Biochemical Journal]] |location=London |publisher=[[Portland Press]] |volume=417 |issue=1 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.1042/bj20081534 |issn=0264-6021 |pmid=19061485 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[theistic evolution]] (to which even [[Charles Darwin]] was open&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darwin 1860|Darwin 1860]], p. 484, "... probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator."&lt;/ref&gt;). Intelligent design is distinct because it asserts repeated miraculous interventions in addition to designed laws. This contrasts with other major religious traditions of a created world in which God's interactions and influences do not work in the same way as physical causes. The Roman Catholic tradition makes a careful distinction between ultimate [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanations and secondary, natural causes.&lt;ref name="Haught Witness Report" /&gt;

The concept of direct miraculous intervention raises other potential theological implications. If such a Designer does not intervene to alleviate suffering even though capable of intervening for other reasons, some imply the designer is not [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] (see [[problem of evil]] and related [[theodicy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070614103827/http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-14 |title=Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?

Further, repeated interventions imply that the original design was not perfect and final, and thus pose a problem for any who believe that the Creator's work had been both perfect and final.&lt;ref name="PM 09" /&gt; Intelligent design proponents seek to explain the [[Argument from poor design|problem of poor design in nature]] by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design (for example, proposing that [[Vestigiality|vestigial organs]] have unknown purposes), or by proposing that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can, and may have unknowable motives for their actions.&lt;ref name="Pennock 245" /&gt;

===God of the gaps===
Intelligent design has also been characterized as a [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] argument,&lt;ref name="Stanford--GodoftheGaps"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ratzsch |first=Del |editor-first=Edward N |editor-last=Zalta |editor-link=Edward N.

*There is a gap in scientific knowledge.
*The gap is filled with acts of God (or intelligent designer) and therefore proves the existence of God (or intelligent designer).&lt;ref name="Stanford--GodoftheGaps" /&gt;

A God-of-the-gaps argument is the theological version of an [[argument from ignorance]]. A key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations (often supernatural) that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance: {{cite journal |last=Bube |first=Richard H. |authorlink=Richard H. Bube |date=Fall 1971 |title=Man Come Of Age: Bonhoeffer's Response To The God-Of-The-Gaps |url=http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/14/14-4/14-4-pp203-220_JETS.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]] |location=Louisville, Ky. |publisher=[[Evangelical Theological Society]] |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=203–220 |issn=0360-8808 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of science|Historians of science]] observe that the [[astronomy]] of the earliest [[civilization]]s, although astonishing and incorporating [[mathematics|mathematical construction]]s far in excess of any practical value, proved to be misdirected and of little importance to the development of science because they failed to inquire more carefully into the mechanisms that drove the [[astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ronan 1983|Ronan]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; It was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] that first practiced science, although not yet as a formally defined experimental science, but nevertheless an attempt to rationalize the world of natural experience without recourse to divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ronan 1983|Ronan]], p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; In this historically motivated definition of science any appeal to an intelligent creator is explicitly excluded for the paralysing effect it may have on [[scientific progress]].

==Legal challenges in the United States==

''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' was the first direct challenge brought in the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal courts]] against a public school district that required the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="NCSE 2008-17-10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/intelligent-design-trial-kitzmiller-v-dover |title=Intelligent Design on Trial: Kitzmiller v.

}} Memorandum and Order, July 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was tried in a [[bench trial]] from September 26 to November 4, 2005, before Judge [[John E. Jones III]]. [[Kenneth R. Miller]], Kevin Padian, [[Brian Alters]], [[Robert T. Pennock]], Barbara Forrest and [[John F. Haught]] served as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs. Michael Behe, [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]] and [[Scott Minnich]] served as expert witnesses for the defense.

On December 20, 2005, Judge Jones issued his 139-page [[Question of fact|findings of fact]] and decision, ruling that the Dover mandate was unconstitutional, and barring intelligent design from being taught in Pennsylvania's Middle District public school science classrooms. On November 8, 2005, there had been an election in which the eight Dover school board members who voted for the intelligent design requirement were all defeated by challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class, and the current school board president stated that the board did not intend to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Michael |date=December 21, 2005 |title=Judge Rules Against 'Intelligent Design' |url=http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=5945 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055938/http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=5945 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his finding of facts, Judge Jones made the following condemnation of the "Teach the Controversy" strategy:

{{quotation|Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the ''controversy'', but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a [[Wikt:canard#Noun|canard]]. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

===Reaction to Kitzmiller ruling===
Judge Jones himself anticipated that his ruling would be criticized, saying in his decision that:

{{quotation|Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court.

Rather, this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy. The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial. The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources.&lt;ref name="kitz137"&gt;

As Jones had predicted, [[John G. West]], Associate Director of the Center for Science and Culture, said:

{{quotation|The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the spread of a scientific idea and even to prevent criticism of Darwinian evolution through government-imposed censorship rather than open debate, and it won't work.

Subsequently, the decision has been examined in a search for flaws and conclusions, partly by intelligent design supporters aiming to avoid future defeats in court. In its Winter issue of 2007, the ''Montana Law Review'' published three articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=Winter 2007 |title=Editor's Note: Intelligent Design Articles |url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2036&amp;context=mlr |format=PDF |journal=Montana Law Review |location=Missoula, Mont. |publisher=[[University of Montana School of Law]] |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |issn=0026-9972 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the first, David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey Luskin, all of the Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, the Jones court should not have addressed the question of whether it was a scientific theory, and that the Kitzmiller decision will have no effect at all on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="DeWolf"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeWolf |first1=David K. |last2=West |first2=John G. |authorlink2=John G.

===Anti-evolution legislation===
{{main|Anti-evolution legislation}}
A number of [[anti-evolution]] [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] have been introduced in the [[United States Congress]] and [[State legislature (United States)|State legislatures]] since 2001, based largely upon language drafted by the [[Discovery Institute]] for the [[Santorum Amendment]]. Their aim has been to expose more students to articles and videos produced by advocates of intelligent design that criticise evolution. They have been presented as supporting "[[academic freedom]]", on the supposition that teachers, students, and college professors face intimidation and retaliation when discussing scientific criticisms of evolution, and therefore require protection. Critics of the legislation have pointed out that there are no credible scientific critiques of evolution, and an investigation in [[Florida]] of allegations of intimidation and retaliation found no evidence that it had occurred. The vast majority of the bills have been unsuccessful, with the one exception being Louisiana's [[Louisiana Science Education Act]], which was enacted in 2008.

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, these worldviews as well as others "that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 23, 2010 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, Calif. |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In June 2007, the [[Council of Europe]]'s Committee on Culture, Science and Education issued a report, ''The dangers of creationism in education'', which states "Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes."&lt;ref name="EDOC11297"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11678&amp;Language=EN |title=The dangers of creationism in education |date=June 8, 2007 |work=Committee on Culture, Science and Education |publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] |type=Report |id=Doc. 11297 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309011447/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11678&amp;Language=EN |archive-date=2013-03-09 }}

On October 4, 2007, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools should "resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion", including "intelligent design", which it described as "the latest, more refined version of creationism", "presented in a more subtle way". The resolution emphasises that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight a belief, but to "warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2007/10/council-europe-approves-resolution-against-creationism-001200 |title=Council of Europe approves resolution against creationism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, Calif. |accessdate=2009-11-18}}

It states that "Intelligent design lies wholly outside of science", has no underpinning scientific principles, or explanations, and is not accepted by the science community as a whole. Though it should not be taught as science, "Any questions about creationism and intelligent design which arise in science lessons, for example as a result of media coverage, could provide the opportunity to explain or explore why they are not considered to be scientific theories and, in the right context, why evolution is considered to be a scientific theory."

[[Muzaffar Iqbal]], a notable Pakistani-Canadian Muslim, signed "A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism", a petition from the Discovery Institute.&lt;ref name="ccit"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edis |first=Taner |authorlink=Taner Edis|date=November–December 1999 |title=Cloning Creationism in Turkey |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/19/6/cloning-creationism-turkey |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, Calif. |publisher=National Center for Science Education |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=30–35 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas similar to intelligent design have been considered respected intellectual options among Muslims, and in [[Turkey]] many intelligent design books have been translated. In [[Istanbul]] in 2007, public meetings promoting intelligent design were sponsored by the local government,&lt;ref name="icash"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edis |first=Taner |date=January 2008 |title=Islamic Creationism: A Short History |url=http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2008/NewsletterJanuary2008Creationism.html |work=Newsletter |location=Notre Dame, Ind. |publisher=[[History of Science Society]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716061337/http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2008/NewsletterJanuary2008Creationism.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Berlinski of the Discovery Institute was the keynote speaker at a meeting in May 2007.&lt;ref name="SecurityWatch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Articles/Detail//?id=54183&amp;lng=en |title=Turkey's survival of the fittest |last=Jones |first=Dorian L. |date=March 12, 2008 |work=Security Watch |publisher=[[International Relations and Security Network]] |location=Zurich |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to ISKCON===
In 2011, the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON) [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] published an intelligent design book titled ''Rethinking Darwin: A Vedic Study of Darwinism and Intelligent Design''. The book included contributions from intelligent design advocates William A. Dembski, Jonathan Wells and Michael Behe as well as from Hindu creationists Leif A. Jensen and [[Michael Cremo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jensen 2011|Jensen 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The status of intelligent design in Australia is somewhat similar to that in the UK (see [[Education in Australia]]). In 2005, the Australian [[Department of Education, Science and Training|Minister for Education, Science and Training]], [[Brendan Nelson]], raised the notion of intelligent design being taught in science classes. The public outcry caused the minister to quickly concede that the correct forum for intelligent design, if it were to be taught, is in religion or philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wroe |first=David |date=August 11, 2005 |title='Intelligent design' an option: Nelson |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/08/10/1123353386917.html |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Deborah |date=October 21, 2005 |title=Intelligent design not science: experts |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian chapter of [[Cru (Christian organization)|Campus Crusade for Christ]] distributed a DVD of the Discovery Institute's documentary ''[[Unlocking the Mystery of Life]]'' (2002) to Australian secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kruger |first=Paula |date=August 26, 2005 |title=Brendan Nelson suggests 'intelligent design' could be taught in schools |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2005/s1447202.htm |work=[[PM (ABC Radio)|PM]] |type=Transcript |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Radio National|ABC Radio National]] |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Hawkes|Tim Hawkes]], the head of [[The King's School, Parramatta|The King's School]], one of Australia's leading private schools, supported use of the DVD in the classroom at the discretion of teachers and principals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Green |first=Shane |date=October 28, 2005 |title=School backs intelligent design DVD |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/school-backs-intelligent-design-dvd/2005/10/27/1130400306721.html |newspaper=The Age |location=Sydney |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13018">The '''International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA)''' was incorporated on 30 May 2002 under the laws of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;IANSA was incorporated on [https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04452066 "30 May 2002".] Retrieved 28 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; IANSA was dissolved on 21 February 2015 in a "Creditors voluntary liquidation".&lt;ref&gt;IANSA was dissolved on [https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04452066/insolvency 21 February 2015.] Retrieved 28 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, IANSA still has an active website and it is soliciting money donations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iansa.org/donate "Donate".] Retrieved 28 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

IANSA was opposed to the proliferation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and all ownership of firearms by anyone other than a government agency. IANSA supported efforts to make people safer by reducing demand for such weapons, improving firearms regulation and strengthening controls on arms transfers.

IANSA's Women's Network is the only international network focused on the connections between gender, women's rights, small arms and armed violence.&lt;ref name="IANSA Women's Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=IANSA Women's Network|url=http://www.iansa-women.org|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations Activities==
IANSA was involved in lobbying the 2001 United Nations [[Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms]] which produced an agreed programme of action.&lt;ref&gt;''UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons'', July 2001   accessed at {{cite web |url=http://disarmament.un.org/cab/poa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229055556/http://disarmament.un.org/cab/poa.html |archivedate=2008-12-29 |df= }} September 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A UN Review Conference ended in July 2006 [https://www.un.org/events/smallarms2006/index.html] without further agreement. A subsequent meeting in 2008, agreed a substantive outcome document by a majority vote .[http://disarmament.un.org/cab/bms3/1BMS3Pages/1thirdBMS.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

IANSA, part of the [[Control Arms Campaign]], promotes an international treaty regulating the conventional arms trade. A resolution to begin work on this Arms Trade Treaty was approved by the UN General Assembly in 2006.&lt;ref name='un_oct2006'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=International Arms Trade Treaty Aim of Draft Resolution | date=26 October 2006 | publisher=UN General Assembly Department of Public Information, News and Media Division | url =https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/gadis3335.doc.htm | work =Press Release | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-24 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week before the vote, IANSA coordinated an international day of support for the Brazilian ban, with demonstrations taking place in Britain, Italy, South Africa, and other countries. IANSA urged support of the ban to "reinforce the movement in favor of gun control in other Latin American countries riddled with armed violence, and back the efforts to control private gun ownership at an international level."&lt;ref name=morton-gunning /&gt;

The referendum was defeated by 64% of the voters.&lt;ref name=morton-gunning /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main article|Gun politics in Canada}}
The IANSA network includes Canadian gun control organizations such as the Coalition for Gun Control.&lt;ref name=iansa-northamerica&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iansa.org/about/members/namerica.htm|title= IANSA: Members: North America|date= 2007-06-14|publisher= IANSA|pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907214319/http://www.iansa.org/about/members/namerica.htm|archivedate=2003-09-07|dead-url= yes|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition for Gun Control is composed of various unions and NGOs, including the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the YWCA, Canadian Federation of University Women, Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, the December 6th Foundation, Project Ploughshares, Canadian Labour Congress, Canadian Auto Workers, National Union of Public and General Employees, Big City Mayors, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Cukier and Sidel, 2005 The Global Gun Epidemic.

===Philippines===

The work of IANSA in the Philippines is carried out by the Center for Peace Education-Miriam College&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mc.edu.phc{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pax Christi-Pilipinas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paxchristi.net/about-us/section-symbols/pax-christi-philippines&lt;/ref&gt; Both are part of the Steering Committee of the Philippine Action Network to Control Arms (PHilANCA). CPE and Pax Christi annually commemorate the Global Week of Action against Gun Violence. Awareness-raising initiatives on small arms proliferation and gun violence are done during the GWA. CPE has also led the lobbying for an engendered Arms Trade Treaty. PhilANCA members which also  include Amnesty International-Pilipinas and GZO Peace Institute lobby the government to fulfill its commitment to the UN Program of Action on SALW. PhilANCAhas also strongly lobbied for the adoption of an Arms Trade Treaty.  PhilANCA members have joined government in weapons destruction and have visited weapons storage, among others. CPE regularly gives workshops to teachers and students on disarmament and arms control issues.

===United States of America===
{{Main article|Gun politics in the United States}}
IANSA membership in the United States includes gun control organizations such as the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]], [[Legal Community Against Violence]] and the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]].&lt;ref name=iansa-northamerica /&gt;

The '''Joint State Political Directorate''' (also translated as the '''All-Union State Political Administration''' and '''Unified State Political Directorate''') was the secret police of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1923 to 1934. Its official name was "Joint State Political Directorate under the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the USSR" (Russian: Объединённое государственное политическое управление при СНК СССР)'', Obyedinyonnoye gosudarstvennoye politicheskoye upravleniye pri SNK SSSR'', or '''ОГПУ''' ('''OGPU'''). 

With the formation of the Soviet Union in December 1922, a unified organization was required{{cn|date=April 2017}} to exercise control over [[state security]] throughout the new union. Thus, on November 15, 1923, the Soviet [[State Political Directorate]] left the [[NKVD|Soviet NKVD]] and became the all-union Joint State Political Directorate. [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], chairman of the GPU, became the OGPU's first chief.

Like the GPU before it, the OGPU operated - in theory - with more restraint than the original Bolshevik secret police, the [[Cheka]] of 1917-1922. The OGPU's powers increased greatly in 1926, when the {{ill|Soviet criminal code|ru|Уголовный кодекс РСФСР 1926 года}} was amended to include a[[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code) | section on anti-state terrorism]]. The provisions were vaguely written and very broadly interpreted. Even before then, OGPU had set up tribunals to try the most exceptional cases of [[terrorism]], usually without calling any witnesses.&lt;ref name=Dictators&gt;{{cite book|title= The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|last= Overy|first= Richard|authorlink= Richard Overy|publisher= [[W. W. Norton]]|location= [[London]]|isbn= 0393020304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, the OGPU's ''de facto'' powers grew even greater than those of the Cheka.

The GPU/OGPU achieved perhaps its most spectacular success with the [[Trust Operation]] of 1924–1925. OGPU agents contacted [[White émigré|émigrés]] in western Europe and pretended to represent a large group, known as "the Trust", working to overthrow the communist régime. Exiled Russians gave "the Trust" large sums of money and supplies, as did foreign intelligence agencies. Soviet agents finally succeeded in luring one of the leading anticommunist operators, [[Sidney Reilly]], into Russia to meet with the Trust. Once in the Soviet Union (September 1925), he was captured and killed. The Trust was then dissolved, having become a huge propaganda success.

From 1927 to 1929 the OGPU engaged in intensive investigations of an opposition coup. Stalin issued a public decree that any and all opposition views should be considered dangerous and gave the GPU the authority to seek out hostile elements. That led in March 1928 to the [[Shakhty Trial]], which saw the prosecution of a group of supposed industrial saboteurs allegedly involved in a hostile conspiracy. That would be the first of many trials during Stalin's rule.   

The OGPU planned and set up the [[Gulag]] system. It also became the Soviet government's arm for the persecution of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholics]], the [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Catholics]], [[Islam]] and other religious organizations, in an operation headed by [[Yevgeny Tuchkov]]. The OGPU was also the principal secret-police agency responsible for the detection, arrest, and liquidation of anarchists and other dissident left-wing factions in the early Soviet Union.

GPU brigades led Soviet forces in the 1934 [[Soviet invasion of Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;

The OGPU was reincorporated into the newly created all-union People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs ([[NKVD]]) in July 1934, becoming its [[Main Directorate of State Security]] (GUGB). It subsequently became the more widely known Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]).

"'''Just watch me'''" is a phrase made famous by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] on October 13, 1970, during the [[October Crisis]].  The term is still regularly used in Canadian political discussion.

Trudeau, who had in previous years been a strong proponent of civil liberties, spoke of the need for drastic action to restore order in [[Quebec]].  When questioned by [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] reporter [[Tim Ralfe]] on how far he would go in the suspension of civil liberties to maintain order, Trudeau replied "Well, just watch me."

Three days later, he invoked the [[War Measures Act]], which led to police action against many Quebec dissidents and great public controversy.

''[[Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the '70s Generation]]'' is the title of a 1999 documentary by [[Catherine Annau]]. The phrase has also been the title of several biographies of Trudeau, e.g., [[Larry Zolf|Larry Zolf's]] ''Just Watch Me: Remembering Pierre Trudeau'' (1984); Ron Coleman's ''Just Watch Me: Trudeau's Tragic Legacy'' (2003); and the 2nd volume of [[John English (Canadian politician)|John English]]'s biography, ''Just Watch Me: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 1968–2000'' (2009).

In March 2013, Trudeau's son [[Justin Trudeau|Justin]], while running for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] leadership, made a rare gesture of evoking his father's memory during his campaign by repeating this phrase.  It was in answer to a fellow airplane passenger's question in a handwritten note, asking Justin if he could beat Conservative Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]].  The comment sparked a frenzy on Twitter, as well as mixed reaction from several commentators, some of whom saw the quote as a politically sensitive and risky one in Quebec.{{Ref|yahoo20130320}} Two years later, Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada, beating Harper in federal election by a significant margin. Justin Trudeau is the first leader of a major political party in Canada to move from a party "third-place" in seats to a majority government.

== Excerpt from interview ==
The following is a partial transcript of the impromptu interview between Tim Ralfe of the CBC and Trudeau. {{Ref|cbc19701013}}

:'''Tim Ralfe''': ''…what you're talking about to me is choices, and my choice is to live in a society that is free and democratic, which means that you don't have people with guns running around in it.''

:'''Pierre Trudeau''': ''Correct.''

:'''Ralfe''': ''And one of the things I have to give up for that choice is the fact that people like you may be kidnapped.''

:'''Trudeau''': ''Sure, but this isn't my choice, obviously. You know, I think it is more important to get rid of those who are committing violence against the total society and those who are trying to run the government through a parallel power by establishing their authority by kidnapping and blackmail. And I think it is our duty as a government to protect government officials and important people in our society against being used as tools in this blackmail. Now, you don't agree to this but I am sure that once again with hindsight, you would probably have found it preferable if Mr. Cross and Mr. Laporte had been protected from kidnapping, which they weren't because these steps we're taking now weren't taken. But even with your hindsight I don't see how you can deny that.''

:'''Ralfe''': ''No, I still go back to the choice that you have to make in the kind of society that you live in.''

:'''Trudeau''':  ''Yes, well there are a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don't like to see people with helmets and guns. All I can say is, go on and bleed, but it is more important to keep law and order in this society than to be worried about weak-kneed people who don't like the looks of a soldier's helmet.''

:'''Ralfe''': ''At any cost? How far would you go with that? How far would you extend that?''

:'''Trudeau''': ''Well, '''just watch me'''.''

:'''Ralfe''': ''At reducing civil liberties? To that extent?''

:'''Trudeau''': ''To what extent?''

:'''Ralfe''': ''Well, if you extend this and you say, ok, you're going to do anything to protect them, does this include wire-tapping, reducing other civil liberties in some way?''

:'''Trudeau''': ''Yes, I think the society must take every means at its disposal to defend itself against the emergence of a parallel power which defies the elected power in this country and I think that goes to any distance. So long as there is a power in here which is challenging the elected representative of the people I think that power must be stopped and I think it's only, I repeat, weak-kneed bleeding hearts who are afraid to take these measures.''

The '''KGB''', an [[initialism]] for '''Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti''' ({{lang-rus|Комите́т госуда́рственной безопа́сности (КГБ)|a=ru-KGB.ogg|p=kəmʲɪˈtʲet ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪnːəj bʲɪzɐˈpasnəsʲtʲɪ}}), [[translate]]d in [[English language|English]] as '''Committee for State Security''', was the main [[security agency]] for the [[Soviet Union]] from 1954 until its break-up in 1991. As a direct successor of such preceding agencies as [[Cheka]], [[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]], [[NKVD]] and [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]], the committee was attached to the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]]. It was the chief government agency of "union-republican jurisdiction", acting as [[security agency|internal security]], [[Intelligence agency|intelligence]] and [[secret police]]. Similar agencies were constituted in each of the [[republics of the Soviet Union]] aside from [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], and consisted of many ministries, state committees and state commissions.

The agency was a [[military service]] governed by army laws and regulations, in the same fashion as the [[Soviet Army]] or [[MVD]] [[Internal Troops]]. While most of the KGB archives remain classified, two online documentary sources are available.&lt;ref name="Y"&gt;{{cite web|editor-first1=Joshua|editor-last1=Rubenstein|editor-first2=Alexander|editor-last2=Gribanov|url=http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/sakharov_list.htm|title=The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov|publisher=Yale University, Annals of Communism|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521130856/http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/sakharov_list.htm|archivedate=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html JHU.edu], archive of documents about [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and KGB, collected by [[Vladimir Bukovsky]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its main functions were foreign intelligence, counter-intelligence, operative-investigatory activities, guarding the State Border of the USSR, guarding the leadership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and the Soviet Government, organization and ensuring of government communications as well as combating nationalism, dissent, and anti-Soviet activities.

In 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the KGB was split into the [[Federal Security Service]] and the [[Foreign Intelligence Service]] of the [[Russian Federation]].

After breaking away from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the early 1990s with Russian help, the [[self-proclaimed]] [[Republic of South Ossetia]] established its own KGB (keeping this unreformed name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/5060|author=Konstantin Preobrazhensky|title=KGB Backyard in the Caucasus|publisher=|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's current head of state, [[Vladimir Putin]], worked at the KGB in [[St Petersburg|Leningrad]].

==Mode of operation==
[[File:KGB first law.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[ukase]] establishing the KGB]]

A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article in 1983 reported that the KGB was the world's most effective information-gathering organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953701-6,00.html|author=John Kohan|title= Eyes of the Kremlin|date=14 February 1983|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operated [[Resident spy|legal and illegal espionage residencies]] in target countries where a ''legal resident'' gathered intelligence while based at the Soviet embassy or consulate, and, if caught, was protected from prosecution by [[diplomatic immunity]]. At best, the compromised spy was either returned to the Soviet Union or was declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' and expelled by the government of the target country. The ''illegal resident'' spied, unprotected by diplomatic immunity, and worked independently of Soviet diplomatic and trade missions, (''cf.'' the [[non-official cover]] CIA officer). In its early history, the KGB valued illegal spies more than legal spies, because illegal spies infiltrated their targets with greater ease. The KGB residency executed four types of espionage: (i) political, (ii) economic, (iii) military-strategic, and (iv) [[disinformation]], effected with "active measures" (PR Line), [[counter-intelligence]] and security (KR Line), and scientific–technological intelligence (X Line); quotidian duties included [[Signal intelligence|SIGINT]] (RP Line) and illegal support (N Line).&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The KGB classified its spies as ''agents'' (intelligence providers) and ''controllers'' (intelligence relayers). The false-identity or ''legend'' assumed by a USSR-born illegal spy was elaborate, using the life of either a "live double" (participant to the fabrications) or a "dead double" (whose identity is tailored to the spy). The agent then substantiated his or her ''legend'' by living it in a foreign country, before emigrating to the target country, thus the sending of US-bound illegal residents via the Soviet embassy in [[Embassy of Russia in Ottawa|Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. [[Tradecraft]] included stealing and photographing documents, code-names, contacts, targets, and [[Dead drop|dead letter boxes]], and working as a "friend of the cause" or as ''[[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]'', who would infiltrate the target group to sow dissension, influence policy, and arrange [[kidnap]]pings and [[assassination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol19no3/html/v19i3a01p_0001.htm|title=Soviet Use of Assassination and Kidnapping|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mindful of ambitious spy chiefs—and after deposing Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]—Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and the CPSU knew to manage the next over-ambitious KGB Chairman, [[Aleksandr Shelepin]] (1958–61), who facilitated Brezhnev's palace ''coup d'état'' against Khrushchev in 1964 (despite Shelepin not then being in the KGB). With political reassignments, Shelepin protégé [[Vladimir Semichastny]] (1961–67) was sacked as KGB Chairman, and Shelepin himself was demoted from chairman of the Committee of Party and State Control to Trade Union Council chairman.

In the 1980s, the [[glasnost]] liberalisation of Soviet society provoked KGB Chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] (1988–91) to lead the August [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] to depose President Mikhail Gorbachev. The thwarted ''coup d'état'' ended the KGB on 6 November 1991. The KGB's main successors are the FSB ([[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation]]) and the SVR ([[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]]).

==In the US==

===Between the World Wars===
The [[GRU]] (military intelligence) recruited the ideological agent [[Julian Wadleigh]], who became a State Department diplomat in 1936. The [[NKVD]]'s first US operation was establishing the legal residency of [[Boris Bazarov]] and the illegal residency of [[Iskhak Akhmerov]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout, the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) and its General Secretary [[Earl Browder]], helped NKVD recruit Americans, working in government, business, and industry.

Other important, low-level and high-level ideological agents were the diplomats [[Laurence Duggan]] and [[Michael Whitney Straight]] in the State Department, the statistician [[Harry Dexter White]] in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], the economist [[Lauchlin Currie]] (an FDR advisor), and the "Silvermaster Group", headed by statistician [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster|Greg Silvermaster]], in the Farm Security Administration and the Board of Economic Warfare.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) pp. 104–5&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, when [[Whittaker Chambers]], formerly Alger Hiss's courier, approached the Roosevelt Government—to identify the Soviet spies Duggan, White, and others—he was ignored. Hence, during the [[Second World War]] (1939–45)—at the [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] (1943), [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] (1945), and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] (1945) conferences—Big Three Ally Joseph Stalin of the USSR, was better informed about the war affairs of his US and UK allies than they were about his.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet espionage was at its most successful in collecting scientific and technological intelligence about advances in [[Jet engine|jet propulsion]], [[radar]] and [[encryption]], which impressed Moscow, but stealing atomic secrets was the capstone of NKVD espionage against Anglo–American science and technology. To wit, British [[Manhattan Project]] team physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]] (GRU 1941) was the main agent of the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] spy ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5948490/the-strange-story-of-klaus-fuchs-the-red-spy-in-the-manhattan-project|title=The Strange Story of Klaus Fuchs, the Red Spy in the Manhattan Project|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the New York City residency infiltrated top secret [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico by recruiting [[Theodore Hall]], a 19-year-old Harvard physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/venona/inte_19441112.html|title=The November 12, 1944 cable: Theodore Alvin Hall and Saville Sax|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/16/guardianobituaries.haroldjackson|author=Harold Jackson|title=US scientist-spy who escaped prosecution and spent 30 years in biological research at Cambridge|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 November 1999|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the Cold War===
The KGB failed to rebuild most of its US illegal resident networks. The aftermath of the Second [[Red Scare#'Second Red Scare' (1947–1957)|Red Scare]] (1947–57) and the crisis in the CPUSA hampered recruitment. The last major illegal resident, [[Rudolf Abel]] (Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher/"Willie" Vilyam Fisher), was betrayed by his assistant, [[Reino Häyhänen]], in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/hollow-nickel|title=Rudolph Ivanovich Abel (Hollow Nickel Case)|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]|accessdate=19 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126054223/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/hollow-nickel|archivedate=26 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruitment then emphasised mercenary agents, an approach especially successful{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}{{Quantify|date=April 2010}} in scientific and technical espionage, since private industry practised lax internal security, unlike the US Government. One notable KGB success occurred in 1967,with the walk-in recruitment of [[US Navy]] [[Chief warrant officer|Chief Warrant Officer]] [[John Anthony Walker]]. Over eighteen years, Walker enabled Soviet Intelligence to decipher some one million US Navy messages, and track the US Navy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late Cold War, the KGB was successful with intelligence coups in the cases of the mercenary walk-in recruits FBI [[counter-espionage|counterspy]] [[Robert Hanssen]] (1979–2001) and CIA Soviet Division officer [[Aldrich Ames]] (1985–1994).&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Soviet Bloc==
It was Cold War policy for the KGB of the Soviet Union and the secret services of the [[satellite state]]s to extensively monitor public and private opinion, internal subversion and possible revolutionary plots in the [[Soviet Bloc]]. In supporting those Communist governments, the KGB was instrumental in crushing the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], and the [[Prague Spring]] of "[[socialism with a human face|Socialism with a Human Face]]", in 1968 Czechoslovakia.

During the Hungarian revolt, KGB chairman [[Ivan Serov]] personally supervised the post-invasion "normalization" of the country. In consequence, KGB monitored the satellite state populations for occurrences of "harmful attitudes" and "hostile acts;" yet, stopping the Prague Spring, deposing a nationalist Communist government, was its greatest achievement.

The KGB prepared the Red Army's route by infiltrating to [[Czechoslovakia]] many illegal residents disguised as Western tourists. They were to gain the trust of and spy upon the most outspoken proponents of [[Alexander Dubček]]'s new government. They were to plant subversive evidence, justifying the USSR's invasion, that right-wing groups—aided by Western intelligence agencies—were going to depose the Communist government of Czechoslovakia. Finally, the KGB prepared [[hardline]], pro-USSR members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (CPC), such as [[Alois Indra]] and [[Vasiľ Škultéty]], to assume power after the Red Army's invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rYFbo5FsnnAC&amp;pg=PA346 |author=Julius Jacobson|title=Soviet Communism and the Socialist Vision|year=1972|publisher=New Politics Publishing|isbn=978-0-87855-005-0|place=[[United States]]|pages=339–352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KGB's Czech success in the 1960s was matched with the failed suppression of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] labour movement in 1980s Poland. The KGB had forecast political instability consequent to the election of Archbishop of Kraków [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyla]] as the first Polish Pope, John Paul II, whom they had categorised as "subversive" because of his anti-Communist sermons against the one-party PUWP régime. Despite its accurate forecast of crisis, the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PUWP) hindered the KGB's destroying the nascent Solidarity-backed political movement, fearing explosive civil violence if they imposed the KGB-recommended martial law. Aided by their Polish counterpart, the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] (SB), the KGB successfully infiltrated spies to Solidarity and the Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/8831691/Polish-secret-police-how-and-why-the-Poles-spied-on-their-own-people.html|author=Matthew Day|title=Polish secret police: how and why the Poles spied on their own people|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Operation X]] co-ordinated the [[Martial law in Poland|declaration of martial law]] with Gen. [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] and the Polish Communist Party;&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Andrew (historian)|last2=Mitrokhin|first2=Vasili|authorlink2=Vasili Mitrokhin|title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TWUAQ7Xof8C&amp;pg=PA531|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00312-9|page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the vacillating, conciliatory Polish approach blunted KGB effectiveness—and Solidarity then fatally weakened the Communist Polish government in 1989.

==Suppressing internal dissent==
[[File:KGB Vilnius.JPG|thumb|Monument to victims of KGB / NKVD operations in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]]]

During the Cold War, the KGB actively sought to combat "ideological subversion" – [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] political and religious ideas and the [[Soviet dissidents|dissidents]] who promoted them – which was generally dealt with as a matter of national security in discouraging influence of hostile foreign powers. After denouncing [[Stalinism]] in his secret speech [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]] in 1956, head of state [[Nikita Khrushchev]] lessened suppression of "ideological subversion". As a result, critical literature re-emerged, including the novel ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' (1962), by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], who was code-named PAUK ("spider") by the KGB. After Khrushchev's deposition in 1964, Leonid Brezhnev reverted the State and KGB to actively harsh suppression; house searches to seize documents and the continual monitoring of dissidents became routine again. To wit, in 1965, such a search-and-seizure operation yielded Solzhenitsyn manuscripts of "slanderous fabrications", and the subversion trial of the novelists [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] and [[Yuli Daniel]]; Sinyavsky (alias "Abram Tertz"), and Daniel (alias "Nikolai Arzhak"), were captured after a Moscow literary-world [[informant]] told KGB when to find them at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OfgJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA1971 |author=Thomas Crump|title=Brezhnev and the Decline of the Soviet Union |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2014|pages=1971–1972|isbn=978-0-415-69073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the campaign of this suppression increased under new KGB Chairman [[Yuri Andropov]]. After suppressing the Prague Spring, KGB Chairman Andropov established the Fifth Directorate to monitor dissension and eliminate dissenters. He was especially concerned with [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]], "Public Enemy Number One".&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Andropov failed to expel Solzhenitsyn before 1974; but did internally exile Sakharov to [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] in 1980. The KGB failed to prevent Sakharov's collecting his [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1975, but did prevent [[Yuri Feodorovich Orlov|Yuri Orlov]] collecting his Nobel Prize in 1978; Chairman Andropov supervised both operations.

KGB dissident-group infiltration featured ''agents provocateur'' pretending "sympathy to the cause", [[smear campaign]]s against prominent dissidents, and [[show trial]]s; once imprisoned, the dissident endured KGB interrogators ''and'' sympathetic informant cell-mates. In the event, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[glasnost]] policies lessened persecution of dissidents; he was effecting some of the policy changes they had been demanding since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield'' (1999) p. 561&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable operations==
*With the [[Trust Operation]] (1921–1926), the OGPU successfully deceived some leaders of the right-wing, counter-revolutionary [[White movement|White Guards]] back to the USSR for execution.
*NKVD infiltrated and destroyed Trotskyist groups; in 1940, the [[Spain|Spanish]] agent [[Ramón Mercader]] assassinated [[Leon Trotsky]] in Mexico City.
*KGB favoured [[active measures]] (e.g. [[disinformation]]), in discrediting the USSR's enemies.
*For war-time, KGB had ready [[sabotage]] operations arms caches in target countries.
According to declassified documents, the KGB aggressively recruited former Nazi intelligence officers after the war.&lt;ref name=NYT7Jul2006&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/world/americas/07nazi.html|title=C.I.A. Knew Where Eichmann Was Hiding, Documents Show|work=The New York Times|date=7 June 2006|first1=Scott|last1=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The KGB used them to penetrate the [[Gehlen Organization|West German intelligence service]].&lt;ref name=NYT7Jul2006/&gt;

In the 1960s, acting upon the information of KGB defector [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], the CIA counter-intelligence chief [[James Jesus Angleton]] believed KGB had [[mole (espionage)|moles]] in two key places—the counter-intelligence section of CIA and the FBI's counter-intelligence department—through whom they would know of, and control, US counter-espionage to protect the moles and hamper the detection and capture of other Communist spies. Moreover, KGB counter-intelligence vetted foreign intelligence sources, so that the moles might "officially" approve an anti-CIA [[double agent]] as trustworthy. In retrospect, the captures of the moles [[Aldrich Ames]] and [[Robert Hanssen]] proved that Angleton, though ignored as over-aggressive, was correct, despite the fact that it cost him his job at CIA, which he left in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In the mid-1970s, the KGB tried to secretly buy three banks in northern California to gain access to high-technology secrets. Their efforts were thwarted by the CIA. The banks were Peninsula National Bank in Burlingame, the First National Bank of Fresno, and the Tahoe National Bank in South Lake Tahoe. These banks had made numerous loans to advanced technology companies and had many of their officers and directors as clients. The KGB used the [[Moscow Narodny Bank Limited]] to finance the acquisition, and an intermediary, Singaporean businessman [[Amos Dawe]], as the frontman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians sought U.S. banks to gain high-tech secrets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/us/russians-sought-us-banks-to-gain-high-tech-secrets.html |publisher=The New York Times|first=Martin|last=Tolchin |date=16 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
On 2 February 1973, the [[Politburo]], which was led by Yuri Andropov at the time, demanded that KGB members influence [[Bangladesh]] (which was then newly formed) where [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was scheduled to win parliamentary elections. During that time, the Soviet secret service tried very hard to ensure support for his party and his allies and even predicted an easy victory for him. In June 1975, Mujib formed a new party called ''[[BAKSAL]]'' and created a one-party state. Three years later, the KGB in that region increased from 90 to 200, and by 1979 printed more than 100 newspaper articles. In these articles, the KGB officials accused [[Ziaur Rahman]], popularly known as "Zia", and his regime of having ties with the United States.&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher M.|authorlink1=Christopher Andrew (historian)|last2=Mitrokhin|first2=Vasili|authorlink2=Vasili Mitrokhin|title=The World was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eSR1rHg5_YC&amp;pg=PA350|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00311-2|pages=350–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1979, the KGB accused some officers who were arrested in [[Dhaka]] in an overthrow attempt, and by October, Andropov approved the fabrication of a letter in which he stated that [[Muhammad Ghulam Tawab]], an Air Vice-Marshal at the time, was the main plotter,  which led the Bangladesh, [[India]]n and [[Sri Lanka]]n press to believe that he was an American spy. Under Andropov's command, [[Service A]], a KGB division, falsified the information in a letter to [[Moudud Ahmed]] in which it said that he was supported by the American government and by 1981 even sent a letter accusing the [[Reagan administration]] of plotting to overthrow President Zia and his regime. The letter also mentioned that after Mujib was assassinated the United States contacted [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]] to replace him as a short-term President. When the election happened in the end of 1979, the KGB made sure that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party would win. The party received 207 out of 300 seats, but the Zia regime did not last long, falling on 29 May 1981 when after numerous escapes, Zia was assassinated in [[Chittagong]].&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2005"/&gt;{{better source|date=December 2015}}

===Afghanistan===
[[File:KGB special operative Igor Morozov on the armored vehicle.jpg|thumb|KGB special operative Igor Morozov sits on top of the [[BTR-80]] armoured vehicle during his assignment to the [[Badakhshan province]], {{c.|1982}}]]
The KGB started infiltrating Afghanistan as early as 27 April 1978. During that time, the Afghan Communist Party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFasqHGo3p0C&amp;pg=PA19 |author-link=Diego Cordovez |first=Diego |last=Cordovez |title=Out of Afghanistan: The Inside Story of the Soviet Withdrawal |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1995 |page=19 |isbn=978-0-19-506294-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was planning the overthrow of the imperially appointed [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]. Under the leadership of Major General [[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]] and Muhammad Rafi{{spnd}}[[code name]]d Mammad and Niruz respectively{{spnd}}the Soviet secret service learned of the imminent uprising. Two days after, the uprising, [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], leader of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]], issued a notice of concern to the Soviet ambassador [[Alexander Puzanov]] and the resident of [[Kabul]]-based KGB embassy [[Viliov Osadchy]] that they could have staged a coup three days earlier hence the warning. On that, both Puzanov and Osadchy dismissed Taraki's complaint and reported it to [[Moscow]], which broke a 30-year contract with him soon after.&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kgbafghanistan&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/WP40-english.pdf |first=Vasiliy |last=Mitrokhin |author-link=Vasili Mitrokhin |first2=Odd Arne |last2=Westad |author2-link=Odd Arne Westad |editor-first=Christian F. |editor-last=Ostermann |title=The KGB in Afghanistan |series=Working Paper (Cold War International History Project |number=40 |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |accessdate=28 January 2014 |oclc=843924202 |format=PDF |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228001834/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/WP40-english.pdf |archive-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre then realized that it was better for them to deal with a more competent agent, which at the time was [[Babrak Karmal]], who later accused Nur Muhammad Taraki of taking bribes and even having secretly contacted the United States embassy in Kabul. On that, the centre again refused to listen and instructed him to take resident position in the Kabul residency by 1974. On 30 April 1978, Taraki, despite being cut off from any support, led the coup which later became known as [[April Revolution]], and became the country's President, along with [[Hafizullah Amin]] being Deputy-Prime Minister and Vice-President. On 5 December of that same year, Taraki compared the April Revolt to the [[Russian Revolution]], which struck [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], the FCD chief of that time.&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kgbafghanistan/&gt;

On 27 March 1979, after losing the city of [[Herat]], Amin became the next Prime Minister, and by 27 July became Minister of Defence as well. The centre though was concerned of his powers since the same month he issued them a complaint about lack of funds and demanded US$400,000,000. Furthermore, it was discovered that Amin had a master's degree from [[Columbia University]], and that he preferred to communicate in English instead of Russian. Unfortunately for Moscow's intelligence services, Amin succeeded Taraki and by 16 September [[Radio Kabul]] announced that the PDPA received a fake request from Taraki concerning health issues among the party members. On that, the centre accused him of "terrorist" activities and expelled him from the [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kgbafghanistan/&gt;

The following day General [[Boris Ivanov]], who was behind the mission in Kabul along with General [[Lev Gorelov]] and Deputy Defense Minister [[Ivan Pavlovsky]], visited Amin to congratulate him on his election to power. On the same day the KGB decided to imprison Sayed Gulabzoy as well as [[Muhammad Watanjar]] and [[Asadullah Sarwari]] but while in captivity and under an investigation all three denied the allegation that the current Minister of Defence was an American secret agent. The denial of claims was passed on to [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]], who as the main chiefs of the KGB proposed operation [[Raduga (operation)|Raduga]] to save the life of Gulabzoy and Watanjar and send them to [[Tashkent]] from [[Bagram airbase]] by giving them fake passports. With that and a sealed container in which an almost breathless Sarwari was laying, they came to Tashkent on 19 September.&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kgbafghanistan/&gt;

During the continued investigation in Tashkent, the three were put under surveillance in one of the rooms for as long as four weeks where they were investigated for the reliability of their claims by the KGB. Soon after, they were satisfied with the results and sent them to [[Bulgaria]] for a secret retreat. On 9 October, the Soviet secret service had a meeting in which Bogdanov, Gorelov, Pavlonsky and Puzanov were the main chiefs who were discussing what to do with Amin who was very harsh at the meeting. After the two-hour meeting they began to worry that Amin will establish an [[Islamic Republic]] in Afghanistan and decided to seek a way to put Karmal back in. They brought him and three other ministers secretly to Moscow during which time they discussed how to put him back in power. The decision was to fly him back to Bagram airbase by 13 December. Four days later, Amin's nephew, [[Asadullah Amin|Asadullah]], was taken to Moscow by the KGB for acute food poisoning treatment.&lt;ref name="AndrewMitrokhin2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kgbafghanistan/&gt;

On 19 November 1979, the KGB had a meeting on which they discussed '''Operation Cascade''', which was launched earlier that year. The operation carried out bombings with the help of [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] and [[First Chief Directorate|FCD]].&lt;ref name=kgbafghanistan/&gt; On 27 December, the centre received news of the [[Darul Aman Palace]], that KGB Special Forces Alpha and Zenith Group, supported by the 154th OSN GRU, also known as ''Muslim battalion'' and paratroopers from the 345th Guards Airborne Regiment stormed the [[Tajbeg Palace]] in [[Afghanistan]] and killed Afghan President [[Hafizullah Amin]] and his 100–150 personal guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCauley |first=Martin |title=Russia, America and the Cold War: 1949–1991 |year=2008 |edition=Revised 2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0V-Oxmy9FQC&amp;pg=PA142 |location=Harlow, UK |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-1-4058-7430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 11-year-old son died due to shrapnel wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8428701.stm |title=How Soviet troops stormed Kabul palace |date=27 December 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets installed [[Babrak Karmal]] as Amin's successor. Several other government buildings were seized during the operation, including the [[Ministry of Interior]] building, the Internal Security ([[KHAD]]) building, and the General Staff building ([[Darul Aman Palace]]). Out of the 54 KGB operators that assaulted the palace, 5 were killed in action, including Colonel [[Grigori Boyarinov]], and 32 were wounded. [[Alpha Group]] [[veteran]]s call this operation one of the most successful in the group's history. In June 1981, there were 370 members in the Afghan-controlled KGB intelligence service throughout the nation which were under the command of [[Ahmad Shah Paiya]] and had received all the training they need in the Soviet Union. By May 1982 the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] was set up in Afghanistan under the command of [[KHAD]]. In 1983 [[Boris Voskoboynikov]] became the next head of the KGB while [[Leonid Kostromin]] became his Deputy Minister.&lt;ref name=kgbafghanistan/&gt;

==August 1991 coup==
{{main|1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt}}
On 18 August 1991, Chairman of the KGB [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], along with seven other Soviet leaders, formed the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency]] and attempted to [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|overthrow the government of the Soviet Union]]. The purpose of the attempted coup d'état was to preserve the integrity of the Soviet Union and the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|constitutional]] order. President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was arrested and ineffective attempts were made to seize power. Within two days, the attempted coup collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Victor Sebestyen |title=The K.G.B.'s Bathhouse Plot |date=20 August 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/opinion/sunday/the-soviet-coup-that-failed.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[International New York Times]] |page=SR4 |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}

To '''kiss hands''' is a [[constitution]]al term used in the [[United Kingdom]] to refer to the formal installation of [[The Crown|Crown]]-appointed British [[government minister]]s to their office.

==Overview==
In the past, it referred to the requirement that the office-holder actually [[kiss]] the hands of the [[monarch|Sovereign]] as a symbol of personal [[fealty]] and [[loyalty]] to the Sovereign, that fealty and loyalty being a requirement to serve in the King's or Queen's government.
 
In modern times, office-holders are not expected physically to kiss the hands of the Sovereign before assuming the role.  Simply being received by the Queen is taken to validate the selection, with this meeting being described in the [[Court Circular]] as "kissing hands". The invitation issued to a party leader to form a government is sometimes still described as "an invitation to kiss hands". The metaphorical kissing of hands (i.e. the appointment) does not legally take place until the subsequent meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], when the new minister is formally appointed as a member of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx |title=The Official Website of the British Monarchy |work=royal.gov.uk |accessdate=September 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023100/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx |archivedate=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When appointing a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] (the top rank in the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government]]), the protocol also involves the delivery by the Sovereign of the seals of office into the hands of the appointee. This is also valid for other officers who are keepers of seals, such as the [[Lord Privy Seal]] or the [[Lord Chancellor]], who is also keeper of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] of the United Kingdom.

Ordinarily the ceremony will take place in [[Buckingham Palace]], but it has been known to happen in [[Windsor Castle]] or [[Balmoral Castle]]. More unusually, when [[H. H. Asquith]] took the premiership after the ailing [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]'s resignation in April 1908, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] controversially summoned Asquith to  [[Biarritz]], France, where he was on holiday at the time.

}}

The '''Ksar Hellal Congress''' was the first and founding [[congress]] of the [[Neo Destour]] party. The 1934 Neo Destour Congress was organized by the secessionist members of the [[Destour]] party, in [[Ksar Hellal]], on March 2, 1934. It ended, that very night, with the creation of a new [[Political parties in tunisia|political party]].

Upon the weakening of the Destour, that adopted a "shy" policy towards the Residence, the colonial French administration in Tunisia, a new generation of provincial thirties, with a European education and a close relationship with the French socialists, emerged. Mainly compounded of [[Habib Bourguiba]], [[Mahmoud El Materi]], [[Bahri Guiga]], [[Tahar Sfar]] and M'hamed Bourguiba, it acquired a huge popularity thanks to its bold articles in newspapers, such as ''[[L'Action Tunisienne]]''. However, the differences they had with the elders of the party led them to resign from the executive committee, the party's leadership, following the [[Tunisian naturalization issue]].

The congress was held on March 2, 1934 to discuss the continuity of this youth's activism which ended with the founding of their own new political party, the Neo Destour, starting, thanks to its new methods, the renewel of the [[Tunisian nationalism]] and its [[Tunisian national movement|movement]].

== Historical context ==

There were numerous reasons leading to the birth of the Neo Destour: The [[Great Depression]] and its impact in Tunisia, in the early 1930s, the reactions denouncing the international [[eucharistic congress]] of [[Carthage]], held to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the [[French colonization of Algeria]], the [[Tunisian naturalization issue]] but mainly the policy and behavior adopted by the [[Destour]] towards these events. Indeed, the party activism decreased in the midst of the 1920s, precisely on January 29, 1926, when "scoundrel decrees" were enacted by the Residence, the French colonial administration. In result, the first exclusively Tunisian labour union, the General Confederation of Tunisian Workers (GCTW), founded by Mohamed Ali El Hammi, was dissolved. Furthermore, nationalist newspapers such as ''Ifriqiya'', ''Al-Asr'', ''Al Jadid'' and ''Le Libéral'' were prohibited.{{sfn|Boularès|2012|p=546}} The party soon bursted in pieces with the departure of Hassen Guellaty and Mohamed Noomane, who founded the Reformist Destourian Party, but also Farhat Ben Ayed, who created the Independent Destourian Party.{{sfn|Boularès|2012|p=547}} In this context, a new generation of nationalists emerged.

== Background ==

=== Emergence of a new generation of nationalists ===

In the early 1930s, a new generation of nationalists emerged and joined the [[Destour]] party. Deeply marked with the [[Eucharistic Congress]] of 1930, considered as a "violation of Islam lands by Christianity" and a revolting shame to the Tunisian people, the new generation feared the celebration of the [[French protectorate of Tunisia|protectorate]]'s 50th anniversary, the next year.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=69}} In this context, the Destour leadership gathered in ''L'hôtel d'Orient''. [[Habib Bourguiba]], [[Mahmoud El Materi]], [[Bahri Guiga]] and [[Tahar Sfar]] took part in the meeting.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=70}} It was decided to support ''La Voix du Tunisien'', a nationalist daily newspaper managed by Chedly Khairallah. Bourguiba, El Materi, Guiga and Sfar decided to join the drafting committee of the paper and stood out from their elders with their daring to challenge the protectorate. Bourguiba wrote: {{quote|text=A State can not be both subject and sovereign: Any treaty of protectorate, because of its nature, carries its own seed of death [...] Is it a lifeless country, a degenerate people who declines? Reduced to be nothing more than a dust of individuals; that means awaiting for downfall [...] In short, total and inevitable demise. Is it, in contrary, a sain people, vigorous, that international races or a momentary crisis forced them to accept the tutelage of a strong state, the necessarily inferior status imposed upon them, the contact of a more advanced civilization determines in them a salutary reaction [...] a real regeneration occurs in them and through judicious assimilation, they inevitably come to realize in stages their final emancipation. Time will tell if the Tunisian people belong to one or the other category.|author=[[Habib Bourguiba]]|source=La Voix du Tunisien (February 23, 1931).{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=24}}}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

With the originality with which they approached problems, the young team made ''La Voix du Tunisien'' a popular newspaper. They soon stood out from their elders of the Destour by establishing a new thinking: They were in favor of the inviolability of the national personality and political sovereignty of the Tunisian people plus a gradual emancipation of the country, by advocating for a nationalism that fought against a regime and not against civilization.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=71}} But their new thinking soon started a fight with Khairallah about the management of the newspaper. It ended with the resignation of the five editors who decided to found their own paper.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=73}} A drafting committee gathering Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Guiga, Sfar, El Materi and Ali Bouhajeb, a pharmacist friend, created ''[[L'Action Tunisienne]]''. Its first edition was published on November 1, 1932. Disappointed in the resigned moderation of their elders, the team worked on defending lower classes and expressing colonial inequalities.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=27}}

[[File:L'action tunisienne du 4 mai 1933.jpg|thumb|left|Frontpage of ''L'Action tunisienne'' edition of May 4, 1933.]]

With the economic crisis that worsened and the popularity of the new generation, the young nationalists felt they needed a good reason to revive the [[Tunisian national movement|national movement]], weakened by the 1926 repression, on new basis. They benefited from the [[Tunisian naturalization issue]] that restarted in the early 1930s. Previously, the nationalists protested strongly against the December 20, 1923, laws that favored the access of non-French protectorate inhabitants to French citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Daniel|last=Goldstein|title=Libération ou annexion. Aux chemins croisés de l'histoire tunisienne, 1914–1922''|publisher=Maison tunisienne de l'édition|location=Tunis|year=1978}}, {{p.|484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discontent following the enactment of these measures receded but reappeared in the beginning of 1933. On December 31, 1932, upon the announcement of a Muslim naturalized's death in [[Bizerte]], Mohamed Chaabane, individuals gathered in the Muslim cemetery to stop the interment of the dead. They obtained the support of the city's mufti who delivered a fatwa prohibiting naturalized citizens to be buried in Muslim cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Roger|last= Casemajor|title=L'action nationaliste en Tunisie|publisher=MC-Editions|location=Carthage|year=2009}}, {{p.|73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba decided to start a press campaign in ''L'Action'', reprised by many other nationalist newspapers. In order to calm down the turmoil that spread all over the country every time a naturalized died, the Residence asked a fatwa from the Sharaa court, in April. But it resolved nothing: The sheikhs maintained the apostasy of the naturalized but affirmed that if he repented, even verbally, and that before his death, his interment in Muslim lands would be granted.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=79}} This decision angered nationalists who opposed the fatwa and started riots in [[Kairouan]] and Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Mustapha|last=Kraïem|title=Higher Institute of National Movement History|publisher=|location=Tunis|year=1956}}, {{p.|75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign led by the new generation of nationalists pressured the Residence to take a two-faced decision: Firstly, it yield to the nationalists stating that naturalized should be buried in special cemeteries. Then, resident-general, François Manceron enacted "scoundrel decrees", granting him the right to imprison at his will any nationalist and suspend newspapers and associations "hostile to the protectorate".{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=80}} Despite that, the victory over the Residence led to the election of El Materi, the Bourguiba brothers, Guiga and Sfar to the executive committee of the party during the extraordinary Destour congress held on May 12 and May 13, 1933.{{sfn|Mestiri|2011|p=120}}

But the maintained turmoil led the Residence to censor nationalist press and suspend the Destour, on May 31. Bourguiba, deprived of means of expression, benefited from the events of August 8, when riots started in Monastir upon the forced interment of a naturalized's child. The fight between law enforcement and inhabitants ended up with one dead and many injured. Bourguiba then convinced Monastirian notables to choose him as their lawyer in order to defend their case. On September 4, without informing the Destour about his initiative, Bourguiba led a protest delegation to the bey. In response, the party leadership decided to inflict a blame to the young activist, to which Bourguiba responded with his resignation from the party on September 9.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=29}}

=== Split-up with the Destour ===

The rest of ''L'Action'' team soon conflicted with the Destour elders. The differences between the groups were not only age but also ideological and methodical. Peyrouton, the new resident-general attempted to calm down the situation by announcing social and economic reforms. By the end of October 1933, he met with a delegation of the Destour executive committee, led by Ahmed Essafi and comprising Salah Farhat, Mohieddine Klibi, Ali Bouhajeb, Moncef Mestiri and Bahri Guiga. He wanted to offer them to join an advisory committee of Tunisian reforms that would stop the transfer, to colonial land agencies, lands mortgaged by farmers reduced to misery. In order to avoid opposition, he asked them to keep these arrangements confidential. At the end of the interview, the delegation members gathered in Moncef Mestiri's house in [[La Marsa]] to agree on the portion of the interview to be made public. Guiga, who was a delegation member refused to yiel to "game of the resident" and joined his friends in Tunis to inform them about what had been negotiated. The very evening, he told the manager of ''Le Petit Matin'' about the talks with the resident-general.{{sfn|Mestiri|2011|pp=124–125}}

The news fastly spread in the city which angered Peyrouton and the Destour leadership, mainly Essafi who asked for the gathering of the executive committee on November 17 to force Guiga's exclusion from the party. On December 7, solidary with their friend, M'hamed Bourguiba, El Materi and Tahar Sfar resigned from the executive committee which refused to reconsider its decision.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=83}} Habib Bourguiba decided to join the "rebel faction", gathered under El Materi's commands, to start an explanation campaign to the activists. Called "traitors" by the Destour, the incident delighted the Residence, as it divided the nationalists.{{sfn|El Materi Hached|2011|p=92}}

== Preparations ==

[[File:Neodestour 1934.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Gathering of the secessionist members of Destour, on January 3, 1934.]]

In order to explain themselves to the people, Sfar, Bourguiba and Guiga decided to start a campaign in [[Ksar Hellal]] and [[Moknine]], seriously hit by the economic-social crisis. At their arrival, they were subject to the hostility of the inhabitants because of the Destour propaganda to discredit them. However, they found support in Ahmad Ayad, a Ksar Hellal notable, who invited them to hold a gathering and explain themselves. The meeting happened in his house on January 3, 1934. Soon, their speeches and determination to act proved to be successful and pleased the inhabitants. Belgacem Gnaoui, then leader of the carter union and who would become the General secretary of the General Confederation of Tunisian Workers, testified that "at the slightest sign, we were ready to close our shops and march in the streets [...] Young people urged us to protest strikes. On day, Ahmad Essafi, General secretary of the Destour, convened a gathering in the Andalous quarter. He was violently attacked by the participants who accused him of enjoying the comfort while we were starving in our hovels".{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|pp=84–85}}

[[File:Convocation au congrès de ksar Hellal.jpg|thumb|Letter convening delegates.]]

Meanwhile, the Destour executive committee pursued its campaign to discredit the new generation of nationalists. In response, Bourguiba replied with more violence, aggression and contempt in his speeches. As for El Materi, they should not stoop to the elders' level; He advocated for reforming the party's methods in peace and understanding or split up from the movement and found their own one. He stated: "My opinion is that we should let them cry in the wilderness, only a few people took them seriously". Sfar also criticized the Destour leadership writing: "Too much conservatism harms society because it is a factor of immobility and death; it solidifies everything, destroyes all initiative spirit, opposes any vivifying and creating force and therefore stops any progress, breaks the momentum and growth of individuals and groups".{{sfn|El Materi Hached|2011|p=92}}

Since then, the number of Destourian representations asking for an extraordinary explanatory congress increased. They addressed letters to Mohieddine Klibi who responded with a revealing stiffening of the danger the young nationalists were for the Destourian ''establishment''. The idea spread across the country mainly in Tunis, [[Menzel Temime]], Moknine, [[Gafsa]] and Bizerte. On the other hand, the young team pursued its tour and asked for a loyal showdown with their opponents: An interim committee including El Materi, the Bourguibas, Sfar and Guiga was formed and decided to organize an extraordinary congress on March 2, 1934, in Ksar Hellal to settle the disagreement. They obtained the support of M'hamed Chenik and many of his major clients who guaranteed the smooth progress of the event. Bourguiba drafted the convening letters inviting delegates to participate in order to settle the dispute arose within the Executive committee, develop the propaganda and action methods of the dissenting team. The establishment of a new political movement was even considered.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=86}}

== The congress ==

=== Founding of the Neo Destour ===

[[File:Congress_of_ksar_Hellal.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Delegation attending the congress.]]

On March 2, 1934, 48 members of the Destour attended the event, mostly originating in the Sahel: 19 delegates represented the Sahel in Ksar Hellal while 9 for Tunis and 20 for the rest of the country. Even though invited, neither the members of the executive committee nor that of the cells that remained loyal to it had sent representatives.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=86}}

During the congress, Sfar denounced the Destour leadership's methods that he judged elitist, accusing them to maintain the people into ignorance. The delegates of the South, such as Metouia and Gafsa, supported these words and confirmed them.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=86}} Bourguiba then asked the attendees to adjudicate and choose the "men that will have to defend the country liberation on your behalf". For the first time, he stated the Destour leadership of being "ancient" and declared: "We have neither the same conception nor the same views in terms of means of action". The congress proceeded with the proposal of Habib Bougafta, delegate of Bizerte, to declare forfeiture of the executive committee while Belhassine Jrad, delegate of Metouia, required their exclusion from the party.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=87}}

Once the decisions made, Sfar chaired the adoption of the internal regulation of the new party, making it a strongly hierarchical pyramidal organization, composed by local cells that answer to the Political Office of the party via regional committees and a national Council.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=87}} The attendees withdrew their endorsement of the executive committee declared "unable to defend the claims of the Tunisian people". Thus, it was replaced within the new party with a Political Office presided by Mahmoud El Materi while Habib Bourguiba was designated General secretary.{{sfn|El Materi Hached|2011|p=93}}

A national council (''Majlis Milli'') was established and composed by 19 delegates, such as Youssef Rouissi and Hédi Chekir.{{sfn|Boularès|2012|p=568}} It decided to maintain all the delegates as head of their regions, adopting as a strategy to be in the continuity of the nationalist movement while marginalizing the former leadership.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=87}}

=== Renewel of the national movement ===

Once the party founded, its young leaders made it a major asset to express their nationalist claims. In order to do that, the party had to stand out and acquire a major position within the National movement. The economic crisis was favorable to that. Plus, their new thinking shaped the party policy that did not systematically oppose the Residence decisions: In March 1934, Peyrouton adopted deflationary measures to ease the burden of the Tunisian budget and trim much of the French officials' privileges, something that had always been requested by the nationalists. On March 31, Bourguiba decided to publicly endorse this decision, arguing that an initiative responding to nationalist aspirations should be applauded.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|pp=90–91}}

But the freshly constituted party still had to impose itself on the political stage, spread its ideology and rally the supporters of a still-powerful Destour. It also had to convince lower classes that the Neo Destour was their defender, inviting them to join and recover a "dignity manhandled by half a century of protectorate". In order to do so, tours were organized throughout the country, which drew a distinction between the new and old parties in their communication field. Despite its significant influence, the Destour did not succeed in mobilizing the illiterate masses whose political weight was still not existing. Cells were created and a structure was formed all around the country, making the Neo Destour a powerful engine more effective than all the preceding nationalist formations.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|pp=90–91}} If the elders addressed the colonial power to express their requests, the secessionists addressed the people. To reach these aims, Tahar Sfar created ''El Amal'', an Arabic version of ''L'Action Tunisienne'', which became the party's official paper.

After the "conquest of the people", the political office tried to reach international support. The party sensitized the French left wing to the requests of colonized people. It presented itself as aspiring to acquire a part of the Regence sovereignty, without being anti-French. They gained the support of Félicien Challaye who visited the country with Bourguiba, while on tour. After his return to France, he publicly supported the Neo Destour arguing that he was convinced in the seriousness, the francophilia and the moderation of the young nationalists.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=32}}

=== Residence reaction: From delight to repression ===

A month after the congress, the resident-general, Marcel Peyrouton tried to benefit from the split-up with the Destour, seeing in it a mean to weaken the nationalist movement. Thus, he convened Mahmoud El Materi to whom he proposed a doctor position in Sadiki Hospital and, upon his refusal, proposed to appoint him as the hospital head. El Materi saw in this an attempted corruption and declared to the resident: "Be aware, sir, that I am neither to be bought nor sold".{{sfn|El Materi Hached|2011|p=94}} Finding no compromise with the young neo-Destourians, Peyrouton called for the French Rally of Tunisia to show a strong opposition to the new party: "I will cross Tunisia like a hurricane", he declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Elie|last=Cohen-Hadria|title=Du protectorat français à l'indépendance tunisienne|publisher=Center of Modern and Contemporary Mediterranean|location=Nice|year=1976}}, {{p.|102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Favorable to the Residence's appeal, the French of Tunisia protested against the national movement. In response, the Neo Destour gathered activists in ''Place aux Moutons'' where the nationalist leaders invited the people to resist and march towards the Residence. A delegation comprising Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, El Materi, Sfar and Ali Dargouth requested to meet the resident-general, who later that day refused. Instead, administration officials demanded that they evacuate the Residence, calmly and without causing incidents.{{sfn|El Materi Hached|2011|p=94}} In response, the Neo Destour meetings increased and their contestations too. They demanded [[national sovereignty]] and evoked independence "accompanied by a treaty guaranteeing France a preponderance both in the political and economical fields in comparison with other foreign powers", in an article published by ''L'Action Tunisienne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Histoire du mouvement national tunisien, 9 avril 1938 : le procès Bourguiba|publisher=National Documentation Centre|location=Tunis|year=1970}}, {{p.|138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to do so, they required the transfer of government responsibilities, legislative and administrative even if it would preserve French interests in the [[Culture of Tunisia|cultural]] and [[Economy of Tunisia|economical]] fields.{{sfn|Le Pautremat|Ageron|2003|p=109}}

These requests started a conflict between the French government and the Tunisian national movement, especially as party officials undertake a major action across the country to raise the people's awareness of their message.{{sfn|Le Pautremat|Ageron|2003|p=110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Omar|last=Khlifi|title=L'assassinat de Salah Ben Youssef|publisher=MC-Editions|location=Carthage|year=2005}}, {{p.|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the worsening of the economic crisis, Peyrouton wanted to avoid turmoil as the Neo Destour wanted an uprise of the population living in hard conditions. Thus, he responded with a series of measures destined to intimidate the movement.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=93}} The repression that started was more and more violent: Peyrouton prohibited any nationalist and left wing newspaper, such as ''Tunis socialiste'', ''L'Humanité'' and ''Le Populaire'', on September 1, 1934. On September 3, raids were carried out as major party leaderships were arrested, that was both Destours and the communist party.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=32}} They were placed under house arrest then sent to the military camp of Bordj le Bœuf, in the far South of Tunisia, before being freed two years later with the arrival of Resident-general, Armand Guillon.

The date of March 2, 1934, became a major event, both in the [[History of Tunisia]] and that of the National movement. After decline of the movement activism, this congress was the return in force of [[Tunisian nationalism]] with new ambitions. The new generation, of Sadikian formation then higher education in France, stood out from the Destour elders with Tunis origins and invited the people to masters of their fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.leconomistemaghrebin.com/2016/03/01/tunisie-2-mars-1934-date-repere/|author=Chater, Khelifa|title=Tunisie : 2 mars 1934, une date repère…!|work=L'Économiste maghrébin|date=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a major date in Bourguiba's political career which permitted him to have a great part in the country liberation then the founding of a modern Republic. The congress also proclaimed the dissolution of the executive committee and endorsed the new party. Thus, two major political parties appeared on the political stage:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ounaies|first=Ahmed|authorlink=Ahmed Ounaies|title=Histoire générale de la Tunisie, L'Époque contemporaine (1881–1956)|volume=5|year=2010|publisher=Sud Editions|location=Tunis|language=fr}}, {{p.|402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first, [[Islamism|Islamist]], [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamist]] and [[tradition]]alist, conserved the name of Destour and also called the old Destour; {{sfn|Le Pautremat|Ageron|2003|p=90}}
* The second, [[Modernism|modernist]], [[Secularism|secularist]], took the name of Neo Destour and established a modern structure based on the model of European socialist and communist parties. It was determined to conquest power and transform the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=L'encyclopédie nomade 2006|publisher=Larousse Edition|location=Paris|year=2005}}, {{p.|708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunisian scholars described the rivalry between the two parties: "The Old Destour was a party of notables, well-raised distinguished people, Arabists formed in majority in the Ez-Zitouna University. Bourguiba and his fellows had, overall, a very different profile and view. From the petty bourgeoisie of the coast, they were considered, scornfully, as ''Afaqiyin'', those who came from behind the horizon, a euphemism for designating provincials. They had a modern, bilingual education and thus were also comfortable both in [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic]], were close to the people, whom they addressed with its spoken language, in [[Tunisian Arabic]], and had the ambition to create a large mass party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN17067queresellim0|author= Ghorbal, Samy |title= Que reste-t-il des grandes familles ?|publisher=[[Jeune Afrique]]|date= June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2913">'''Kuleana''' is a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word, defined in the Hawaii Electronic Library as a "Right, privilege, concern, responsibility, title, business, property, estate, portion, jurisdiction, authority, liability, interest, claim, ownership, tenure, affair, province; reason, cause, function, justification; small piece of property, as within an [[ahupuaʻa]]; blood relative through whom a relationship to less close relatives is traced, as to in-laws." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulukau.org/ |title=Nā Puke Wehewehe ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi |trans-title=Hawaii Electronic Library |accessdate=2017-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kuleana Act of 1850==

The Kuleana Act of 1850, proposed by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|King in Privy Council]] passed by the [[Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii legislature]] created a system for private land ownership in seven parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoakaleifoundation.org/documents/kuleana-act-1850 |title=The Kuleana Act of 1850 |work=Hawaii State Archives, DLNR, 2–4 |publisher=Hoakalei Cultural Foundation. |accessdate=2017-01-28 |quote=The Kuleana Act remains the foundation of law pertaining to native tenant rights. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Section 1 recognized ownership of government plots occupied and improved by families.  Section 2 expanded title to other types of land. Section 3 defined land boundaries and the ability to exchange portions of land. Section 4 established a system for the Hawaiian government to distribute larger parcels of land. Section 5 established the largest size of family owned lots. Section 6 attempted to distinguish between cultivated and waste lands.  Section 7 established access to roads, water sources, and other natural resources.

==Recent Controversies==

[[Facebook]] founder and billionaire [[Mark Zuckerberg]] came under scrutiny in 2017 when he attempted to integrate property titles established by the Kuleana Act into a 700 acre estate he intended to assemble in Hawaii using [[quiet title]] lawsuits to establish the ownership of ambiguously-titled parcels of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Uria |first=Daniel |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2017/01/28/Mark-Zuckerberg-drops-property-lawsuits-to-force-sale-of-Hawaiian-lands/8041485608671/ |title=Mark Zuckerberg drops property lawsuits to force sale of Hawaiian lands |work=United Press International |publisher=United Press International |date=2017-01-28 |accessdate=2017-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata''' was a small and short-lived political party in New Zealand. It was established by [[Alamein Kopu]], a member of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] who had left her original party (the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]]). After a short time as an independent MP, Kopu established Mana Wahine as her own party. It was officially registered on 12 June 1998.

The name "Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata" is difficult to translate, but essentially refers to dignity or respect for women. Kopu claims that the party was intended to  support [[Māori people|Māori]] women, promoting a Māori form of [[feminism]]. Critics of Alamein Kopu, however, did not see the party as a genuine ideological organization. Rather, they saw a more cynical reason for the party's creation – as leader of a party rather than an independent, Kopu was entitled to $80,000 in additional funding. [[Jim Anderton]], leader of Kopu's former party, said that the creation of Mana Wahine approached corruption, a sentiment which was echoed by several other politicians.

Kopu (and thus Mana Wahine) closely followed the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] government of [[Jenny Shipley]]. National, having recently ended its coalition with the [[New Zealand First]] party, was highly interested in finding additional parliamentary support. It is sometimes claimed that National's influence was instrumental in gaining Mana Wahine official recognition as a party, and many members of the Opposition claimed that this help was given in order to secure Mana Wahine's vote – [[Trevor Mallard]], a [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MP, openly called it a "bribe".

Mana Wahine contested only two elections. The first was the [[Taranaki-King Country by-election, 1998|Taranaki-King Country by-election]] in 1998. The Mana Wahine candidate, Mary Gilmore, received 7 of the 20,225 valid votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresults.govt.nz/1998_taranaki_byelection/|title=1998 Taranaki-King Country By-election – 2&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1998|publisher=Chief Electoral Office, [[New Zealand Ministry of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 general election]], Mana Wahine failed to submit a party list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proportional Representation on Trial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvC_IiNljSEC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Mana+Wahine+Te+Ira+Tangata%22|last=Vowles|first=Jack|pages=76|year=2002|isbn=1-86940-265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kopu saying that she missed the deadline by just minutes. The party nevertheless contested twelve electorate seats, gaining  a total of 1,082 votes across the country. Kopu herself contested the Waiariki electorate, and gained sixth place with 1.70% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1999/e9/html/e9_partI.html|title=1999 General Election – Summary of Overall Results|publisher=Chief Electoral Office, [[New Zealand Ministry of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

12 February 2001, Mana Wahine was removed from the list of registered political parties at its own request.

In 1998, Hale was [[disbarment|barred from practicing law]] in Illinois by the state panel that evaluates the character and fitness of prospective lawyers. The panel stated that Hale's incitement of racial hatred, for the ultimate purpose of depriving selected groups of their legal rights, was blatantly [[Immorality|immoral]] and rendered him unfit to be a lawyer.&lt;ref name="halesuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hatemonitor.csusb.edu/NewsHeadlines/hale_complaint.htm |title=Matthew F.

In 2005, Hale was sentenced to a 40-year federal prison term for encouraging an undercover [[FBI]] informant to kill [[federal judge]] [[Joan Lefkow]].&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;  His projected release date is December 6, 2037.&lt;ref name="inmateloc"&gt;BOP register number 15177-424 at {{cite web | url = https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ | title = Find an inmate. | publisher = Federal Bureau of Prisons | accessdate = 2016-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2037|12|6}}

==Early life==
Hale was born in 1971 and raised in [[East Peoria, Illinois]], a city on the [[Illinois River]]. By the age of 12, he was reading books about [[Nazism|National Socialism]], such as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', and had formed a group at his school.&lt;ref name="adl-ext-hale"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Hale.asp?xpicked=2 | title = Matt Hale and The Creativity Movement (formerly the World Church of the Creator) | work = Extremism in America | publisher = [[Anti-Defamation League]] | location = [[New York City]] | date = 2005-04-06 | accessdate = 2010-02-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629094856/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Hale.asp?xpicked=2 | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1989, Hale entered [[Bradley University]], studying [[political science]]. At the age of 19, Hale burned an [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] at a demonstration and was found guilty of violating an East Peoria ordinance against open burning. The next year, he passed out [[racism|racist]] pamphlets to patrons at a shopping mall and was fined for littering. In May 1991, Hale and his brother allegedly threatened three [[African-American]]s with a gun. Hale was arrested for mob action, and because he refused to tell police where his brother was, he was also charged with [[felony]] [[obstruction of justice]]. Hale was convicted of obstruction, but won a reversal on [[appeal]]. In 1992, Hale attacked a security guard at a mall and was charged with [[criminal trespass]], [[resisting arrest]], [[battery (crime)|aggravated battery]] and carrying a concealed weapon. For this attack, Hale was sentenced to 30 months of [[probation]] and six months of [[house arrest]].&lt;ref name="splc-matt-hale"&gt;{{cite web

In 1990, Hale was expelled from [[Bradley University]], where he was studying [[political science]].&lt;ref name="creativitymovement.net"/&gt;  In 1995, he dissolved the National Socialist White Americans Party (NSWAP) and instead formed the [[New Church of the Creator]], a revival of [[Ben Klassen]]'s religious group "Church of the Creator", which believes that the white race are the creators of all worthwhile [[civilization]]. The church believes that a "racial holy war" is necessary to attain a "white world" without [[Jew]]s and non-whites. To this end, it encourages its members to "populate the lands of this earth with [[white people]] exclusively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1999/church-creator-timeline |title=Church of the Creator Timeline | work=Intelligence Report |date=September 15, 1999 | publisher = Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hale appointed himself "Pontifex Maximus", he changed the name of the organization to the World Church of the Creator.

==Controversy over law license==
Hale graduated from [[Southern Illinois University School of Law]] in May 1998 and passed the [[bar examination]] in July of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matthew F. Hale, Plaintiff, v.Committee on Character and Fitness for the State of Illinois (see "The Parties", paragraph 5)|url=http://hatemonitor.csusb.edu/NewsHeadlines/hale_complaint.htm|website=web.archive.org|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=4 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409205157/http://hatemonitor.csusb.edu/NewsHeadlines/hale_complaint.htm|archivedate=9 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 1998, the Illinois Bar Committee on Character and Fitness rejected Hale's application for a license to practice law. Hale appealed, and a hearing was held on April 10, 1999. On June 30, 1999, a Hearing Panel of the Committee refused to certify that Hale had the requisite moral character and fitness to practice law in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.state.il.us/court/Media/PressRel/1999/102999.htm | date = 1999-10-29 | title = Committee Files With Illinois Supreme Court Objection to Matthew F. Hale's Application for Law License | publisher = [[Illinois Supreme Court]] | accessdate = 2010-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney [[Glenn Greenwald]] represented Hale in a failed federal lawsuit to overturn the licensing decision.&lt;ref name="halesuit" /&gt; The [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] concluded it did not have jurisdiction to review an earlier decision of the Illinois Supreme Court upholding the license denial.&lt;ref name="7thCir"&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Matthew F.

Committee on Character and Fitness for the State of Illinois |vol = 353 |reporter = F.3d |opinion =  678 |court = Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit |date = 2003 |url= https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/782652/matthew-f-hale-v-committee-on-character-and-fitnes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld that decision in an opinion filed on July 14, 2003.&lt;ref name="7thCir" /&gt;

Two days after Hale was denied a license to practice law, a World Church of the Creator member and college student, [[Benjamin Nathaniel Smith|Benjamin Smith]], went on a three-day shooting spree in which he randomly targeted members of racial and ethnic minority groups in Illinois and [[Indiana]]. Beginning on July 2, 1999, Smith shot nine [[Orthodox Jew]]s while they were walking to and from their [[synagogue]]s in [[Chicago]]'s West Rogers Park neighborhood. He also killed two people, including former [[Northwestern University]] basketball coach [[Ricky Byrdsong]], in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and a 26-year-old Korean graduate student, Won-Joon Yoon, who was on his way to church in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. Smith wounded nine others before committing [[suicide]] on July 4. Mark Potok, director of intelligence for the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], believes that Smith may have acted in [[retaliation]] after Hale's application to practice law was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Wilgoren, Jodi (March 2, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/02/national/02chicago.html Haunted by Threats, U.S. Judge Finds New Horror]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a television interview in the summer of 1999,{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}} Hale stated that his "church does not condone violent or illegal activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-04-27/news/0404280037_1_matthew-hale-supremacist-racial-holy-war | title = Hale guilty: Profile: Supremacist offered mixed message through his group | date = April 27, 2004 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | edition = online | accessdate = September 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Joan Lefkow#Matthew Hale}}
In 2000, a religious group in [[Oregon]] called the [[Church of the Creator]] sued Hale's organization, the World Church of the Creator, for [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref name="splc-matt-hale"/&gt;

Hale filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[Joan Lefkow|Judge Joan Lefkow]], the United States district court judge presiding over the trademark infringement case who, after an appeal, had ruled against Hale's organization.  Hale stated that the WCOTC was in a "state of war" with Lefkow, and denounced Lefkow in a news conference, claiming that she was biased against him because she was married to a Jewish man and had [[biracial]] grandchildren.&lt;ref name="splc-matt-hale"/&gt;

On January 8, 2003, Hale was arrested, charged with soliciting an undercover FBI informant to kill Lefkow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Midwest/01/08/white.supremacist/index.html | title=Race extremist jailed in plot to kill judge | publisher=CNN |date=January 9, 2003|accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2005, Lefkow's mother and husband were murdered at her home on [[Chicago]]'s North Side. Chicago police revealed on March 10 that Bart Ross, a plaintiff in a [[medical malpractice]] case that Lefkow had dismissed, admitted to the murders in a suicide note written before shooting himself during a routine traffic stop in [[Wisconsin]] the previous evening. The murders and suicide were unrelated to Hale or Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;(March 10, 2005) [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-050310lefkow,1,487378.story Police: Wisconsin death has Lefkow tie] ''Chicago Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2005, Hale was sentenced to a 40-year prison term for attempting to solicit Lefkow's murder. During the trial, jurors heard more than a dozen tapes of Hale using [[List of ethnic slurs|racial slurs]] (considered a virtue in Creativity), including one in which he joked about Benjamin Smith's murderous shooting spree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/news/item.jsp?site_area=1&amp;aid=102 |title=Matthew Hale gets maximum 40-year sentence |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=April 7, 2005 |first= |last= |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214090434/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/news/item.jsp?site_area=1&amp;aid=102 |archivedate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Hale was transferred out of [[ADX Florence]] to medium-security federal prison [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terre Haute|FCI Terre Haute]], Indiana, to serve the remainder of his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/20160614/matt-hale-moved-out-of-supermax-prison-in-colorado-and-into-indiana-federal-prison|title=Matt Hale moved out of supermax prison in Colorado and into Indiana federal prison|first=Andy|last=Kravetz|work=[[Peoria Journal Star|PJStar.com]]|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale's projected release date is December 6, 2037.&lt;ref name="inmateloc"/&gt;{{update after|2037|12|6}} If he is released at that time, he will be 66 years old.

==Crimes and disturbing issues==
In the years of 2007-8 the [[Government of Cambodia|Cambodian Government]], was responsible for the sale of 45% of the total landmass in Cambodia to primarily foreign investors. The land [[Concession (contract)|concession]]s are to be used for agro-industrial, forestry, tourism and constructional projects, even though larger parts of the land are wildlife protections or [[national park]]s even (See [[Cardamom Mountains]] for example).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/maps/ Maps] Open Development Cambodia. See Economic Land Concessions, Concessions For Mining and Forest Concessions.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of the Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) have in fact been issued in violation of Cambodia’s 2001 Land Law and its Subdecree on ELCs and are therefore illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.licadho-cambodia.org/reports/files/187Document-UPR2013-LICADHO.pdf

The '''Ministry of National Defence''' ({{lang-el|Υπουργείο Εθνικής Άμυνας}}, abbreviated ΥΠΕΘΑ), is the civilian cabinet organisation responsible for managing the [[Military of Greece|Hellenic Armed Forces]], the leader of which is, according to the Constitution (Article 45), the [[President of Greece|President of the Republic]] but their administration is exercised only by the [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] and the [[Government of Greece]]. It is located at 227-231 Messogion Avenue, in the Papagos camp (Pentagon) in Athens, between Papagos and Holargos.

Today is hierarchically ranked 3rd in the rankings of ministries, according to a decision of the Prime Minister (Government Gazette B / 1594 / 25-6-2013). The highest position in the history of the Ministry was the second, behind the ministry of the presidency of the government, [[:el:Κυβέρνηση Ανδρέα Παπανδρέου 1993|on the last government of Andreas Papandreou (1993-1996)]].

It is considered to be a ministry of particular prestige and is one of the most desirable to the members of each government, because it oversees the Armed Forces, manages huge sums of money, and is usually away from the woes and the wear and tear of everyday life.

The current Greek [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Minister for Defence]] is [[Independent Greeks|ANEL]] leader [[Panos Kammenos]] in the [[Second Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras]]. Kammenos assumed the role on 23 September 2015.

== History ==
It was founded in 1950 from the unification of three Ministries:  under the influence of American advisors. However, a single Ministry of National Defense was established and operated in the three-year period of 1941-44 by the [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|puppet governments]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ggk.gov.gr/?p=1035&lt;/ref&gt; (the legitimate exiled Greek government of the Middle East had retained the separate Ministries of [[Ministry for Military Affairs (Greece)|Military Affairs]], [[Ministry for Naval Affairs (Greece)|Naval Affairs]] and [[Aviation Ministry (Greece)|Aviation]] for the free Greek Armed Forces there).

'''No Peace Without Justice''' ('''NPWJ''') or '''Non C'è  Pace Senza Giustizia''' ('''NPSG''') is an Italian non-profit organization, founded in 1993 by [[Emma Bonino]], an Italian politician, former Member of the European Parliament and current Member of the Italian Senate.&lt;ref name="Emma Bonino's Biography"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonino|first=Emma|title=Italian Senator|url=http://www.emmabonino.it/biography|publisher=Emma Bonino's Official Website|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NPWJ is based in Rome and is a member of the Steering Committee of the [[NGO Coalition for the International Criminal Court]] (CICC) and a constituent association of the Nonviolent [[Transnational Radical Party]], an [[NGO]] with General (category I) Consultative Status at the [[United Nations]] [[ECOSOC]].
The main programs areas are on [[international criminal justice]], [[female genital mutilation]], MENA [[democracy]], including the [[Iraq]] project.
[[Human rights]] are most at threat in situations of conflict, where even the international community often promotes short-term measures intended to stop the fighting, but which breed more conflict, perpetuate impunity and undermine the rule of law, unless they provide accountability for the crimes and redress for the victims. Justice, democracy and the [[rule of law]] are the pillars of sustainable peace by guaranteeing fundamental freedoms and human rights. NPWJ's original core activities since 1993 were designed to promote the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court as part of a more effective international criminal justice system for the prevention, deterrence and prosecution of [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]].

==International Criminal Justice Program==

NPWJ’s international criminal justice program still focuses both on international and national efforts to restore the rule of law and provide accountability and redress for the victims of crimes under international law, be they through the [[International Criminal Court]], or through [[ad hoc Courts]] or Tribunals, national prosecutions or other accountability processes. The overall objective of the international criminal justice program is to ensure that whatever solution is adopted, it is shaped and implemented so that it can contribute to the restoration of the rule of law, it is responsive to the needs of stakeholders and it adheres to the strictest human rights standards. While NPWJ continues to work towards the universality of the Rome ICC Statute by promoting its ratification and effective implementing legislation, much of its focus is on ensuring that those crimes are properly addressed through national and international judicial processes or accountability mechanisms, with the ICC acting as a catalyst, as a guardian and as a last resort.

==Female Genital Mutilation Program==

The female genital mutilation program, begun in 2000, specifically addresses one of the most widespread and systematic violations of the human right to personal integrity, committed against millions of women and girls worldwide, and which goes unchallenged under the pretext of respecting local customs. The overall objective of the FGM program is to develop a political, legal and social environment that challenges attitudes and behaviours on FGM and promotes its abandonment, in the context of the promotion and protection of women's and girls' rights, including through promoting the ratification and implementation of the [[Maputo Protocol]] on the Rights of Women in Africa. The program builds the strategic capacity of women’s rights advocates and field practitioners working on FGM and promotes legal reform as an effective tool for behavioural change in order to turn the tide of social norms against FGM.

==Middle East and North Africa Democracy Program==

The Middle East and North Africa democracy program, begun in 2003, also addresses situations where fundamental and universal principles are often set aside in the name of political stability and presumed cultural incompatibility. The overall objective of the MENA Democracy program is to promote democratic values, liberal institutions and open government through the development of political mechanisms of consultation that recognise non-state actors, [[NGOs]] and civil society as a legitimate and necessary counterpart for dialogue with State institutions on issues of democratic reform. The program is carried out both at national and at regional levels, in cooperation with several governments, non-governmental and institutional partners, aiming to develop effective and durable consultation and dialogue mechanisms on democratic reform.

===Iraq Project===

Within the framework of the MENA Democracy program, the Iraq project, begun in 2006, contributes to the constitutional and institution-building process in Iraq by promoting negotiation between leaders from the entire political spectrum on the most politically sensitive issues, including in particular the attribution of responsibilities and powers at the various levels of State, Regions, Governorates, Towns and Municipalities.  By providing opportunities for open and informed debate, the Iraq project aims to help prevent or defuse negotiation deadlocks and identify durable solutions.

==Methodology==

Priorities for action for all programs are selected on the basis of the needs as determined on the ground, involving all stakeholders in the design and implementation of activities.  In advocacy activities, NPWJ raises awareness and fosters public debate through explicitly political campaigns and the implementation of key programs, such as international and regional meetings, often co-hosted and co-organised with Government of the country in which they are held, fostering partnerships between public institutions, non-governmental organisations and other actors in society, to attain stakeholders’ ownership both of the political drive and of the results.  NPWJ also undertakes wide-ranging technical assistance, through the secondment of legal experts to governments for the drafting of legislation and to assist in negotiations on international human rights instruments. Finally, NPWJ has acquired unique field experience in “conflict mapping” and wide-scale documentation of violations of international humanitarian law in areas affected by conflicts and in implementing outreach programs engaging local communities in conflict and post-conflict areas on issues of international criminal justice.

The '''Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014''' is an act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was passed with the intent to ban [[dual mandate]]s (also known as double-jobbing) for [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) and to bring the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]'s elections into line with the other British devolved legislatures.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/northern-ireland-news/parliament-extends-assembly-term-until-2016-and-bans-double-jobbing-1-5936664 |title=Parliament extends Assembly term until 2016 and bans double-jobbing |work=News Letter |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received [[Royal Assent]] on 13 March 2014.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-assent-for-northern-ireland-miscellaneous-provisions-act-2014 |title=Royal Assent for Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elections ==
During the debate on the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[Welsh Assembly]] passed motions requesting the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] to delay their respective devolved legislature elections in 2015 to avoid a clash with the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. The UK Government passed an amendment to the bill to allow for their elections to take place in 2016. Northern Ireland was not included in this bill due to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2011|2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election]] taking place at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-welcomes-elections-agreement |title=Government welcomes elections agreement |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act was passed to bring the Northern Ireland Assembly into line with the other devolved legislatures and to extend each Assembly term to five years instead of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22480728 |title=Northern Ireland Assembly elections put back to 2016 |publisher=BBC News |date=2013-05-10 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also provided the option for the Assembly to [[Assembly Members (Reduction of Numbers) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|reduce its size to 90 MLAs]].&lt;ref name=gov /&gt; The option for an [[Opposition (parliamentary)|official opposition]] to be formed in the Assembly if there was sufficient cross community support was considered during the parliamentary debate however it was not included in the final act.&lt;ref name=ex /&gt;

== "Double-jobbing" ==
In 2009, a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] report recommended banning double-jobbing despite noting that it was a part of political culture in Northern Ireland as part of a legacy of [[The Troubles]] which had discouraged people from taking part in standing for elected office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grew |first=Tony |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/debateni/westminster-calls-time-on-stormonts-doublejobbers-29369723.html |title=Westminster calls time on Stormont's double-jobbers |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, at one point [[Ian Paisley]] was "triple-jobbing" as an MLA, MP and MEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3409211.stm |title=Paisley to stand down as MEP |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-01-19 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 all the major parties in Northern Ireland had agreed to the principle of ending double-jobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8673397.stm |title=Campbell 'to retain' dual mandate |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation prohibited people from being a member of the House of Commons, [[European Parliament]] or the Republic of Ireland's [[Dáil Éireann]] as well as an MLA. The legislation banned double-jobbing from the [[2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election]] but allowed those who currently held dual mandates to hold them until the election when they would have eight days to decide which legislature they wished to sit in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-29068877 |title=Northern Ireland double-jobbing to continue for now |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three members had this possibility at the time of passage, but following the 2015 UK general election, the last person in Northern Ireland with a dual mandate was [[Gregory Campbell (politician)|Gregory Campbell]] as an MLA and MP for [[East Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|East Londonderry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-35718796 |title=Gregory Campbell to stand down as MLA ahead of double-jobbing ban |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pinwale''' is the code name for a [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) collection and retrieval system for so-called "Digital Network Intelligence", including internet e-mail.&lt;ref name=homeland1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hstoday.us/blogs/the-kimery-report/blog/exclusive-nsas-x-keyscore-does-far-more-than-just-siphon-the-net-but-is-it-working/f419986393a64eec5bf2630815d3da3e.html | title=NSA’s X-KEYSCORE Does Far More than Just Siphon the ‘Net, But is it Working? | author=Anthony L.

The existence of the system was first revealed by an NSA analyst who was trained in its use during 2005.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; However, according to ''Homeland Security Today'', Pinwale has in it much more than email, it also contains other forms of Internet data, and other forms of digital communications as well. Its software has built-in protections against collecting from any of the [[Five Eyes]] members. Unlike its successor  [[XKeyscore]], targets for Pinwale have to be approved beforehand by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISC]].&lt;ref name=homeland1/&gt;

According to information obtained by ''[[The Guardian]]'' from [[Edward Snowden]], Pinwale is part of a "multi-tiered system" to address the issue of NSA "collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time." The system allows analysts to store "interesting" content in databases such as Pinwale, which is capable of storing material for up to five years.&lt;ref name =Guardian1&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data | title=XKeyscore: NSA tool collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet' | author=Glenn Greenwald | work=The Guardian | date=2013-07-31 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=2014-03-20 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OE0cg0RQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinwale consists of at least two known partitions referred to as "Sweet" and "Sour".&lt;ref name="theguardian-nsa-schlupflöcher"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/nsa-loophole-warrantless-searches-email-calls | title=NSA loophole allows warrantless search for US citizens' emails and phone calls | author=James Ball, Spencer Ackerman | work=The Guardian | date=2013-08-09 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=2014-03-23 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHWWXuPj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the documents leaked by Snowden, Pinwale normally processed about 60 GB of data per day without trouble. Pinwale was overwhelmed however when Yahoo started mass mailbox transfers between its datacenters, which were captured by the NSA's [[Muscular (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]] program that taps the [[Cloud_computing#Private_cloud|private cloud]]s of Google and Yahoo. Monitored email accounts being hacked by spammers also present a challenge to Pinwale, because they can cause the database of suspect email addresses to grow exponentially with information of no intelligence value.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-pinwale"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/how-the-nsas-muscular-tapped-googles-and-yahoos-private-networks/ | title=How the NSA’s MUSCULAR tapped Google’s and Yahoo’s private networks | author=Sean Gallagher | work=Ars Technica | date=2013-10-31 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=2014-03-23 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHXOnRtk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political fiction''' employs [[narrative]] to [[Political commentary|comment]] on [[political]] events, systems and theories. Works of political [[fiction]], such as '''political novels''', often "directly criticize an existing society or present an alternative, even fantastic, reality".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wesmaps/course0102/hist294s.htm "HIST 294 - Political Fiction"], Wesleyan University, accessed 12 December 2005  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916105750/http://www.wesleyan.edu/wesmaps/course0102/hist294s.htm |date=September 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The political novel overlaps with the [[social novel]], [[proletarian novel]], and [[social science fiction]].

[[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]] written around 380 BC, has been one of the world's most influential works of [[philosophy]] and [[Political philosophy|political theory]], both intellectually and historically.&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio (August 8, 2007). [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12594668 Plato's 'Republic' Still Influential, Author Says].

Plato: His Philosophy and his life, allphilosophers.com&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Republic'' is concerned with [[justice]] ([[:Wiktionary:δικαιοσύνη|δικαιοσύνη]]), the order and character of the just [[city-state]], and the just man.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhouse, Thomas and Smith, Nicholas D. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/plato.htm Plato (c. 427–347 BC)], The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, University of Tennessee, cf. ''Dating Plato's Dialogues''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other influential politically-themed works include [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' (1759), and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852).

Political fiction frequently employs [[satire]], often in the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian and dystopian]] genres.
This includes [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[dystopia]]s of the early 20th century such as [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', and [[George Orwell]]'s  ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

==Political satire==
The [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]]' plays are known for their political and social satire,&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in his criticism of the powerful Athenian general, [[Cleon]], in plays such as ''[[The Knights]]''. Aristophanes is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D.

[[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' (1729) is an 18th-century [[Juvenal]]ian [[Satire|satirical]] [[essay]] in which he suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. The satirical [[hyperbole]] mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policy toward the [[Irish people|Irish]] in general.

[[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) is an [[allegory|allegorical]] and [[dystopian novel|dystopian]] novella which satirises the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-historical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html|title=BBC - GCSE English Literature - 'Animal Farm' - historical context (pt 1/3)|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "[[Why I Write]]" (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 – An Age Like This 1945–1950'' p.&amp;nbsp;23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and was hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]]—an attitude that had been shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bowker, ''Orwell'' p.&amp;nbsp;224 ; Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and "Spilling the Spanish Beans", ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]], built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[Great purge|a reign of terror]]. Orwell described his ''Animal Farm'' as "a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin",{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946) he wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole."

Orwell's most famous work, however, is ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (published in 1949), many of whose terms and concepts, such as ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'', ''[[doublethink]]'', ''[[thoughtcrime]]'', ''[[Newspeak]]'', ''[[Room 101]]'', ''[[telescreen]]'', ''[[2 + 2 = 5]]'', and ''[[memory hole]]'', have entered into common use. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' popularised the adjective "[[Orwellian]]", which describes official deception, secret surveillance, and manipulation of recorded history by a [[totalitarian]] or [[authoritarian]] state.&lt;ref name="English Literature 2000. p. 726"&gt;The Oxford Companion to English Literature, Sixth Edition. University of Oxford Press: 2000. p. 726.&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th century==
The poet [[Jan Kochanowski]]'s play, ''[[Jan Kochanowski#Works|The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys]]'' (1578), the first [[tragedy]] written in the [[Polish language]], recounts an incident leading up to the [[Trojan War]].  Its theme of the responsibilities of statesmanship resonates to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Kieniewicz]], ed., ''Warszawa w latach 1526–1795'' (Warsaw in the Years 1526–1795), vol. II, Warsaw, 1984, {{ISBN|83-01-03323-1}}, pp. 157–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
The political [[comedy]], ''The Return of the Deputy'' (1790), by [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]]—Polish poet, playwright, statesman, and comrade-in-arms of [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]]—was written in about two weeks' time while Niemcewicz was serving as a deputy to the historic [[Four-Year Sejm]] of 1788–92.  The comedy's premiere in January 1791 was an enormous success, sparking widespread debate, royal communiques, and diplomatic correspondence.  As Niemcewicz had hoped, it set the stage for passage of Poland's epochal [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution of 3 May 1791]], which is regarded as Europe's first, and the world's second, modern written national constitution, after the [[United States Constitution]] implemented in 1789.  The comedy pits proponents against opponents of political reforms:  of abolishing the destabilizing [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of Poland's kings; of abolishing the legislatively destructive ''[[liberum veto]]''; of granting greater rights to [[peasant]]s and townspeople; of curbing the privileges of the mostly self-interested [[szlachta|noble class]]; and of promoting a more active Polish role in international affairs, in the interest of stopping the depredations of Poland's neighbors, Russia, Prussia, and Austria (who will in 1795 complete the dismemberment of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]).  Romantic interest is provided by a rivalry between a reformer and a conservative for a young lady's hand—which is won by the proponent of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Zdzisław Skwarczyński|Zdzisław Skwarczyński]], ''wstęp'' (introduction) to [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], ''[[:pl:Powrót posła|Powrót posła]]'' (The Return of the Deputy), Wrocław, [[Ossolineum]], 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century novel==
An early example of the political novel is ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' (1827) by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], an Italian [[historical novel]]. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years of direct Spanish rule, it has been seen sometimes as a veiled attack on the [[Austrian Empire]], which controlled [[Italy]] at the time the novel was written. It has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.&lt;ref name="Archibald Colquhoun 1954"&gt;Archibald Colquhoun. ''Manzoni and his Times.'' J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, London, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s British politician [[Benjamin Disraeli]] wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With ''[[Coningsby (novel)|Coningsby; or, The New Generation]]'' (1844), Disraeli, in historian [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]]'s view, "infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that England's future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians."&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/benjamin-disraeli-essays/disraeli-benjamin "Benjamin Disraeli 1804–1881"], '' Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism'', eNotes, accessed 25 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coningsby''  was followed by ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil; or, The Two Nations]]'' (1845), another political novel, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than ''Coningsby''; the "two nations" of its subtitle referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived working classes. The last of Disraeli's political-novel trilogy, ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred; or, The New Crusade]]'' (1847), promoted the Church of England's role in reviving Britain's flagging spirituality.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;

[[Ivan Turgenev]] wrote ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' (1862) as a response to the growing cultural schism that he saw between [[Russia]]'s liberals of the 1830s and 1840s, and the growing Russian [[nihilist movement]] among their sons. Both the nihilists and the 1830s liberals sought Western-based social change in Russia. Additionally, these two modes of thought were contrasted with the [[Slavophile]]s, who believed that Russia's path lay in its [[Russian Orthodox Church|traditional spirituality]].  Turgenev's novel was responsible for popularizing the use of the term "[[Nihilist movement|nihilism]]", which became widely used after the novel was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nihilismus|url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/05/0510_Nihilismus.pdf|publisher=Johannes Kepler University|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Polish writer [[Bolesław Prus]]' novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895), is set in the Egypt of 1087&amp;ndash;85 BCE as that country experiences internal stresses and external threats that will culminate in the fall of its [[Twentieth Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]]. The young protagonist Ramses learns that those who would challenge [[The powers that be (phrase)|the powers that be]] are vulnerable to co-option, [[seduction]], subornation, [[defamation]], intimidation, and [[assassination]]. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, is the importance, to power, of [[knowledge]].  Prus' vision of the fall of an ancient civilization derives some of its power from the author's intimate awareness of the final demise of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, a century before he completed ''Pharaoh''.  This is a political awareness that Prus shared with his 10-years-junior novelist compatriot, [[Joseph Conrad]], who was an admirer of Prus' writings.  ''Pharaoh'' has been translated into 20 languages and adapted as a 1966 Polish [[Pharaoh (film)|feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXI, nos. 2-3, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known to have been [[Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin's]] favourite book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation", p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th-century novel==
[[Joseph Conrad]] wrote several novels with political themes:  ''[[Nostromo]] (1904)'', ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' (1907), and
''[[Under Western Eyes (novel)|Under Western Eyes]]'' (1911). ''Nostromo'' (1904) is set amid political upheaval in the fictitious [[South America]]n country of Costaguana, where a trusted Italian-descended longshoreman, Giovanni Battista Fidanza—the novel's [[eponym]]ous "Nostromo" (Italian for "our man")—is instructed by English-descended silver-mine owner Charles Gould to take Gould's silver abroad so that it will not fall into the hands of revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Conrad]], ''[[Nostromo]]'', 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of politics is paramount in ''The Secret Agent'', as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The plot to destroy [[Greenwich Observatory]] is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing "must be purely destructive" and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion "should make it clear that [they] are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation."&lt;ref name="anarchist"&gt;{{Citation | first = Joseph | last = Conrad | year = 1993 | title = The Secret Agent | place = London | publisher = Penguin | page = 35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency. Conrad's third political novel, ''Under Western Eyes'', is connected to Russian history. Its first audience read it against the backdrop of the failed [[Revolution of 1905]] and in the shadow of the movements and impulses that would take shape as the [[Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conrad: The Critical Heritage |editor=Norman Sherry |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |year=1973 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad's earlier novella, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), also had political implications, in its depiction of European [[colonialism|colonial]] depredations in [[Africa]], which Conrad witnessed during his employ in the [[Congo Free State|Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology'', 7th edition, 2000, p. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939) is a passionate depiction of the plight of the poor. However, many of Steinbeck's contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack writes: "Steinbeck was attacked as a [[propaganda|propagandist]] and a [[Socialism|socialist]] from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the book's depiction of California farmers' attitudes and conduct toward the migrants. They denounced the book as a 'pack of lies' and labeled it 'communist propaganda'".&lt;ref name=cordyack&gt;{{cite web

''[[The Quiet American]]'' (1955) by English novelist [[Graham Greene]] questions the foundations of growing American involvement in Vietnam in the 1950s. The novel has received much attention due to its prediction of the outcome of the Vietnam War and subsequent American foreign policy since the 1950s. Graham Greene portrays a U.S. official named Pyle as so blinded by [[American exceptionalism]] that he cannot see the calamities he brings upon the Vietnamese.  The book uses Greene's experiences as a war correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[Le Figaro]]'' in [[French Indochina]] in 1951–54.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Bacevich, "Best Intentions: An Appreciation of Graham Greene".  World Affairs [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/best-intentions-appreciation-graham-greene]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proletarian novel==
The [[proletarian novel]] is written by workers, mainly for other workers. It overlaps and sometimes is synonymous with the working-class novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus, ''The Socialist Novel in Britain: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition''. ( Brighton: Harvester Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; socialist novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social problem novel|social-problem novel]] (also problem novel, sociological novel, or [[social novel]]),&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook to Literature'' 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1996), p.487; "social problem novel." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 02 Nov. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/664323/social-problem-novel]&lt;/ref&gt; propaganda or thesis novel,&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon (revised C. E. Preston), ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory''. (London: Penguin, 1999), pp. 704, 913&lt;/ref&gt; and [[socialist realism|socialist-realism]] novel. The intention of the writers of proletarian literature is to lift the workers from the slums by inspiring them to embrace the possibilities of social change or of a political revolution. As such, it is a form of political fiction.

The proletarian novel may [[Political commentary|comment]] on [[political]] events, systems, and theories, and is frequently seen as an instrument to promote social reform or political revolution among the working classes. Proletarian literature is created especially by [[communist]], [[socialist]], and [[anarchist]] authors. It is about the lives of the poor, and the period from 1930 to 1945, in particular, produced many such novels. However, proletarian works were also produced before and after those dates. In Britain, the terms "[[working class|working-class]]" literature, novel, etc., are more generally used.

==Social novel==
A closely related type of novel, which frequently has a political dimension, is the [[social novel]] – also known as the "social-problem" or "social-protest" novel – a "work of fiction in which a prevailing social problem, such as gender, race, or class prejudice, is dramatized through its effect on the characters of a novel".&lt;ref&gt;"social problem novel" in ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 04 Nov. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/664323/social-problem-novel].&lt;/ref&gt; More specific examples of social problems that are addressed in such works include poverty, conditions in factories and mines, the plight of child labor, violence against women, rising criminality, and epidemics caused by overcrowding and poor sanitation in cities.&lt;ref&gt;"Childers, JW (2001)"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Dickens]] was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens "issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together".&lt;ref name="KucichSadoff"&gt;{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[George Orwell]], in his essay on Dickens, wrote: "There is no clear sign that he wants the existing order to be overthrown, or that he believes it would make very much difference if it were overthrown. For in reality his target is not so much society as 'human nature'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eliot|first=George|title=Charles Dickens|url=http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/dickens/english/e_chd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickens's second novel, ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it destroyed middle-class polemics about criminals, making any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]]'s [[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]] (1854) is set in a small [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] industrial town and particularly criticizes the effect of [[Utilitarianism]] on the lives of cities' working classes. [[John Ruskin]] declared ''Hard Times'' his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions. [[Walter Allen]] characterised ''Hard Times'' as an unsurpassed "critique of industrial society",

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12441">In [[computational complexity theory]], the '''polynomial hierarchy''' (sometimes called the '''polynomial-time hierarchy''') is a [[hierarchy (mathematics)|hierarchy]] of [[complexity class]]es that generalize the classes [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and [[co-NP]] to [[oracle machine]]s.  It is a resource-bounded counterpart to the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]] from [[mathematical logic]].

==Definitions==
There are multiple equivalent definitions of the classes of the polynomial hierarchy.

{{ordered list
|1= For the oracle definition of the polynomial hierarchy, define

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_0^\mathsf{P} := \Sigma_0^\mathsf{P} := \Pi_0^\mathsf{P} := \mathsf{P},&lt;/math&gt;

where [[P (complexity)|P]] is the set of [[decision problem]]s solvable in [[polynomial time]]. Then for i ≥ 0 define

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{i+1}^\mathsf{P} := \mathsf{P}^{\Sigma_i^\mathsf{P}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{i+1}^\mathsf{P} := \mathsf{NP}^{\Sigma_i^\mathsf{P}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i+1}^\mathsf{P} := \mathsf{coNP}^{\Sigma_i^\mathsf{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{P}^{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[decision problem]]s solvable in polynomial time by a [[Turing machine]] augmented by an [[oracle machine|oracle]] for some complete problem in class A; the classes &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{NP}^{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{coNP}^{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; are defined analogously.  For example, &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_1^\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}, \Pi_1^\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{coNP} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \Delta_2^\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{P^{NP}} &lt;/math&gt; is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with an oracle for some NP-complete problem.

|2= For the existential/universal definition of the polynomial hierarchy, let {{mvar|L}} be a [[formal language|language]] (i.e. a [[decision problem]], a subset of {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;), let {{mvar|p}} be a [[polynomial]], and define

: &lt;math&gt; \exists^p L := \left\{ x \in \{0,1\}^* \ \left| \ \left( \exists w \in \{0,1\}^{\leq p(|x|)} \right) \langle x,w \rangle \in L \right. \right\}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle x,w \rangle \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt; is some standard encoding of the pair of binary strings ''x'' and ''w'' as a single binary string. ''L'' represents a set of ordered pairs of strings, where the first string ''x'' is a member of &lt;math&gt;\exists^p L&lt;/math&gt;, and the second string ''w'' is a "short" (&lt;math&gt;|w| \leq p(|x|) &lt;/math&gt;) witness testifying that ''x'' is a member of &lt;math&gt;\exists^p L&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;x \in \exists^p L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a short  witness ''w'' such that &lt;math&gt; \langle x,w \rangle \in L &lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, define

: &lt;math&gt; \forall^p L := \left\{ x \in \{0,1\}^* \ \left| \ \left( \forall w \in \{0,1\}^{\leq p(|x|)} \right) \langle x,w \rangle \in L \right. \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
Note that [[De Morgan's laws]] hold: &lt;math&gt; \left( \exists^p L \right)^{\rm c} = \forall^p L^{\rm c} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \left( \forall^p L \right)^{\rm c} = \exists^p L^{\rm c} &lt;/math&gt;, where ''L''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; is the complement of ''L''.

Let {{mathcal|C}} be a class of languages. Extend these operators to work on whole classes of languages by the definition

:&lt;math&gt;\exists^\mathsf{P} \mathcal{C} := \left\{\exists^p L \ | \ p \text{ is a polynomial and } L \in \mathcal{C} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall^\mathsf{P} \mathcal{C} := \left\{\forall^p L \ | \ p \text{ is a polynomial and } L \in \mathcal{C} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, De Morgan's laws hold: &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{co} \exists^\mathsf{P} \mathcal{C} = \forall^\mathsf{P} \mathsf{co} \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{co} \forall^\mathsf{P} \mathcal{C} = \exists^\mathsf{P} \mathsf{co} \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{co}\mathcal{C} = \left\{ L^c | L \in \mathcal{C} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The classes '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and '''[[co-NP]]''' can be defined as &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{NP} = \exists^\mathsf{P} \mathsf{P} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{coNP} = \forall^\mathsf{P} \mathsf{P} &lt;/math&gt;, where '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''' is the class of all feasibly (polynomial-time) decidable languages. The polynomial hierarchy can be defined recursively as

:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma_0^\mathsf{P} := \Pi_0^\mathsf{P} := \mathsf{P} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma_{k+1}^\mathsf{P} := \exists^\mathsf{P} \Pi_k^\mathsf{P} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi_{k+1}^\mathsf{P} := \forall^\mathsf{P} \Sigma_k^\mathsf{P} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{NP} = \Sigma_1^\mathsf{P} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{coNP} = \Pi_1^\mathsf{P} &lt;/math&gt;.

This definition reflects the close connection between the polynomial hierarchy and the [[arithmetical hierarchy]], where '''[[Decidable language|R]]''' and '''[[Recursively enumerable language|RE]]''' play roles analogous to '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''' and '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', respectively. The [[analytic hierarchy]] is also defined in a similar way to give a hierarchy of subsets of the real numbers.

|3=An equivalent definition in terms of [[alternating Turing machine]]s defines &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt; (respectively, &lt;math&gt;\Pi_k^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;) as the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time on an alternating Turing machine with {{mvar|k}} alternations starting in an existential (respectively, universal) state.

==Relations between classes in the polynomial hierarchy==
[[Image:Polynomial time hierarchy.svg|250px|thumb|right|Commutative diagram equivalent to the polynomial time hierarchy. The arrows denote inclusion.]]
The definitions imply the relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i^\mathsf{P} \subseteq \Delta_{i+1}^\mathsf{P} \subseteq \Sigma_{i+1}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_i^\mathsf{P} \subseteq \Delta_{i+1}^\mathsf{P} \subseteq \Pi_{i+1}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i^\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{co}\Pi_{i}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the arithmetic and analytic hierarchies, whose inclusions are known to be proper, it is an open question whether any of these inclusions are proper, though it is widely believed that they all are.  If any &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^\mathsf{P} = \Sigma_{k+1}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;, or if any &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^\mathsf{P} = \Pi_{k}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;, then the hierarchy ''collapses to level k'': for all &lt;math&gt;i &gt; k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i^\mathsf{P} = \Sigma_k^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, if [[P = NP]], then the hierarchy collapses completely.

The union of all classes in the polynomial hierarchy is the complexity class '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]'''.

== Properties ==
{{unsolved|computer science|{{tmath|1= \mathsf{PH} \overset{?}{=} \mathsf{PSPACE} }}}}

The polynomial hierarchy is an analogue (at much lower complexity) of the [[exponential hierarchy]] and [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

It is known that PH is contained within [[PSPACE]], but it is not known whether the two classes are equal. One useful reformulation of this problem is that PH = PSPACE if and only if [[SO (complexity)|second-order logic over finite structures]] gains no additional power from the addition of a [[transitive closure]] operator.

If the polynomial hierarchy has any [[complete problem]]s, then it has only finitely many distinct levels.  Since there are [[PSPACE-complete]] problems, we know that if PSPACE = PH, then the polynomial hierarchy must collapse, since a PSPACE-complete problem would be a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{k}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;-complete problem for some ''k''.

Each class in the polynomial hierarchy contains &lt;math&gt;\leq_{\rm m}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;-complete problems (problems complete under polynomial-time many-one reductions). Furthermore, each class in the polynomial hierarchy is ''closed under &lt;math&gt;\leq_{\rm m}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;-reductions'': meaning that for a class {{mathcal|C}} in the hierarchy and a language &lt;math&gt;L \in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;A \leq_{\rm m}^\mathsf{P} L&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; as well. These two facts together imply that if &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; is a complete problem for &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{i}^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{i+1}^\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}^{K_i}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i+1}^\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{coNP}^{K_i}&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{2}^\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}^\mathsf{SAT}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if a language is defined based on some oracle in {{mathcal|C}}, then we can assume that it is defined based on a complete problem for {{mathcal|C}}. Complete problems therefore act as "representatives" of the class for which they are complete.

The [[Sipser–Lautemann theorem]] states that the class [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.

[[Karp–Lipton theorem|Kannan's theorem]] states that for any ''k'', &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; is not contained in '''SIZE'''(n&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;).

[[Toda's theorem]] states that the polynomial hierarchy is contained in P&lt;sup&gt;#P&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Problems in the polynomial hierarchy==
{{unordered list
|1=
An example of a natural problem in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt; is ''circuit minimization'': given a number ''k'' and a circuit ''A'' computing a [[Boolean function]] ''f'', determine if there is a circuit with at most ''k'' gates that computes the same function ''f''. Let {{mathcal|C}} be the set of all boolean circuits. The language

:&lt;math&gt; L = \left\{ \langle A,k,B,x \rangle \in \mathcal{C} \times \mathbb{N} \times \mathcal{C} \times \{0,1\}^*  
\left|
B \text{ has at most } k \text{ gates, and } A(x)=B(x) 
\right.
\right\} &lt;/math&gt;

is decidable in polynomial time. The language

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{CM} = \left\{ \langle A,k \rangle \in \mathcal{C} \times \mathbb{N} 
\left| 
\begin{matrix}
\text{there exists a circuit } B \text{ with at most } k \text{ gates } \\
\text{ such that } A \text{ and } B \text{ compute the same function} 
\end{matrix}
\right.
\right\} &lt;/math&gt;

is the circuit minimization language. &lt;math&gt; \mathit{CM} \in \Sigma_2^\mathsf{P} (= \exists^\mathsf{P} \forall^\mathsf{P} \mathsf{P}) &lt;/math&gt; because {{mvar|L}} is decidable in polynomial time and because, given &lt;math&gt; \langle A,k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \langle A,k \rangle \in \mathit{CM}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''there exists'' a circuit {{mvar|B}} such that ''for all'' inputs {{mvar|x}}, &lt;math&gt; \langle A,k,B,x \rangle \in L &lt;/math&gt;.

|2=
A complete problem for &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt; is '''satisfiability for quantified Boolean formulas with ''k'' alternations of quantifiers''' (abbreviated '''QBF&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''' or '''QSAT&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''). This is the version of the [[boolean satisfiability problem]] for &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;. In this problem, we are given a Boolean formula ''f'' with variables partitioned into ''k'' sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. We have to determine if it is true that 
:&lt;math&gt; \exists X_1 \forall X_2 \exists X_3 \ldots f&lt;/math&gt;
That is, is there an assignment of values to variables in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that, for all assignments of values in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists an assignment of values to variables in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''f'' is true?

The variant above is complete for &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;. The variant in which the first quantifier is "for all", the second is "exists", etc., is complete for &lt;math&gt;\Pi_k^\mathsf{P}&lt;/math&gt;.

and higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy can be found in [http://ovid.cs.depaul.edu/documents/phcom.pdf this Compendium].

'''Prohibition''' is the act or practice of forbidding something by law; more particularly the term refers to the banning of the [[manufacturing|manufacture]], storage (whether in [[barrel]]s or in [[bottle]]s), [[transport]]ation, sale, possession, and consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. The word is also used to refer to a period of time during which such bans are enforced.

==History==
[[File:The Drunkard's Progress - Color.jpg|thumb|The Drunkard's Progress: A lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] supporting the temperance movement, January 1846.]]
Some kind of limitation on the trade in alcohol can be seen in the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (ca.1772 BCE) specifically banning the selling of beer for money.  It could only be bartered for barley: "If a beer seller do not receive barley as the price for beer, but if she receive money or make the beer a measure smaller than the barley measure received, they shall throw her into the water."&lt;ref&gt;Benton and DiYanni. ''Arts and Culture, An Introduction to the Humanities''. Volume One. Fourth Edition. Pearson. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western world, one of the great moral issues of the nineteenth century was slavery, but once that battle was won, social moralists turned to their next targets, one of which was prohibition. In the early twentieth century, much of the impetus for the prohibition movement in the Nordic countries and North America came from moralistic convictions of pietistic Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], ''The winning of the Midwest: social and political conflict, 1888–1896'' (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XpCgCNZwpvoC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22Iowa+wet+or+dry%22+intitle:winning+intitle:midwest+inauthor:jensen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HeNKT5_RKYKtsAK409nqCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 89–121 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibition movements in the West coincided with the advent of [[women's suffrage]], with newly empowered women as part of the political process strongly supporting policies that curbed alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aileen Kraditor]], ''The Ideas of the Woman Suffrage Movement, 1890–1920'' (1965) pp. 12–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Myra Goodman Benjamin, ''A history of the anti-suffrage movement in the United States from 1895 to 1920: women against equality'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the 20th century saw periods of prohibition of alcoholic beverages in several countries:
* 1907 to 1948 in [[Prince Edward Island]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9lWztgWymgC&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=prohibition%20%22prince%20edward%20island%22%2C%20alcohol&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q=prohibition%20%22prince%20edward%20island%22,%20alcohol&amp;f=false Heath, Dwight B. (1995). International handbook on alcohol and culture. Westport, CT. Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 21] There seems to be agreement in the literature for 1948 but various dates are given for the initiation of PEI's prohibition legislation. 1907 is the latest. 1900, 1901 and 1902 are given by others.&lt;/ref&gt; and for shorter periods in other provinces in Canada
* 1907 to 1992 in the [[Faroe Islands]]; limited private imports from Denmark were allowed from 1928
* 1914 to 1925&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbth.com/opinion/2014/08/15/sobering_effect_what_happened_when_russia_banned_booze_39045.html "Sobering effect: What happened when Russia banned booze"]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]]
* 1915 to 1933 in Iceland (beer was still prohibited until 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/11/world/beer-soon-for-icelanders.html Beer (Soon) for Icelanders], ''New York Times'', May 11, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1916 to 1927 in Norway (fortified wine and beer were also prohibited from 1917 to 1923)
* 1919 in the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], March 21 to August 1; called ''szesztilalom''
* 1919 to 1932 in Finland (called ''kieltolaki'', "ban law")
* 1920 to 1933 in the United States

After several years, prohibition failed in North America and elsewhere. [[Rum-running|Rum-running or bootlegging]] became widespread, and [[organized crime]] took control of the distribution of alcohol.  Distilleries and breweries in Canada, Mexico and the [[Caribbean]] flourished as their products were either consumed by visiting Americans or illegally exported to the United States.  [[Chicago]] became notorious as a haven for prohibition dodgers during the time known as the [[Roaring Twenties]].  Prohibition generally came to an end in the late 1920s or early 1930s in most of North America and Europe, although a few locations continued prohibition for many more years.

In [[List of countries with alcohol prohibition|some countries]] where the dominant religion forbids the use of alcohol, the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited or restricted today.  For example, in Saudi Arabia and Libya alcohol is banned; in Pakistan and Iran it is illegal with exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21560543|title=Tipsy Taboo|work=The Economist|date=18 August 2012|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===Afghanistan===
Sale of alcohol is banned in Afghanistan.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, alcohol is somewhat prohibited due to its [[Islam and alcohol#Intoxicants|proscription in the Islamic faith]].  However, the purchase and consumption is allowed in the country.  The [[Garo people|Garo]] tribe consume a type of rice beer, and Christians in this country drink and purchase wine for their [[Eucharist|holy communion]].

===Brunei===
In [[Brunei]], alcohol consumption and sale is banned in public. Non-Muslims are allowed to purchase a limited amount of alcohol from their point of embarcation overseas for their own private consumption, and non-Muslims who are at least the age of 18 are allowed to bring in not more than two bottles of liquor (about two [[litre]]s) and twelve cans of beer per person into the country.

===India===
{{main|Alcohol prohibition in India}} 
{{further|Temperance movement in India}}
In India alcohol is a state subject and individual states can legislate prohibition, but currently most states do not have prohibition and sale/consumption is freely available in 25 out of [[Indian states|29 states]]. Prohibition is in force in the states of [[Gujarat]], [[Bihar]] and [[Nagaland]], parts of [[Manipur]], and the [[union territory]] of [[Lakshadweep]]. All other [[States and union territories of India]] permit the sale of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bihar-liquor-ban-states-having-total-prohibition-gujarat-kerala/|title=States with total and phase-wise prohibition of alcohol in India|publisher= [[The Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Election days and certain national holidays such as ''[[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]]'' are meant to be ''dry days'' when liquor sale is not permitted but consumption is allowed. Some Indian states observe dry days on major religious festivals/occasions depending on the popularity of the festival in that region.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Iran===
Since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]], the sale and consumption of alcohol is banned in Iran. All people are banned from drinking alcohol but some people trade and sell it illegaly .&lt;ref name="Gorder2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Christian Van Gorder|title=Christianity in Persia and the Status of Non-muslims in Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeHAxxEpe-cC&amp;pg=PA195|year=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7391-3609-6|pages=195–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
Alcohol sales are banned in small shops and convenience stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/indonesias-new-alcohol-ban/|title=Indonesia’s New Alcohol Ban|author=Prashanth Parameswaran, The Diplomat|work=The Diplomat|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kuwait===
The consumption, importation and brewing of, and trafficking in liquor is strictly against the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-kuwait Living in Kuwait - GOV.UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
Alcohol is banned only for Muslims in Malaysia due to its Islamic faith and sharia law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/alcohol-policies-malaysia-108164.html|title=Alcohol Policies in Malaysia|author=Jason Cristiano Ramon, Demand Media|work=Travel Tips – USA Today|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, alcoholic products can easily be found in supermarkets, specialty shops, and convenience stores all over the country. Non-[[halal]] restaurants also typically sell alcohol.

===Maldives===
The [[Maldives]] ban the import of alcohol, x-raying all baggage on arrival. Alcoholic beverages are available only to foreign tourists on [[Island resort|resort islands]] and may not be taken off the [[resort]].

===Pakistan===
{{further|Temperance movement in India}}
Pakistan allowed the free sale and consumption of alcohol for three decades from 1947, but restrictions were introduced by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] just weeks before he was removed as prime minister in 1977. Since then, only members of non-Muslim minorities such as [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Christian]]s and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] are allowed to apply for alcohol permits. The monthly quota is dependent upon one's income, but usually is about five bottles of liquor or 100 bottles of beer. In a country of 180 million, only about 60 outlets are allowed to sell alcohol. The [[Murree Brewery]] in [[Rawalpindi]] was once the only legal brewery, but today there are more. The ban officially is enforced by the country's Islamic Ideology Council, but it is not strictly policed. Members of religious minorities, however, often sell their liquor permits to Muslims as part of a continuing black market trade in alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/10/1047144915849.html?from=moreStories |title=Lone brewer small beer in Pakistan |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2003-03-11 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
There are only restrictions during elections in the Philippines. Alcohol is prohibited from purchase two days prior to an election. The Philippine [Commission on Elections] may opt to extend the liquor ban. In the [[Philippine general election, 2010|2010 elections]], the liquor ban was a minimum two days; in the [[Philippine general election, 2013|2013 elections]], there was a proposal that it be extended to five days.  This was overturned by the Supreme Court.

Other than election-related prohibition, alcohol is freely sold to anyone above the [[legal drinking age]].

===Thailand===
Alcohol is prohibited from being sold during [[Elections in Thailand|election time]], from 6 pm the day prior to voting, until the end of the day of voting itself.  Alcohol is also prohibited on major [[Public holidays in Thailand|Buddhist holy days]], and sometimes on Royal Commemoration days, such as birthdays.

Thailand also enforces time-limited bans on alcohol on a daily basis. Alcohol can only be legally purchased in stores or restaurants between 11 am–2 pm and 5 pm–midnight. This law is enforced by all major retailers (most notably 7-Eleven) and restaurants but is frequently ignored by the smaller 'mom and pop' stores. Hotels and resorts are exempt from the rules.

The consumption of alcohol is also banned at any time within 200 meters of a filling station (where sale of alcohol is also illegal), schools, temples or hospitals as well as on board any type of road vehicle regardless of whether it is being consumed by the driver or passenger.

At certain times of the year – Thai New Year (Songkran) as an example – the government may also enforce arbitrary bans on the sale and consumption of alcohol in specific public areas where large scale festivities are due to take place and large crowds are expected.

On 14 September 2012, the government of the [[Czech Republic]] banned all sales of liquor with more than 20% alcohol. From this date on it was illegal to sell such alcoholic beverages in shops, supermarkets, bars, restaurants, gas stations, [[e-shop]]s etc. This measure was taken in response to the wave of [[methanol poisoning]] cases resulting in the deaths of 18 people in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nečas: Liquor needs new stamps before hitting the shelves|url=http://praguemonitor.com/2012/09/20/ne%C4%8D-liquor-needs-new-stamps-hitting-shelves|accessdate=2012-09-20 |newspaper=Prague Daily Monitor (ČTK)|date=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of the "[[2012 Czech Republic methanol poisonings|methanol affair]]" the total number of deaths has increased to 25.

===Nordic countries===&lt;!-- This section is linked from many places --&gt;
The [[Nordic countries]], with the exception of [[Denmark]], have had a strong [[temperance movement]] since the late 1800s, closely linked to the [[Christian revival]] movement of the late 19th century, but also to several worker organisations. As an example, in 1910 the temperance organisations in [[Sweden]] had some 330,000 members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iogt.info/106_Historia-2.html IOGT history] (in Swedish) Retrieved 2011-12-08&lt;/ref&gt; which was about 6% of a population of 5.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scb.se/Grupp/Hitta_statistik/Historisk_statistik/_Dokument/BISOS_A/1910/Befolkning%20A%20Historisk%20statistik%201900-talet%201910.pdf SCB Population statistics for 1910] (in Swedish) Retrieved 2011-12-08&lt;/ref&gt; This heavily influenced the decisions of Nordic politicians in the early 20th century.

In 1907, the [[Faroe Islands]] passed a law prohibiting all sale of alcohol, which was in force until 1992. Very restricted private importation from Denmark was allowed from 1928 on.

In 1914, Sweden put in place a rationing system, the [[Bratt System]], in force until 1955. A [[Swedish prohibition referendum, 1922|referendum in 1922]] rejected an attempt to enforce total prohibition.

In 1915, [[Prohibition in Iceland|Iceland instituted total prohibition]]. The ban for wine was lifted in 1922 and spirits in 1935, but beer remained prohibited until 1989 (cirumvented by mixing light beer and spirits).

In 1916, [[Norway]] prohibited [[distilled beverage]]s, and in 1917 the prohibition was extended to also include [[fortified wine]] and beer. The wine and beer ban was lifted in 1923, and in 1927 
[[Norwegian continued prohibition referendum, 1926|the ban of distilled beverages was also lifted]].

In 1919, [[Finland]] enacted prohibition, as one of the first acts after independence from the [[Russian Empire]]. Four previous attempts to institute prohibition in the early 20th century had failed due to opposition from the [[Nicholas II of Russia|tsar]]. After a development similar to the one in the United States during its prohibition, with large-scale [[smuggling]] and increasing violence and crime rates, public opinion turned against the prohibition, and after a national [[Finnish prohibition referendum, 1931|referendum]] where 70% voted for a repeal of the law, prohibition was ended in early 1932.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Wuorinen, "Finland's Prohibition Experiment," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' vol. 163, (Sep. 1932), pp. 216–26 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1017701 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Sariola, "Prohibition in Finland, 1919–1932; its background and consequences," ''Quarterly Journal of Studies in Alcohol'' (Sep. 1954) 15(3) pp. 477–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, all Nordic countries (with the exception of Denmark) continue to have strict controls on the sale of alcohol which is highly taxed (dutied) to the public. There are [[alcohol monopoly|government monopolies]] in place for selling spirits, wine, and stronger beers in Norway ([[Vinmonopolet]]), Finland ([[Alko]]), Sweden ([[Systembolaget]]), [[Iceland]] ([[Vínbúð]]in), and the Faroe Islands ([[Rúsdrekkasøla Landsins]]). Bars and restaurants may, however, import alcoholic beverages directly or through other companies.
{{See also|Alcoholic beverages in Sweden|Algoth Niska}}

[[Greenland]], which is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], does not share its easier controls on the sale of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefourthcontinent.com/2013/07/26/imagine-drinking-water-only-alcohol-and-greenland/|title=Imagine drinking water only: alcohol and Greenland|work=The Fourth Continent|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenland has (like Denmark) sales in food shops, but prices are high. Private import when traveling from Denmark is only allowed in small quantities.

===Russian Empire and the Soviet Union===
{{Main|Prohibition in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union}}
In the [[Russian Empire]], a limited version of a Dry Law was introduced in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;I.N. Vvedensky, [http://www.tvereza.info/downloads/literature/forcedabstinenceexperience_ru.html#fae-results An Experience in Enforced Abstinence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221151810/http://tvereza.info/downloads/literature/forcedabstinenceexperience_ru.html |date=2008-12-21 }} (1915), Moscow (Введенский И. Н. Опыт принудительной трезвости. М.: Издание Московского Столичного Попечительства о Народной Трезвости, 1915.) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued through the turmoil of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] into the period of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] until 1925.

===United Kingdom===
Although the sale or consumption of commercial alcohol has never been prohibited by law in the United Kingdom, historically, various groups in the UK have campaigned for the prohibition of alcohol; including the [[Society of Friends]] (Quakers), [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|The Methodist Church]] and other [[non-conformists]], as well as temperance movements such as [[Hope UK|Band of Hope]] and [[Chartism|temperance Chartist]] movements of the nineteenth century.

Formed in 1853 and inspired by the [[Maine law]] in the United States, the [[United Kingdom Alliance]] aimed at promoting a similar law prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the UK. This hard-line group of prohibitionists was opposed by other temperance organisations who preferred moral persuasion to a legal ban. This division in the ranks limited the effectiveness of the temperance movement as a whole. The impotence of legislation in this field was demonstrated when the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840–1859|Sale of Beer Act 1854]] which restricted Sunday opening hours had to be repealed, following widespread rioting. In 1859, a prototype prohibition bill was overwhelmingly defeated in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Brownlee (2002) ''This is Alcohol'': 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 1917, during the [[First World War]] at a crowded meeting in the [[Queen's Hall]] in London (chaired by [[Alfred Booth]]) many influential people including [[Agnes Weston]] spoke, or letters from them were read out, against alcohol consumption, calling for prohibition; General Sir [[Reginald Hart]] wrote to the meeting that "Every experienced officer knew that practically all unhappiness and crime in the Army is due to drink". At the meeting, [[Lord Channing]] said that it was a pity that the whole [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] did not follow the example of [[King George V]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] when in 1914 those two spoke calling for complete prohibition for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Friday 23 March 1917, reprinted in ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Thursday 23 March 2017, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
{{Main|Prohibition in Canada}}

An official, but non-binding, federal referendum on prohibition was held in 1898. Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier's government chose not to introduce a federal bill on prohibition, mindful of the strong antipathy in [[Quebec]]. As a result, Canadian prohibition was instead enacted through laws passed by the provinces during the first twenty years of the 20th century. The provinces repealed their prohibition laws, mostly during the 1920s.

===Mexico===
Some communities in the [[Chiapas]] state of southern Mexico are under the control of the radical leftist [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]], and often ban alcohol as part of what was described as "a collective decision". This prohibition has been used by many villages as a way to decrease domestic violence{{failed verification|date=May 2017}} and has generally been favored by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narconews.com/Issue33/article971.html |title=The Zapatistas Reject the War on Drugs |publisher=Narco News |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this prohibition is not recognized by federal Mexican law as the Zapatista movement is strongly opposed by the federal government.

The sale and purchase of alcohol is prohibited on and the night before certain national holidays, such as ''[[Fiestas Patrias (Mexico)|Natalicio de Benito Juárez]]'' (birthdate of [[Benito Juárez]]) and ''[[Fiestas Patrias (Mexico)|Día de la Revolución]]'', which are meant to be dry nationally. The same "dry law" applies to the days before presidential elections every six years.

Prohibition in the United States focused on the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages; however, exceptions were made for medicinal and religious uses. Alcohol consumption was never illegal under federal law. Nationwide Prohibition did not begin in the United States until January 1920, when the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] went into effect. The 18th amendment was ratified in 1919, and was repealed in December 1933 with the ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa  McGirr,  ''The War on Alcohol: Prohibition and the Rise of the American State'' (2015) [https://www.amazon.com/War-Alcohol-Prohibition-American-State/dp/0393066959/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperance movement====
Concern over excessive alcohol consumption began during the American colonial era, when fines were imposed for drunken behavior and for selling liquor without a license.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition&gt;{{cite web | author = | title =History of Alcohol Prohibition | work = | publisher =Schaffer Library of Drug Policy | date = | url =http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/nc/nc2a.htm | accessdate =2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, when drinking was a part of everyday American life, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] religious groups, especially the [[Methodism|Methodists]], and health reformers, including [[Benjamin Rush]] and others, urged Americans to curb their drinking habits for moral and health reasons. In particular, Benjamin Rush believed Americans were drinking hard spirits in excess, so he created "A Moral and Physical Thermometer," displaying the progression of behaviors caused by the consumption of various alcohols. By the 1840s the [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]] was actively encouraging individuals to reduce alcohol consumption. Music ([[Temperance songs|a completely new genre]]) was composed and performed in support of the efforts, both in social contexts and in response to state legislation attempts to regulate alcohol. Many took a pledge of total abstinence ([[teetotalism]]) from drinking distilled liquor as well as beer and wine. Prohibition remained a major reform movement from the 1840s until the 1920s, when nationwide prohibition went into effect, and was supported by evangelical Protestant churches, especially the [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. [[Kansas]] and [[Maine]] were early adopters of statewide prohibition. Following passage of the [[Maine law]], [[Delaware]], [[Ohio]], [[Illinois]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Minnesota]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], among others, soon passed statewide prohibition legislation; however, a number of these laws were overturned.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt;

[https://daily.jstor.org/feminist-history-prohibition/ Women] served a special role in the temperance movement. Along with prostitution, alcohol was a vice that kept men out of their homes and caused them to oppress their wives. [[Carrie Nation]], a middle-aged woman living in Kansas in the early 1900s, grew tired of the moral protesting and began a campaign destroying bars first in Kansas and later across the entire United States. She said once that "almost everyone who was in jail was directly or indirectly there from the influence of intoxicating drinks,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57507050|title=A fierce discontent : the rise and fall of the Progressive movement in America, 1870-1920|last=E.|first=McGerr, Michael|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195183658|location=Oxford, Eng.|oclc=57507050}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encapsulated people's negative attitudes towards alcohol at the time. Nation also said, after she destroyed a painting of a nude woman, "It is very significant that the pictures of naked women are in saloons. Women are stripped of everything by them. Her husband is torn from her, she is robbed of her sons, her home, her food, and her virtue, and then they strip her clothes off and hang her up bare of all things!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As temperance groups continued to promote prohibition, other groups opposed increased alcohol restrictions. For example, Chicago's citizens fought against enforcing Sunday closings laws in the 1850s, which included mob violence. It was also during this time when [[patent medicine]]s, many of which contained alcohol, gained popularity. During the [[American Civil War]] efforts at increasing federal revenue included imposition of taxes on liquor and beer. The liquor industry responded to the taxes by forming an industry lobby, the [[United States Brewers Association]], that succeeded in reducing the tax rate on beer from $1 to 60 cents. The [[Women's Crusade]] of 1873 and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), founded in 1874, "marked the formal entrance of women into the temperance movement."&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt; Organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Movement were a venue through which certain women organized and demanded political action, well before they were granted the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Christian Temperance Movement|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/roots-of-prohibition/|website=Prohibition: Roots of Prohibition|publisher=PBS|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WCTU and the [[Prohibition Party]], organized in 1869, remained major players in the temperance movement until the early twentieth century, when the [[Anti-Saloon League]], formed in 1895, emerged as the movement's leader.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt;

Between 1880 and 1890, although several states enacted local option laws that allowed counties or towns to go dry by referendum, only six states had statewide prohibition by state statute or constitutional amendment. The League, with the support of evangelical Protestant churches and other [[Progressive Era|Progressive-era]] reformers continued to press for prohibition legislation. Opposition to prohibition was strong in America's urban industrial centers, where a large, immigrant, working-class population generally opposed it, as did Jewish and Catholic religious groups. In the years leading up to [[World War I]], nativism, American patriotism, distrust of immigrants, and anti-German sentiment became associated with the prohibition movement. Through the use of pressure politics on legislators, the League and other temperance reformers achieved the goal of nationwide prohibition by emphasizing the need to destroy the moral corruption of the saloons and the political power of the brewing industry, and to reduce domestic violence in the home. By 1913 nine states had stateside prohibition and thirty-one others had local option laws in effect, which included nearly fifty percent of the [[U.S. population]]. At that time the League and other reformers turned their efforts toward attaining a constitutional amendment and grassroots support for nationwide prohibition.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt;

====18th Amendment to the Constitution====
In December 1917, after two previous attempts had failed (one in 1913; the other in 1915), Congress approved a resolution to submit a constitutional amendment on nationwide prohibition to the states for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prohibition wins in Senate, 47 to 8 |newspaper=New York Times|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/12/19/96281151.pdf|format=PDF |date=1917-12-19 |page=6 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitutional amendment prohibited "the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Constitution of the United States, Amendments 11–27: Amendment XVIII, Section 1 | work = | publisher =The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration | date =|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html | accessdate =2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 1918, [[Mississippi]] became the first state to ratify the amendment; the thirty-sixth state to do so, Nebraska, ratified it on January 16, 1919, assuring its passage into law.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt; On October 28, 1919, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act, also known as the [[Volstead Act]], which provided enabling legislation to implement the Eighteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =David J.

Congress ratified the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] on January 16, 1920; nationwide prohibition began the next day.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt;

During the first years of Prohibition, the new law was enforced in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt; The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of Prohibition; once it was passed they helped with its enforcement. For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouses]], and whipped liquor sellers, and anybody else who broke the moral code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pegram|first1=Thomas|title=Hoodwinked: The Anti-Saloon League and the Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Prohibition Enforcement|journal=Journal of Gilded Age and Progressive era|date=2008|volume=7|issue=1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jack S.

Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the [[Great Lakes]], and alcohol was diverted from the limited exceptions to the Volsted Act: medicinal and religious. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, it was a different story along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and hops stores popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling malt extract syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Prohibition became increasingly unpopular during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Some believe that the demand for increased employment and tax revenues during this time brought an end to Prohibition. Others argue it was the result of the economic motivations of American businessmen as well as the stress and excesses of the era that kept it from surviving, even under optimal economic conditions.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt;

====Repeal====
{{Main|Repeal of Prohibition in the United States}}

The repeal movement was initiated and financed by the [[Association Against the Prohibition Amendment]], who worked to elect Congressmen who agreed to support repeal. The group's wealthy supporters included [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[S. S. Kresge]], and the [[Du Pont family]], among others, who had abandoned the dry cause.&lt;ref name=AlcoholProhibition/&gt; [[Pauline Sabin]], a wealthy Republican who founded the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR), argued that Prohibition should be repealed because it made the United States a nation of hypocrites and undermined its respect for the rule of law. This hypocrisy and the fact that women had initially led the prohibition movement convinced Sabin to establish the WONPR. Their efforts eventually led to the repeal of prohibition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1933"&gt;

[[File:Prohibition prescription front.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Prescription form for medicinal liquor]]
When Sabin's fellow Republicans would not support her efforts, she went to the Democrats, who switched their support of the dry cause to endorse repeal under the leadership of liberal politicians such as [[Fiorello La Guardia]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Sabin and her supporters emphasized that repeal would generate enormous sums of much-needed tax revenue, and weaken the base of organized crime.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Repeal of Prohibition]] was accomplished with the ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] on December 5, 1933. Under its terms, states were allowed to set their own laws for the control of alcohol.

Following repeal, public interest in an organized prohibition movement dwindled. However, it survived for a while in a few southern and border states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1933"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; To this day, there are still counties and parishes within the US known as "[[Dry county|dry]]", where the sale of alcohol – liquor, and sometimes wine and beer – is prohibited. Several such municipalities have adopted [[liquor-by-the-drink]], however, in order to expand tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.starhq.com/html/localnews/1104/110304drink.html | title = Drink up 'Betsy | first = Lesley | last = Hughes | date = November 3, 2004 | work = Elizabethton Star | page = | publisher = | location = Elizabethton, Tennessee | access-date = June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some municipalities regulate when alcohol can be sold; an example is restricting or banning sales on Sunday, under the so-called "[[blue laws]]".

====Al Capone====
{{Main|Al Capone}}

Al Capone was the most notorious gangster of his generation. Born on January 17, 1899 in Brooklyn, New York; Capone settled in Chicago to take over Johnny Torrio's business dealing with outlawed liquor. Within three years, Capone had nearly 700 men at his disposal. As the profits came in, Capone acquired finesse—particularly in the management of politicians. By the middle of the decade, he had gained control of the suburb of [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], and had installed his own mayor. Capone's rise to fame did not come without bloodshed. Rival gangs, such as the Gennas and the Aiellos, started wars with Capone, eventually leading to a rash of killings. In 1927, Capone and his gang were pulling in approximately $60 million per year—most of it from beer. Capone not only controlled the sale of [[liquor]] to over 10,000 [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]], but he also controlled the supply from Canada to Florida. Capone was imprisoned in 1929 for tax violations and died January 25, 1947, from a heart attack, pneumonia, and [[syphilis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America's Longest War|year=1974|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
In Venezuela, twenty-four hours before every election, the government prohibits the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages throughout the national territory, including the restriction to all dealers, liquor stores, supermarkets, restaurants, wineries, pubs, bars, public entertainment, clubs and any establishment that markets alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleccionesvenezuela.com/informacion-ley-seca-elecciones-municipales-venezuela-126.html|title=LEY SECA 2013 por Elecciones Municipales, Cuando empieza? – Elecciones 2013 Venezuela|author=eleccionesvenezuela|work=eleccionesvenezuela.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done to prevent violent alcohol-induced confrontations because of the high political polarization.

===Australia===
[[File:Prohibition lifted in Canberra 1928.jpg|thumb|250px|The first consignment of liquor [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], following the repeal of prohibition laws in 1928.]]

The [[Australian Capital Territory]] (then the Federal Capital Territory) was the first jurisdiction in [[Australia]] to have prohibition laws. In 1911, [[King O'Malley]], then Minister of Home Affairs, shepherded laws through Parliament preventing new issue or transfer of licences to sell alcohol, to address unruly behaviour among workers building the new capital city. Prohibition was partial, since possession of alcohol purchased outside of the Territory remained legal and the few pubs that had existing licences could continue to operate. The Federal Parliament repealed the laws after residents of the Federal Capital Territory voted for the end of them in a 1928 plebiscite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibition in Canberra|url=http://yourmemento.naa.gov.au/2013/04/prohibition-in-canberra-king-omalley-and-the-dry-capital/|website=Your Memento|publisher=National Archives of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, some local councils have enacted [[Alcohol laws of Australia#Dry zones|local dry zones]] in which possession or consumption of alcohol is forbidden.  Nearly all dry zones are only a district within a larger community. Notable among those remaining in existence is the Adelaide city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.sa.gov.au/licensing-and-registration/liquor/dry-areas/|title=Dry Areas|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, alcohol has been prohibited in many remote [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] communities. Penalties for transporting alcohol into these "dry" communities are severe and can result in confiscation of any vehicles involved; in dry areas within the [[Northern Territory]], all vehicles used to transport alcohol are seized.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, prohibition was a moralistic reform movement begun in the mid-1880s by the Protestant evangelical and Nonconformist churches and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and after 1890 by the Prohibition League. It assumed that individual virtue was all that was needed to carry the colony forward from a pioneering society to a more mature one, but it never achieved its goal of national prohibition. However, both the Church of England and the largely Irish Catholic Church rejected prohibition as an intrusion of government into the church's domain, while the growing labor movement saw capitalism rather than alcohol as the enemy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1914"&gt;Greg Ryan, "Drink and the Historians: Sober Reflections on Alcohol in New Zealand 1840–1914," ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (April 2010) Vol.44, No.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated52"&gt;Richard Newman, "New Zealand's Vote For Prohibition In 1911," ''New Zealand Journal of History'', April 1975, Vol. 9 Issue 1, pp. 52–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Reformers hoped that the women's vote, in which New Zealand was a pioneer, would swing the balance, but the women were not as well organized as in other countries. Prohibition had a majority in a national referendum in 1911, but needed a 60% vote to pass. The movement kept trying in the 1920s, losing three more referenda by close votes; it managed to keep in place a [[Six o'clock swill|6pm closing hour]] for pubs and Sunday closing. The Depression and war years effectively ended the movement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1914"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated52"/&gt; but their 6pm closing hour remained until October 1967 when it was extended to 10pm.

For many years, referenda were held for individual towns or electorates, often coincident with general elections. The ballots determined whether these individual areas would be "dry" – that is, alcohol could not be purchased or consumed in public in these areas. One notable example was the southern city of [[Invercargill]], which was dry from 1907 to 1943. People wanting alcohol usually travelled to places outside the city (such as the nearby township of [[Lorneville, New Zealand|Lorneville]] or the town of [[Winton, New Zealand|Winton]]) to drink in the local pubs or purchase alcohol to take back home. The last bastion of this 'dry' area remains in force in the form of a licensing trust which still to this day governs the sale of liquor in Invercargill. The city does not allow the sale of alcohol (beer and wine included) in supermarkets unlike the remainder of New Zealand, and all form of alcohol regardless of the sort can only be sold in bars and liquor stores.

Prohibition was of limited success in New Zealand as—like in other countries—it led to organised [[bootlegging (alcohol)|bootlegging]]. The most famous bootlegged alcohol in New Zealand was that produced in the [[Hokonui Hills]] close to the town of [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]] (not coincidentally, the nearest large town to Invercargill). Even today, the term "Hokonui" conjures up images of illicit whisky to many New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goredc.govt.nz/our-facilities/arts-and-heritage/hokonui-moonshiners-museum/ Hokonui Moonshiners Museum], Gore District Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
In many countries in Latin America, the Philippines, Turkey and several US states, the sale but not the consumption of alcohol is prohibited before and during [[election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts General Laws 138 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/topics/prohibition Prohibition] – View Videos&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud Gap's aborted work culminated in ''Field Test 34'', "an extensive mock dismantlement exercise" which demonstrated two things: if any party to a treaty attempted to cheat, the risk of detection was significant, and the party that cooperated and allowed for on-site inspection would see "significant amounts of classified information be put at risk and invariably lost".&lt;ref name="fuller"/&gt;

'''Qin's wars of unification''' were a series of military campaigns launched in the late 3rd century BC by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] against the other [[Seven Warring States|six major states]] — [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]] — within the territories that formed modern [[China]]. By the end of the wars in 221 BC, Qin had unified most of the states and occupied some lands south of the [[Yangtze River]]. The territories conquered by Qin served as the foundation of the [[Qin dynasty]].

==Background==
[[File:China Warring States Period.png|right|thumb|250px|China in the [[Warring States period]]. Many of the smaller states, such as Ba and Zhongshan, had been conquered by the time [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]] became the King of Qin. In particular, [[Ba (state)|Ba]] and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] were conquered by [[Qin (state)|Qin]], [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] by [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Lu (state)|Lu]] by [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Song (state)|Song]] by [[Wei (state)|Wei]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]].]]

===Rise of Qin===
Over the course of the [[Warring States period]], the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] had evolved to become the most powerful of the [[Seven Warring States|seven major states]] in China. In 238 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], the King of Qin, took over the reins of power after eliminating his political rivals [[Lü Buwei]] and [[Lao Ai]]. With help from [[Li Si]], [[Wei Liao]] (尉繚) and others, Ying Zheng formulated a plan for conquering the other six major states and unifying China.{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=184}} The plan, which focuses on annexing each state individually, is based on "[[Thirty-Six Stratagems#Befriend a distant state while attacking a neighbour|allying with distant states and attacking nearby ones]]", one of the [[Thirty-Six Stratagems]]. Its key steps were: ally with [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]], deter [[Wei (state)|Wei]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and conquer [[Han (state)|Han]] and [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]].

==Conquest of Han==
[[Han (state)|Han]] was the weakest of the seven states and had previously been subject to numerous attacks by Qin, which caused it to be drastically and further weakened. In 230 BC, the Qin army led by Interior Minister Teng (內史騰) moved south, crossed the [[Yellow River]] and conquered Zheng (鄭; present-day [[Xinzheng]], [[Henan]]), the capital of Han, within one year. [[King An of Han]] surrendered and Han came under Qin control. The territory of Han was reorganised to form the Qin Empire's Yingchuan [[Commandery (China)|Commandery]] (潁川郡),{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=184}} with the commandery capital at Yangzhai (陽翟; present-day [[Yuzhou, Henan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|language=zh|url=http://www.hudong.com/wiki/秦灭韩之战|title=秦灭韩之战|trans-title=Qin's conquest of Han|type=wiki|publisher=Hudong Baike}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conquest of Zhao==
{{See also|Battle of Fei (233 BC)}}

In 236 BC, while [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] was attacking Yan, Qin used the opportunity to send two separate forces to invade Zhao. The Qin army led by [[Wang Jian (Qin)|Wang Jian]] conquered the Zhao territories of Eyu (閼與; present-day [[Heshun County]], [[Shanxi]]) and Liaoyang (撩陽; present-day [[Zuoquan County]], Shanxi), while the other Qin army under the command of [[Huan Yi]] (桓齮) and Yang Duanhe (楊端和) captured [[Ye (ancient China)|Ye]] (鄴; in present-day [[Handan]], [[Hebei]]) and Anyang (安陽; present-day [[Anyang County]], [[Henan]]). Zhao lost nine cities and its military prowess was weakened.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong"&gt;{{Citation|language=zh|url=http://www.hudong.com/wiki/秦灭赵之战|title=秦灭赵之战|type=wiki|trans-title=Qin's conquest of Zhao|publisher=Hudong Baike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Qin planned to attack Han, but feared that Zhao might support Han, so it ordered Huan Yi to lead an army to attack Zhao's Pingyang (平陽; southeast of present-day [[Ci County]], Hebei) and Wucheng (武城; southwest of present-day Ci County, Hebei).&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong" /&gt; More than 100,000 soldiers were killed in the battle. The Zhao army was defeated and its commander, Hu Zhe (扈輒), was killed in action.{{Sfn|Bodde|1987|p=27}} In 233 BC, Huan Yi's army crossed [[Mount Taihang]] and conquered the Zhao territories of Chili (赤麗) and Yi'an (宜安), both located southeast of present-day [[Shijiazhuang]], Hebei.&lt;ref name= "Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong" /&gt;

In 232 BC, the Qin forces split into two groups to attack Fanwu (番吾; present-day [[Lingshou County]], Hebei) and Langmeng (狼孟; present-day [[Yangqu County]], [[Shanxi]]), but were defeated by the Zhao army led by [[Li Mu]].&lt;ref name = "Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong" /&gt; Huan Yi fled to Yan to escape punishment for his defeat.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong" /&gt; However, the Zhao forces also sustained heavy losses and could only retreat to defend their capital, [[Handan]].

In the following two years, Zhao was struck by two natural disasters — an earthquake and a severe famine. In 229 BC, Qin took advantage of the situation to launch a pincer attack from the north and south on Handan, Zhao's capital. Three Qin armies embarked from Shangdi (上地; in present-day northern [[Shaanxi]]), Jingxing (井陉; present-day [[Jingxing County]], Hebei) and Henei (河內; present-day [[Xinxiang]], Henan), respectively led by Wang Jian, Jiang Lei (羌瘣) and Yang Duanhe, to coordinate the attack on Handan.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong" /&gt; Li Mu and Sima Shang (司馬尚) were put in command of the Zhao army. Li Mu ordered his troops to build defensive structures and avoid direct confrontation with the enemy. The Qin forces were unable to advance further and both sides reached a stalemate.&lt;ref name ="Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong" /&gt;

The Qin state bribed Guo Kai (郭開), a Zhao minister, to sow discord between King Qian of Zhao (趙王遷) and Li Mu. The king doubted Li Mu's loyalty and ordered Li Mu to hand over his authority to his deputies, Zhao Cong (趙蔥) and Yan Ju (顏聚). When Li Mu refused to obey, the king became more suspicious of him and ordered his men to take Li Mu by surprise and capture him. Li Mu was executed in prison later on King Qian's order. In 228 BC, after learning that Li Mu had been replaced, the Qin forces attacked, defeated the Zhao army and conquered Dongyang (東陽; east of Mount Taihang). Zhao Cong was killed in action while Yan Ju escaped after his defeat.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Zhao on Hudong" /&gt; Seven months later, Qin forces occupied Handan and captured King Qian, bringing an end to Zhao's existence.

[[King Jia of Dai|Prince Jia]], King Qian's elder brother, escaped from Handan and went to [[Dai (Warring States period)|Dai]] (within present-day [[Yu County, Hebei|Yu County]] in northwestern [[Hebei]]), where, with help from some Zhao remnants, he declared himself the King of Dai. In 222 BC, Dai was conquered by the Qin army led by Wang Jian's son, [[Wang Ben]]. Prince Jia was taken captive.{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=184}}

==Conquest of Yan==
In 228 BC, after the fall of Zhao, [[Wang Jian (Qin)|Wang Jian]] led the Qin army stationed at [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] to prepare for an offensive on [[Yan (state)|Yan]]. Ju Wu (鞠武), a Yan minister, proposed to [[King Xi of Yan]] to form alliances with Dai, Qi and Chu, and make peace with the [[Xiongnu]] in the north, in order to counter the Qin invasion.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Yan on Hudong"&gt;{{Citation|language=zh|url=http://www.hudong.com/wiki/秦灭燕之战|title=秦灭燕之战|trans-title=Qin's conquest of Yan|type=wiki|publisher=Hudong Baike}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Crown Prince Dan of Yan|Crown Prince Dan]] felt that the alliance strategy was unlikely to succeed, so he sent [[Jing Ke]] to assassinate Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. Jing Ke went to Qin by pretending to be an envoy, bringing with him a map of Dukang{{Efn|Dukang is the most fertile land in Yan. Crown Prince Dan pretended to cede the land to Qin to put Qin off guard, as well as to help Jing Ke gain Ying Zheng's trust so that Jing Ke can get closer to the king and assassinate him.}} and the head of [[Fan Wuji]],{{Efn|Fan Wuji is believed to be Huan Yi, the Qin general who fled to Yan to escape punishment after his defeat during Qin's conquest of Zhao.}} a Qin turncoat general. Jing Ke failed and died in his attempt to assassinate Ying Zheng.

In 226 BC, using the assassination attempt as an excuse, Ying Zheng ordered Wang Jian to lead an army to attack Yan, with Meng Wu (蒙武) serving as Wang Jian's deputy. The Qin forces defeated the Yan army and Yan's reinforcements from Dai in a battle on the eastern bank of the Yi River (易水), after which they conquered Ji (薊; present-day [[Beijing]]), the capital of Yan.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Yan on Hudong" /&gt; King Xi of Yan and his son, Crown Prince Dan, led their remaining forces on a retreat to the [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. A Qin army led by [[Li Xin (Qin)|Li Xin]] pursued the retreating Yan forces to the Yan River (衍水; present-day [[Hun River (Liao River tributary)|Hun River]], Liaoning), where they engaged enemy forces and destroyed the bulk of the Yan army. Later, King Xi ordered Crown Prince Dan's execution and sent his son's head to Qin as an "apology" for the assassination attempt. Qin accepted the "apology" and did not attack Yan for the next three years.

In 222 BC, the Qin army led by [[Wang Ben]] invaded Liaodong and destroyed Yan's remaining forces and captured King Xi, bringing an end to Yan's existence.{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|pp=185–87}} The former territories of Yan were partitioned and reorganised to form the Qin Empire's Yuyang (漁陽), Beiping (北平), Liaoxi (遼西) and Liaodong (遼東) [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]].&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Yan on Hudong" /&gt;

==Conquest of Wei==
In 225 BCE, a 600,000 strong Qin army led by [[Wang Ben]] conquered more than ten cities on the northern border of Chu as a precautionary move to guard the flank from possible attacks from Chu while Qin was invading [[Wei (state)|Wei]].&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Wei on Hudong"&gt;{{Citation|language=zh|url=http://www.hudong.com/wiki/秦灭魏之战|title=秦灭魏之战|trans-title=Qin's conquest of Wei|type=wiki|publisher=Hudong Baike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Ben then led his forces north to attack and besiege Daliang (大梁; northwest of present-day [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]]), the capital of Wei. As Daliang was situated at the concourse of the Sui and Ying rivers and the Hong Canal (鴻溝), its geographical location gave it a natural defensive advantage. Besides, the moat around Daliang was very wide and all the five gates of the city had drawbridges, making it even more difficult for Qin forces to breach the city walls. The Wei troops used the opportunity to strengthen their fortifications and defences.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Wei on Hudong" /&gt;

Wang Ben came up with the idea of directing the waters from the [[Yellow River]] and the Hong Canal to flood Daliang. Wang Ben's troops worked for three months to redirect the water flow while maintaining the siege on Daliang, and succeeded in their plan.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Wei on Hudong" /&gt; Daliang was heavily flooded and over 100,000 people died, including civilians. King Jia of Wei (魏王假) surrendered and Wei came under Qin control.{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=187}} Qin established the [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] of Dang (碭) and Sishui (泗水) in the former Wei territories.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Wei on Hudong" /&gt;

==Conquest of Chu==
In 224 BC, Ying Zheng called for a meeting with his subjects to discuss his plans for the invasion of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. [[Wang Jian (Qin)|Wang Jian]] felt that they needed at least 600,000 troops for the campaign, while [[Li Xin (Qin)|Li Xin]] claimed that 200,000 men would suffice. Ying Zheng dismissed Wang Jian's idea and ordered Li Xin and [[Meng Tian]] to lead an army of about 200,000 to attack Chu.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Chu on Hudong"&gt;{{Citation|language=zh|url=http://www.hudong.com/wiki/秦灭楚之战|title=秦灭楚之战|type=wiki|trans-title=Qin's conquest of Chu|publisher=Hudong Baike}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Jian retired on the grounds of illness.

The Qin armies scored initial victories as Li Xin's force conquered Pingyu (平輿; north of present-day [[Pingyu County]], [[Henan]]) while Meng Tian's captured Qinqiu (寢丘; present-day [[Linquan County]], [[Anhui]]). After conquering Yan (鄢; present-day [[Yanling County, Henan]]), Li Xin led his army west to rendezvous with Meng Tian at Chengfu (城父; east of present-day [[Baofeng County]], Henan). The Chu army, led by Xiang Yan (項燕), had been avoiding using its main force to resist the Qin invaders while waiting for an opportunity to launch a counterattack.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Chu on Hudong" /&gt; During this time, [[Lord Changping]], a relative of Ying Zheng who descended from the Chu royal family, incited a rebellion in a city previously conquered by Li Xin. He also prepared for a surprise attack on Li Xin later.

The Chu army led by Xiang Yan secretly followed Li Xin at high speed for three days and three nights before launching a surprise attack.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Chu on Hudong" /&gt; Lord Changping's forces followed suit from behind and joined Xiang Yan's army in attacking Li Xin. Most of Li Xin's forces were destroyed in the battle.

Upon learning of Li Xin's defeat, Ying Zheng personally visited Wang Jian, who was in retirement, apologised for not heeding Wang Jian's advice earlier, and invited him back to serve in the army. He approved Wang Jian's request and put him in command of 600,000 troops, in addition to assigning Meng Wu to serve as Wang Jian's deputy. Wang Jian was aware that the king would doubt his loyalty because he wielded too much military power, so he frequently sent messengers back to the king to request for rewards for his family, so that the king would be less suspicious of him.

In 224 BC, Wang Jian's army passed through the south of Chen (陳; present-day [[Huaiyang County]], Henan) and made camp at Pingyu. The Chu forces, led by Xiang Yan, used their full strength to launch an offensive on the Qin camp but failed.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Chu on Hudong" /&gt; Wang Jian ordered his troops to defend their positions firmly and avoid advancing further into Chu territory.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Chu on Hudong" /&gt; After failing to lure the Qin army to attack, Xiang Yan ordered a retreat and Wang Jian seized the opportunity to launch a surprise counterattack. The Qin forces pursued the retreating Chu forces to Qinan (蕲南; northwest of present-day [[Qichun County]], [[Hubei]]), where Xiang Yan was killed in action{{Efn|Some accounts claimed that Xiang Yan committed suicide after his defeat.}} in the ensuing battle.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Chu on Hudong" /&gt;

In 223 BC, Qin launched another attack on Chu and captured Shouchun (壽春; present-day [[Shou County]], Anhui), the capital of Chu. [[Fuchu]], the king of Chu, was captured and Chu was annexed by Qin.&lt;ref name= "Qin's conquest of Chu on Hudong" /&gt;{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=188}} The following year, Wang Jian and Meng Wu led the Qin army to attack the [[Wu (region)|Wuyue region]] (covering present-day [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangsu]]), which was inhabited by the [[Baiyue]], and captured the descendants of the royal family of the ancient [[Yue (state)|Yue state]].{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=188}} The conquered Wuyue territories became the Qin Empire's [[Kuaiji Commandery]].

==Conquest of Qi==
In 264 BC, [[Jian of Qi|Tian Jian]] became the king of [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. However, as he was too young to rule, his mother the queen dowager became his regent. Qin bribed Hou Sheng (後勝), the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] of Qi, to dissuade King Jian from helping the other states while they were being attacked by Qin.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Qi on Hudong"&gt;{{Citation|language=zh|type=wiki|url=http://www.hudong.com/wiki/秦灭齐之战|title=秦灭齐之战|trans-title=Qin's conquest of Qi|publisher=Hudong Baike}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 221 BC, Qi was the only state in China yet to be conquered by Qin. Qi hurriedly mobilised its armies to its western borders as a safeguard against a possible Qin invasion, even though its military was not well equipped and morale was low.&lt;ref name="Qin's conquest of Qi on Hudong" /&gt;

In the same year, Ying Zheng used Qi's rejection of a meeting with a Qin envoy as an excuse to attack Qi. The Qin army, led by [[Li Xin (Qin)|Li Xin]], avoided direct confrontation with enemy forces stationed on Qi's western borders, and advanced into Qi's heartland via a southern detour from Yan. The Qin forces met with little resistance as they passed through Qi territory and eventually arrived at [[Ancient Linzi|Linzi]] (north of present-day [[Zibo]], [[Shandong]]), the capital of Qi. King Jian was caught by surprise. When Hou Sheng urged him to surrender, he heeded Hou Sheng's advice and surrendered to Qin without putting up a fight.{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|p=188}} The former territories of Qi were reorganised to form the Qin Empire's Qi (齊) and Langya (琅邪) [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]].&lt;ref name ="Qin's conquest of Qi on Hudong" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Qin Unification.png|thumb|450px|Map of Qin unification]]

In 221 BC, after the conquest of Qi, Ying Zheng proclaimed himself "[[Qin Shi Huang]]" (秦始皇; literally "First Emperor of Qin") and established the [[Qin dynasty]]. The Qin Empire was divided into 36 commanderies, with [[Xianyang]] as the imperial capital. Qin Shi Huang created a centralised state and empire that would become the bedrock of future Chinese dynasties. Although the Qin dynasty lasted 15 years only, its influence on Chinese history lasted for centuries to come.{{Sfn|Li|Zheng|2001|pp=214–17}}

In 209 BC, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], Qin Shi Huang's son and successor, [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] started [[Dazexiang Uprising|an uprising in Dazexiang]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty due to the Qin government's brutal and oppressive policies. Although the revolt was crushed by imperial forces, several other rebellions also started consecutively all over China over the next three years. The last Qin ruler, [[Ziying]], surrendered to a rebel force led by [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] in 206 BC, bringing an end to the Qin dynasty. Several of the rebel forces claimed to be restoring the former states that were annexed by Qin and numerous [[pretender]]s to the thrones of the former states emerged. In 206 BC, Xianyang was occupied and sacked by the forces of [[Xiang Yu]], a descendant of the Chu general Xiang Yan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17166">The '''Re-election''' system of the [[English Football League|Football League]], in use until [[1985–86 Football League|1986]], was a process where the worst placed clubs of the league had to reapply for their place in the league while non-league clubs could apply for a league place. It was the only way for a [[Non-League football|non-league]] side to enter the Football League until direct [[promotion and relegation]] were introduced from the [[1986–87 Football League|1986–87 season]] onwards. The clubs placed on a re-election rank at the end of a season had to face their Football League peers at the Annual General Meeting of the league. At the AGM the league members had the choice to either vote to retain the current league members or allow entry to the league for applying non-league clubs.&lt;ref name="Pool" /&gt;

Re-election had existed as early as 1890 when [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] failed to retain their league status.&lt;ref name="Pyramid" &gt;[http://www.thepyramid.info/stats/updownyear.htm Promotion to/Relegation from the Football League by year] www.thepyramid.info, accessed: 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; During the first five seasons of the league, that is, until the [[1893–94 Football League|season 1893–94]], re-election process concerned the clubs which finished in the bottom four of the league. From the [[1894–95 Football League|1894–95 season]] and until the [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21 season]] the re-election process was required of the clubs which finished in the bottom three of the league.&lt;ref name="Rothmans"&gt;Ian Laschke: ''Rothmans Book of Football League Records 1888–89 to 1978–79''. MacDonald and Jane’s, London &amp; Sydney, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[1921–22 Football League|1921–22]] season on, it was used for the two last placed teams of each of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] North and South. After the formation of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1958, it applied to the bottom four clubs of that league.

The club with the largest number of re-election campaigns, [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], fourteen between 1924 and 1984, was never actually voted out of the league&lt;ref name="Pool" &gt;[http://www.poolstats.co.uk/seasons/reelection.htm Football League Re-Election] www.poolstats.co.uk, accessed: 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt; but a number of other clubs were, the last of those being [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]] in 1977 and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] in 1978, who lost their league places to [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] respectively.

==History==

===Third Division North and South===
The southern group of the Third Division was established in 1920 with the northern group following the next year. The two leagues existed in parallel until 1958 when the Fourth Division was established.&lt;ref name="One" &gt;''Rothmans 2002–03'', p. 581&lt;/ref&gt;

In this era, [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] faced the most re-election campaigns, seven. Clubs that lost their league place in this time were [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] (1927), [[Durham City A.F.C.|Durham City]] (1928), [[Ashington A.F.C.|Ashington]] (1929), [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] (1930), [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] (1931), [[Nelson F.C.|Nelson]] (1931), [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] (1938) and [[New Brighton A.F.C.|New Brighton]] (1951).&lt;ref name="Pyramid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;

The following clubs had to face the re-election process during the Third Division North and South era:&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;

The Fourth Division was established in 1958 out of the bottom clubs of the two groups of the Third Division. The bottom four of the Fourth Division had to face re-election on an annual basis.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

In this era, 32 clubs had to face the re-election process in 28 seasons. Of those, five failed to gain re-election: [[Gateshead A.F.C.|Gateshead]] (1960), [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]] (1970), [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]] (1972), [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]] (1977) and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] (1978). Elected in their stead were [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref name="Four" &gt;''Rothmans 2002–03'', p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, all newly elected clubs were located further south than the club they replaced, a shift away from the more remote parts of northern England to the south.

Of those, Gateshead was the first to lose its league place, after only two seasons in the Fourth Division. The club had joined the Football League in 1930 and faced a successful re-election campaign in 1937. The club was convinced it would be re-elected, especially with Southport making their third consecutive re-election bid. In the end, on 28 May 1960, Gateshead only achieved 18 votes, with Southport the next lowest at 29. Gateshead lost their league place to Peterborough United who made their 21st attempt at entry into the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;''Twydell'', p. 160 &amp; 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Gateshead was followed ten years later by former First Division side Bradford Park Avenue. The club had been a league member since 1908 and had faced re-election five times before, being successful in 1956, 1958, 1967, 1968 and 1969. Faced with the process for the fourth year running in 1970, the club received only 17 votes and dropped out of the league while Cambridge United was voted in with 31. Unsuccessful, Wigan Athletic even achieved a higher vote then Bradford Park Avenue, reaching 18.&lt;ref&gt;''Twydell'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Two seasons later, Barrow was replaced by Hereford United.&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;

A five-year break followed before Workington was voted out of the league in 1977. The club had only joined the league in 1951, being voted in at the expense of [[New Brighton A.F.C.|New Brighton]] which they beat by ten votes.&lt;ref&gt;''Twydell'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Workington faced two successful re-election campaigns in its first two seasons in the league but then did not have to apply again from 1953 to 1974. After three more successful campaigns in 1974, 1975 and 1976 the club's league membership came to an end on 17 June 1977 when Wimbledon received 27 votes and Workington only 21, finishing fifth in the tally.&lt;ref&gt;''Twydell'', p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

The last club to lose their Football League status through a vote was Southport, who were voted out in favour of Wigan Athletic in 1978. Southport was tied with Wigan on 26 votes and a second round between the two was necessary which Wigan carried by nine votes.&lt;ref name="Pool" /&gt;

No club was voted out in the following eight seasons until 1986, after which the system was abandoned in favour of direct promotion between the Football League and the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]].&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt; On 23 May 1986, the last time a re-election vote was held, [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]], [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] had their league places confirmed while [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] was denied a place in the league.&lt;ref&gt;''Rothmans 1986–87'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The following clubs had to face the re-election process during the Fourth Division era:&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada, regional police forces are assigned to [[regional municipality|regional municipalities]] in the [[provinces]] of [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], and [[Quebec]].  In the absence of such forces, provincial police (Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador) or the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (rest of Canada) perform police duties for the region.

Through the formation of a "[[Special-purpose district|police district]]" under the control of a Police Commission, some municipalities in Pennsylvania have found that improved and more professional police services could be obtained through inter-governmental cooperation.  Having one police department covering two or more neighboring communities, rather than separate police departments, allows each municipality to enjoy the benefits of a larger department, such as specialized units and a professional staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dauphincounty.org/government/Publicly-Elected-Officials/Commissioners/Documents/PA%20Consolidated%20Poilce%20Agencies%20as%20of%20June%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Resident''', or in full '''Resident Minister''', is a government official required to take up permanent residence in another country. A representative of his government, he officially has diplomatic functions which are often seen as a form of [[indirect rule]].

==Resident Ministers==
This full style occurred commonly as a [[diplomatic rank]] for the head of a mission ranking just below [[Envoy (title)|envoy]], usually reflecting the relatively low status of the states of origin and/or residency, or else difficult relations.

On occasion, the Resident Minister's role could become extremely important, as when in 1806 the Bourbon king [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|Ferdinand IV]] fled his [[Kingdom of Naples]], and [[Lord William Bentinck]], the British Resident, authored (1812) a new and relatively liberal constitution.

Residents could also be posted with shadowy governments. For instance, the British sent Residents to the [[Mamluk dynasty of Iraq | Mameluk]] Beys who ruled [[Baghdad Eyalet | Baghdad province]] as an autonomous state (1704-1831) in the north of present-day [[Iraq]], until the [[Ottoman Empire | Ottoman]] sultans regained control over it (1831) and its [[Wali]] (governor).

Even after the [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] in 1815, the British posted a "mere" Resident to [[Florence]].

As international relations developed, it became customary to give the highest title of diplomatic rank - [[ambassador]] - to the head of all permanent missions in any country, except as a temporary expression of down-graded relations or where representation was merely an interim arrangement.

==Pseudo-colonial Residents==
Some official representatives of European colonial powers, while in theory diplomats, in practice exercised a degree of [[indirect rule]]. Some such Residents were former military officers, rather than career diplomats, who resided in smaller self-governing [[protectorate]]s and [[tributary state]]s and acted as political advisors to the rulers. A trusted Resident could even become the ''de facto'' prime minister to a native ruler. In other respects they acted as an ambassador of their own government, but at a lower level, since even large and rich native states were usually seen as inferior to Western nations. Instead of being a representative to a single ruler, a Resident could be posted to more than one native state, or to a grouping of states which the European power decided for its convenience. This could create an artificial geographical unit, as in '''Residency X''' in some parts of the [[British Indian Empire]].

Similar positions could carry alternative titles, such as [[Political Resident|Political Agent]] and [[Resident Commissioner]].

In some cases, the intertwining of the European power with the traditional native establishment went so far that members of the native princely houses became Residents, either in other states or even within their own state, provided that they were unlikely ever to succeed as ruler of the state.
[[File:Morocco Resident General Ponsot.jpg|thumb|The Resident General of Morocco in the 1930s.]]
A Resident's real role varied enormously, depending upon the underlying relationship between the two parties and even upon the personalities of the Resident and the ruler(s). Some residents were little more than observers and diplomats, others were seen as the "face of the oppressor" and were treated with hostility, while some won enough trust from the ruler that they were able to exercise great influence. In French protectorates, such as those of Morocco and Tunisia, the resident or resident general was the effective ruler of the territory.

In 1887, when both Boers and gold prospectors of all nationalities were overrunning his country, the Swazi [[Paramount chief]] [[Umbandine]] asked for a British resident, seeing this as a desirable and effective form of protection. His request was refused.

===British &amp; dominion Residents===
The Residents of the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[dominion]]s to a variety of protectorates include:

====Residents in Africa====
* In the Sultanate of [[Zanzibar]], the second 'homeland' of the Omani dynasty, since 1913. From 1913 to 1961 the Residents were also the Sultan's [[vizier]]. There were Consuls and Consuls-general until 1963.
* In present-day [[Kenya]], in the Sultanate of [[Wituland|Witu]], after the British took over the protectorate from the German Empire, which had itself posted a Resident.
* In [[British Cameroon]] (part of the former German Kamerun), since 1916, in 1949 restyled '''Special Resident''' (superior to the new two provinces) for Edward John Gibbons  (b. 1906 – d. 1990), who stayed on in October 1954 as first Commissioner when it became an autonomous part of [[Nigeria]].
* in Southern Africa:
** when the military party sent from Cape Colony to occupy Port Natal on behalf of Great Britain was recalled in 1839, a British Resident was appointed among the [[Fingo (Mfengu)|Fingo]] and other tribes in [[Kaffraria]] until the definite establishment of British rule in Natal and its 1845 organization as an administrative entity, when the incumbent Shepstone was made Agent for the native tribes.
** In [[kwaZulu]], which since 1843 was under a British protectorate, after it became the Zulu "Native" Reserve or Zululand Province on 1 September 1879: two British Residents (William Douglas Wheelwright, 8 September 1879 to January 1880, then Sir Melmoth Osborn until 22 December 1882). Thereafter there were Resident Commissioners until Zululand was incorporated into the [[crown colony]] of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] as British Zululand on 1 December 1897.
** in 1845 the resident 'north of the Orange river' chose his residency at [[Bloemfontein]], which became the capital of the [[Orange River Sovereignty]] in 1848. In 1854 the British abandoned the Sovereignty, and the independent Boer republic of the [[Orange Free State]] was established
** in the [[Boer]] republic of [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] at Pretoria
** with the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] chief at [[Bulawayo]]
* in [[Ghana]], with the rulers of the [[Asanteman Confederation]] (established in 1701), since it became in 1896 a British protectorate; on 23 June 1900 the Confederation was dissolved by UK protectorate authority, on 26 September 1901 turned into [[Ashanti Colony]], so since 1902 his place was taken by a [[Chief Commissioner]] at [[Kumasi]]
* in various parts of the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]], [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] and after their joining Nigeria protectorate, notably in [[Edo state]] at [[Benin City]] (first to the British-installed ruling council of chiefs, later to the restored Oba), with the Emir of and in [[Bauchi Emirate|Bauchi]], to the jointly ruling [[bale (title)|bale]] and balogun of [[Ibadan]] (a vassal state in [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]land), with the Emir of [[Illorin]], with the Emir of and in [[Muri (Nigeria)]], with the Emir of [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]]

====Residents in Asia====
[[File:The British Residency at Hyderabad.jpg|thumb|The British Residency at Hyderabad]]

British Residents were posted in various [[Princely state]]s — in major states or groups of states—in the days of [[British India]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Resident |volume=23 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often they were appointed to a single state, as with the Resident in [[Lucknow]], the capital of [[Oudh]]; to the Maharaja Gaekwar of [[Baroda]]; to the Maharaja Sindhya of [[Gwalior]]; to the Nizam al-Mulk of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]]; to the Maharaja Rana of [[Jhalawar]]; to the restored Maharaja of [[Mysore]], after the fall of [[Tipu Sultan]]; to the Maharaja Sena Sahib Subah of the Mahratta state of [[Nagpur]]; to the (Maha)Raja of [[Manipur]]; to the (Maha)Raja of [[Travancore]]; to the Maharana of [[Mewar]] in Udaipur.
Even when [[Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake|Lord Lake]] had broken the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta]] power in 1803, and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] was taken under the protection of the [[East India Company]], the districts of [[Delhi]] and [[Hisar, India|Hissar]] were assigned for the maintenance of the royal family, and were administered by a British Resident, until in 1832 the whole area was annexed to 
British Residents were also posted in major states considered to be connected with India, neighbouring or on the sea route to it, notably:
* in [[Aden]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (while subordinated to the [[Bombay Presidency]]), the only part of the present-day [[Yemen]] made a colony in full British possession. The last of three British Political Agents since 1939 stayed on as first Resident since 1859, the last again staying on in 1932 as first Chief Commissioner; he was the only diplomatic representative to the various Arabian rulers who over time accepted British protectorate, but since the 1935 legal separation from British India was followed in 1937 by a reorganisation into an Eastern and a Western Aden Protectorate (based at Mukallah and Lahej; together covering all Yemen), the British Representatives in each were styled British [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political officers]]
* in [[Afghanistan]], a kingdom entitled to a [[gun salute]] of 21 guns (the highest rank among [[princely state]]s, not then among Sovereign monarchs): the first British Residents were Sir Alexander Burnes (1837 – 2 November 1841); William Hay McNaghten (7 August 1839 – 23 December 1841); Eldred Pottinger (December 1841 – 6 January 1842). After that, four native ''[[Vakil]]''s acted on behalf of the British government: Nawab Foujdar Khan (1856 – April 1859), Ghulam Husain Khan Allizai (April 1859 – 1865), Bukhiar Khan (February 1864 – January 1868, acting), Attah Muhammad Khan Khagwani (January 1868 – 1878); then there were two more British Residents Louis Napoleon Cavagnari (24 July 1879 – 3 September 1879), [[Henry Lepel-Griffin]] (1880); next came two Military Commanders (8 October 1879 – 11 August 1880) and until 1919 ten native British Agents, one of whom served two non-consecutive terms.
* Capt. [[Hiram Cox]] (died 1799)&lt;ref&gt;[[Cox's Bazar]] in [[Bangladesh]] commemorates his name; Cox also figures among [[List of chess historians|historians of chess]]: see the now-discredited [[Cox-Forbes theory]].&lt;/ref&gt; was the first British Resident to the King of independent [[Burma]] (October 1796 – July 1797), and there were more discontinuous posting to that court, in the 19th century, never satisfactory to either party; after the British conquest of Burma there were two separate British Residents in a border zone of that country: in the [[Northern Shan States]] and in the [[Southern Shan States]] (each several tribal states, usually ruled by a [[Saopha]]=[[Sawbwa]]) in 1945–1948 (each group had been under a Superintendent from 1887/88 till 1922, then both jointly under a Resident Commissioner till the 1942 Japanese occupation)
* after five military governors since the East India Company started chasing the Dutch out of [[Ceylon]] in August 1795 and occupying the island (completed on 16 February 1796), their only Resident there was Robert Andrews, 12 February 1796 – 12 October 1798, who was subordinate to the [[presidency of Madras]] (see British India), afterwards the [[East India Company|HEIC]] appointed Governors as it was made a separate colony
* to the Sultan of the [[Maldives]] archipelago since he formally accepted British protection on 16 December 1887 (informally since 1796, after the British took over Ceylon from the Dutch), but in fact this office was filled ''ex officio'' by the colonial Governors of until 4 February 1948, abolished on 26 July 1965
* in [[Nepal]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; since 1802, accredited to the Hindu Kings (title [[Maharajadhiraja]]), since 15 March 1816 exercising a de facto protectorate—the last staying on 1920 as [[Envoy (title)|Envoy]] till the 1923 emancipation
* with the Imam/Sultan of [[Oman]], 1800–1804, 1805–1810 and 1840 (so twice interrupted by vacancy), then located with the African branch of the dynasty on the island of Unguja, since 1862 his role was handed over to a Political Agent

And elsewhere:
* in [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] (present Jordan) April 1921 – 17 June 1946 four incumbents accredited to the Hashemite Emir/King

Even in overseas territories occupied ('preventively' or conquered) to keep the French out of strategic trade and waters, residencies could be established, e.g. at [[Laye]] on [[Sumatra]], an island returned to the [[Dutch East Indies]]

====Residents in (British) European protectorates====
Since on 5 November 1815 the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]] became a federal republic of seven islands (Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, Santa Maura, Ithaca, Cerigo and Paxos), as a protectorate (nominally of the allied Powers; de facto UK protectorate; the highest office was the always-British [[Lord High Commissioner]]), until its 1 June 1864 incorporation into independent Greece, there were British Residents, each posted with a local Prefect, on seven individual islands, notably: [[Cephalonia]] (Kephalonia), [[Cerigo]] (Kythira), [[Ithaca]], [[Paxos]], [[Santa Maura]] (Leucada/Lefkada) and [[Zante]] (Zakynthos)

====Residents on (British &amp; dominion) Ocean Island states====
* in the early colonial settlement phase on [[New Zealand]] (where the Polynesian [[Māori people|Māori]] declared independence on 28 October 1835 as the Confederation of the United Tribes, under British protectorate), from 10 May 1833 [[James Busby]] (b. 1801 – d. 1871; from 1834–1836 jointly with [[Thomas McDonnell, Snr.|Thomas McDonnell]] as ''co-Resident'') till 28 January 1840, then two Lieutenant governors (as part of [[New South Wales]], in Australia) and many Governors since 3 January 1841
* at [[Rarotonga]] since the 1888 establishment of the British protectorate over the [[Cook Islands]]; the third and last incumbent stayed on as first Resident Commissioner since 1901, at the incorporation in the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (under a single High Commissioner, till its 1976 dissolution, in Suva or Honoria), until the abolition of the post at the 1965 self-government grant as territory in free association with New Zealand, having its own cabinet (still under the British Crown, which after the 1976 appoints a special King's/Queen's Representative, as well as a High Commissioner).

====Residents in protectorates of decolonised Commonwealth states====
* [[Sikkim]], where the [[Maharaja]] had been under a British protectorate (1861 – 15 August 1947; the crown representative was styled Political Agent), became immediately afterwards a protectorate of newly independent [[India]] (formally from 5 December 1950; in the meantime the Indian representative was again styled Political Agent, the first incumbent actually being the former British Political Agent—India was a [[dominion]], still under the British crown, till 26 January 1950) until 16 May 1975, it was annexed as a constituent state of India.

===Dutch colonial Residents===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het huis van de resident aan de Kanarielaan te Banjoemas. TMnr 60004313.jpg|thumb|300px|The house of a Dutch resident in [[Central Java]] c. 1905]]
In the [[Dutch East Indies]], Dutch residents and lower ranks such as assistant residents were posted alongside a number of the many native princes in present Indonesia, compare [[Regentschap]].

For example, on [[Sumatra]], there were Dutch Residents at [[Palembang]], at [[Medan]] in [[Deli sultanate]]; another was posted with the Sultan of and on [[Ternate]], and one in [[Bali]].

===French colonial Residents===
France also maintained Residents, the French word being ''Résident''.

However the 'Jacobin' tradition of strict state authority didn't agree well with indirect rule, so often direct rule was preferred.

Many were part of a white colonial hierarchy, rather than truly posted with a native ruler or chieftain.

====Style ''Résident''====
* A single post of Resident was also created in ''Côte d'Ivoire'', i.e. [[Ivory Coast]] (from 1881 subordinated to the Superior Commandant of [[Gabon]] and the Gulf of Guinea Settlements; from 1886 subordinated to the Lieutenant Governors of [[Guinea]]), where in 1842 France had declared protectorates over the Kingdoms of [[Nzema people|Nzima]] and [[Sanwi]] (posts at Assinié 1843–1870, and Grand Bassam, Fort Dabou 1853–1872, part of the Colony of Gorée and Dependencies in Senegal]):
** 1871–1885 Arthur Verdier (to 1878 Warden of the French Flag) (b. 1835 – d. 1898)
** 1885–1886 Charles Bour -Commandant-particular
** 1886 – 9 March 1890 Marcel Treich Leplène (b. 1860 – d. 1890)
** 9 March 1890 – 14 June 1890 Jean Joseph Étienne Octave Péan (acting)
** 14 June 1890 – 1892 Jean Auguste Henri Desailles
** 1892 Eloi Bricard (acting)
** 1892 – 12 November 1892 Julien Voisin (acting)
** 12 November 1892 – 10 March 1893 Paul Alphonse Frédéric Heckman; thereafter it had its own Governors
* On the [[Comoros]], in the Indian Ocean, several Residents were posted with the various native [[Sultans on the Comoros|sultanates]] on major islands; they were all three subordinated to the French [[Administration (government)|administrator]]s of [[Mayotte]] island protectorate (itself constituting the native [[Maore]] or Mawuti sultanate):
** On Ngazidja ([[Grande Comore]] island, divided in eleven sultanates, some of which on occasion had the superior title of [[Sultani tibe]]): November 1886 – 1912
** On Ndzuwani ([[Anjouan]] island) with the [[Phany]] (sole Sultan): only two incumbents  188x–189x
** On Mwali ([[Mohéli]] island) from 1886; then 1889–1912 filled by the above résidents of Anjouan
* On [[Wallis and Futuna]], after a single French Representative styled ''chargé de mission'' (7 April 1887 – 26 June 1888, Maurice Antoine Chauvot), there was a long list of Residents from 7 April 1887; since 3 October 1961, when both islands were joined as the Wallis &amp; Futuna overseas territory, their successors were styled ''Administrateur supérieur'' 'Administrator-superior', but the native dynasties remain; they represented the French government by virtue of the protectorate treaties with the [[Tu'i|Tui]] (ruler) of [[`Uvea]] (Wallis island, 5 April 1887; 27 November 1887 administratively attached to [[New Caledonia]]) and on 16 February 1888 with the two kingdoms on Futuna—[[Tu`a]] (also called Alo) and [[Sigave]]

====''Résident supérieur''====
This French title, meaning "Superior" (i.e. Senior) Resident, indicates that he had junior Residents under him.
*In [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] (present Burkina Faso), which has had its own Lieutenant governor (before) or Governor (after) and intermediately has been part of one or (carved up) more neighbouring French colonies, there has been one Résident-Superieur of "Upper Ivory Coast", 1 January 1938 - 29 July 1940, while it was part of the [[Ivory Coast]] colony: Edmond Louveau
*In [[Cambodia]], where the local royal government was theoretically maintained, the resident at Phnom-Penh was the Resident-Superior, over the various Residents posted throughout Cambodia. The Resident-Superior of Cambodia answered to the Governor-General of Indochina, however.

===German colonial Residents===
In the German colonies, the title was also Resident; the post was called ''Residentur''.

* in [[Wituland]]: Ahmed ibn Fumo Bakari, the first [[mfalume]] (sultan) of Witu (on the Kenyan coast), ceded {{convert|25|sqmi|km2}} of territory on 8 April 1885 to the brothers Clemens and Gustav Denhardt’s “Tana Company”, and the remainder of the Wituland became the German ''[[Schutzgebiet]]'' (Protectorate) of [[Wituland]] (''Deutsch-Witu'') on 27 May 1885. The Reich was represented there by the German Residents: Gustav Denhardt (b. 1856 – d. 1917; in office 8 April 1885 – 1 July 1890) and his deputy Clemens Andreas Denhardt (b. 1852 – d. 1928) until on 1 July 1890 imperial Germany renounces its protectorate, ceding the Wituland to Great Britain which had on 18 June 1890 declared it a British protectorate).
* in [[German East Africa]]
** Resident of [[Ruanda]]: 1906 – 15 November 1907 Werner von Grawert (d. 1918), formerly the last military district commander of Usumbura (the other district being Ujiji)
** Resident of [[Urundi]] (present Burundi): 15 November 1907 – June 1916, starting with the same as above; formally accredited to the native Mwami (King; on 8 October 1905 the Germans recognized the already ruling Mwezi IV Gisabo as "Sultan" of Burundi and its only supreme authority)
** Resident of [[Bukoba]] west of [[Lake Victoria]] overseeing an area of 32,200&amp;nbsp;km²;
* in [[German Kamerun]]
** Resident of [[Garua, Cameroon|Garua]]
** Resident of [[Mora, Cameroon|Mora]]
** Resident of [[Ngaundere]]
* in [[German South-West Africa]] (present Namibia)
** Resident of [[Schuckmannsburg]] for the [[Caprivi Strip]].

===Portuguese colonial Residents===
* In [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] (in present [[Angola]]), five incumbents from 1885 (18 July 1885 Portuguese Congo district created after 14 February 1885 confirmation by the Berlin Conference of the 1883 Portuguese protectorate over "Portuguese Congo") to 1899 (end of autonomy under the Governors of Congo district which had its seat in Cabinda since 1887)
* In the [[Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá]] (in present [[Benin]]), civil residents served from 1911 (withdrawal of the Portuguese military garrison) until 31 July 1961 (invasion of the fort by the Benin military forces)

==Residents-general (and their subordinate Residents)==

===British Residents (-general)===

====British Malay states and possessions====
At the "national" level of [[British Malaya]], after the post of High Commissioners had been filled (1 July 1896 – 1 April 1946) by the governors of the Straits Settlements (see Singapore), Britain appointed the following Residents-general:
* 1 July 1896 – 1901 [[Frank Swettenham|Frank Athelstane Swettenham]] (b. 1850 – d. 1946; from 1897, Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham)
* 1901–1904 [[William Hood Treacher]] (b. 1849 – d. 1919)
* 1904–1910 Sir William Thomas Taylor (b. 1848 – d. 1931)
* 1910–1911 Arthur Henderson Young (b. 1854 – d. 1938)

Then there were various British Chief Secretaries 1911–1936 and two Federal Secretaries until 31 January 1942; after three Japanese Military governors, the British Governor (1 April 1946 – 1 February 1948) stayed on as first of four High Commissioners as de facto Governor-general of the Federation of Malaya until independence on 31 August 1957 saw the creation of an elective federal [[Paramount ruler]] styled [[Yang Dipertuan Agong]] (since 16 September 1961 with the addition ''bagi Malaysia'').

There were specific Residents accredited in most constituent [[Malay states]]:
* 1885–1911 British Residents were appointed to the Sultans (until 1886 styled Maharaja) of [[Johore]], an unfederated state until 1946; thereafter the British crown was represented by [[General Adviser]]s until the Japanese occupation, finally by Commissioners 1945–1948
* 1888–1941 to the [[Yang Di Pertuan Besar]] (state's elective ruler) of the nine member-confederation [[Negeri Sembilan]], which accepted a British protectorate in 1888 and acceded in 1896 to the Federation; again British Commissioners after the Japanese occupation
** 1883–1895 additional British Residents were appointed to the [[Yang Di-Pertuan Muda]] (ruler) of [[Jelebu]], a major member principality
** 1875–1889 additional British Residents were also appointed to the [[Undang Luak Sungai Ujong]] (ruler) of [[Sungai Ujong]], another major member principality
* 1888–1938 British Residents were appointed to the Sultans (until 1882 styled [[Bendahara Seri Maharaja]]) of [[Pahang]] from the start of the British protectorate; again British Commissioners after the Japanese occupation
* 1874–1941 British Residents to the Sultans of [[Perak]] as written in the [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874]], since they exchanged Thai sovereignty for a British protectorate; since 1 July 1896 part of the Federated Malay States; after the Japanese occupation a single British Commissioner
* 1875–1941 British Residents to the Sultans of [[Selangor]] during the [[Klang War]], a year after accepting British protectorate (never under Thailand), 1 July 1896 part of Federated Malay States; after the Japanese occupation British Commissioners

A similar position, under another title, was held in the other Malay states:
* 1909–41 British Advisers replaced the Thai king's Advisers in the sultanate of [[Kedah]], an unfederated state; after Japanese and Thai occupation, British Commissioners were appointed
* 1903–41 British Advisers replaced Thai ones in the sultanate of [[Kelantan]], an unfederated state; after Japanese and Thai occupation, British Commissioners were appointed
* 1909–1941 British Advisers replaced Thai ones with the Rajas of [[Perlis]], since the acceptance of British protectorate as an unfederated state instead of the Thai sovereignty (since the secession from Kedah) and were appointed again after Japanese and Thai occupation, until 1 April 1946 it joins the Malay Union (from 16 September 1963, Malaysia)
* 1904–25 British Agents were appointed to the Sultans of [[Terengganu]], i.e. even before the 9 July 1909 exchange of Thai sovereignty for a British protectorate as unfederated Malay state, then Advisers 1919–1941 (overlap merely both titles for the same incumbent); after Japanese and Thai occupation, British Commissioners were appointed.

In the [[Straits Settlements]], under direct British rule:
* in [[Singapore]], after two separate British Residents (7 February 1819 – December 1822 William Farquhar, then John Crawfurd), the Governors of the Straits Settlements filled the post 1826 – 15 February 1942; after four Japanese Military Administrators and two Japanese Mayors, a British Military Administrator 12 September 1945 – 1 April 1946, then four British Governors and the second incumbent stayed on as first of two gubernatorial 'Heads of state' styled [[yang di-pertuan negara]], his Malay successor also becoming the first President after independence
* In [[Malacca]] (Melaka), a former Dutch colony, seven consecutive British Residents were in office 1795–1818, followed by three Dutch governors; after the final inclusion in the British Strait Settlements, 1826, most were titled [[Resident Councillor]], except the period 1910–1920 reverting to the style Resident; after the Japanese occupation, [[Resident Commissioner]]s took their place until the 1957 independence installed Malaysian Governors and Chief Ministers
* In [[Penang]] (Pinang), after three [[Administration (business)|Superintendent]]s for the British East India Company (1786–1799; only [[Penang Island|Prince of Wales Island]] had yet been ceded to the British by the Sultan of Kedah), then two [[Lieutenant-governor]]s (in 1801 Province Wellesley on the mainland was added) and many Governors after 1805 (since 1826 as part of the Strait Settlements), only Resident Councillors were in office 1849–1941 (name Penang assumed in 1867); after four Japanese and since 1945 two British military governors, four Resident Commissioners 1946–1957, since then Malaysian-appointed "heads of state".

On Northern Borneo, contrary to the Malay peninsula, no such officials were appointed, in [[Sarawak]] and [[North Borneo|Sabah]] as there were white rulers or governors; but to the still sovereign Sultans of [[Brunei]], lying between those larger states, British Residents were appointed 1906–1959 (interrupted by Japanese commander Masao Baba 6 January 1942 – 14 June 1945), afterwards only High Commissioners for the matters not transferred under autonomy (and 1971 self-government) until full independence went in force 1 January 1984. The administrative head of Sarawak's geographical Divisions was, however, titled as Resident.

===French===
The French word is ''Résident-général''.

====Africa====
* In [[Morocco]], accredited with the Sultan: Residents-general 28 April 1912 – 2 March 1956 (first incumbent previously military governor)
* In [[Tunisia]], accredited with the [[Basha Bey]] [[Residents-general]] 23 June 1885 – 31 August 1955; first incumbent was the last of the two previous Resident ministers
* On [[Madagascar]]: 28 April 1886 – 31 July 1897

====Indochina====

** later downgraded (under Hué) to Residents-superior 16 May 1889 – 15 October 1945
** several regional Résidents

===Belgian===
(Belgium mainly used French in the colonies; the word in its other official language, Dutch, is ''Resident-generaal'')
* [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (cfr. German above; there were Belgian Residents ): 1960 – 1 July 1962 [[Jean-Paul Harroy]] (b. 1909 – d. 1995), staying on after being its Belgian last Governor (and Deputy Governor-General of the [[Belgian Congo]])

===Japanese (original title)===
In the protectorate [[Korea]], accredited to the [[Joseon Dynasty|Choson]] Monarch (rendered as King or Emperor) 21 Dec 1905 – 1 Oct 1910 three incumbents (including [[Hirobumi Ito]] the former Prime Minister of Japan), all Japanese peers (new western-type styles, rendered as: Marquess/Duke or Viscount); the last stayed on as the first Governor-General after full annexation to Japan.  See:  [[List of Japanese Residents-General of Korea]]

==Postcolonial Residents==
On occasion, residents were maintained, notably by former colonial powers, in territories in a transitional process to a new constitutional status, such as full independence. Such function could also be performed under another title, such as Commissioner or High Commissioner.

Thus after World War I, there were Residents in some mandate territories:
* after the French and British occupation of the former German colony [[Kamerun]] (since 26 September 1914), Britain started appointing a long line of Residents (some were District Officer or Senior D.O., others '''Deputy Resident''' or '''Senior Resident''') in its zone from 1916, even before the 28 June 1919 formal division into French and [[British Cameroons]] and the 20 July 1920 British Cameroons, League of Nations mandate; they continued in the 13 December 1946 created British Cameroons United Nations trust territory, until 31 December 1949; next a single '''Special Resident''' was appointed (although in 1949 Southern Cameroons was divided into two provinces: Bamenda, capital Bamenda, and Southern, capital Buea) until 1 October 1954 when British Cameroons became an autonomous part of [[Nigeria]]; next two Commissioners were appointed instead, until on 1 October 1961 Southern British Cameroons was incorporated into the Republic of Cameroon (the former [[French Cameroun]]), the northern part was already united with Nigeria on 1 June 1961.
* Present [[Jordan]] was part since 12 May 1920 of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate of Palestine]] (under a British [[High Commissioner]]), but in August 1920 the British create autonomous local administrations in Ajlun, Salt, and Karak—with limited success; 11 April 1921 the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] (under British mandate); 26 May 1923 Transjordan formally separated from Palestine; 28 Feb 1928 Britain recognizes Transjordan mandate as independent, but maintains military and some financial control; 25 May 1946 proclamation of the Hashemite Kingdom (style [[Malik]]) of Transjordan (present [[Jordan]]); the 17 June 1946 formal independence from Britain finally ends the term of the last of four British Residents:
** April 1921 – 21 November 1921 Albert Abramson (b. 1876 – d. 19..)
** 21 November 1921 – April 1924 Harry St. John Bridger Philby (b. 1885 – d. 1960)
** August 1924 – March 1939 Henry Cox (from 1937, Charles Henry Cox) (b. 1880 – d. 1953)
**  March 1939 – 17 June 1946 Alec Seath Kirkbride (b. 1897 – d. 1978)
*

Also after World War II, and not only in former mandate territories; e.g. in parts of [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, put under UN administration since 1946 prior to their unification as a Libyan kingdom, Britain maintained a Resident in [[Tripolitania]] April 1949 – 24 December 1951 and another in [[Cyrenaica]] 17 September 1949 – 24 December 1951, and France one in [[Fezzan]] 1950 – 24 December 1951.

In a later phase a former colony could itself appoint such Residents, as India did 5 December 1950 – 16 May 1975 in its Himalayan protectorate [[Sikkim]], then still an independent monarchy (afterwards absorbed into India as an additional constitutive state) where Britain had obtained a protectorate over the Maharaja in 1861, see above.

==Government Residents in Australia==
===Western Australia===
In the Colony of [[Western Australia]], colonial administration and local government were sometimes controlled at the regional level, by Government Residents, under the direction of the [[Colonial Secretary of Western Australia|Colonial Secretary]] (i.e. the "Governor in Council").

The main responsibility of a Government Resident was the role of [[Resident Magistrate]], and the two titles were often used interchangeably. However, they also often directed the day to day activities of police, explorers, surveyors, customs officers and other [[public servant]]s.
Government Residents were appointed (at various times), at Augusta, Busselton, Carnarvon (Gascoyne District), Champion Bay (Geraldton), Derby (Kimberley District, later West Kimberley), Fremantle, Guildford, King George's Sound (Albany), Newcastle (Toodyay), the [[North-West Australia|North District]] ([[Camden Harbour, Western Australia|Camden Harbour]]/[[Roebourne]]), Port Leschenault (Bunbury), Wyndham (East Kimberley) and York.

===Northern Territory===
In the [[Northern Territory]], under the authority of the Governor of [[New South Wales]], after having been merely under Military Commanders: 3 March 1864 – 1 January 1911, at which date it became a separate territory but the last incumbent stayed on as first of six Administrators; then again 1 February 1927 Robert Hunter Weddell was Government Resident for North Australia, until from 12 June 1931. Administrators were (and still are) appointed, even after 1978 when self-government was granted.
===Central Australia===
1 March 1927 – 12 June 1931, while the Northern Territory was split, there were two consecutive incumbents for [[Central Australia (territory)|Central Australia]].

==Other uses==
* In [[espionage]], resident (or ''rezident'') may be used to refer to the head or representative of a country's intelligence services in a foreign country, often within an [[Embassy]].
* In the U.S. and Canada, the term "chief resident" applies to a physician who is appointed to act as head of the [[Residency (medicine)|residents]] in his or her hospital, program or department.

{{Politics of Namibia}}

The '''South West Africa National Union''' (SWANU) is a Namibian political party founded in 1959. Most of its members came from the [[Herero people]], while fellow independence movement [[SWAPO]] was mostly an [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] party. The party's President is [[Usutuaije Maamberua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/letters/full-story/archive/2008/december/article/swanu-appeal-for-socialism/ Swanu Appeal For Socialism] The Namibian 12 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The first President of SWANU was [[Fanuel Kozonguizi]], who led from its formation in 1959 until 1966. [[Rihupisa Justus Kandando]] was the President prior to Maamberua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=76 Rihupisa Kandando] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611173210/http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=76 |date=11 June 2011 }} at Namibia Institute for Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Namibian parliamentary election, 1999|1999 elections]] it formed a "Socialist Alliance" with the [[Workers Revolutionary Party (Namibia)|Workers' Revolutionary Party]] and got 0.35% of the vote. In the [[Namibian parliamentary election, 2004|2004 elections]] it finished last with 3,610 votes and 0.44% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/na.html Elections in Namibia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

SWANU had its roots in the South West African Student Bureau (SWASB), an association of Namibian students studying at South African universities during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Johann Alexander|title=The Inevitable Pipeline Into Exile. Botswana's Role in the Namibian Liberation Struggle|year=2012|pages=36–41|publisher=Basler Afrika Bibliographien Namibia Resource Center and Southern Africa Library|location=Basel, Switzerland|isbn=978-3905758290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students had been radicalised by their firsthand exposure to [[apartheid]] in South Africa, and the active resistance to that system by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; In 1955, the SWASB became a political party in its own right in 1955, when its members renamed it the South West African Progressive Association (SWAPA) and appointed [[Uatja Kaukuetu]] as its first chairman.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; 

SWAPA possessed little support outside academia, however, and in an attempt to expand its support base it united with the [[Ovamboland People's Organization|Ovamboland People's Congress]] (later the ''Ovamboland People's Organisation'', or OPO), which represented Ovambo migrant labourers in [[Cape Town]], to form the South West African National Union (SWANU) on 27 September 1959.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; However, SWANU's leadership and agenda remained dominated by former SWAPA members, and OPO retained its autonomy under the partnership.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; [[Fanuel Jariretundu Kozonguizi]] was named the first president of SWANU, with Kaukuetu, the chairman of SWAPA, being appointed vice president.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; The party eventually came under the direct sponsorship of the [[South African Communist Party]] and became increasingly radical as a result.&lt;ref name=Dobell&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobell|first=Lauren|title=Swapo's Struggle for Namibia, 1960–1991: War by Other Means|year=1998|pages=27–39|publisher=P. Schlettwein Publishing Switzerland|location=Basel|isbn=978-3908193029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout late 1959, SWANU and the Herero Chiefs' Council organised a bus boycott in [[Windhoek]]'s [[Old Location]], in response to forced evictions being undertaken by the [[South African Police]].&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; The police opened fire on the protesters, killing or wounding up to sixty.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt;

The Old Location shootings was the first of several political developments which ushered in a period of decline for SWANU. In the controversy surrounding the incident, the Herero Chiefs' Council disavowed SWANU and denied involvement with the Old Location protests.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; In July 1960, the OPO dissolved its affiliation with SWANU and issued its own party constitution.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; It also rebranded itself as the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) and opened its ranks to Namibians of all ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; SWAPO's agenda was virtually identical to SWANU's: both called for an end to colonialism and imperialism, promoted pan-African ideals, and called for the economic, cultural, and social advancement of the Namibian people.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; However, SWANU placed a disproportionate emphasis on self-reliance, while SWAPO acknowledged the importance of external actors and the role of the United Nations in securing Namibian independence from South Africa.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; 

Both organisations competed for international recognition and support, and the relationship between SWAPO and SWANU's leadership grew increasingly frigid.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; SWANU was the only one of the two parties formally represented in the All-African People's Conference, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organisation, and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]].&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; It had established a political headquarters in [[Dar es Salaam]] and political offices in [[Accra]] and [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt;

Both SWANU and SWAPO received formal recognition from the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) in 1963. They also succeeded in establishing bilateral relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; The growing severity of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] drove a rift between the two parties, however, with SWANU becoming more influenced ideologically and politically by China, and SWAPO by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; 

By 1966, the OAU had raised £20,000 in obligatory contributions from OAU member states for funding nationalist movements in Namibia.&lt;ref name="Devils"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbstein|first1=Denis|last2=Evenson|first2=John|title=The Devils Are Among Us: The War for Namibia|year=1989|pages=14–23|publisher=Zed Books Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0862328962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kozonguizi was initially confident the money would be awarded to SWANU due to its international prominence and the fact that many of its members had been educated at prestigious institutions, namely in the United States and Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; However, the OAU's official policy was to base its support for anti-colonial movements on their willingness to use force if necessary.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; The money was offered to both SWANU and SWAPO for the express purposes of undertaking an armed struggle against South African rule.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; Kozonguizi refused to make a commitment to armed struggle; whether this was due to his personal preference for passive resistance or whether he was simply skeptical about the wisdom of taking up arms against the well-equipped South African security forces is disputed.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; The repercussions of his decision were politically catastrophic for SWANU.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; SWAPO was able to argue that its willingness to initiate armed struggle gave it legitimacy in the eyes of the Namibian people that SWANU lacked.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; The OAU immediately withdrew recognition from SWANU and awarded the £20,000 to SWAPO.&lt;ref name="Devils"/&gt; It also recognised SWAPO as the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt; This doomed any remaining prospects SWANU held for receiving assistance from the OAU or any black African government.&lt;ref name=Dobell/&gt;

The following year, SWANU was expelled from the Afro-Asian People's Conference.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; Its continued affiliation with the People's Republic of China made it unpopular, as both the Western nations and the Soviet bloc came to regard it as a Chinese proxy.&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; Tanzanian authorities closed SWANU's headquarters in Dar es Salaam and ordered the party to leave Tanzania.&lt;ref name=Dale&gt;{{cite book|last=Dale|first=Richard|title=The Namibian War of Independence, 1966-1989: Diplomatic, Economic and Military Campaigns|year=2014|pages=74–77, 93–95|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Incorporated Publishers|location=Jefferson|isbn=978-0786496594}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zambia]], another country which had been initially sympathetic to SWANU, began refusing to accept Namibian refugees who were members of that party.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; With SWANU exiles considered prohibited immigrants in both Zambia and Tanzania, they were forced to settle almost solely in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt; Botswana was willing to accept Namibian refugees, but forbade them from engaging in politics.&lt;ref name=Dale/&gt;

In January 2009, SWANU condemned [[Israel]] for their actions during the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]].

On the issue of [[land reform in Namibia|land reform]], SWANU advocated for state intervention to bring about reform more quickly.

== Synopsis ==
In an alternate iteration of the present, [[Tokyo]] has been hit by a [[terrorist attack]] that has devastated the city. The only evidence of the culprits is a cryptic video uploaded to the Internet, which sparks paranoia across Japan. Unbeknownst to the authorities is that the terrorist masterminds—who call themselves {{nihongo4|"Sphinx"|スピンクス|Supinkusu}}—are two teenaged boys who go by the names Nine and Twelve.

 |ShortSummary    = In Aomori, Japan, [[plutonium]] was stolen from a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility during a snow storm. A perpetrator left the message "VON" at the scene of the crime in red paint. Six months after the event, a mysterious video is posted on social media. Referring to themselves as Sphinx 1 and 2, two masked teenagers claim "Tokyo will be enveloped by darkness after 3:00 p.m. and large sparks will fly, scattered around the Shinjuku area." Despite the video coming to the attention of former detective Shibazaki, he does not initially report it. Nine and Twelve interrupt Lisa Mishima's classmates as they bully her, then take their place undercover in her school. While at the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building]], Lisa wishes everyone would disappear in frustration. At that moment, the greater Tokyo prefecture loses power and citizens in the building are evacuated without Lisa. Assuming the building free of surveillance, Nine and Twelve place stuffed animals containing thermite-based explosives beneath the sprinkler systems of the main building. When Twelve is interrupted by Lisa, he gives her one of their stuffed animal bombs and flees the building. He asks Nine to decide whether they should kill her or keep her alive. Nine's terse answer is that he will ask her directly. Lisa responds that she does not want to die, sending Twelve to extract her as the building crumbles down. Nine takes a photo of the destruction with his phone. Twelve and Lisa return unharmed, but Nine informs her as a result of her decision to live she has decided to become their accomplice. Lisa is left speechless by this.

 |ShortSummary    = It is revealed that the bombing and subsequent building collapse, despite the large scale of destruction involved, left several with minor injuries, and no fatalities. Lisa returns home from the incident shaken, but her mother (unaware of Lisa's location during the bombings) breaks down and berates her for ignoring her text messages. During her tirade, she reveals that Lisa's father has left the family. Nine and Twelve return without Lisa to their residence, to start work on a cellphone bomb. The police force gathers for a comprehensive briefing of the day's events, where they become aware of the video on social media. Nine and Twelve, aware of this, release a second video with a riddle from ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' referring to the location of their next bombsite. After finding what appears to be the answer to the riddle, police move on the suspected location, a DNA laboratory. Shibazaki phones the chief of police, Kurahashi, with alternate interpretation to the riddle, and suggests that the bomb will be in a police district office. After the bomb discharges in the district office instead of the lab, Kurahashi asks for Shibazaki to involve himself in the case. In private, Kurahashi reveals the theft of plutonium to Shibazaki, and his suspicion of the connection to the bombers. Lisa follows Twelve on the street, where he reminds her that if she reveals their secret, he will kill her.

 |ShortSummary   = Shibazaki transfers to the police agency heading the investigation, much to the dissatisfaction of several employees. As he constructs another bomb, Nine deduces from the presence of counter-[[nuclear terrorism]] special forces that the police are aware of his and Twelve's stealing of the plutonium from the Aomori nuclear facility, but intends to confirm his suspicions through another attack. Talking with Kurahashi, Shibazaki learns that one of the men who stole the plutonium worked at the nuclear facility for a short time, and had his identity erased after the incident occurred. Shibazaki then laments to Kurahashi that, as a [[Hiroshima]] native, he hated summer due to the fears held by the older townspeople who experienced [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the town's atomic bombing]] during [[World War II]]. Nine and Twelve send a third video with another riddle related to ''Oedipus Rex''. Finally unable to bear with her mentally unstable mother, Lisa runs away from home. Solving the riddle, the police streams a live recording of Shibazaki all over Japan, in which he announces the location of the newest bomb. He then issues a direct challenge to Nine and Twelve before the police is forced to cut off the livestream. Viewing news and surveillance footage and realizing the officers were wearing [[hazmat suits]], Nine realizes the police have definitely connected them to the stolen plutonium. Kurahashi reveals to other officers the reason behind Shibazaki's demotion, as Shibazaki steps outside the building and comments, "Today's another hot day."

 |ShortSummary    = Nine successfully hacks into the Metropolitan Police Department database in search of something. Twelve goes out to follow Lisa, expressing his concern that her running away from home will jeopardize the mission. Nine sends a fourth video, titled "Time Shock Bomb", where he and Twelve give another riddle related to ''Oedipus Rex'' and then state their hopes that their game would be played "without cheating", otherwise a hidden bomb will explode. Using the riddle, Shibazaki finds a website created by Nine and Twelve, which asks for a password related to three [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxims]] inscribed at the temple at [[Delphi]]. Realizing that time is running out, the police decide to search an apartment building where Nine was recorded dropping off a suspicious package, although Shibazaki is still intent on solving the riddle. Twelve finds Lisa and tells her to go home, but she refuses, then comments she was stupid for running away before fleeing. Police officers breach the apartment, only to find no bomb and a laptop instead. Time runs out, even though Shibazaki manages to solve the password (his surname). Seconds later, police investigation reports of the attacks are leaked online, drawing a shocked reaction from the public since the reports conclude the perpetrators are always one step ahead of them. Simultaneously, Twelve rescues Lisa from two police officers. While on their way to Nine's location, Lisa asks Twelve if he is going to destroy the world, to which both laugh; Lisa then comments she hadn't laughed like that in "a really long time". At Nine's location, he disapproves of Lisa staying with them, just before she suddenly collapses.

 |ShortSummary    = Lisa wakes up in Nine and Twelve's residence, while the two debate on giving her shelter. They then catch her playing around with their devices, and she faints again after learning she nearly blew up the building with one of their newly made bombs. Nine and Twelve later place the same bomb inside a passenger train. Upon returning home, they find Lisa attempting to cook, and then criticize her food. Twelve later comments to Nine that the food had value despite its taste, since it reminded him of the food at the institution. Nine and Twelve then send another video with another riddle, also saying that an explosion will occur after 8:00 p.m. if the riddle isn't solved before then. Using clues from the riddle, Shibazaki concludes the newest bomb is on the Shuto Shinjuku Line train. He then explains his discovery of a connection between all of the bombings: certain people connected to the bombsites participated in a seminar run by the Rising Peace Academy, a non-profit organization that promoted interaction between the Japanese government and the people. As the day goes by, there have been no reports of the bomb being recovered, and Nine and Twelve, not wishing to kill people, plan on deactivating it using a cellphone. However, cellphone reception goes out all over the area, preventing them from doing so, forcing them to try and remove it manually. Kurahashi later informs Shibazaki that higher-ranking agents have prevented them from removing the bomb. While trying to pinpoint the train's location, Nine is horrified when his computer is hacked into, and realizes that he might know the hacker. He then manages to find the train using a second computer and rushes to the station, throwing a [[smoke bomb]] to force commuters off the train and cover his tracks. However, one woman still remains, and the bomb explodes as he enters the train to save her. Nine is unhurt, and as he drags the commuter out of the wreckage, he receives a text message saying, "I found you". Shibazaki confronts Kurahashi about the bombing, but he informs him that he had no knowledge of it. They then spot a mysterious woman sitting nearby, whom Nine identifies as Five.

 |ShortSummary    = During a comprehensive meeting, the chief announces the involvement of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in the investigation, surprising the other officers. After Nine has a nightmare involving Five, he and Twelve discuss about her, and Nine concludes that Five is continuing a "game" the three played together previously. When Lisa offers to help them, Nine shows her pictures of the aftermath of the subway train bombing and states that this is what they were doing, which shocks her. Kurahashi later recounts to Shibazaki his meeting with the FBI agents, which include Five, whose job is described as a researcher from an American organization called the Nuclear Emergency Support Team. Twelve tells Lisa that he suffers from [[synesthesia]], a condition that allows him to see colors through sound, and describes her voice as being a "pale yellow". Five sends a text containing a riddle to the public, posing as Sphinx; the riddle can only be decoded via [[Caesar cipher]]. The answer turns out to be a set of coordinates leading to [[Haneda Airport]]'s International Terminal, one of the locations targeted by Nine and Twelve. The police try to respond to the scene, only to be told to stand by on orders from the superintendent general. Knowing that they will be caught by Five while trying to enter the terminal, Nine reluctantly decides to bring Lisa along with them, since she isn't known to be associated with him and Twelve. Shibazaki and several officers decide to disobey orders and converge on the terminal as well. Upon arriving at the terminal, Nine realizes that Five plans to play a game of chess using the airport as the chessboard.

 |ShortSummary    = Nine and Twelve decide to play along with Five's chess game. Arriving at the terminal, Shibazaki and the officers see messages being given to Nine and Twelve from Five in regards to the game and learn that the police ordered airport employees to transmit them. They realize that the latest Sphinx video was a fake created by the police, and that it is Sphinx they are communicating with. When they get closer to the bomb's potential location, Twelve sends in Lisa to create a distraction; after some hesitation, she sets off flares that trigger a fire alarm. Twelve then hacks into the camera system and brings the recordings back by five minutes, allowing Nine to rush to Five's location without being detected. He confronts Five and holds her at gunpoint with a pistol he brought, demanding to know why she is getting in the way of his and Twelve's plans. She responds that she wants to settle something with him, then reveals her knowledge of Lisa being an accomplice and that she is being held captive at the bomb's location. Airport police then arrive and fire at Nine, forcing him away. While fleeing, he briefly passes Shibazaki. Nine regroups with Twelve, who receives a phone call from Lisa describing her and the bomb's whereabouts: a plane that is on autopilot and headed for a terminal filled with numerous commuters. Realizing there is a way to save both Lisa and the commuters, Nine contacts Shibazaki, convinces him that the latest bomb isn't Sphinx's, and instructs him to infiltrate the control tower and take control of the autopilot system. Nine and Twelve rescue Lisa from the plane, while Shibazaki enters the control room and forces one of the operators to divert the plane away from the terminal at gunpoint. The plane explodes without injuring anyone, and Shibazaki spots a masked Nine, who signals him in thanks before leaving. Five manages to escape, and it is revealed that she has Lisa's school ID. Looking at it, she smiles and says, "You won't get away again."

 |ShortSummary    = In the wake of the attempted terminal bombing, the media believes the foiled attack to be the work of Sphinx. The officers who accompanied Shibazaki to Haneda Airport are reprimanded by their boss, who takes them off the case and gives them a three-month suspension, while Shibazaki himself is given a permanent suspension. Shibazaki goes to his daughter Haruka, who is studying physics at a university, and asks her if an average person could construct an atomic bomb from plutonium. She replies that with the right tools and knowledge, it is possible. Using Lisa's stolen ID, Five tracks her down at Nine and Twelve's hideout while they are away. She sends her a bomb, but Lisa escapes before it detonates, destroying the entire upper floor. Joined by Nine and Twelve, Lisa flees to an abandoned [[video arcade]] that Nine and Twelve arranged to use as an alternate refuge. There, Nine implies that it was Lisa's fault their initial headquarters was destroyed, which she sadly confirms. Shibazaki investigates on his own, and while at the [[National Archives of Japan]], he learns that a decade ago, the Rising Peace Academy implemented an operation called the "Athena Project", whose goal was to educate gifted children, but he is unable to find further details about it. He visits Ichiro Fujiwaka, a politician, and asks about it, then threatens to expose his son's illegal activities after not receiving an honest answer. Fujiwaka informs Shibazaki that orphaned children were gathered, with the gifted ones singled out for the Athena Project. Eventually leaving, Shibazaki is joined by another suspended officer, Hamura, who helps him as he follows numerous leads. Lisa later overhears Nine and Twelve arguing about what to do with her and leaves, only to be captured by Five's men. When she wakes up in Five's office, Five initially acts friendly towards her by painting her nails, but quickly becomes hostile and tells her that she does not care for the lives of Nine and Twelve. Later, Twelve receives a threatening text message from Five, revealing that Lisa has been taken hostage. Refusing Nine's pleas to remember their mission, Twelve sets off to try and rescue Lisa.

 |ShortSummary    = Nine leaves their hideout and heads to retrieve the plutonium he and Twelve have hidden. Meanwhile, Shibazaki and Hamura visit Souta Aoki, the former welfare minister, to find out more about the Athena Project. To their surprise, Aoki tells them everything about it; its connection to the members of Rising Peace Academy; and that Five was the only child to have survived by the end of the experiments within the "Settlement", a location where the orphans were secretly taken to for the purpose of artificially producing [[Savant syndrome]] in humans. However, Aoki mentions that two children, Nine and Twelve, managed to escape, then tells Shibazaki that the mastermind behind the Athena Project was in fact Dr. Shunzo Mamiya, the politician who was the reason behind Shibazaki's demotion. At the same time, while Nine is busy making the bomb, Twelve reaches the amusement park where Lisa is being held captive. As he comes onto the Ferris wheel, he finds Lisa, her body laced with several bombs that immediately activate when the ride begins to run. Twelve comforts her and begins disarming the bombs one by one. Though both seem to realize that he can't possibly defuse them all in time, Twelve continues while revealing his feelings for Lisa. Moved to tears, she nevertheless tells Twelve to escape and save himself, reminding him that Nine needs him, but Twelve refuses, just before Five calls him and tells him to give her the location of the plutonium in exchange for disarming the bombs on Lisa. She reveals that she knows Nine and Twelve had actually stolen a prototype of an atomic bomb, rather than plutonium, from Aomori. Twelve becomes torn between saving Lisa and covering for Nine, but at the last few seconds, Twelve reluctantly discloses the prototype's location. Five stops the timer, and along with it, cuts the power to the Ferris wheel, trapping Twelve and Lisa midair. Five immediately mobilizes the Metropolitan Police Department to the school, where Nine has just arrived to retrieve the bomb. Catching a glimpse of them in advance, he manages to take the prototype from the locker and tries to escape. However, he is spotted and Five, suffering from a seemingly worsening headache, immediately orders Nine to be taken down before abruptly fainting.

 |ShortSummary    = Nine goes to the police headquarters, dons his Sphinx mask, and turns himself in. He refuses to speak to anyone but Shibazaki, but later relents and issues a demand for a press conference at a specific location at 8:00 p.m., or he will activate the atomic bomb prototype. Shibazaki visits Shunzo Mamiya, who confesses that he created the Athena Project as part of a plan to revitalize Japanese national morale following the nation's defeat at the end of [[World War II]]. Five, who has been hospitalized due to her deteriorating health as a consequence of the Athena Project experiments, learns of Nine's surrender and desperately sets off to try and reach him. When Twelve hears from Lisa that Nine has surrendered, he attempts to forget about Sphinx in his shame for betraying Nine, but Lisa convinces him to help Nine like he helped her. Five's men pursue the police convoy carrying Nine to the press conference through [[Shuto Expressway]], only to find that the truck is a decoy. Enraged and desperate, Five leaves to pursue Nine herself. Twelve interferes, but Five disables his motorbike before stopping the truck carrying Nine. After killing her assistant for attempting to stop her, Five confronts Nine and confesses that she always wanted to beat him but never could. Knowing that she is dying, Five admits her love for Nine, begs him to live for them both, and gives him a brief kiss before committing suicide by detonating the spilled gasoline from her car. The Japanese airwaves are then hijacked by a prerecorded message from Nine: as his plans for the press conference were disrupted, the countdown for the atomic bomb's detonation has begun. Declaring that this is the final message from Sphinx, Nine unmasks himself and bids the people of Japan farewell.

 |ShortSummary    = Japan goes into a state of panic from Nine's declaration, and Tokyo's entire population begins to evacuate. Lisa regroups with a severely injured Twelve, who greets her before collapsing. Citing that Sphinx had killed no one during all of the attacks, Shibazaki assumes the atomic bomb is just part of a message from them. He then calls Haruka and asks her of the existence of the possibility that an atomic bomb can explode without inflicting a single casualty; she replies that it would be possible if it explodes while in the stratosphere, otherwise known as a "high-altitude nuclear explosion". Hamura realizes that Sphinx would be using a balloon to lift the atomic bomb into the air. Finding a security video of a balloon carrying a box into the air, the police realize that Sphinx plans on disabling all of Japan's electronic devices with an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that would result in the atomic explosion, essentially paralyzing the country. They then realize that aircraft would also be disabled, and there are hundreds of passenger flights currently in the air, carrying evacuated citizens. Fighter jets are dispatched to intercept the atomic bomb but are unable to succeed, while Nine goes up a skyscraper as he observes the countdown on his cellphone. Simultaneously, the passenger flights are all grounded, and Twelve regains consciousness. He is asked by Lisa if Nine really was going to destroy the whole world, to which he replies that he and Nine were always alone and were never needed by anyone before. He then thanks Lisa and proclaims that he is glad to have met her, which prompts her to smile seconds before the atomic bomb detonates. Everyone watches the explosion occur before the entire city is plunged into darkness, followed by an [[aurora]], formed by the radiation from the atomic bomb, illuminating the sky.

The following day, Tokyo's buildings and streets are completely abandoned. Nine heads to the Settlement, where he sets up makeshift grave markers for the children who died from the Athena Project's experiments, including Five. He is then joined by Twelve and Lisa, and forgives the former for his actions. The three then spend the rest of the day playing around with a ball and listening to music. As night falls, they are approached by Shibazaki, who tells them that if they turn themselves in, then Project Athena will be exposed to the world and will not be ignored by anyone anymore. Minutes later, U.S. helicopters arrive and hold Nine and Twelve at gunpoint, but Nine pulls out a detonator, claiming that it is for another atomic bomb designed by the Japanese government, which is now in a nuclear power plant. Despite the threat, the soldiers shoot and kill Twelve under orders from their superior, who wants to keep the American government's involvement in the investigation a secret. Shibazaki orders the soldiers to stand down, then negotiates with an outraged Nine, who eventually gives the detonator to him before abruptly experiencing the same headache Five suffered. Before dying, he tells Shibazaki to always remember Sphinx.

One year later, it is revealed that Project Athena was exposed to the world, leaving the Japanese government under scrutiny. Lisa and Shibazaki visit the graves of Nine, Twelve, Five, and the other experimented children regularly, and are on a familiar basis with each other. While coming across Shibazaki one day, Lisa tells him what Nine had told her before his death: the meaning of "VON", which is [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] for "hope".

'''The Association of World Election Bodies''', commonly referred to as ‘A-WEB,’ was established on October 14, 2013 in Song-do, [[South Korea|South]] [[Korea]]. A-WEB is the first global organization of election management bodies, and the membership currently consists of 97 organizations from 94 countries. Under the slogan of ‘Democracy to Grow for All Worldwide,’ the A-WEB Secretariat provides training programs for election officials of member nations and undertakes country programs at the request of member organization, providing support during the election cycle to boost election management capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-WEB Promotional Booklet|url=http://www.aweb.org/site/program/board/basicboard/view?menuid=002004001&amp;pagesize=8&amp;boardtypeid=20&amp;boardid=75|website=A-WEB Website|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and Inauguration==

The [[National Election Commission (South Korea)|National Election Commission]] of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] first proposed the creation of a global election management body institution to the Association of Asian Election Authorities (AAEA) in 2010. After a series of Working Group meetings,&lt;ref name="World delegates launch Association of World Election Bodies Monday"&gt;{{cite web|title=World delegates launch Association of World Election Bodies Monday|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=152195|website=Arirang News|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Charter was drawn up and the name A-WEB was chosen upon the suggestion of the [[Election Commission of India]].&lt;ref name="PROPOSED ASSOCIATION OF WORLD ELECTION BODIES (A-WEB)"&gt;{{cite web|title=PROPOSED ASSOCIATION OF WORLD ELECTION BODIES (A-WEB)|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/inter_corp_pdf/PAWEB.pdf|website=Election Commission of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A-WEB was inaugurated on October 14, 2013. Over 400 participants from 140 election management bodies, international organizations and non-governmental organizations attended the ceremony in Song-do South Korea, where the Secretariat was established. 97 organizations gained membership into A-WEB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's elections bodies launch new partnership|website=The Electoral Integrity Project|publisher=http://electoralintegrity.blogspot.kr/2013/10/worlds-elections-bodies-launch-new.html|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

A-WEB essentially has three main bodies. The Executive Board serves the executive function and meets yearly to make decisions on A-WEB’s general direction. It consists of up to ten member organizations and the Board must maintain a continental balance. The more members there are from a particular continent, the more members of the Executive Board should be from that continent. The Executive Board is headed by a Chairperson who leads the meetings of the board.

The remaining members make up the second body, the General Assembly. The General Assembly convenes once every two years and votes are important issues related to A-WEB and decisions made by the Executive Board. The General Assembly also elects the members of the Executive Board and confirms the induction of new member organizations.

Finally, the secretariat carries out the general administrative work of A-WEB and is based in the country where the Secretary General (elected by the Executive Board) resides. Currently the secretariat is based in Song-do, South Korea. Other member countries send secondee staff to operate the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-WEB Charter|url=http://www.rec.gov.by/sites/default/files/pdf/A-WEB_eng.pdf|website=The Central Election Commission of Belarus|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and Country Programs==

A-WEB currently undertakes most of its training programs in the secretariat main office. These training programs are broken into two broad categories; A-WEB’s own training projects and those in collaboration with other organizations such as the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KIOCA) and the Korea Civic Education Institute (KOCEI). In total, A-WEB has trained 622 election officials from 72 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Annual Report|url=http://www.aweb.org/site/program/board/basicboard/view?menuid=002004001&amp;pagesize=8&amp;boardtypeid=20&amp;boardid=274|website=A-WEB Website|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A-WEB also undertakes large-scale country projects at the request of member organizations. The first is in Kyrgyzstan alongside the country’s Central Election Commission. The program aims to introduce the Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) election system into Kyrgyzstan elections scheduled on October 4, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NEC hosts Kyrgyz Republic Election Officials as part of A-WEB’s Capacity Building Program|url=http://www.nec.go.kr/engvote_2013/04_news/01_02.jsp?num=148&amp;pg=1&amp;col=&amp;sw=|website=National Election Commission of the Republic of Korea|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KOICA to open Bishkek Office|url=http://www.koica.go.kr/english/board/press_releases/1319425_3534.html|website=KOICA English Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other country program currently underway is in Kenya alongside the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, where A-WEB is working to develop election ICT and the capacity of the organization ahead of general elections in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-WEB Annual Schedule|url=http://www.aweb.org/site/program/board/basicboard/view?menuid=002003002&amp;pagesize=10&amp;searchmonth=&amp;searchyear=2015&amp;boardtypeid=24&amp;boardid=258|website=A-WEB Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy - Tripoli''' is an active campaign in Libya’s capital and largest city, Tripoli, to reinstate the [[Constitution of Libya (1951)|1951 Constitution]] and the historic [[Senussi|Senussi monarchy]]. Members of the movement view the 1951 Constitution as the only political solution to the [[Libyan Civil War (2011–present)|Libyan Civil War]] that has persisted since 2011. The members of the movement advocate for the legitimate heir to the Senussi Crown Prince [[Mohammed El Senussi]], son of Crown Prince [[Hasan as-Senussi]] and nephew of late [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]], to lead Libya according to the provisions of the 1951 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.libyaherald.com/2016/08/31/call-for-restoration-of-senussi-monarchy-and-1951-constitution-on-47th-anniversary-of-1969-coup/|title=Fresh call for restoration of Senussi monarchy and 1951 constitution on 47th anniversary of 1969 coup|last=Fornaji|first=Hadi|date=2016-08-31|work=Libya Herald|access-date=2017-10-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tripoli’s Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy, which has been active for a number of years, is part of the nationwide Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy in Libya which is also active in [[Tobruk]], [[Zliten]], [[Jebel Akhdar, Libya|Jebel Akhdar]] and [[Misurata]]. 

== Campaign for constitutional legitimacy ==
The members of the movement in Tripoli view the 1951 Constitution as the basis for establishing national sovereignty and returning stability to the Libyan homeland. 

The movement in Tripoli has been active for several years and has had a social media presence on [[Facebook]] since early 2014. In 2014 it proclaimed:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-_-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%B3-317037058450330/posts/?ref=page_internal|title=حراك العودة للشرعية الدستورية _ طرابلس|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The movement for the return to constitutional legitimacy provides a vision aimed at stabilizing the political situation in the country, based on the return of constitutional legitimacy with the inherent right to establish the nation and unity, as approved by the founding fathers and grandfathers of the independent state of Libya […] with the return of constitutional legitimacy, a minimum level of consensus can be found between all the forces and components of the Libyan people. This enables them to formulate a charter that guarantees the safety and unity of the nation and guarantees the dignity and security of the citizen."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Local events in support of the 1951 Constitution ==
The movement actively posts to its Facebook page on a weekly basis, including pertinent speeches, events and news coverage surrounding the 1951 constitution. 

On January 25, 2017, it posted that the draft national constitutional entitlement "which represents a political solution to the Libyan crisis" would be announced on January 26th.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In December 2016, the movement proclaimed:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"All Libyans must loudly claim to activate the Constitution of Independence and to invite the rightful heir […] and Crown Prince Hassan Mohammed Rida al-Mahdi al-Sanusi to receive full constitutional duties to save our country […] and save the country from division and stop the bleeding of the Libyan people."&lt;/blockquote&gt;On December 6th, 2016, it shared a collection of photos from a peaceful march in the Algiers Square of Tripoli to demand the return to constitutional legitimacy and for Prince Mohammed El Senussi to "receive full constitutional powers as the king of Libya."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In February 2016, the movement said it had attended a four-hour-long meeting with the [[General National Congress]] of Libya to present the initiative to return to constitutional legitimacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In December 2014, the movement held a peaceful demonstration for the reestablishment of the 1951 Constitution and a conference at a hotel in [[Bayda, Libya|El-Bayda]], attended by politicians, businessmen, academics and tribal leaders in [[Cyrenaica|Barqa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alwasat.ly/ar/news/libya/51528/|title=«العودة للشرعية الدستورية» يعقد ملتقاه الثاني في البيضاء|last=|first=|date=|work=بوابة الوسط|access-date=2017-10-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same month, it shared photos from a meeting with the Mayor of Tripoli, [[Mahdi al-Harati|Mr. Mahdi Abdul Hamid Al-Harati]] to strengthen national unity and rally support for the 1951 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/317037058450330/photos/pcb.416765448477490/416765265144175/?type=3&amp;theater|title=حراك العودة للشرعية الدستورية _ طرابلس|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2014, it announced its first Board of Directors meeting in the [[Zawiyat al-Dahmani|Zawiyat Al-Dahmani]] district.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Prince Mohammed El Senussi ==
The movement refers to Crown Prince Mohammed El Senussi as "the holder of constitutional legitimacy" and advocates for his reinstatement as leader of Libya. It frequently shares press releases and speeches by the Prince himself commenting on important matters of the Libyan state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On August 9, 2017, the movement shared a statement by Prince Senussi honoring the seventy-seventh anniversary of the establishment of the [[Libyan Army (1951–2011)|Libyan army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mohammedelsenussi.org/2013-12-19-17-59-38|title=Mohammed El-Senussi - بيانات صحفية|last=|first=|date=|website=mohammedelsenussi.org|language=ar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It circulated a press release from Prince Senussi who cautioned political leaders and their international sponsors that lifting the arms embargo on Libya could lead to more conflict and [[extremism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In December 2016, the movement shared the video of a speech by Prince Senussi on December 24, 2016 through a "Free Libya" [[Vimeo]] account, stating "we ask [[Allah]] Almighty to make and accelerate the release and save Libya on his hands."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== International coverage ==
[[United States|U.S.]]-based ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' published an article in February 2016 titled "A Radical Idea to Rebuild a Shattered Libya: Restore the Monarchy."  The article described how since the Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi's]] [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|1969 coup]] and dissolution of the monarchy, "the popular memory of King Idris, who died in [[Cairo]] in 1983, has quietly endured in Libya."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/middleeast/a-radical-idea-to-rebuild-a-shattered-libya-restore-the-monarchy.html|title=A Radical Idea to Rebuild a Shattered Libya: Restore the Monarchy|last=Walsh|first=Declan|date=2016-02-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It summarizes supporters' hope to "restore a form of monarchy […] to let Libyans rally behind a respected father figure and begin to rebuild their splintered nation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, [[Germany|German]] outlet ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' commented that "the security situation in Libya remains chaotic – not ideal conditions to draw up a new constitution. But a 63-year-old constitution, framed under the old monarchy, could help the federalists." In reference to reintroducing the monarchy, it said "at the moment, the old kingdom looks a lot more attractive than the Gadhafi era or the current state of near-anarchy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/libya-looks-to-past-for-new-constitution/a-17562341|title=Libya looks to past for new constitution|last=|first=|date=2014-12-04|website=Deutsche Welle|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wales Audit Office''' (WAO) is an independent public body which was established by the [[National Assembly for Wales]] on 1 April 2005. It has overall responsibility for auditing on behalf of the [[Auditor General for Wales]], across all sectors of government in Wales, except those reserved to the UK government.

== Function ==
Their aim is to ensure that the people of Wales know whether public money is being managed wisely and that public bodies in Wales understand how to improve outcomes.&lt;ref name="About us"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wao.gov.uk/about-us|title = About us 'Making Public Money Count'|publisher = Wales Audit Office |accessdate = 2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This overall aim is supported by four key objectives:

* Provide timely assurance on governance and stewardship of public money and assets
* Offer useful insight on the extent to which resources are used well in meeting people's needs
* Clearly identify and promote ways to which the provision of public services may be improved
* Be an accountable, well-run and efficient organisation that provides a stimulating and rewarding environment to work&lt;ref name="Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wao.gov.uk/publication/wales-audit-office-corporate-strategy-2013-2016|title = ‘Corporate Strategy 2013-2016’|publisher = Wales Audit Office|accessdate = 2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WAO currently audits around 800 public bodies including the [[Welsh Government]], [[NHS Wales]], and local government.

== Structure ==
[[File:Wales Audit Office, Cardiff - geograph-4088258-by-Jaggery.jpg|thumb|Wales Audit Office in Cathedral Road, Cardiff]]
The WAO takes the form of a statutory board, which employs staff, secures resources and monitors and advises the Auditor General. The National Assembly for Wales appoints the Chair and 3 other non-executive members to the board. The other members are the '''Auditor General''' and 3 employees.&lt;ref name="Who's who"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wao.gov.uk/about-us/whos-who|title = 'Who's who'|publisher = Wales Audit Office |accessdate = 2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The WAO currently employ around 240 people across 3 offices in Cardiff, Swansea and Ewloe.

== History ==
On 1 July 1999, The National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 came into effect, this transferred all powers from the Secretary of State for Wales to the National Assembly for Wales. Wales did not have its own auditing body, as all public auditing was carried out by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] and the '''Audit Commission'''. It was not until 1 April 2005 that the Wales Audit Office was created after the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004 came into effect.

== Legislation ==
The [[Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004]], the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] and [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] and other legislation currently provide the statutory basis for the Auditor General and the auditors he appoints in local government to fulfill their purpose across the Welsh public sector. In 2012 the Welsh Government introduced before the National Assembly the Public Audit (Wales) Bill. One feature of the Bill as currently drafted is to make provision for the Auditor General to be the statutory auditor of local government bodies.&lt;ref name="Strategy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20233">[[File:Comandanta Ramona by bastian.jpg|thumb|[[Comandanta Ramona]], perhaps the most famous female Zapatista actor.]]
'''Women''' have been influential in the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) ''Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional'', a revolutionary leftist group in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], by participating as armed insurgents and civil supporters. In the 1990s, one-third of the insurgents were women and half of the Zapatista support base was women. The EZLN organization style involved consensus and participation by everyone, including women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodriguez|first=Victoria|title=Women's Participation in Mexican Political Life|year=1998|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, CO|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, one aspect of the EZLN’s ideology was [[gender equality]] and rights for women. After the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, the EZLN announced the Women’s Revolutionary Law which was a set of ten laws that granted rights to women regarding marriage, children, work, health, education, political and military participation, and protected women from violence. Prominent figures who joined the movement early on such as [[Comandante Ramona]] and Major Ana Maria encouraged other women to join the Zapatistas.

==Background==

===Indigenous Women of Chiapas===
[[File:Zapatista Dolls for Sale - Chamula - Chiapas - Mexico - 02 (15638772616).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dolls from [[Chamula]].]]
In Chiapas during the second half of the twentieth century, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] women were married at a very young age, usually around thirteen or fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rovira|first=Guiomar|title=Women of Maize: Indigenous Women and the Zapatista Rebellion|year=2000|publisher=Latin American Bureau|location=London|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They tended to have little choice in the matter; the future husband selected a woman and the marriage was negotiated between the parents. Once married, the women fulfilled their primary roles of child-rearing, cooking, and housekeeping, though they also participated in other labor such as agriculture.  Married women were often subject to mistreatment by their husbands, including physical abuse. In addition, indigenous women of Chiapas lacked access to formal education, and they typically did not learn [[Spanish language|Spanish]] like many men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kampwirth|first=Karen|title=Women and Guerrilla Movements: Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chiapas, Cuba|year=2002|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, PA|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This inhibited their socioeconomic mobility because Spanish is the main language spoken in cities and used in business practices.

===Indigenous Women and Internal Migration===
In the 1950s, the [[Mexican government]] encouraged migration from the highlands to the [[Lacandon Jungle]] area of eastern Chiapas, the locus of the EZLN, because of demands for [[Agrarian land reform in Mexico|land reform]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFKampwirth2002|Kampwirth 2002]], p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, men forced their wives to accompany them to the jungle. Women did not want to leave because many of them had never left their villages in the [[Chiapas highlands|highlands of Chiapas]].  Due to the mixing of various [[ethnic group]]s in the new location, women learned other [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]] and were able to communicate more broadly.{{sfn|Kampwirth|2002|p=91}}

There were some differences for those who stayed in the highlands. Men started working with the new businesses and industries, while women were not able to work as wage laborers. Women earned cash in other ways as street vendors or as maids in [[Ladino people|ladino]] homes.{{sfn|Kampwirth|2002|p=93}} Some of the street vendors sold handmade crafts to tourist in the cities, and these women organized into artisan collectives. They also formed other types of economic collectives such as for bread-making and vegetable gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Hilary|title=We Learn as We Go: Zapatista Women Share Their Experiences|url=http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/%20view/1224/1/|newspaper=Toward Freedom|date=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rural women could also remain in their village and still contribute to the collective. This was an early instance of women organizing and working to better themselves. The maids earned cash, but suffered abuse in the ladino plantations. Physical and sexual abuse were commonly committed by the ladino landowners against the women who worked in their homes.{{sfn|Klein|2008}} Independence, new skills, and grievances gained from these experiences led women to join the EZLN.{{sfn|Kampwirth|2002|p=93}}

==Involvement==

===Military and Political Involvement===
The EZLN made its first appearance on the national and international scene with the seizing of [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]] as well as six other towns in Chiapas on January 1, 1994, which coincided with Mexico entering into the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. This uprising declared war against the Mexican state with the issuing of the First Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle and their Revolutionary Laws. Major Ana Maria, a woman, led the capture of San Cristóbal de las Casas.

Women comprised one-third of the EZLN army, and a significant portion of them held commanding offices.{{sfn|Kampwirth|2002|p=84}} In addition, about half of the EZLN’s support base was women.{{sfn|Kampwirth|2002|p=84}} Initially, the majority of the women insurgents were in the less-organized local militias, but later decided to join the actual EZLN.{{sfn|Rovira|2000|p=39}} The women who joined as insurgents had to renounce having a family of their own, because it was too difficult to care for children in the conditions they lived in. There was family planning for women insurgents, but for those who did get pregnant, they either went home or left the child with their parents. In the insurgent camps men and women share cooking and cleaning tasks equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perez|first=Matilde and Laura Castellanos|title=Do Not Leave Us Alone! Interview with Comandante Ramona|url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/hcleaver/www/bookalone.html|work=Originally published in Doble Jornada|date=7 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining the EZLN allowed women greater access to educational opportunities. Zapatistas spoke Spanish as a common language between the various [[Mayan languages]]. So the Zapatista women learned Spanish and also had the opportunity to learn to read and write.

===Other Involvement===
Despite not being actual insurgents in the EZLN, many indigenous women still supported the EZLN in other ways. These women were those who were typically older or had families to care for. The civilian women contributed by warning communities if the military arrived, operating radios to notify communities of federal troop movement, sewing uniforms, feeding troops, and more.{{sfn|Rovira|2000|p=37}}

== Indigenous feminism in the EZLN ==

Westernization, neoliberal globalization, and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] affected indigenous communities in [[Chiapas, Mexico]] in that it prompted the emergence of indigenous feminism. Indigenous feminism has "its own unique flair. It is an important site of gender struggle that explicitly recognizes the vital issues of cultural identity, nationalism, and decolonization. Their struggle is based in a blend of their unique ethnic, class and gender identities. In Mexico, indigenous women, feminists or not, are deeply involved in the political and social struggles of their communities. Simultaneously to these struggles, they have created specific spaces to reflect on their experiences of exclusion as women, as indigenous and as indigenous women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hymn|first1=Soneile|title=Indigenous Feminism in Southern Mexico|url=http://sites.psu.edu/illichjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/13963/2013/06/hymn4.pdf|publisher=The International Journal of Illich Studies 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though feminism is seen as a result of Westernization, indigenous women have struggled to “draw on and navigate Western ideologies while preserving and attempting to reclaim some indigenous traditions...which have been eroded with the imposition of dominant western culture and ideology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hymn|first1=Soneile|title=Indigenous Feminism in Southern Mexico|url=http://sites.psu.edu/illichjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/13963/2013/06/hymn4.pdf|publisher=The International Journal of Illich Studies 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous feminism is invested in struggles of women, indigenous people, and look to their roots for solutions whilst using some western ideas for achieving these goals.

The women are invested in the collective struggle as the Zapatistas, and of women in general. In an interview with Ana Maria, one of the movement leaders said that the women "participated in the first of January (Zapatista Uprising)... the women’s struggle is 	the struggle of everybody. In EZLN, we do not fight for our own interests but struggle against every situation that exists in Mexico; against all the injustice, all the marginalization, all the poverty, and all the exploitation that Mexican women suffer. Our struggle in EZLN is not for women in Chiapas but for all the Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=Yun-Joo|title=Constructing New Meanings through Traditional Values : Feminism and the Promotion of Women’s Rights in the Mexican Zapatista Movement|url=http://www.ajlas.org/v2006/paper/2007vol20no305.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of Western capitalist systems of development and culture makes flexibility in gender and labor roles more difficult than the indigenous cultures historical way of living off of the land. “Indigenous women’s entry into the money economy has been analyzed as making their domestic and subsistence work evermore dispensable to the reproduction of the labor force and thus reducing women’s power within the family. Indigenous men have been 	forced by the need to help provide for the family in the globalized capitalist economic system that favors paid economic labor while depending on female subordination and unpaid subsistence labor. These ideals are internalized by many workers and imported back into the communities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hymn|first1=Soneile|title=Indigenous Feminism in Southern Mexico|url=http://sites.psu.edu/illichjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/13963/2013/06/hymn4.pdf|publisher=The International Journal of Illich Studies 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capitalistic infiltration harmed Gender role, they were becoming more and more restrictive and polarized with the ever-growing imposition of external factors on indigenous communities. Ever since the arrival of the Europeans and their clear distinction in the views of “home/work, domestic/productive, (soon to become the public and the private” separations and distinctions began to be made, and value began being placed in different forms.

Indigenous feminism also gave rise to more collaboration and contact between indigenous and mestiza women in the informal sector. After the emergence of the Zapatistas, more meaningful collaboration started to take place, and six months after the EZLN uprising, the first Chiapas State Women’s Convention was held. Six months after that, the National Women’s Convention was held in Querétaro; it included the participation of over three hundred women from fourteen different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hymn|first1=Soneile|title=Indigenous Feminism in Southern Mexico|url=http://sites.psu.edu/illichjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/13963/2013/06/hymn4.pdf|publisher=The International Journal of Illich Studies 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1997, the first National Gathering of Indigenous Women took place in the state of Oaxaca, it was organized by indigenous women and was attended by over 400 women. One of the most prevalent issues discussed in the conventions, was the dynamics between mestizas and indigenous women. Oftentimes it became the situation where the mestizas tended to “help” and the indigenous women were the one being “helped.”

The Zapatistas’ movement was the first time a guerrilla movement held women’s liberation as part of the agenda for the uprising. Major Ana Maria&lt;ref&gt;[[Women in the EZLN#Major Ana Maria]]&lt;/ref&gt;—who was not only the woman who lead the EZLN capture of San Cristobal de las Casas during the uprising, but also one of the women who helped create the Women’s Revolutionary Law,&lt;ref&gt;[[Women in the EZLN#Women.27s Revolutionary Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ‘A general law was made, but there was no women’s law. And so we protested and said that there has to be a women’s law when we make our demands. We also want the government to recognize us as women. The right to have equality, equality of men and women.’ The Women’s Revolutionary Law came about through a woman named Susana and Comandanta Ramona&lt;ref&gt;[[Women in the EZLN#Comandante Ramona]]&lt;/ref&gt; traveling to dozens of communities and to ask the opinions of thousands of women. The Women’s Revolutionary Law was released along with the rest of the Zapatista demands aimed at the government during their public uprising on New Years Day of 1994.
	 
“For the first time in the history of Latin American guerrilla movements, women members were analyzing and presenting the “personal” in politically explicit terms. This is not to say, however, that in Zapatista communities women don’t have to fight for equality and dignity. Revolutionary laws are a means, and usually a beginning,not an end. But all in all, the existence and knowledge of the law, even for women who don’t actually 	know what it says, has had great symbolic importance as the seedling of the current indigenous women’s movement in Mexico.”&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.psu.edu/illichjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/13963/2013/06/hymn4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to acknowledge that not only was it a monumental move for so many women to be in the ranks and forefront of a movement, but they also went beyond that and made their own demands. They participated in the collective struggle, but also made sure their struggle was heard, acknowledged, and validated.

==Women's Revolutionary Law==
On the day of the uprising, the EZLN announced the Women’s Revolutionary Law with the other Revolutionary Laws. The [[Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee]] created and approved of these laws which were developed through with consultation of indigenous women. The Women’s Revolutionary Law strived to change “traditional patriarchal domination” and it addressed many of the grievances that Chiapas women had.{{sfn|Rovira|2000|p=5}} These laws coincided with the EZLN’s attempt to “shift power away from the center to marginalized sectors."{{sfn|Rovira|2000|p=6}} The follow are the ten laws that comprised the Women’s Revolutionary Law:
* First, women have the right to participate in the revolutionary struggle in the place and at the level that their capacity and will dictates without any discrimination based on race, creed, color, or political affiliation.
* Second, women have the right to work and to receive a just salary.
* Third, women have the right to decide on the number of children they have and take care of.
* Fourth, women have the right to participate in community affairs and hold leadership positions if they are freely and democratically elected.
* Fifth, women have the right to primary care in terms of their health and nutrition.
* Sixth, women have the right to education.
* Seventh, women have the right to choose who they are with (i.e. choose their romantic/sexual partners) and should not be obligated to marry by force.
* Eighth, no woman should be beaten or physically mistreated by either family members or strangers. Rape and attempted rape should be severely punished.
* Ninth, women can hold leadership positions in the organization and hold military rank in the revolutionary armed forces.
* Ten, women have all the rights and obligations set out by the revolutionary laws and regulations.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1998|p=150}}

==Encuentro==
In December 2007, an ''encuentro'' (gathering) was held in la Garrucha, a small indigenous village in Chiapas, for Zapatista women to discuss issues related to women. Three thousand participants attended, including approximately three hundred Zapatista women. The encuentro was considered a space for women; so men were allowed to attend the gathering, but not to participate.

These women covered topics such as their lives before the uprising, what had changed since, and how women have participated in the EZLN. Also, the Zapatista women talked about the terrible conditions that women suffered which the Zapatistas sought to fix, including: the mistreatment from working for landowners, violence at home, discrimination faced in their own communities, and lack of access to health care and education. Then, the women went on to discuss how the Zapatista movement changed their lives such as decreasing domestic violence, more freedom in regards to marriage and children, and more rights in general. One way that women achieved these changes is through the women’s collectives which allowed the women to be more independent which led to increased participation in the Zapatista movement.{{sfn|Klein|2008}}

===Comandante Ramona===
[[Comandante Ramona]] was the [[nom de guerre]] of one of the early political leaders in the EZLN.{{sfn|Klein|2008}} She only spoke [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]], and so used translators to translate between Tzotzil and Spanish.{{sfn|Perez &amp; Castellanos|1994}} Ramona worked in the communities with political organizing, but was not involved as an insurgent.{{sfn|Perez &amp; Castellanos|1994}} In February 1994 following the initial uprising, Ramona attended peace talks and served as a negotiator with the Mexican government.

The '''Wyoming Rule''' is a proposal to increase the [[United States congressional apportionment|size of the United States House of Representatives]] so that the standard representative-to-population ratio would be that of the smallest entitled unit, which is currently [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/representation-in-the-house-the-wyoming-rule/], Outside the Beltway, Dec. 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Article I of the U.S. Constitution]], each [[U.S. state]] is guaranteed at least one [[Member of the U.S. House of Representatives|representative]]. If the disparity between the population of the most and least populous states continues to grow, the disproportionality of the House will continue to increase unless the House (whose size has been fixed at 435 since 1913) is expanded.

A total of 568 House seats would have been required to implement the Wyoming Rule based on the 2000 Census results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fruitsandvotes.wordpress.com/category/american-political-reform/us-house], [[Matthew Søberg Shugart]], [Fruits and Votes], July 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decade leading up to the [[2010 United States Census]] saw Wyoming's population increase at a greater rate than that of the U.S. as a whole; as a result, the required House size to implement the Wyoming Rule was reduced to 545.

The wide disparity in population among the states combines with the cap on House membership to lessen the effective representation for people who live in more populated states. The most glaring example is [[Montana]], which, according to the 2010 Census, had a population of 989,417 with one representative, compared to Rhode Island's 1,052,931 residents with two. This makes a Rhode Islander's vote worth 88% more than a vote from a Montanan. Under the Wyoming Rule California would gain the most seats with 13 more House members than it has currently. 

While a larger House size will generally result in the smallest and largest districts being proportionally closer in size, this is not always the case. Therefore, in some cases, the Wyoming Rule may actually result in an increase in the ratio of the sizes of the largest and smallest districts. For instance, after the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]] and with a House size of 435, the largest district (Montana's at-large district) had 799,065 residents, 76% larger than the smallest district (Wyoming's at-large district with 453,588 residents). The Wyoming Rule would have given a House size of 547 in 1990 if the former method of seat apportionment been used. With that size, the largest district (North Dakota's at-large district) would have had 638,800 residents, 92% larger than the smallest districts (Delaware's two districts, at approximately 333,084 residents each).

==Legal basis for Current House Size==
The current size of the house was set by [[Reapportionment Act of 1929|The Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929]].  This law would need to be repealed and replaced in order to change the number of Congressional members, which would require a majority of both houses of Congress to approve it.

==In the current House (2010 Census)==
The chart set out below identifies the number of House members that would be given to the respective states if the Wyoming Rule were to be implemented using the population numbers from the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].

Delaware, with two (and an average of 448,967 people per seat) would have the most seats per capita. South Dakota's lone seat (814,180 people per seat) have cost the most people. This gives a ratio of 1 to 1.81345 between greatest and smallest cost per seat. By comparison, it would be 1 to 1.88000 for the current 1 seat of Montana (989,415 per seat), and Rhode Islands 2 seats (526,284 per seat).

Note that North Dakota and South Dakota would have one representative each, but would have three if merged into one state. This is due to both states having more residents per representative than the national average. South Dakota falls just a few thousand people short of a second representative, having roughly 1.44 times the population of Wyoming.

Other states just short of getting an extra vote in the House include Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, and New Hampshire, who all have more than 650,000 people per representative. At the other end of the scale, states like Delaware, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico just manage to secure an extra seat in Congress, having below 525,000 people per representative each.

==Historical House sizes==

The following table describes how the House of Representatives would have looked like historically, had the Wyoming Rule been adopted when the Constitution was ratified. Note that for the 1787 estimate and censuses 1800 through 1860, all slaves (and not [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]]) are included in populations, giving representatives to slave states in too large numbers.

'''Yield protection''' (commonly referred to as '''Tufts syndrome''') is an [[College admissions|admissions]] practice where a [[university]] or academic institution rejects or wait-lists highly qualified students on the grounds that such students are bound to be accepted by more prestigious universities or programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beware the Tufts Syndrome|url=http://www.collegeconfidential.com/admit/beware-the-tufts-syndrome/|website=[[College Confidential (company)|College Confidential]]|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, alternate theories regard the yield protection as a myth propagated by college students who failed to gain admission to elite universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/connection/a2z/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=11 |title=Yield Protection: myth or reality? Or a little of both? |work=[[University of Michigan Law School]] |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |first=Sarah |last=Zearfoss |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yield (college admissions)|Yield]] rate refers to the proportion of students who matriculate (i.e. accept an admissions offer and attend the college) after acceptance to a college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collegeapps.about.com/od/glossaryofkeyterms/g/yield.htm What Is "Yield" in the College Admissions Process?]&lt;/ref&gt;
