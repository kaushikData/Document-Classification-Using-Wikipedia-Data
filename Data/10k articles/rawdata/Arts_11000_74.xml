The '''Alhambra''' was a popular theatre and [[music hall]] located on the east side of [[Leicester Square]], in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of [[London]]. It was built originally as the Royal Panopticon of Science and Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Odeon Leicester Square: Formerly – The Royal Panopticon of Science and Art / The Alhambra Theatre | url =http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra.htm | website = arthurlloyd.co.uk | publisher = Arthur Lloyd Theatres | access-date = 12 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opening on 18 March 1854. It was closed after two years and reopened as the Alhambra. The building was demolished in 1936. The name was also adopted by many other British music hall theatres located elsewhere; in [[Bradford Alhambra|Bradford]], in Hull and in [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Glasgow]] etc. The name comes from association with the Moorish splendour of the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]], Spain.

==History==
===Origins===
The Alhambra was originally known as the [[Royal Panopticon]] and was a landmark building at 23–27 Leicester Square, completed in 1854 by T. Hayter Lewis as a venue for showcasing the finest in the arts and for [[scientific]] demonstrations and popular education. This lasted for two years, and then the decision to add a circus ring was taken. When it reopened on 3 April 1858 it was renamed the Alhambra.

The 1858 building  conversion to the ''Alhambra Circus'', was also by T. Hayter Lewis. It had a {{convert|104|ft|m|1}} frontage and was very tall for the time. It was built in a [[Moorish]] style, with lavish fenestration, two towers and a dome, similar to the eponymous [[Bradford]] theatre in architectural style. It was a complete contrast with the neighbouring buildings. Inside there was a central rotunda {{convert|94|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|94|ft|m}} high. There was a secondary entrance to the rear on [[Charing Cross Road]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra.htm ''Alhambra Theatre'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jules Léotard2.jpg|thumb|upright|left| [[Jules Léotard]], ''[[The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'', performed his aerial act at the Alhambra.]]
The Leicester Square theatre's name was changed frequently, but usually reflected the building's (very loose) stylistic associations with the celebrated [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]]. By 1864, the circus had become the Alhambra [[Music Hall]]. Rebuildings occurred in 1866 and 1881, by Perry and Reed. From 1871, when it obtained a licence, an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] [[ballet]] was performed. The Alhambra was destroyed by fire in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/12/07/102935454.pdf ''A London theatre burned: The Alhambra, the home of pageants, totally destroyed'' 7 December 1882 (''NY Times'')] accessed 23 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and was rebuilt in a more restrained style by Reed, reopening in 1884 as the Alhambra Theatre. Further rebuildings were in 1888 by Edward Clark, 1892 by Clark and Pollard, 1897 by [[W. M. Brutton]], and in 1912 by the prolific theatre architect, [[Frank Matcham]]. Other names used during the life of the theatre were the Royal Alhambra Palace; Alhambra Theatre of Varieties; Theatre Royal, Alhambra; Great United States Circus and New Alhambra Theatre.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

===Entertainments===
London's Alhambra was predominantly used for the popular entertainment of the day, [[music hall]]. The usual music hall acts were performed, as well as the début of [[Jules Léotard]] performing his aerial act, above the heads of diners in May 1861. Other entertainments included "patriotic demonstrations" celebrating the [[British Empire]] and British military successes. The theatre also staged [[ballet]] and light [[opera]].  In the 1860s, [[John Hollingshead]] took over management at the Alhambra and made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring [[corps de ballet]] and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. "The spark that lit the bonfire", in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  At its bars, the attractions of the Alhambra's ballet were not merely artistic:
{{quote|You must please imagine yourself a man about town, with money in your pocket and a fancy for a night of pleasure. It is early in the year 1870. You find a congenial companion with similar inclination, and after a leisurely dinner at the club you find yourself looking at the Alhambra. You are purposely too late for the strident 'variety' with which the programme opens, but in easy time for the Ballet which concludes the first half and is followed by a long&amp;nbsp;– a very long&amp;nbsp;– interval. The interval is one of the main features of the show, for the huge basement canteen is open to any of the audience who think a visit worth while&amp;nbsp;... You wander down after the ballet, pick up a couple of dancers and buy them champagne. They are cheerful young women still wearing their scanty ballet costumes and with plenty to say for themselves. Nearly an hour passes in telling stories and gossiping about the crowd of swells and chorines who skirmish and lounge and laugh in the long, bare but well lighted room. It is now nearly time for the notorious [[Can-Can]], and you prepare to return to your seats. The ladies wish to say thank you for their wine, and each, with an arm round your neck or his, puts unmistakable provocation into her kiss. She probably ventures other familiarities, and certainly asks softly if you will be near the stage-door when the show is over.&lt;dd&gt;—[[Michael Sadleir]], ''[[Fanny by Gaslight (novel)|Fanny by Gaslight]]'' (1940)&lt;/dd&gt;}}
The ''[[Can-Can]]'' as presented at the Alhambra by the 'Parisian Colonna' troupe proved so sexually provocative that in October 1870 the Alhambra was deprived of its dancing licence.

Another example of the fare on offer was this 1882 production, written by [[Dion Boucicault]]{{efn|It may be that his diminutive son ([[Dion Boucicault Jr.]]) played opposite this statuesque woman.}} and [[James Planche|J. R. Planche]]:

Early films were also a part of the entertainment, with [[Robert W. Paul]], a former collaborator of [[Birt Acres]], presenting his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. This included films featuring cartoonist [[William Mecham|Tom Merry]] drawing caricatures of the German Emperor [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (1895),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/23159 ''Tom Merry Lightning Cartoonist, sketching Kaiser Wilhelm II'', Birt Acres (1895) (BFI)] accessed 3 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prince Bismarck]] (1895).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/565486 ''Tom Merry Lightning Cartoonist, sketching Bismarck'', Birt Acres (1895) (BFI)] accessed 3 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Merry had previously performed his lightning fast drawing as part of a music hall stage act.

During World War I, a series of hit [[revues]] played at the Alhambra that included ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]'' (1916), which featured the first performances of the song ''[[If You Were The Only Girl In The World]]'', performed by [[Violet Lorraine]] and [[George Robey]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070129065521/http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/Violet%20Lorraine%20and%20George%20Robey%20-%20If%20You%20Were%20The%20Only.mp3]. This was followed by ''The Bing Boys on Broadway'' (1917) and ''The Bing Boys are There'' (1918).  The music for the revues was written by [[Nat D. Ayer]] with lyrics by Clifford Grey, and the text was by [[George Grossmith, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstworldwar.com/audio/ifyouweretheonlygirl.htm ''If You Were The Only Girl In The World'' (First World War)] accessed 24 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other theatres, the Alhambra went into decline after World War I owing to the increasing popularity of cinema and radio. It was demolished in 1936 to make way for the [[Odeon Leicester Square]], which remains on the site. The entrance on [[Charing Cross Road]] has also been demolished and is now a modern office block.

== History ==
Anshen and Allen was founded by Bob Anshen and Steve Allen in San Francisco in 1940. Their relationship began while they were studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] School of Architecture. Upon graduation, they both received a traveling fellowship that eventually led them to San Francisco in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Cleper-Borkovi, Felicia et al. (2007). ''Modernity in Healing and Learning: The Architecture of Anshen + Allen.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Keck Science Center Pepperdine.jpg|thumb|120px|Keck Science Center at [[Pepperdine University]], designed by Anshen and Allen]]
Their first project was the Davies House, a {{convert|6000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Tudor Gothic inspired mansion in [[Woodside, California]], commissioned by Ralph K. Davies, a senior vice-president of [[Standard Oil of California]]. The house was completed on November 30, 1941.  After the end of [[World War II]], as a generalist practice, the firm developed gas station prototypes for Standard Oil, [[parking garages]] and interior [[naval architecture]].

[[Joseph Eichler]] and [[John Calder Mackay]], both residential [[real estate developer|real estate developers]], commissioned Anshen and Allen to build the initial Eichler homes and Mackay Homes in the California [[Modernist]] style beginning in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Arbunich, Marty. (2002). ''Eichler: Modernism Rebuilds the American Dream.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ditto, Jerry et al. (1995). ''Eichler Homes: Design for Living.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eichlernetwork.com/blog/dave-weinstein/mid-century-mackay-homes-deserve-respect|title=Mid-Century Mackay Homes Deserve Respect|last=|first=|date=|work=The Eichler Network|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm continued to build [[tract housing]] until 1962. 

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, under the leadership of Derek Parker, the firm was transformed into a modern international architectural practice. 

During the mid-2000s, Anshen and Allen adopted the use of [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM).&lt;ref&gt;Barista, Dave.  ''Building Design &amp; Construction.''  July 28, 2009.  [http://www.bdcnetwork.com/article/382072-BIM_adoption_rate_exceeds_80_among_nation_s_largest_AEC_firms.php  "BIM Adoption Rate Exceeds 80% Among Nation's Largest AEC Firms"].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Anshen and Allen participated in the development of [[Integrated Project Delivery]] by serving on the IPD Definition Task Group of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) California Council.&lt;ref&gt;Integrated Project Delivery Definition Task Group, May 15, 2007. [http://www.ipd-ca.net/images/Integrated%20Project%20Delivery%20Definition.pdf  Integrated Project Delivery: A Working Definition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816025354/http://www.ipd-ca.net/images/Integrated%20Project%20Delivery%20Definition.pdf |date=August 16, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anshen and Allen used [[shipping containers]] in their design for [[clinics]] for Containers 2 Clinics (C2C), a [[nonprofit]] organization that provides access to healthcare for women and children in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Nicholas Tamarin| title=Anshen + Allen Turns Containers Into Clinics | url= | work=Interior Design | date=25 March 2010 | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the firm was identified as specializing in [[sustainable]] designs for the [[healthcare]] and [[academic]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering News-Record''. July 6, 2009.[http://enr.construction.com/toplists/GreenDesignFirms/001-100.asp  "The Top 100 Green Design Firms"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Building Design &amp; Construction.'' July 7, 2009.

'''Caochangdi''' ({{zh|s=草场地|t=草場地|p=Cǎochǎngdì}}) was an urban village and renowned arts district located in the [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] of northeast [[Beijing]] at the intersection of the [[5th Ring Road]] and Airport Expressway. Translated as "grasslands" in Mandarin, Caochangdi was home to a diverse group of residents, including migrant workers, farmers, students and artists, most notably, [[Ai Weiwei]]. Caochangdi developed into a thriving arts and cultural hub when artists began to move into the area around 2000, attracting international attention similar to the nearby [[798 Art Zone]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;Chen, Aric. [http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/travel/01surfacing.html "A New Frontier for Chinese Art"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 2007. Retrieved 25 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/arts/05iht-CHINART.1376385.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "An artists' community takes shape on Beijing's edge - Arts &amp; Leisure - International Herald Tribune"]&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition of the village began in July 2018.

{{TOC right}}

==History==
Caochangdi has changed dramatically over its history. Once unoccupied grazing land used as hunting grounds by the Imperial Court, it later became an imperial grave and garden site. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the region became an Agricultural People's Commune and transitioned into a farming village. When the Chinese economy opened up to the global market under [[Deng Xiaoping]], farmers became landlords and began leasing the land to private companies, artists and galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/33465/the-village-that-art-built/|title= The Village that Art Built|date= February 11, 2010|publisher=ArtInfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the architects Mary-Ann Ray and Robert Mangurian published a book on the village, titled ''Caochangdi, Beijing Inside Out: Farmers, Floaters, Taxi Drivers, Artists, and the International Art Mob Challenge and Remake the City''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timezone8.com/osc/product_info.php?products_id=124 ''Caochangdi, Beijing Inside Out: Farmers, Floaters, Taxi Drivers, Artists, and the International Art Mob Challenge and Remake the City''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813171449/http://timezone8.com/osc/product_info.php?products_id=124 |date=August 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It  is a study of the village's history and architecture, and includes interviews with Caochangdi residents.

For many years Caochangdi was under threat of demolition. In May 2011, after petitions by its residents and businesses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.threeshadows.cn/qianming/index.htm "Protect Caochangdi Art District Petition to Collect 10,000 Signatures from Art Supporters"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220041335/http://www.threeshadows.cn/qianming/index.htm |date=December 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese authorities officially announced the village would be spared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130122114745/http://places.designobserver.com/feature/caochangdi-and-the-demolition-of-beijing-art-villages/33678/ "Art Village: A Year in Caochangdi"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2018 evictions were announced in preparation for demolition &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.artnet.com/art-world/galleries-china-caochangdi-evicted-1322069 "China Abruptly Evicts Galleries in a Beijing Arts District to Make Way for ‘Immediate Demolition’"]&lt;/ref&gt; And Ai Weiwei's studio was demolished shortly thereafter. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/08/04/635654200/ai-wei-weis-beijing-studio-destroyed-by-chinese-authorities/ "Ai Weiwei Responds To Chinese Authorities Destroying His Beijing Studio"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
"Caochangdi (CCD) – The Community" was launched on September 28, 2012, as a research-driven program that hosts a series of art, design and technology events throughout Caochangdi. Consisting of gallery exhibitions, public art installations, live events, educational programs, workshops and seminars, CCD – The Community seeks to cultivate the diversity of Caochangdi through long-term curatorial projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCD - THE COMMUNITY @ BJDW 2012|url=http://www.design-china.org/post/31265972437/ccd-the-community-bjdw-2012|publisher=Design China|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://caochangdi.org/about CCD, The Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">A '''closet drama''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is "a quite legitimate product of literary art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25106077|title = The Legitimacy of the Closet-Drama|journal = The North American Review|volume = 187|issue = 627|pages = 213–223|last1 = Matthews|first1 = Brander|year = 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is a [[play (theatre)|play]] created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, [[playwright]]s might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid [[censorship]] of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-5|[4]]] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including ''dramatis personae'' and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[[Closet drama#cite note-6|[5]]] This created an "unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-:1-2|[1]]]

Marta Straznicky describes the form as "part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privacy, playreading, and women's closet drama, 1500-1700|last=Straznicky|first=Marta|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: "a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere" through this medium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women in closet drama ==
In the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to "engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.

[[Margaret Lucas Cavendish]], author of fourteen folio volumes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. [[Closet drama#cite note-:0-1|[1]]] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.

Other notable women involved in closet drama include [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Jane Lumley, Baroness Lumley|Jane Lumley]], and [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]].

==History==
The philosophical [[dialogue]]s of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as [[Plato]] (see [[Socratic dialogue]]) were written in the form of conversations between "characters" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1998|title=Recent Studies in Closet Dramas|jstor=43447570|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=28|issue=1|pages=142–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], many have argued that the [[tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1994|title=Profane Stoical Paradoxes': 'The Tragedie of Mariam' and Sidnean Closet Drama|jstor=43447747|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume= 24|issue=1|pages=104–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor [[Nero]], a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the [[Middle Ages]] was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of [[Hrosvit|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] and [[Medieval debate poetry|debate poems]] in quasi-dramatic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Elizabethan and Jacobean ===
[[Fulke Greville]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]], and [[Mary Sidney]] wrote closet dramas in the age of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Randall, Dale J. B. ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&amp;#x2013;1660.'' Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a "substitute" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on "propagandist aims" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. [[Thomas Killigrew]] is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kennedy, Dennis. ''Theatre &amp; Performance''. Oxford University Press, 2003 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form "served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[John Milton]]'s play ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', written in 1671, is an example of [[early modern]] drama never intended for the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Faust, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of [[German literature]], were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse [[tragedy]] on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward [[melodrama]] and [[comedy]] and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Robert Browning]], and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

[[Image:Colab logo.jpg|right|thumb|250px]]
'''Colab''' is the commonly used abbreviation of the [[New York City]] artists' group '''Collaborative Projects''', which was formed after a series of open meetings between artists of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;David Little, ''Colab Takes a Piece, History Takes It Back: Collectivity and New York Alternative Spaces'', ''Art Journal'' Vol.66, No. 1, Spring 2007, College Art Association, New York, pp. 60-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Colab came together as a collective in 1977,  first using the name Green Corporation, and initially received an NEA Workshop Grant through Center for New Art Activities, Inc., a small not-for-profit formed in 1974.

In 1978, Collaborative Projects was incorporated as a not-for-profit and later received its tax-exempt status from the IRS, so that it could apply for grants from the NEA and other sources independently.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julie Ault]]. ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'' [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2002: p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Colab was active for about 10 years and became distinguished by the raw energy of its members and sometimes politically engaged open membership. By raising its own sources of funding, Colab was in control of its own exhibitions and cable TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' [[Printed Matter, Inc]], 2016: pp.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocating a form of cultural activism that was purely artist driven, the group created artworks, negotiated venues, curated shows, crafted their own PR, and engaged in discourse that responded to the political themes and predicaments of their time, among them the recessions of the 1970s, the Reagan era of budget cuts and nuclear armament, the housing crisis and gentrification in New York City, and other pressing social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: pp.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
From November 1978, different artist members organized and installed original one-off group shows in their own studios or other temporary sites, such as  "The Batman Show," (591 Broadway 1979), "Income and Wealth Show" (5 Bleecker Store 1979), "Doctors &amp; Dentists Show" (591 Broadway 1979), ''The Manifesto Show'' (5 Bleecker Store 1979), "The Dog Show" (591 Broadway 1979), "Just Another Asshole Show" (5 Bleecker Store), ''[[The Real Estate Show]]'' ([[Delancey Street]], Jan. 1980), Jay St film shows 1979, ''Exhibit A'' (93 Grand Street, 1979) and, notably, ''The Times Square Show'' (201 W 41st, June 1980), a large open exhibition near the center of New York's entertainment (and pornography) district ([[Times Square]]) put on with Bronx-based [[Fashion Moda]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' [[Printed Matter, Inc]], 2016: pp.120-135&lt;/ref&gt;
Seed money from the first Colab (Green Corp.) workshop grant through Center for New Art Inc. led to the creation of Colab artists' TV series on Manhattan Cable (1978–1984) "All Color News,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/XFR_2013_10_15_1A_23 Colab 78-80 (1978-80)]: Anybody's Show; End of the World; July 4, 1980; Real Estate Show; Shipwreck; Dance of the Leper; All Color News (Colab)&lt;/ref&gt; "Potato Wolf" and "Red Curtain", [[New Cinema]], a screening room on St. Mark's Place for narrative Super 8 films transferred to video and projected on an Advent screen; the continued publication of X Motion Picture Magazine(1979), whose first issue preceded the formation of Colab;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Masters, (2007) ''[[No Wave]]'', Black Dog Publishing, London, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; support and inspiration for the [[ABC No Rio|ABC No Rio cultural center]] (1980-82 (ongoing) created from the Real Estate Show;  support of the [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] (1984), NightShift Theater 1979, Spanner Magazine (3 issues 1979), MWF Video Club (established in 1986) and [[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb Magazine]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], ''The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984'', [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the original group are presently highly active making art, and the membership has shifted and evolved. ABC No Rio was recently awarded a $1.6 million capital construction grant from the City of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/nyregion/04abc.html|title=For $1, a Collective Mixing Art and Radical Politics Turns Itself Into Its Own Landlord|date=July 4, 2006|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We [Collaborative Projects] are functioning as a group of artists with complementary resources and skills providing a solid ground for [[collaborative]] work directed to the needs of the community-at-large. Specifically we are involved in programs facilitating development, production, and distribution of collaborative works. These works are realized in various [[Media (arts)|media]] including [[film]] and [[video]] for distribution and cable-cast, and live cable TV broadcasts, as well as other more conventional art media such as graphics and printed materials."&lt;ref&gt;''The Red Book'', 1978 (NEA application document authored by Coleen Fitzgibbon, Andrea Callard and Ulli Rimkus) Andrea Callard Papers, ''The Downtown Collection'', Fales Library, [[NYU]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"This statement (the one above) defines three fundamental aspects of Colab - members' desire to create and distribute "collaborative work" under the umbrella of an artist-run organization, their focus on new media versus traditional art objects and their openness to a range of aesthetic styles that would meet the "needs of the community-at-large." This last point was critical to the group's identity and served as the foundation of a workshop-oriented administration that encouraged experimentation in many different areas, including but not limited to TV production, video editing, film, and [[performance art]]. With various workshops operating simultaneously and the participants' ability to draw on like-minded members as partners, Colab could produce many projects without the burden of an institutional identity. Typically, individual members worked together on more than one project in small subgroups that changed and over lapped from one project to the next."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomotterness.net/pdf/news_artjournal_colabdavidlittle_2007.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011001/http://www.tomotterness.net/pdf/news_artjournal_colabdavidlittle_2007.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} David Little, Artjounal pdf file&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, artists emulating 1970s Puerto Rican activists seized a building on New York's [[Lower East Side]] and opened it as a collectively run cultural center. [[ABC No Rio]] was passed on to successive managements until today it is an [[anarchist]] cultural center run by a collective with close ties to the publishing group [[Autonomedia]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Moore, ''Artists' Collectives: Focus on New York, 1975-2000'' in ''Collectivism After Modernism: The Art of Social Imagination after 1945'', Blake Stimson &amp; Gregory Sholette, (eds) University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2007, pp. 193-221&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the bohemia of downtown [[Manhattan]], the band - and crew - based practices of [[art rock]] and [[super-8 film]] making thrived. The first artists' group to achieve prominence in New York was Colab (Collaborative Projects), which produced a show in [[Times Square]] in 1980. This exhibition was a groundswell of popularly accessible socially themed artworks held in an empty building that has housed an erotic [[massage parlor]]. Critics called it "[[punk art]]" -- "three cord art anyone can play." The South Bronx art space [[Fashion Moda]].  participated in the '''Times Square Show''', bringing in some of the new generation of [[graffiti art]]ists who had been exhibiting in the [[Bronx]] as part of the [[hip-hop]] culture of writers, [[rapper]]s, and [[break dance]]rs.  A forty-member democratically run membership group; Colab inspired other artists to form groups and mount huge shows in [[Brooklyn]] lofts, not to mention collaboration with the [[Washington Project for the Arts]], for the [[Ritz Hotel Project, Washington, D.C.|Ritz Hotel Project]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1983.

==A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)==
In 2016 "A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)" was published by [[Printed Matter, Inc]]. It was edited by Max Schumann, the director of Printed Matter, and contained a Foreword and Afterword by art writer and Colab member [[Walter Robinson (art critic and artist)|Walter Robinson]]. The book traces the output of Collaborative Projects from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s and serves as an exhaustive homage to the group’s work and a testimonial about their particular practice of collaboration, collectivity, and social engagement, while reflecting an iconic period of NYC cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
In keeping with the democratic "by and for artists" ethos of Colab, the publication places this material alongside newly solicited texts from many of the group’s members – a mix of reflections and anecdotes, statements, manifestos, and excerpts from the ‘Colab Annual Report’, which provide a close perspective on the meaning of Colab for those who came into its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.printedmatter.org/events/437 ''A More Store &amp; A Book About Colab (and Related Activities'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 2008, a small partial retrospective exhibition called ''Colab Redux'' was held at Brooke Alexander Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baeditions.com/installation-views/colab-redux/colab-redux-installation.htm Colab Redux installation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baeditions.com/installation-views/colab-redux/colab-redux-press-release.htm Colab Redux PR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Printed Matter, Inc. presented an exhibition entitled ''A Show about Colab (and Related Activities)''. This overarching survey presented a wide range of materials and artworks from various Colab activities from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s, including screenings of film and video works, and cable broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://printedmatter.org/news/news.cfm?article_id=857 |title=''A Show about Colab (and Related Activities)'' |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524220857/http://www.printedmatter.org/news/news.cfm?article_id=857 |archive-date=2012-05-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, The [[Hunter College]] Art Galleries presented ''Times Square Show Revisited'', an in-depth look at the original ''Times Square Show'' (1980). ''Times Square Show Revisited'' was the first focused assessment of the landmark exhibition organized by the artist group Collaborative Projects, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timessquareshowrevisited.com/press.html Times Square Show Revisited]&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby G's audio piece ''Times Sq. Show Audio'' (0:38) appears on ''[[Just Another Asshole]]'', a compilation anthology LP that was released in 1981 and reissued in 1995 on Atavistic Records.

In 2013, an exhibition workshop entitled ''XFR STN (Transfer Station)'' was held at the [[New Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/arts/design/xfr-stn-offers-a-digital-update-at-the-new-museum.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=Preserving That Great Performance - XFR STN Offers a Digital Update at the New Museum |work=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening night featured ''Moving Image Artists' Distribution Then &amp; Now'' an assembly of participants in the ''MWF video club'', introduced by [[Andrea Callard]], Michael Carter, [[Alan W. Moore]], [[Nick Zedd]] and [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]]. Alan W. Moore created ''MWF Club'' in 1986 as a distribution company for ''Potato Wolf and All Color News'' Colab's television programs that aired on public access TV. ''MWF Club'' expanded to include programs from various other groups such as Communications Update, Downtown TV, [[Glenn O'Brien]]'s TV Party, [[New Cinema]], [[Cinema of Transgression]], Naked Eye Cinema and numerous artists and filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/xfr-stn XFR STN at the New Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013 Tom Warren's ''Photo Portfolio of Colab Artists Portraits (1981-1984)'' were featured at Gallery 98&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.98bowery.com/tom-warren-portfolio-of-portraits-of-colab-artists-10-photographs-1981-1984/] Tom Warren, ''Photo Portfolio COLAB Artists Portraits, 1981-1984''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]] presented a mini [[video]] [[retrospective]] entitled ''Colab TV Video Excerpts'' on November 15 at [[Soho House (club)|Soho House]] in New York City with discussion with [[Tom Otterness]].

In early 2014, there were four concurrent art exhibitions in New York City around ''[[The Real Estate Show]]'': at James Fuentes Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/04/a-legendary-exhibition-the-real-estate-show-has-been-revived-on-the-les/] Article on James Fuentes Gallery show ''Real Estate Show, Then...And Now''&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC No Rio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/lower-east-side-the-real-estate-show-redux] ''Lower East Side: The Real Estate Show Redux'' by Natasha Kurchanova at Studio International&lt;/ref&gt; the Lodge Gallery, and Cuchifritos Gallery/Essex Street Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2014/03/the-real-estate-show-revisted-at-the-james-fuentes-gallery.html] ''The Real Estate Show Revisited''&lt;/ref&gt; That year also [[Art International Radio]] featured an interview and conversation between [[Jane Dickson]], [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]], and Becky Howland about Colab and the 1980 [[The Real Estate Show]] which birthed the [[ABC No Rio]] cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clocktower.org/show/colab-abc-no-rio-a-history] [[Art International Radio]] Colab interview&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 15 to May 15, 2016, [[Printed Matter, Inc]] presented a restating of ''The A. More Store'', a Colab-sponsored artists’ outlet for low-priced multiples from the early 1980s The selling exhibition included over 100 artworks from over 50 participating Colab members, including works on loan from historic ''A. More Stores''. The first ''A. More Store'' evolved from the Gift Shop at the legendary Colab-organized ''Times Square Show'' and appeared shortly after on Broome Street in 1980 with the tag-line “You won’t pay more at the A. More Store”. Other iterations of the store were later presented at [[Barbara Gladstone]] Gallery, Jack Tilton Gallery, [[White Columns]], and Printed Matter, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.printedmatter.org/events/437] Printed Matter, Inc Exhibition for ''A More Store'' &amp; ''A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clocktower Productions]] web exhibited ''The Colab Vinyl Mix'',  an 80-minute audio mix (aired 5/9/16) of [[no wave]], hip hop, anti-pop, punk, funk, and [[noise music]]. These sounds provided the soundtrack to Colab art productions in the 1980s. The playlist was assembled by Sandra Seymour, Mark C of [[Live Skull]], and Robert Goldman (Bobby G). The audio files were captured from the original vinyl record by the producers and illustrate the world of such legendary projects as ''The Times Square Show'', ''The Real Estate Show'', [[ABC No Rio]], Fashion Moda. The mix includes the [[post-punk]] sounds of [[Y Pants]], [[DNA (American band)|DNA]], [[Teenage Jesus and the Jerks]], [[Alan Vega]], [[The Lounge Lizards]], [[Bush Tetras]], [[Glenn Branca]] as The Static, [[ESG (band)|ESG]], [[Robin Crutchfield]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clocktower.org/show/the-colab-vinyl-mix ''The Colab Vinyl Mix'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 20 and May 15, 2016 an art historic street posters show from 1984 called ''Talk is Cheap'' at Printed Matter, Inc. Sponsored by Colab and organized by John Hogan in 1984, the show featured 47 two-color  broadsides posted in the streets around downtown New York. The posters addressed political and economic issues of the time. The original ephemeral exhibition lasted a few days, as the posters were covered by signage and eventually posted over. Colab collaborators include [[Charlie Ahearn]], [[Jane Dickson]], [[Kiki Smith]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Jolie Stahl]], [[Mitch Corber]], [[Andrea Callard]], Christy Rupp, [[Alan W. Moore]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.printedmatter.org/tables/1283] Event Exhibition for ''A More Store'' &amp; ''A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)'' at Printed Matter, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Becky Howland &amp; Matthias Mayer curated ''The Real Estate Show'' at Spor Klubu in Berlin, drawing from documentation of the original ''Real Estate Show'' (1980) from the Archive Collection of the extant project space [[ABC No Rio]]. Included in the show were Robert Cooney, Mitch Corber, Peter Fend, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Bobby G (Robert Goldman), Ilona Granet, Becky Howland, Christof Kohlhofer, Gregory Lehmann, Ann Messner, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, Joseph Nechvatal, Cara Perlman, Scott Pfaffman, Christy Rupp and Robin Winters. In conjunction with this show, another exhibition called ''The Real Estate Show Extended/Berlin: Group exhibition on the subject of [[Gentrification]], Real Estate Speculation and Selling out the City'' was presented at Kunstpunkt Berlin. This show included many Berlin artists along with four original members of the ''Real Estate Show'' (1980): Becky Howland, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, and Joseph Nechvatal. Howland, Mönnig, Moore and Nechvatal also participated in a panel discussion on Real Estate and Art on June 3, 2017 that was moderated by Howard McCalebb of Dada Post, Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstpunkt.com/pages/ausstell_fr.htm] ''The Real Estate Show'' at Kunstpunkt Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Proprietatibus Elementorum''''' (English: On the Properties of the Elements) is a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] treatise on [[geology]]. It is also known as '''''De Causis Proprietatum Elementorum''''', '''''De Proprietatibus Elementorum et Planetarum''''' or simply '''''De Elementis'''''.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}} It was probably written in the ninth{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}} or tenth century.{{sfn|Crombie|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA133 133]}} The author of the work claimed to be [[Aristotle]], but eventually it was determined that it was an original work by an [[Arabs|Arab]] author. Consequently, the work is now attributed to a [[Pseudo-Aristotle]].{{sfn|Peters|1961|p=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57–58]}}

== History ==
The work did not have a lasting impact on [[science in the medieval Islamic world]], but it became important in Europe after it was translated to [[Latin]] by [[Gerard of Cremona]] in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Peters|1961|p=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57–58]}} By the thirteenth century, it had become one of the three main sources for medieval knowledge on geology, together with Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology]]'' and [[Avicenna]]'s ''De Mineralibus''. These three treatises were an important influence on the study of geology by [[Albertus Magnus]].{{sfn|Crombie|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA133 133–135]}} When scholars started to recognize during [[the Renaissance]] that ''De Proprietatibus Elementorum'' was not written by Aristotle, it was removed from the academic curriculum.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}}

== Content ==
In his work ''Meteorology'', Aristotle explained that the earth as an element was cold and dry. He did not cover phenomena related to terrestrial heat. ''De Proprietatibus Elementorum'' filled this lacuna with its inquiry on [[volcano]]es and [[hot spring]]s. According to the work large quantities of [[sulfur]] in the interior of a mountain caused volcanic eruptions. Winds and waters present at the foot of the mountain could set fire to this sulfur, particularly in the case of [[Mount Etna]].{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324–325}}

Its explanation of hot springs seems to have been taken by an unknown work from [[Theophrastus]]. Theophrastus or the pseudo-Aristotle first dismisses several explanations provided by [[Democritus]], Mileus and Rentifolus, the latter two possibly [[Thales]] and [[Xenophanes]]. The opinion of the author follows, that water gets heated by beds of sulfur before it emerges on the surface. [[Naphtha]] is associated with this process, because together with sulfur it forms a kind of burner to transport fuel to the fire.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=328}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4030">'''Doreen Mary Carwithen''' (15 November 1922{{spaced ndash}}5 January 2003) was a British [[composer]] of classical and [[film music]]. She was also known as '''Mary Alwyn'''.

==Biography==
Doreen Carwithen was born in [[Haddenham, Buckinghamshire]] on 15 November 1922. As a child she had her first music lessons from her mother, a music teacher, starting both [[piano]] and [[violin]] with her at the age of four. At age 16 she began composing by setting [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]'s "[[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud|I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (Daffodils)]]" for voice and piano.

In 1941 she entered the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and played the [[cello]] in a string quartet and with orchestras. She was a member of the harmony class of [[William Alwyn]], who began to teach her [[musical composition|composition]]. Her overture ''ODTAA (One Damn Thing After Another)'' was premiered at [[Covent Garden]] by [[Adrian Boult]] in 1947. The same year she was selected by the Royal Academy to train as composer of [[film music]].

In 1961 she became William Alwyn's devoted secretary and [[amanuensis]], becoming his second wife in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Piers|last=Burton-Page|title=Alwyn, William (1905–1985)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55919|accessdate=2015-01-05|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/88725}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopting Mary Alwyn as her married name, as she disliked the name Doreen, and Mary was her middle name. She later worked as a Sub Professor of Composition at the RAM. After her husband's death in 1985, she founded the William Alwyn Archive and William Alwyn Foundation to promote his music and facilitate related research projects.

She then also resumed interest in her own music. In 1999 a [[stroke]] left her paralysed on one side. She died at [[Forncett|Forncett St Peter]], near [[Norwich]], on 5 January 2003.

==Works==

{{Bronze Age}}
The '''Dunaverney Flesh-Hook''' is a sophisticated [[prehistoric]] [[bronze]] artefact from [[Prehistoric Ireland]], thought to be an item of ceremonial feasting gear, and a symbol of authority. It is believed it was used to remove chunks of meat from a stew in a large cauldron for serving. It dates to the [[Late Bronze Age]], between 1050 and 900 BC.  Since 1856, it has been in the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=831082&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=+Dunaverney+&amp;page=1 British Museum Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
Along the top of the [[flesh-hook]] are five birds, two large ones next to three smaller ones. At the bottom of the shaft, facing the family of five, are two birds. The group of two birds, presumably an adult pair, can be identified as [[corvid]]s, perhaps [[raven]]s, the family of five as [[swan]]s and [[Cygnet (bird)|cygnet]]s. The two sets of birds seem to invoke opposites: birds of water versus birds of the air; white ranged against black, [[fecundity]] as opposed to death (implied by the predatory character of ravens). Perhaps, in the mind of the Bronze Age inhabitants, the two sets of birds denoted a [[fable]] of opposites between good and bad. The flesh-hook was originally linked by pieces of [[oak]] shaft, only one fragment of which remains extant.

==Discovery==
The Dunaverney Flesh-Hook was discovered in 1829 by workmen who were cutting [[Peat|turf]] at Dunaverney Bog to the north of [[Ballymoney]], Co. Antrim, [[Northern Ireland]]. At the time of its discovery, the Dunaverney Flesh-Hook was unparalleled and for a long time many experts could not agree on its age and function. However, as more examples were found, not only in [[Ireland]] and Britain, but along the [[Atlantic]] seaboard of the European continent,  it became clear from their style, technology and context that they belonged to the [[Bronze Age]] and were clearly important instruments used during ceremonial [[feasts]]. To this day, the representation of [[birds]] seen on the Dunaverney Flesh-Hook remains unique in north-west Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"'''El Paso'''" is a [[Country music|country and western]] [[ballad]] written and originally recorded by [[Marty Robbins]], and first released on ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'' in September 1959. It was released as a [[single (music)|single]] the following month, and became a major hit on both the [[country music|country]] and [[Pop music|pop]] [[Record chart|music charts]], reaching number one in both at the start of 1960. It won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country &amp; Western Recording]] in [[Grammy Awards of 1961|1961]], and remains Robbins' best-known song. It is widely considered a genre classic for its gripping narrative which ends in the death of its protagonist, its shift from past to present tense, haunting harmonies by vocalists Bobby Sykes and [[Jim Glaser]] (of the [[Tompall &amp; the Glaser Brothers|Glaser Brothers]]) and the eloquent and varied [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] accompaniment by [[Grady Martin]] that lends the recording a distinctive [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] feel. The name of the character Feleena&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/de/Marty-Robbins-The-Drifter/release/3462152 Marty Robbins ‎– The Drifter] on discogs.com&lt;/ref&gt; was based upon a schoolmate of Robbins in the fifth grade; Fidelina Martinez.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=17

==The song's storyline==

There have been three versions of Robbins' original recording of "El Paso": the original full-length version, the edited version, and the abbreviated version (briefly described below), which is an alternate take in stereo. The original version is in mono and is around 4 minutes and 38 seconds in duration, far longer than most contemporary singles at the time, especially in the [[country music|country]] genre. Robbins' longtime record company, Columbia Records, was unsure whether radio stations would play such a long song, so it released two versions of the song on a promo 45:&lt;ref name=pc10&gt;{{Pop Chronicles |10 |2 |Marty Robbins}}&lt;/ref&gt; the full-length version on one side, and an edited version on the other which was nearer to the three-minute mark. This version omitted some excerpts of lyrics of the original. Most of the record-buying public, as well as most disk jockeys, overwhelmingly preferred the full-length version. 

:''"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso, I fell in love with a Mexican girl..."''

The song is a [[first-person narrative]] about an ill-fated [[love triangle]], as sung by a [[cowboy]] in [[El Paso, Texas]], in the days of the [[American Old West|Wild West]]. The singer recalls how he frequented a nightclub called "Rosa's [[Cantina]]," where he became smitten with a young Mexican dancer named Feleena. When the singer notices another cowboy sharing a drink with "wicked Feleena," he challenges the newcomer to a gunfight out of jealousy over the young woman. The singer kills the newcomer, then flees El Paso for fear of being [[hanging|hanged]] for [[murder]] or [[vigilante|killed in revenge]] by his victim's entourage. (The abbreviated version of the song, often found on compilations, omits a verse in which the singer expresses shock and remorse over the "foul evil deed I had done" before realizing he has to flee.) In the act of fleeing, the singer commits the additional and potentially hanging offense of [[horse theft]] ("I caught a good one, it looked like it could run"), further sealing his fate in El Paso. Departing El Paso, the singer hides out in the "[[badlands]] of [[New Mexico]]."

The song then fast-forwards to an undisclosed time later, when the singer describes his yearning for Feleena that drives him to return to El Paso, without regard for his own life: "It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden / My love is stronger than my fear of death."&lt;ref name=pc10/&gt; Upon arriving, the singer is chased and fatally [[gunshot wound|wounded]] by a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]]. At the end of the song, the singer recounts how Feleena has "found me," and he dies in her arms after "one little kiss."

Coincidentally, "El Paso" was followed in the Hot 100 No. 1 position by [[Johnny Preston]]'s "[[Running Bear]]", another song in which the protagonist of the song dies although the story of Running Bear is not told in the first person.

==Other versions==
"El Paso" was frequently performed by the [[Grateful Dead]] in concert. The song entered the band's repertoire in 1969, and remained there until the band's demise in 1995; in total, it was performed 389 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setlists.net/ |title=The SetList Program - Grateful Dead Setlists, Listener Experiences, and Statistics |website=Setlists.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sung by rhythm guitarist [[Bob Weir]], with [[Jerry Garcia]] contributing harmony vocals. On the album ''Ladies and Gentlemen... The Grateful Dead'', Bob Weir introduces the song as the Dead's "most requested number".

The [[alternative country]] band [[Old 97's]] have also covered this song but instead of in the traditional 3/4 time, they hammered it out in 4/4. Their cover appears on [[Hit by a Train: The Best of Old 97's]] as well as the ''[[King of the Hill]]'' original TV soundtrack.

[[Grady Martin]] released an instrumental version in 1965 on his ''[[Instrumentally Yours]]'' album.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0001443273 |title=Instrumentally Yours - Grady Martin &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Paso has also been recorded by [[Max Stalling]], [[Michael Martin Murphey]], [[Tom Russell]], The [[Mills Brothers]], and [[Jason and the Scorchers]].

After [[Lolita (Austrian singer)|Lolita]] along with her Western Trio had a hit in the US with [[Sailor (Your Home is the Sea)|Seemann (Deine Heimat ist das Meer)]] she reciprocated by recording a German version of the song which became a hit in the German world and contributed to a long series of bi-national songs such as ''[[Theme from A Summer Place|Wenn der Sommer Kommt]]'' and two songs which would top the U.S. country charts thirteen years later as performed by [[Marie Osmond]]  ''[[Paper Roses|Lieber Jonny, Komm doch Wieder]]'' and ''[[My Little Corner of the World|Das einsame Haus in Waikiki]]''.

A parody version, "El Pizza" by [[H. B. Barnum]], was a radio hit in 1960. It moved the action to [[Azusa, California]], where Rosa's Cantina became a pizza place where Feleena worked as a waitress.

Homer and Jethro also parodied the song ("Velvita's Cafe had standing room only; wall-to-wall drunks all the way to the door.  I looked around for a place I could sit down; a lady got up, and I grabbed her char . . . ."[not "chair").  "I asked her where have you been all my life; she answered, 'Most of it I wasn't born'."

Blaine L. Reininger, a founding musician of San Francisco band Tuxedomoon, included this song on his 1989 solo album Book of Hours.

In the late 1980s a modified version of "El Paso" (Miners Fight) became known as the Official [[Fight song]] of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] Miners.

==Sequels==
Robbins wrote two songs that are explicit sequels to "El Paso", one in 1966, one in 1976.  (He also wrote other songs that told Western stories in a similar vein, but they are not sequels to "El Paso", as they involve none of the same characters.)

===Felina (From El Paso)===
In 1966, Robbins recorded "Felina (From El Paso)", telling the life story of Felina, the "Mexican girl" from "El Paso", in a [[Third-person limited omniscient|third-person narrative]].  This track was over eight minutes long.  Robbins wrote most of it in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], but went to El Paso seeking inspiration for the conclusion.

Born in a desert shack in [[New Mexico]] during a thunderstorm, Felina runs away from home at 17, living off her charms for a year in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], before moving to the brighter lights of El Paso to become a paid dancer.  After another year, the narrator of "El Paso" arrives, the first man she did not have contempt for.  He spends six weeks romancing her, before shooting another man with whom she was flirting through "insane jealousy" in a retelling of the key moment in the original song. Her lover's return to El Paso comes only a day after his flight (the original song suggests a longer timeframe before his return) and as she goes to run to him, the cowboy motions to her to stay out of the line of fire and is shot; immediately after his dying kiss, Feleena [[suicide|shoots herself]] with his gun.  Their [[ghost]]s are heard to this day in the wind blowing around El Paso: "It's only the young cowboy showing Feleena the town".

===El Paso City===
In 1976 Robbins released another reworking, "[[El Paso City (song)|El Paso City]]", in which the present-day singer is a passenger on a flight over El Paso, which reminds him of a song he had heard "long ago," proceeding to summarize the original "El Paso" story.  "I don't recall who sang the song," he sings, but he feels a [[supernatural]] connection to the story: "Could it be that I could be the cowboy in this mystery...," he asks, suggesting a [[Reincarnation|past life]].  This song was a country number one.  The arrangement includes riffs and themes from the previous two El Paso songs.  Robbins wrote it while flying over El Paso in, he reported, the same amount of time it takes to sing--four minutes and fourteen seconds. It was only the second time that ever happened to him; the first time was when he composed the original "El Paso" as fast as he could write it down. Robbins intended to do one more sequel, “The Mystery of Old El Paso,” but he died in late 1982 before he could finish the final song.

'''Filippo Baldinucci''' (1624 &amp;ndash; 1 January 1697) was an [[Italy|Italian]] art historian and biographer.

==Life==
Baldinucci is considered&lt;ref&gt;See Gombrich reference.&lt;/ref&gt; among the most significant [[Florence|Florentine]] biographers/historians of the artists and the arts of the [[Baroque]] period. Patronised by the [[Medici]], he aspired to become the new [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] by renewing and expanding his biographies of artists, to which Baldinucci added lives of French and Flemish artists omitted by Vasari. His most important work was this biographical dictionary of artists, ''Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua'',&lt;ref&gt;"Notices of professors of design from [[Cimabue]] to now"&lt;/ref&gt; of which the publication began in 1681 and continued after his death. 

His biography of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] was published in 1682.&lt;ref&gt;"His biography of Bernini (1682) is the most important source on this dominant master of the age of the Baroque." ([[Ernst Gombrich]] "Kunstliteratur").&lt;/ref&gt; 

Baldinucci came from a prominent and wealthy family of the Florentine merchant elite. As well as writing he drew portraits in chalk and modeled in clay; many of his deft and lively chalk portraits of friends are in the collection of the [[Uffizi]].&lt;ref&gt;Others, dispersed at auction, are in various collections including the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; For Cardinal [[Leopoldo de' Medici]], brother of [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and a scholar and patron of the arts, he began as bookkeeper in 1664 and developed, after the Cardinal's death, into virtually the [[curator]] of the Grand Ducal collections. In this way Baldinucci made a name as one of Italy's leading connoisseurs. His work recataloguing and adding to the Medici collections, first of drawings and then of paintings, was groundbreaking, using new ideas about organisation and completeness to make these the most modern collections of the time&amp;mdash;collections in large part the foundation of the [[Uffizi]]'s art holdings.  

This meticulous work was based on an ability to distinguish between the hands of different painters&amp;mdash;an idea then new and untested, and one that opened up the field of connoisseurship that enabled the attributions of Italian drawings, which are generally unsigned. In his ''Vocabolario'', the first dictionary of artistic terms, Baldinucci provided fourteen definitions of style using eighty different terms,&lt;ref&gt;According to the census compiled by Philip Sohm, in ''Style in the Art Theory of Early Modern Italy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied some of his terms to "bad" art.  

From this grew his ''Notizie'', in which he consciously intended to build upon the ''[[Vite]]'' of [[Giorgio Vasari]]; Baldinucci's was the first [[art history]] to trace the lives and work of artists not only of one region (Vasari was prejudiced towards Tuscan artists) but all Italy, and indeed beyond. He studied closely the stylistic debts of the great masters to one another, and in this, and his meticulous use of documentation and archives, he was centuries ahead in the discipline of art history.

In his ''Vocabolario'' (1681) he presented terms of art and technical terms, not only for the [[fine arts]] but for goldsmith's work, ''[[pietre dure]]'', color pigments and tools.

In other ways Baldinucci was very much a man of his time, of the [[Counter-Reformation]] and of the Baroque. Educated at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school, he was intensely pious&amp;mdash;before marrying, he completed the whole of [[Ignatius of Loyola]]'s ''Spiritual Exercises'' to discover whether he should in fact devote himself to a single life. Three of his sons went into the church, and one, [[Anthony Baldinucci|Antonio]], was a Jesuit missionary later beatified.

He had great appreciation of the [[Baroque]], and wrote in a periodic style which reflected it, each phrase opening from the preceding, full of [[periphrasis]] and other flourishes of [[rhetoric]], though flowing. His understanding of art stemmed largely from his religion, for he believed that it came as divine inspiration into special lives, the lives of the artists he so painstakingly recorded.

Baldinucci's son wrote the first biography of his father; Baldinucci's notes are conserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence (MSS Fondo Nazionale II.II.110)

'''Florence Turner''' (January 6, 1885 &amp;ndash; August 28, 1946) was an American actress who became known as the "Vitagraph Girl" in early [[silent film]]s.

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], Turner was pushed into appearing on the [[theater|stage]] at age three by her ambitious mother. Turner became a regular performer in a variety of productions.

In 1906 she joined the fledgling [[film|motion picture]] business, signing with the pioneering [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]] [[movie studio|Studios]] and making her film debut in ''How to Cure a Cold'' (June 8, 1907).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330418/|title=How to Cure a Cold|date=June 8, 1907|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time there were no [[movie star|stars]] per se, unless an already famous stage star made a movie. Performers were not even mentioned by name. Long, drawn out screen credits were not thought of. There was nothing but the name of the company and the picture. As the content of movies evolved from simple incidents, or situations, into definite stories, some of the heroes and heroines were conceded a vague identity, such as the "Edison Girl", etc.

[[File:Florence-Turner-1912.jpg|thumb|left|Florence Turner, the [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]] Girl, in 1912]]
Though she was known only as the "Vitagraph Girl" in the early motion picture shorts, Turner became the most popular American actress to appear on screen (at that time still dominated by French pictures, especially from the Pathe and Gaumont companies). Her worth to the studio, as its biggest box-office draw, was recognised in 1907 when her pay was upped to $22 a week, as proto-star plus part-time seamstress. It was somewhat less than the male leading players, especially those with stage experience, particularly the super-popular [[Maurice Costello]]. In March 1910 she and [[Florence Lawrence]] became the first screen actors not already famous in another medium to be publicized by name by their studios to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Bowser, ''The Transformation of Cinema, 1907–1915'', University of California Press, 1994, p. 112–113. {{ISBN|978-0-520-08534-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Florence was paired several times with heart throb [[Wallace Reid]], who was on his way to stardom. But with the rise of more stars such as [[Gene Gauntier]] and [[Marin Sais]] at [[Kalem Studios]], [[Marion Leonard]] and [[Mary Pickford]] at [[Biograph Studios]], and [[Florence Lawrence]] (Biograph, moving to [[Independent Moving Pictures|IMP]] in 1910), Florence Turner was no longer quite as special. By 1913 she was looking for new pastures and left the United States accompanied by longtime friend [[Laurence Trimble]], who directed her in a number of movies.&lt;ref&gt;Passenger list of S.S. ''Kaiser Wilhelm II'', Port of Plymouth, England, May 5, 1913. Ancestry.com. ''UK Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878-1960'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to England, where she and Larry began performing together in [[London]] [[music hall]]s.

Turner sometimes wrote [[screenplay]]s and directed her own movies, including a number of comedies. She also organized her own production company, [[Turner Films]], for which she made more than thirty shorts.

Turner entertained Allied troops during [[World War I]]. She returned to the U.S. after the [[Armistice]], but was not as successful as before. In 1920, she again went to England, where she remained until moving to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], virtually forgotten, in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k0UtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mJ8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1043%2C636190 Would You Be Famous? Consider for a Moment the Fortunes of These Stars of Yesterday!]", ''The Evening Herald'', Rock Hill, South Carolina, July 21, 1924, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By then she was thirty-nine years of age and her starring days were long behind her. She continued to act in supporting roles into the 1930s.

In 1928 she acted in a minor role on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''Sign of the Leopard'', which ran for 39 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Internet Broadway Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; Turner was placed on the payroll at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] by [[Louis B. Mayer]] in the 1930s, but was limited in the assignments offered. She mostly played bit or small parts and worked as an extra.

She later moved to the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House]], a retirement community for the industry in [[Woodland Hills, California]].

After appearing in more than 160 motion pictures, Florence Turner died at 61 in Woodland Hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=August 30, 1946 |title=Obituaries; Florence Turner |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1946/08/30/page/16/article/obituary-4-no-title |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location= |access-date=2015-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was cremated at a mortuary in Hollywood and, at her request, there was no funeral service. She was buried at [[Chapel of the Pines Crematory]].

'''''Freedom Writers''''' is a  2007 [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Richard LaGravenese]] and starring [[Hilary Swank]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Imelda Staunton]], [[Patrick Dempsey]] and [[Mario (American singer)|Mario]].

It is based on the book ''[[The Freedom Writers Diary]]'' by teacher [[Erin Gruwell]] who wrote the story based on [[Woodrow Wilson Classical High School]] in Long Beach, California. The movie is also based on the DC program called City at Peace.  The title is a play on the term "[[Freedom Riders]]", referring to the multiracial [[civil rights]] activists who tested the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ordering the [[desegregation]] of interstate buses in 1961.

The idea for the film came from journalist Tracey Durning, who made a documentary about Erin Gruwell for the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Primetime Live]]''. Durning served as co-executive producer of the film. The film was dedicated to the memory of Armand Jones, who was killed after wrapping up ''Freedom Writers''. He was 18 and was shot to death in [[Anaheim, California]] after a confrontation with a man who robbed Jones of a necklace in a [[Denny's]] restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2012/07/14/actors-death-eerily-similar-to-film-role/|title=Actor's death eerily similar to film role|work=[[Orange County Register]]|date=July 14, 2012|access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1994, in Long Beach, California, Erin Gruwell ([[Hilary Swank]]) has been accepted to teach English for at-risk students at Woodrow Wilson High School, a once highly acclaimed school, but where racial tensions have increased since the [[Los Angeles riot of 1992|Los Angeles Riots]] two years prior. Erin struggles to connect to her students and she experiences numerous fights between some students, who are in rival gangs.

One night, Eva Benitez ([[April L. Hernandez]]), her boyfriend, and a friend go to a convenience store. Sindy ([[Jaclyn Ngan]]), a Cambodian refugee, frequents the same convenience store. Grant Rice (Armand Jones), an African-American student at Woodrow Wilson, frustrated at losing an arcade game, demands a refund from the store owner. As Grant storms out of the store, Eva's boyfriend, Paco (as retaliation for losing a fight against Grant that took place earlier during a gang fight at Woodrow Wilson), attempts a drive-by shooting to kill Grant, but misses accidentally killing Sindy's boyfriend. As a witness, Eva must testify at court; she intends to guard "her own" in her testimony.

At school, Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing by one of her high school students and utilizes it to teach them about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], most of whom have no knowledge of. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys them composition books to record their diaries, in which they talk about their experiences of being abused, seeing their friends die, and being evicted. Determined to reform her high school students, Gruwell takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband ([[Patrick Dempsey]]). Her students start to behave with respect and discover a lot more. A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus ([[Jason Finn (actor)|Jason Finn]]). Gruwell invites various Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the [[Museum of Tolerance]]. Meanwhile, her unique training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell ([[Imelda Staunton]]).

The following school year comes, and Gruwell teaches her class (now sophomores) again, making it the second year that she is their teacher. On the first day of semester, Gruwell makes her class do a "Toast for Change", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves. Later on, the class makes enough money to have [[Miep Gies]] to arrive to the United States and tell her experience when she helped [[Anne Frank]], her family, and the Van Pels hide from the [[Nazis]]; she then also persuades the students that they are heroes and that they "within their own small ways, [can] turn on a small light in a dark room." These two events inspire Eva to break free of the demands of her father to always protect her own rather than tell the truth. At Grant's trial, she shocks the courtroom by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's boyfriend in the store; Grant is spared of being convicted and Sindy later forgives Eva. On leaving the court, Eva is attacked and threatened but ultimately spared by members of her gang and ends up going to live with her aunt in order to keep herself safe.

Meanwhile, Gruwell asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it ''The Freedom Writers Diary''. Her husband divorces her and Margaret tells her she cannot teach her kids for their junior year. Gruwell fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids during their junior and senior years, much to their elation. The film ends with a note that Gruwell successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college, for many the first in their families to do so.

==Reception==
''Freedom Writers'' has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] provides links to 124 reviews, 70% of which are positive. The critical consensus is that "''Freedom Writers'' is a frank, formulaic entry in the inspirational inner-city teacher genre, with an energetic Hilary Swank leading the appealing cast of unknowns."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|freedom_writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 64/100 based on 29 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Writers|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/freedom-writers|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cynthia Fuchs of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the film three out of five stars, writing in her review that "the plot is predictable, the actors too old to play high school students, and the pacing too slow. And really, the camera circles around deep-thinking faces a few too many times. But ''Freedom Writers'' also argues for listening to teenagers. That in itself makes it a rare and close-to-wonderful thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Writers|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/freedom-writers|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a positive rating from ''Fox Weekly'', giving the film a 9 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: ‘Freedom Writers’ (2007)|url=http://foxweekly.com/2014/03/28/reviews/review-freedom-writers-2007.html|publisher=Fox Weekly|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chloé Valdary]] says that seeing the film inspired her to become politically active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Anthony|title=Chloe Valdary: Christian, black, rising star of pro-Israel campus activism |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/chloe-valdary-christian-black-rising-star-of-pro-israel-campus-activism/|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=Times of Israel|publisher=Times of Israel|date=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deutsches Musikarchiv der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek.jpg|thumb|Reading room of the German Music Archive in Leipzig]]
The '''German Music Archive''' (in German: '''Deutsches Musikarchiv''', ''DMA'') is the central collection of [[sheet music|printed]] and [[gramophone record|recorded music]] and the music-bibliographic information centre for [[Germany]]. It is a Federal agency founded in 1970, tasked with collecting all music published in the country. Publishers of printed and recorded music in Germany are required by law (since 1973) to deliver two copies of every edition as [[legal deposit]]s to the archive.

The DMA constitutes a department of the [[German National Library]] (''Deutsche Nationalbibliothek''). Since 2010 it is located in [[Leipzig]] at the national library.

== History ==
[[Image:Berlin musikarchiv.jpg|thumb|Former host building: The ''Siemens-Villa'' in Berlin-Lankwitz]]

The archive was founded in [[West Berlin]] on January 1, 1970, during the [[History of Germany (1945–90)|division of Germany]] as a department of [[Frankfurt am Main]] based ''Deutsche Bibliothek''—the national library for [[West Germany]]. It incorporated its precursor, the ''Deutsche Musik-Phonothek'' (1961–1969), and was located (until 2010) at the ''Siemens-Villa'' in [[Berlin-Lankwitz]].

In the process of [[German reunification]] the West German ''Deutsche Bibliothek'' and the East German ''Deutsche Bücherei'' formed one national library with two seats in Frankfurt and Leipzig. The DMA moved to Leipzig in 2010, to be housed in an extension of the ''Deutsche Nationalbibliothek''. Construction work began in 2006 and was completed in 2009.

In July 2000, the DMA also assumed the role as repository for [[GEMA (Germany)|GEMA]], ''Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte,'' a German music copyright organization. Since then, music publishers only have to submit copies to DMA, which covers both national archiving and copyright registration. The 210,000 works of printed music previously held by GEMA were transferred to DMA.

The '''Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen e.V.''' (GVU, Society for the Prosecution of Copyright Infringement) is a registered association under German law. According to its own description it works for the [[Video game industry|game]] and [[film industry]] and helps to protect [[intellectual property]] and to counter the illegal distribution of [[Copyright infringement|copied materials]]. For this purpose, the association cooperates with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mpaa.org/about/around-the-world | title = Around the World | publisher = Motion Picture Association of America | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GVU was founded in the spring of 1984 and entered the register of associations in February 1985 for the first time. The headquarters were located first in [[Hamburg]], since 2008 they have been in [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin-Mitte]]. The GVU became known to a wider public by participating in campaigns such as "pirates are criminals“ and investigations in the Kino.to case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = European Police Shut Down Internet Pirate Kino.to | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-police-shut-down-internet-196223 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | author = Scott Roxborough | date = 2011-08-06 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ZentraleGVU.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Headquarters in Berlin (Quarter Mitte)]]

=== Early Years ===
Against the backdrop of a rapidly increasing demand for movies on [[VHS]] and an increase in [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] at the same time, film industry representatives agreed in early 1984 to set up a separate company to combat illegal distribution of [[copyright]]ed material. The decision was primarily driven by the motivation of the industry, to detach from the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). The longtime chairman of the Bundesverband Audiovisuelle Medien (BVV, Federal Association of Audiovisual Media) and Managing Director of the German subsidiary of [[Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment]], Bodo Schwartz, was key in the establishment of GVU.

The establishment of the GVU as a [[Business entity|legally registered association]] was formally announced in the autumn of 1984 at the [[High fidelity|HiFi]] trade fair in Düsseldorf. The first constitution was adopted on December 17, 1984. It first entered the register of the city of Hamburg on February 27, 1985, finalising the establishment of the association on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/welcome.do?language=en | title = Common register portal of the German federal states | publisher = Amtsgericht Hagen | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to Bodo Schwartz, Paul Miller of the [[Cinema International Corporation]] (CIC) and Manfred Goller of the Verband der Filmverleiher (VDF, Association of Film Distributors) were members of the founding board.

=== Software Era ===

After exclusive funding of the GVU by the movie industry in its initial years, the organisations range of tasks expanded in 1997 to include [[PC game|computer games]]. On the one hand this was due to the parallels between illegal copies of films and games - both in the production and distribution - and on the other hand, the simpler distribution of unauthorized material over the emerging [[Internet]]. [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]’s membership of the GVU in 1997 initiated the membership of the entire Entertainment Software Association in the GVU in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/241.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807142341/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/241.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-07 |title=Milestones of our Work |publisher=GVU |date=2007-04-03 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |format=PDF |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Microsoft]] entered the GVU as the first member of the [[software industry]], which represented a significant milestone for the work of the GVU and directed the attention of the general public to the association. Simultaneously, this resulted in an expansion of the range of GVU’s tasks. As early as in 2001, the GVU took over the [[Management|administration]] of the organization SAFE, which is responsible for the fight against [[copyright infringement]] in [[Switzerland]]. At the same time, cooperation intensified with the [[Austria]]n Verein für Anti-Piraterie (VAP, Association for Anti-Piracy) in the film and video industry, so the entire [[German language|German-speaking]] area was fully covered.

=== Management ===

The statutes of the GVU provides that the [[Vorstand|board]] consists of a chairman and at least three others. The GVU is represented jointly by at least two board members. Currently (as of November 2012) the committee includes Vincent de La Tour (Chairman), Dr. Holger Ensslin, Violetta Psofiou, Ralph Tübben, Alexander Skipis and Dr. Bernd Fakesch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/17_Impressum.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130211040202/http://www.gvu.de/17_Impressum.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-11 |title=Imprint on the Official Website |publisher=GVU |language=German |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[List of company registers|Commercial Register]] there are committees for finance, legal and technology. Next to the executive board the association has a full-time [[general manager|executive director]] who is responsible for the daily operations and reports to the Board. Dr. Matthias Leonardy currently holds this position, who previously worked as a [[Syndic|general counsel]] for the German [[eBay]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.linkedin.com/pub/matthias-leonardy/0/668/a40 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225201307/http://de.linkedin.com/pub/matthias-leonardy/0/668/a40 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-25 |title=Professional Profile of Matthias Leonardy |publisher=LinkedIn |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work and structure of the GVU was mainly characterized by Bodo Schwartz, who was on the executive board for over 20 years and led it as Chairman for a long time. He also represented the GVU to media and shaped the image of the association in the public, including through various interviews. Schwartz retired from his position of CEO of [[Twentieth Century Fox]] in 2002, and retired from the GVU in October 2006. His retirement speech in late January 2007 was held by [[Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Speech at the New Year Reception of the GVU | date = 2009-08-25 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German | publisher = FDP Bayern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==

In 2011, a total of about 50 companies and organizations were represented as a member of the GVU. In the field of film this includes virtually all major [[Hollywood]] studios, such as [[Sony Pictures]], [[Twentieth Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]] and [[The Walt Disney Studios (production company)|Walt Disney Studios]]. Members from the gaming industry include [[Ubisoft]], Microsoft, [[Activision]], [[Konami]] and [[Koch Media]] as well as respective affiliates of the major film studios. In addition, in its Annual Report 2011, the service providers [[arvato]], [[Cinram]], [[OpSec]] and [[Rovi]] got quoted as members.&lt;ref name="report2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/828.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907051457/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/828.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-07 |title=Annual Report 2011 |publisher=GVU |language=German |format=PDF |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special role is played by the membership of numerous [[Trade association|professional organizations]], in which the interests and positions of certain industries are bundled. So for example currently the [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] (BVMI, Federal Association of Music Industry), the [[Bundesverband Informationswirtschaft, Telekommunikation und neue Medien]] (BITKOM, German Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media) and the [[Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware]] (BIU, Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) belong to the GVU. The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), one of the foremost organizations against [[copyright infringement]] in the [[English language|English speaking world]], is a full member too.

Overall, in 2011, nine organizations, 21 films- and 15 games providers and five other companies supported the GVU. Over the last five years the number of members has remained largely constant. However, as a result of the economic and [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]], the association lost some companies from the movie industry. The most prominent example in this case is the production and distribution company [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which in 2007 was still listed as a member of the GVU, but no longer in the following year. MGM went into administration in 2010 and withdrew from other industry associations.

Since 2007, the GVU has published annually a list of its members.&lt;ref name="report2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/408.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812185131/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/408.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-12 |title=Annual Report 2007 |publisher=GVU |format=PDF |language=German |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and [[business|companies]] indirectly involved in the GVU through third-party associations are not explicitly listed in it.

== Activities ==

The activities of the Association focuses on preventing economic losses of its members, resulting from unauthorized copying and its dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.din.de/sixcms_upload/media/2896/TMC_Leonardy.pdf |title=Digital IP Theft: What it is, its Economics and Effects – and then, what? |author=Matthias Leonardy |publisher=5th Transatlantic Market Conference |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090428/http://www.din.de/sixcms_upload/media/2896/TMC_Leonardy.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GVU estimated the loss at several hundred million euros annually. In addition to those defined in the constitution, the association based its efforts primarily on copyright law.

=== Investigations ===

The association applies a large part of its resources to the actual detection of copyright infringements. The action is driven by the view that government agencies alone cannot monitor the entire [[Market (economics)|market]] for unlicensed content, which is why the GVU tries to fill this gap. The employees of the GVU, including former [[police officers]] and [[commissioners]], systematically scour the relevant sources of illegal copies, especially on the Internet. Unlike other organizations, by its own admission the GVU does not primarily aim at end-consumers, rather, it targets mainly the "big fishes". Besides those people who for example record a movie at the cinema or make copies from a computer game, these increasingly include the operators of so-called [[BitTorrent|Trackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German |url=http://www.gvu.de/26_Illegale_Kopien.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531164334/http://www.gvu.de/26_Illegale_Kopien.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-31 |title=Mission and Activities - Disseminating Illegal Copies |publisher=GVU |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GVU mainly focuses on large, internationally active [[Warez group|release groups]] where copyrighted products are reproduced and distributed systematically, especially for profit. In its work, the association - if possible - accesses to public registers, for example, to reveal the real people behind a [[Shell corporation|shell company]]. Due of their private-sector activity, the GVU may not identify IP addresses directly. Instead the association directs this as evidence to the relevant authorities. This is usually done as part of criminal procedure, which then leads to public prosecutorial investigations. Unless a criminal procedure is actually opened, an employee of the association often act as an [[expert witness]]. Not every [[complaint]] will automatically lead to a successful prosecution, for example the GVU had to make a total of three applications in the case of Kino.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87476-interview-gvu-war-bereits-dritte-strafantrag-gegen-kino-to.html | title = This was the third complaint against kino.to | publisher = Netzwelt | author = Markus Franz | date = 2011-07-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as it is known to date, the GVU does not claim [[damages]] from [[warez]] users according to civil law. Instead the association allows its members the freedom to make possible claims for losses incurred. However, the association engages in strongly communicating its legal opinion in individual cases. Particularly in cases related to so-called illegal [[streaming media|streaming]] of copied content, many legal assessments and opinions remain debatable.

=== Public Relations ===

In addition to its investigative activities the GVU does intensive public relations, which aims to raise awareness of copyright infringement. In the years 2009 to 2011 members of the association participated in nearly 100 events and reached about 2.000 participants through their [[Presentation|speeches]]. In addition, since the late 80s the GVU has offered seminars for police officers and prosecutors, where they can learn about the consequences of [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] as well as the activities of the association.

In 1990, the GVU launched a prevention program on the topic of [[holography]], a technology making it easier for [[retail]]ers and [[consumer]]s to identify unauthorized copied media. In addition, the association was known to a wider audience through the campaign "Pirates are criminals". This was produced by a subsidiary of the Central Association of German Film Theatres, where the GVU sits on the advisory board. During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] an action of the umbrella organization MPAA was supported by [[Pelé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2006/06/10/mpaa_enlists_football_legend_pel_in_piracy_fight | title = MPAA enlists football legend Pelé in piracy fight | author = James Delahunty | publisher = AfterDawn | date = 2006-06-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the GVU has performed annually the so-called ROOF-industry forum together with VAP and SAFE, which recently took place in the Kalkscheune venue in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://irights.info/blog/arbeit2.0/2011/11/22/5-dach-branchenforum-gvu-verkundet-neue-strategie-vielleicht/ | title = GVU announces new strategy - perhaps? | publisher = iRights | date = 2011-11-22 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the event, [[Jurist|lawyers]], representatives of the games and movie industries are brought together with trade associations and [[Advocacy group|other stakeholders]] under the slogan "prevention and education". In 2011, the study of digital content usage (short DCN study) received large attention, since it was the first to cover the specific uses of legal and illegal online content. The study was prepared by the GVU and the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (Federal Association of Music Industry) as well as the [[Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels]] (Association of German Book Trade).

=== Political Influence ===
Beside the main activities, GVU also gives advice to politicians and represents its interests there.&lt;ref name="report2011" /&gt; For example, the association - as well as others around the globe - requested a [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] warning. This should be presented to an Internet user as soon as it first wants to call a pirated copy, but this remains controversial in [[Germany]]. In the course of this particular position, the GVU criticized the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Justice]]. Furthermore, the association has complained for years that in case of copyright infringement there is a right of access to Internet service providers, but this would fail due to the lack of storage of communication data ("web problem").

The GVU also calls to execute the missing third basket of the reform of copyright law at last. Likewise, the trend towards trivialisation of copyright infringement by individual politicians criticized repeatedly, most recently in an article by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and [[Paul van Dyk]] in TIME.

== Proceedings ==

The investigations conducted by the association were influenced by [[Technological change|technological progress]] over the years: After the beginning of the 80s the fight against pirated VHS tapes were in the spotlight, many prosecutions in the 90s and the following years related to the distribution of movies and games via [[Peer-to-Peer|P2P networks]]. Since 2010 streaming has taken an increasingly larger space.&lt;ref name="report2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/798.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128005349/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/798.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-11-28 |title=Annual Report 2009 |publisher=GVU |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |format=PDF |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of cases opened in the years 2007 to 2011 fell from 576 to 204. The decrease is mainly due to the fact that since 2008 many [[State's attorney|prosecutors]] have focused on those investigations in which more than 200 [[Reproduction|copies]] of a work were produced. The GVU in its own words has adopted this trend and focuses its investigative activities increasingly on major cases.

In addition to the operations that stern directly from GVU investigations, the association supports those proceedings initiated by the relevant legal authorities. In addition, each year several proceedings are officially reported, which were initiated jointly by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] and the GVU. About a quarter of all cases result in a [[Sentence (law)|verdict]] or penalty order.

=== Significant Cases ===

In recent years, the GVU has uncovered many release groups and other networks, some of which stand out because of their size or importance.  Especially if in the course of the investigation a [[Search and seizure|house search]] takes place, the respective cases and the activities of the association experienced increased media attention. Mentioned in the annual reports of the GVU important procedures include the following:

* In September 2007, 50 properties were searched simultaneously in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. The aim of the objective, which was launched by the GVU project "autumn storms", was primarily to obtain evidence. According to media reports, a total of 60 [[Personal computer|computers]] and 15 [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] were seized. The GVU itself evaluates the action a success, for example by "[[Keinohrhasen]]" was no unauthorized copy in circulation until 2007.&lt;ref name="report2007" /&gt;
* Also in the same year a person could be found who was responsible for the spread of so-called First seeding the first illegal version of "[[Spider-Man 3|Spiderman 3]]". The person was also senior member of a release group that was responsible for numerous other software [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]].
* In March 2008, a request by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] umbrella organization caused that the GVU has started investigations against the operator of an internet portal, that offered primarily latest films like "[[Rush Hour 3]]". In the course of the proceedings it became clear that behind the offer stood a broad network, which had connections to the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Australia]]. Following a criminal complaint of the GVU the [[Frankfurt]] [[Kriminalpolizei|Criminal Police]] confiscated ten servers of the group, which were hosted there in one [[data center|datacenter]].&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/586.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230033113/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/586.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-30 |title=Annual Report 2008 |publisher=GVU |language=German |format=PDF |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Earlier this year, the GVU acted against a Payserver-ring that gave users access to pirated copies for a fee. In this case 13 [[Byte|terabytes]] of data were provided for a total of more than 10,000 registered users. In addition the association led a criminal conduct against operators of so-called trackers in [[BitTorrent]] network.
* In the spring of 2009 this led to another spectacular lawsuit: After raids in [[Lüneburg]], [[Wolfenbüttel]] and [[Braunschweig]] three men were [[Detention (imprisonment)|arrested]], who ran a tracker with 24.500 copied movies, TV shows, games, audiobooks, [[eBook]]s, music and software. This was characterized particularly by the fact that every user had to pay a fee to access the tracker. In addition, extensive [[User guide|instructions]] were provided to make the access to pirate copies simply as possible for less experienced people too.&lt;ref name="report2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/653.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124112337/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/653.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-24 |title=Annual Report 2009 |publisher=GVU |format=PDF |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2012-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The annual report also points to another important event: In 2005, the Swiss organization SAFE had received a notice of information about a large Payserver ring. Since the physical location was in [[Germany]], the persecution was handed over to the local association. The GVU set a criminal complaint against the head of the server in 2009.
* In March 2010, the GVU presented a criminal complaint, which was directed against a [[projectionist]] from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The projectionist was one of the most active Cinegroups and procured high-quality pirated audio material for the production of pirated copies. The investigations of the association revealed that they were identical to the original material even to the audio [[watermark]]ing. The group ended their activities completely after the arrest of the projectionist.&lt;ref name="report2010" /&gt;
* Another complaint in the same year was directed against the streaming hosting clickandload on which more than 20 terabytes of pirated copies were provided. According to the GVU-investigation the platform was organized as far-flung release group and, in particular, those who provided an illegally copy, shared revenue from [[advertising]] on the [[Website|site]]. During the police investigation the portal was completely shut down. Against the relevant uploader clickandload also proceedings were initiated.

In the following years, the association wants especially to tackle the financing of "piracy". The aim of the operation is to prevent professional service of ad-funded websites with pirated works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/25_208_Alexander_Skipis_in_den_GVU_Vorstand_gewaehlt_Austrocknen_von_Finanzquellen_digitaler_Hehler_im_Jahr_2013_ein_Schwerpunktthema_der_GVU.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130206185156/http://www.gvu.de/25_208_Alexander_Skipis_in_den_GVU_Vorstand_gewaehlt_Austrocknen_von_Finanzquellen_digitaler_Hehler_im_Jahr_2013_ein_Schwerpunktthema_der_GVU.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-06 |title=In 2013, the GVU focuses on Financing of Piracy |publisher=GVU |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2012-12-06 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Kino.to ===
[[File:KinoToScreenshot.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Message from the Criminal Police]]

The most important proceeding of the GVU in the last decade was against Kino.to. In June 2011 Kino.to was one of the 50 most visited sites in Germany and was thus well known to the general public. According to the film industry over 96 per cent of visitors were located in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. At Kino.to it was possible to view tens of thousands of videos via so-called Streams, including numerous high-quality [[Movie theater|movies]] and [[Television program|TV series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/229865/article.html | title = Police Shut Down German Movie-streaming Portal | author = Jeremy Kirk | publisher = PCWorld | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Kino.to has become available in March 2008, the GVU was determined to go against its backers. According to the GVU, the process was difficult, as those behind Kino.to had specifically concealed their [[Identity (social science)|identities]]. For example, the [[top-level domain]] [[.to]] was chosen, as the responsible authority in [[Tonga]] does not releases any information about the respective owners of domains. Only when the third formal complaint by the Association was reported to the authorities in Dresden on April 28, 2011, the desired outcome was achieved: In early June, in [[Police raid|raids]] across several [[Europe]]an countries, several persons were arrested who were directly involved in Kino.to - including the owner Dirk B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Police take down Kino.to in massive anti-piracy operation | url = http://www.techspot.com/news/44187-police-take-down-kinoto-in-massive-anti-piracy-operation.html | publisher = TechSpot | author = Emil Protalinski | date = 2011-06-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly responsible for the success was the Integrierte Ermittlungseinheit Sachsen (INES, Integrated Detection Unit Saxony). During the course of process Kino.to was shut down on the suspicion of the backers forming a criminal organization and copyright infringement on an industrial scale. A message relating to the criminal investigation is now found at Kino.to. What is seen in the film industry as a major success fuelled huge criticisms by the majority of Kino.to users.

As a direct result of the closure of Kino.to, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] started an attack on the [[Web server]] of the GVU, which finally led to an overload and failure of the website. In addition under the name KinoX.to a portal got created which is a direct descendant of Kino.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/german-piracy-site-kinoto-relaunches-210099 | title = German Piracy Site Kino.to Relaunches as KinoX.to | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | author = Scott Roxborough | date = 2011-12-07 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GVU has now also initiated an investigation into this portal. In addition, the association and authorities are investigating the [[Online advertising|advertising]] and marketing of Kino.to and KinoX.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/anonymous-retaliates-against-kino-to-take-down/ |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |title=Anonymous retaliates against Kino.to takedown |publisher=GigaOM |author=Janko Roettgers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203205442/http://gigaom.com/video/anonymous-retaliates-against-kino-to-take-down/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malware ==

A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]], which had been discovered for the first time on 20 March 2012, used the [[logo]] of GVU without permission of the Association. It targets and infects PCs running Microsoft [[Windows XP]] or later versions and claims to have [[Ransomware|locked the PC]] on behalf of the GVU, as pirated content had been detected on it. In fact not a single file on the hard disk is checked; however the user is prompted to pay a fee in order to regain access to the computer. Usually, the requested amount is between 50 and 100 euros and is to be paid via [[paysafecard]] or (now defunct) [[Ukash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.2-spyware.com/remove-gvu-virus.html | title = Remove GVU Virus - Removal Instructions | publisher = 2Spyware | author = Ugnius Kiguolis | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, numerous variants of the GVU Trojan are circulating purporting to be a program of the [[Federal Office for Information Security|Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik]] (BSI, Federal Office for Information Security) or the [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte]] (GEMA, Society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights). Due to the widespread use of the Trojan, in August 2012 the GVU released its first statement regarding the [[malware]], aimed in particular at the malware authors. It was speculated that the Trojan was written by operators of illegal streaming portals in order to open up new financial sources. The page KinoX.to which strongly resembles Kino.to was used for the mass dissemination of new variants of the malware according to GVU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gvu-blog.de/?p=427 |title=What Kinox has to do with the GVU Trojans? |publisher=GVU Blog |author=Christine Ehlers |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817122054/http://www.gvu-blog.de/?p=427 |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006 the GVU was itself under investigation. The state prosecution of [[Ellwangen]] accused the association of having promoted the illegal distribution of copyrighted material. As the accusation details the association had allegedly had financial dealings with an administrator of the so-called IOH server, over which numerous release groups had collected and distributed copied content. In addition, the association got accused of directly providing hardware for the operation of the server.

During the course of the investigation the business premises of the GVU in Hamburg, as well as the [[apartment|home]] of a senior employee, were searched. The GVU has officially confirmed the raid and, according to the authorities, made available all of the information. Due to the particular urgency of the case, the action gained widespread media attention. However, suspicions against the association have not been confirmed. The investigation has since halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.onlinekosten.de/news/artikel/19848/0/Razzia-Ermittlungen-gegen-die-GVU | title = Roundup: Investigation of the GVU | language = German | publisher = Onlinekosten | author = Volker Briegleb | date = 2006-01-24 | accessdate = 2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, during another investigation, the role of the GVU was criticised: The [[Kiel]] District Court said that during the course of proceedings against a suspected software pirates, it is essential to ensure the independence of police investigative work. Specifically, there were complaints that an employee of the GVU had worked as an expert in the process and at the same time had a free hand in the analysis of seized computers. The requirement of impartiality, not only for [[judge]]s but also for prosecutors and the [[police]] had, in their opinion, not been fully safeguarded. Investigating authorities were prohibited to privatize their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LGKIEL/EN/LGKIEL_node.html |title=Official Website of the Kiel District Court |publisher=Schleswig-Holstein |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201081913/http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LGKIEL/EN/LGKIEL_node.html |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the strategy of the GVU in luring software pirates through a so-called [[Honeypot (computing)|honey pot]] trap has remained a subject of criticism. For example, during the course a raid in autumn 2007 suspicions were raised that the GVU and other organizations had installed open [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP servers]] on network, intended for the use by release groups, thus enabling the determination release group members based on their [[IP address]]. According to the unanimous opinion of experts, this approach is, at least legally, unobjectionable.

Individual media outlets have criticised the GVU’s close proximity to [[lawyer]]s, prosecutors, police and internet [[service provider]]s, although naturally these kind of co-operations are part of the work of any interest group. The Association’s close cooperation with various other organizations is repeatedly criticized, especially during its annual Industry Forum.

In August 2010, the GVU was suspected of having caused the unjustified removal of several posts on the video platform [[Vimeo]], which had been published under a [[Creative Commons]] license and are therefore available to all. Among other contents, "You are a terrorist" and "Electric Reporter" were affected. During the course of the investigation into the case it was revealed that the removal of the content was not initiated by the association, but by the company OpSec Security, based in [[Munich]]. The authors Alexander Lehmann and Mario Sixtus were able to obtain an injunction against the company and the GVU has since explicitly distanced itself from the company. According to the GVU, OpSec Security had at no point been contracted to clear videos from Vimeo in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-failure-takes-down-creative-commons-video-100812/ | title = Anti-Piracy Failure Takes Down Creative Commons Videos | publisher = TorrentFreak | date = 2010-08-12 | accessdate = 2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Mourning and in Rage''''' was a work of [[performance art]] and activism by [[Suzanne Lacy]] and [[Leslie Labowitz-Starus|Leslie Labowitz]]. The performance took place in [[Los Angeles]], California in 1977 as a response to the rapes and murders covered by the media in the "[[Hillside Strangler]]" case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labowitz-Starus|first=Leslie|last2=Lacy|first2=Suzanne|date=1978-01-01|title="In Mourning and in Rage ..."|jstor=3345993|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=52–55|doi=10.2307/3345993}}&lt;/ref&gt;"As if the horror of these crimes wasn't enough, the press coverage of the events sensationalized the sexual nature of the crimes.  For feminist activists in Los Angeles involved in the movement to end violence against women, this analysis was unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moravec|first1=Michelle|title=In Mourning and In Rage|url=http://historyinthecity.blogspot.com/2011/09/in-mourning-and-in-rage.html|website=History of the City|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuation of ''Three Weeks in May,'' Lacy and Labowitz designed ''In Mourning and in Rage'' as a personal response to the sensationalized media coverage of violence against women as well as an expression of grief and rage towards the loss of life. The performance was a collaboration between Lacy, Labowitz, Bia Lowe, [[Holly Near]], City Councilwoman Pat Russel, the [[Woman's Building]], Women Against Violence Against Women, and Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. The event was staged for mass media coverage at the [[Los Angeles City Hall]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suzannelacy.com/in-mourning-and-in-rage-1977/|title=In Mourning and In Rage (1977)|website=SUZANNE LACY|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/women-art-and-society/oclc/930389708&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Women, art, and society|last=Chadwick|first=Whitney|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500204054|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance consisted of a large funeral motorcade of black-clad women lead by a hearse from the [[Woman's Building]] to the Los Angeles City Hall. Once there, nine seven-feet-tall women draped in black emerged from the hearse along with a women dressed in red. The mourners then climbed the steps of city hall where each of the nine women gave a statement into a microphone expressing their solidarity with the murdered women, emphasized by a chorus of "In memory of our sisters, we fight back!" from the rest of the motorcade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By making this performance public as well as highly crafted for media coverage, Lacy and Labowitz looked to highlight not only the deaths of the ten women killed by the [[Hillside Strangler]], but the significantly larger population of women victims whose stories went uncovered by mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801307168|title=Pacific standard time : Los Angeles art 1945-1980|last=Rebecca.|first=Peabody,|last2=Calif.)|first2=J.

The piece concluded with direct statements to the press explaining the rationale for the piece as well as a speech demanding resources for women's self defense. Singer-songwriter [[Holly Near]] performed her song "Fight Back"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Near|first1=Holly|title=Fight Back|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBE4Au5myko|website=Youtube|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written specifically for this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish|first1=Sharon|title=Suzanne Lacy: Spaces Between|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0fCKMCOdO0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=fight+back+holly+near+composed+lacy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q4DGhJL3eI&amp;sig=kM9wgfqVxJWggucbF-__So5cXqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHro--i_zSAhXmsFQKHdNmDVsQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=fight%20back%20holly%20near%20composed%20lacy&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press (February 12, 2010)|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
''In Mourning and in Rage'' was highly covered by the press and resulted in increased support from Los Angeles City Council members and a pledge from the Rape Hotline Alliance to provide self defense classes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To further the conversation about social action and art, Lacy and Labowitz produced a video documenting ''In Mourning and in Rage'' as well as a pamphlet entitled ''What is Social Art?.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9518">[[File:Keshcarrigan Bowl.png|thumb|Illustration of the Keshcarrigan Bronze bowl; [http://100objects.ie/keshcarrigan-bowl/ photos].]]
The '''Keshcarrigan Bowl''' is an [[Iron age]] bronze bowl discovered to the north of [[Keshcarrigan]], [[county Leitrim]], [[Ireland]], in the [[19th century]]. The bowl was found in the waterway between [[Lough Scur]] and [[Lough Marrave]] ("lake of death").{{sfn|Mulvany, Fraser, Roberts, Mulvany, O'Flaherty|1852|pp=lix}} It was perhaps a ceremonial drinking cup.{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}} The bowl would have been a  prestigious item in [[1st century]] [[Ireland]], the bird-shaped handle outstandingly designed and skillfully executed.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=5}} The Keshcarrigan Bowl is in the [[National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology|archaeology branch of the National Museum of Ireland]].{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}

The Keshcarrigan bowl is considered one of the finest classic cast bronze cups, or drinking vessel.  Made of bright-yellow metal, it was discovered {{nobreak|{{circa|1842|1850}}}} during the building of the "[[Shannon–Erne Waterway|Ulster Canal]]".{{sfn|Mulvany, Fraser, Roberts, Mulvany, O'Flaherty|1852|pp=lix}}{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}}{{sfn|Wilde|1857|534}} The [[bowl]] is a fine golden [[bronze]] only {{convert|14|cm|1}} wide and {{convert|1|mm}} in thickness, being cast or beaten into shape before being finished and polished by being spun on a lathe.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}}{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=323}} The neck was finished off against an internal mould.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}} The principal decorative feature of the bowl is its cast bronze zoomorphic handle, following the graceful shape of a bird-beast head of a somewhat nondescript appearance influenced by the flamboyant ornamentation of its time, soldered to the body of the vessel at the base and loosely connected to the vessel neck.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=52}} The ridge at the front of the bird-head, the 'shield' below, and impression of a beak turning-backward, are all characteristic of the male-[[Shelduck]].{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=95}}

In 2018 it was shown on an [[Irish postage stamp]], after featuring in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://100objects.ie/keshcarrigan-bowl/ Page] in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Torrs Pony-cap and Horns|Witham Shield|Wandsworth Shield}}
The brilliantly modeled ducks-head handle on the Keshcarrigan bowl is an early masterpiece of the style, comparable to the best British work of the period such as the bird-finials on the [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns|Torrs Chamfrein horns]],{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}} the stylistic identity of both heads representing ducks, and both having empty slots for studs in the eyes.{{sfn|Atkinson, Piggott|1953|pp=223}} The Torrs style originated in Britain in the middle or second half of the third century BC. The Keshcarrigan cup is on stylistic grounds likely to be contemporary with the Torrs pieces, with the “crimped” pattern on the rim of the Keshcarrigan bowl perhaps comparable with similar techniques used on [[Wandsworth Shield|the circular Wandsworth boss]] and the terminal circular insignias on the [[Witham Shield]].  The bowl seems to have close affinities to pottery bowls of identical profile from Brittany, which have a similar “crimped” pattern on their inner rims. Being lathe-spun the age of the bowl suggests a comparatively late date at variance with the stylistic evidence.  The bowl is of importance in showing the Torrs style is recorded in both Britain and Ireland.{{sfn|Atkinson, Piggott|1953|pp=231}}  The cup resembles another found at [[Fore, County Westmeath]], which is slightly earlier and imported from Britain, as this may also be.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace and O'Floinn, 4:7 (Fore), 4:8 (Keshcarrigan)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==  
The bowl was intended for drinking purposes, for eating food out of, as a container, and ceremonial purposes.{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}}{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=52}} Metal handled cups are a feature of late [[La Tène culture]], and their production might have been stimulated by the re-appearance of wine-services imported from the Classical world.{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=221}}{{refn|The bowl was found in, or beside, [[Lough Marrave]]  ({{lang-ga|Loch Marbh}}, "dead lake" or "lake of death"), perhaps deposited as a pagan ritual offering.|group=n|name=cupInDeadLake}}

Some sources suggest the bowl was imported across the [[Irish Sea]] because the practice of producing bronze bowls using a spinning technique was done in the [[Belgae#Belgae outside Gaul|Belgae]] workshops of south-east [[England]], and Roman continental workshops, rather than Ireland.{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}}{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=93}} However the evidence for this conclusion is conjecture, and the Keshcarrigan bowl was just as likely made in Ireland.{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=220}} A reasonably close parallel to the Keshcarrigan cup is a handled vessel of willow, presumably Irish origin, in the National Museum of Ireland, and another bronze handle from a similar profile cup was discovered at [[County Galway]].{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=220}} Conversely, though a similar handle was recently found in the Somerset hoard,{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}} no other vessel of this style was found in southern Britain,{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=221}} so the practice of making bowls with ornamental bird handles must have become established in Ireland sometime in the early [[1st Century]] AD.{{sfn|Jope|1971|pp=118}}

===Belgae refugees===
[[Fintan O'Toole|O'Toole]] suggested the Keshcarrigan Bowl represents evidence for the movement of people into Ireland following upheavals in Celtic Europe in the century before and after the birth of Christ. Gallic [[Belgae|Belgic tribes]] crossed into Britain as refugees from the Romans and displacing native people some of whom came to Ireland.{{sfn|O'Toole|2013|p=45}}

'''Louisville Gardens''' is a multi-purpose, 6,000-seat [[arena]], in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], that opened in 1905, as the '''Jefferson County Armory'''. It celebrated its 100th anniversary as former city mayor [[Jerry Abramson]]'s official "Family-Friendly New Years Eve" celebration location. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.

==History==
The facility has served the city of Louisville and [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] in a variety of ways during the past century, from utilization as an actual armory to [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Kentucky Colonels]] basketball games, to various wrestling events, concerts, political rallies, and [[Hurricane Katrina]] flood relief have also been staged there. More recently, [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] used the 3,000-person capacity arena as a training ground for future stars in a minor-league [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] known as [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], until the organization moved to the [[Davis Arena]]. WWE also staged two [[pay-per-view]] events while the venue was known as '''Louisville Gardens''': ([[In Your House 6]] and [[Ground Zero: In Your House|In Your House 17: Ground Zero]]). TNA Wrestling held an event at the venue in 2007. [[Freedom Hall]] replaced the small, aging facility in 1956, as a more popular venue for city events. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (Tuesday, August 23, 1960)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/mlk-jefferson-county-armory&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harry Truman]] both spoke at the arena.

==Use as basketball arena==
Primary home of [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball]] starting in 1945 when [[Bernard Hickman|Bernard "Peck" Hickman]] was head coach until the 1957–58 season when they moved to Freedom Hall. They  played a few more games there up until their last on November 30, 1972. The Louisville Cardinals were 153-23 all time at the armory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20101010/SPORTS0203/310100032/Louisville-basketball-has-had-many-homes-before-KFC-Yum-Center&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]] when led by [[Adolph Rupp]] played 72 games at the armory going 61-11 there from 1937 to 1956&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/statistics/arenajeffersoncountyarmory.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Included in that was games played in the [[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]] which was held at the armory from 1941 to 1952. Additionally, the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament was held there from 1949 to 1955 and again from 1964 to 1967.

The [[Kentucky Colonels]], of the [[American Basketball Association]], played their home games at the facility, then known as the '''Louisville Convention Center''', from 1967 through 1970. [[Louie Dampier]] was the team's best player in the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Kentucky-Colonels.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142515/http://www.remembertheaba.com/Kentucky-Colonels.html |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 1968, [[Penny Ann Earley]] became the first female to appear in a men's professional league, playing briefly in a home game for the Colonels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remembertheaba.com/OnlyintheABAMaterial/OnlyInTheABA/PAEarly/PAEarly.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Louisville Catbirds]], of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] (1983–1985), the [[Louisville Shooters]], of the [[Global Basketball Association]] (1991–1992) and the [[Kentucky Colonels (ABA 2000)|Kentucky Colonels]], of the [[ABA 2000]] (2004–2006), all played their home basketball games at the Louisville Gardens. The [[Louisville Cardinals|University of Louisville]] women's basketball team used the Gardens for six home games in the 1997–98 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guide.provations.com/louisville/womensbb2010#pg161 |title=Records: Home/Attendance |work=2010–11 Louisville Cardinals Women's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=University of Louisville Sports information |format=PDF |page=159 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice hockey]] teams to use the Gardens as home ice include the [[Louisville Blades]], [[Louisville Shooting Stars]] and the [[Louisville Rebels]].

==Other names==
The building was also known as the Convention Center or Louisville Convention Center, mostly in the 1960s and 1970s. It was renamed Louisville Gardens in 1975 when the Commonwealth Convention Center (now called [[Kentucky International Convention Center]]) was being built.

==Current status==
In 2007, the [[Cordish Company]], manager of the nearby [[Fourth Street Live!]] entertainment complex, agreed to take over operation of "The Gardens" from the [[Louisville Metro Council|Metro Louisville Government]] as part of a $250 million development in [[downtown Louisville]]. In 2012, Cordish was released from its obligations to the Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdrb.com/story/19568501/cordish-obligation-to-revamp-louisville-gardens-optional Cordish obligation to revamp Louisville Gardens 'optional']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Menhirs of Lavajo''' ({{lang-pt|Menires de Lavajo}}) are a group of [[menhir]]s, located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Alcoutim e Pereiro]] in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Alcoutim]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Algarve]].

==History==
[[File:MenirLavajoI.JPG|170px|left|thumb|The largest menhir of the megalithic group]]

These structures are territorial marks or define sacred spaces from the [[Late Neolithic]] or [[Chalcolithic]] period (constructed sometime between 3500 and 2800 B.C.).&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=32266 |title=Menires de Lavajo/Conjunto megalítico de Lavajo (IPA.00032266/PT050802010019) |publisher=SIPA–Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Rosário |last=Gordalina |year=2011 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first excavations in 1998, revealed the existence of not only the large menhir, but fragments of the two small menhirs.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; These menhirs raised the possibility that the group was an intentional alignment of these structures.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; One of these structures were eventually stored in the archaeological museum in Alcoutim.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
A rural group, located on a small {{convert|155|m|ft}} hilltop, between the Lavajo valley and the ravine of the same name. The area is encircled by fence.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

Part of an aligned group of megalithic religious structures. Consists of three carved menhirs, with the largest decorated with carvings and circles. The largest (Lavajo I) is {{convert|3.14|m|ft}} high, dark grey phallic-form structure, with its surface stained in brown.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Its carvings combine decoration arranged along a longitudinal groove, with circles and other elements.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The other two menhirs (Lavajo II) located {{convert|250|m|ft}},  decorated in a similar fashion, with one decorated by perforated circle.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms.cm-alcoutim.pt.vf-host.com/upload_files/client_id_1/website_id_1/Concelho/Turismo/o_que_visitar_/Menir%20Lavajo/Folheto%20menir.pdf |editor=Câmara Municipal |publisher=Câmara Municipal de Alcoutim |title=Menhires of Lavajo |accessdate=5 April 2015 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both committees aim to foster intellectual exchange among scholars and students interested in all fields of art history. They organize scholarly conferences and promote the communication, dissemination and exchange of knowledge and information about art history in order to promote a global community of art historians. 

The NCHA is supported by the [[Getty Foundation]] and interested in developing global networks of art historians, particularly in areas of the world in which art history is an emerging discipline. Therefore, it brings together art historians from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe for discussions on the state of the discipline. The NCHA also provides travel support to congresses for students enrolled in US doctoral programs.

The current president of the NCHA is [[Marc Gotlieb]], Director of the Graduate Program and Class of 1955 Memorial Professor of Art at [[Williams College]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]].

The '''National Symphony Orchestra''' ('''NSO'''), founded in 1931, is an American [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]].  Its principal performing venue is the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. 

==History==
For the first period of its history, the NSO performed in [[Constitution Hall]].  During the tenure of the first music director, [[Hans Kindler]], the musicians received a salary of $40.00 per week, for three rehearsals and one concert, for five months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200542_pf.html | title=The NSO: 75 and Counting Its Blessings | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page |date=2005-09-04 | accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first female member of the NSO was a harpist, [[Sylvia Meyer]], who joined in 1933.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|date=March 30, 2005|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/03/29/AR2005032901247.html|title=Esteemed NSO Harpist Sylvia Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kindler and the NSO made several 78-rpm recordings for [[RCA Victor]], including the two Roumanian Rhapsodies by [[George Enescu]]; much later, in 1960, the NSO would perform the first of these works under the baton of the visiting Romanian conductor [[George Georgescu]], a close associate and favored exponent of the composer.&lt;ref name=Programme&gt;Programme for National Symphony Orchestra performances of December 13–15, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the more unusual RCA recordings with the orchestra was of the complete ballet music from the opera ''King Henry VIII'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], one of the very few recordings conducted by [[Walter Damrosch]].  Years later, [[Howard Mitchell]] made a series of [[stereophonic]] recordings with the orchestra for RCA.  [[Antal Doráti]] recorded with the orchestra for [[Decca Records]].  [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] made recordings for [[Telefunken|Teldec]], [[Sony Records]], and [[Erato Records|Erato]].  The orchestra returned to RCA Victor under [[Leonard Slatkin]], until RCA abandoned new [[classical music|classical]] recordings.

In 1986, the NSO became the artistic affiliate of the [[Kennedy Center]], where it has presented a concert season annually since the Center opened in 1971.

==Activities==
The NSO regularly participates in events of national and international importance, including performances for ceremonial state affairs, presidential inaugurations and official holiday celebrations, including concerts for [[Memorial Day]] and the regular ''[[A Capitol Fourth]]'' concerts on 4 July.

The NSO itself numbers 100 musicians, presenting a 52-week season of approximately 175 concerts each year. These include classical subscription series, [[Traditional pop music|pops]] concerts, and educational programs.   In addition to these activities, small groups of NSO members develop education programs designed at age levels from pre-kindergarten through high school.  Collectively, these ensembles present as many as 100 additional performances a year during the [[#AR|American Residencies]] and at the Kennedy Center.

Through the John and June Hechinger Commissioning Fund for New Orchestral Works, the NSO has commissioned more than 50 works, including cycles of fanfares and encores.  During his tenure, Slatkin founded the National Conducting Institute in 2000.  

Also of note is the National Symphony Orchestra Summer Music Institute.  For more than a decade, [[scholarships]] provided by the National Trustees of the National Symphony Orchestra have enabled top-level students from across the country and from many nations to come to the nation’s capital for several weeks of study with NSO musicians.  These participants, selected from a competitive pool of applicants, come from a variety of backgrounds, some currently enrolled in music conservatories such as [[Juilliard]] and others still completing high school.

{{Anchor|AR}}Another important project is the National Symphony Orchestra American Residencies for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This venture encompasses sharing all elements of classical symphonic music with a specific region of the United States, exploring the diversity of musical influences, and giving the region a musical voice in the nation’s center for the performing arts through exchanges, training programs, and commissions. Established in 1992, the project has taken the NSO to fifteen states.

In November 2004, the orchestra announced the conclusion of Slatkin's NSO directorship in 2008.  One report spoke of tensions between the conductor and the orchestra, and mentioned criticisms of Slatkin's programming and rehearsal styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57371-2004Nov17.html?sub=AR |title=Slatkin, NSO to Part in 2008 | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page | date=2004-11-18 | accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the 2006–2007 season, [[Iván Fischer]] became the principal guest conductor of the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/features/article/5442.html | title=Q&amp;A: Iván Fischer | work=Playbill Arts | author= |date=2006-10-19 | accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/11/AR2007021101509.html | title=Ivan Fischer: Plays Well With Children | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page | date=2007-02-12  |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 April 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of Fischer as the orchestra's principal conductor as of the 2008–2009 season, for two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041201612.html?hpid=moreheadlines | title=NSO Picks Fischer as Interim Maestro | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page | date=2007-04-12 | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/6310.html | title=Iván Fischer Appointed Principal Conductor of DC's National Symphony Orchestra | work=Playbill Arts | date=2007-04-12 | accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 25, 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of [[Christoph Eschenbach]] as the orchestra's sixth music director, effective with the 2010–2011 season, for an initial contract of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504161.html?hpid=topnews | title=Christoph Eschenbach to Lead National Symphony | work=Washington Post| author=Anne Midgette | date=2008-09-25 | accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, the orchestra extended Eschenbach's contract through the 2014–2015 season, and in March 2014, his contract was extended through the 2016–2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/kennedy-center-extends-eschenbachs-contract-new-organ-in-works/2011/09/25/gIQAswnQxK_story.html | title=Kennedy Center extends Eschenbach's contract; new organ in works | work=Washington Post | author=Anne Midgette | date=2011-09-25 | accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://web.kennedy-center.org/~/media/Files/KC/Press%20Releases/press%20release%20NSO%20and%20Kennedy%20Center%20Extend%20Christoph%20Eschenbachs%20contract%20through%20August%202017.pdf | title=Christoph Eschenbach Extends Contract as Music Director of the National Symphony Orchestra and Kennedy Center Through the 2016-2017 Season | work=Kennedy Center Press Release | date=2014-03-24 | accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2015, the NSO announced the scheduled conclusion of Eschenbach's tenure as NSO music director at the end of the 2016-2017 season, at which time he is scheduled to become the NSO's conductor laureate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2015/02/18/eschenbachs-nso-contract-to-end-in-2017-will-become-conductor-laureate/ | title=Eschenbach’s NSO contract to end in 2017; will become conductor laureate | work=Washington Post | author=Anne Midgette | date=2015-02-18 | accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Gianandrea Noseda]] first guest-conducted the NSO, and returned in November 2015 for an additional guest engagement.  In January 2016, the NSO announced the appointment Noseda as its next music director, effective with the 2017–2018 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anne Midgette | title=National Symphony Orchestra names rising star Gianandrea Noseda as music director | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-symphony-orchestra-names-rising-star-gianandrea-noseda-as-music-director/2016/01/04/e3f055c8-b2b9-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html | work=The Washington Post | date=2016-01-04 | accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is to serve as music director-designate in the 2016-2017 season, and his initial contract as music director is for 4 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://web.kennedy-center.org/~/media/Files/KC/Press%20Releases/January%202016%20Releases/GIANANDREANOSEDANAMEDNATIONALSYMPHONYORCHESTRAMUSICDIRECTOR?_ga=1.156840187.1975559029.1452359132 | title=Gianandrea Noseda Named Music Director of the National Symphony Orchestra | work=Kennedy Center Press Release | date=2016-01-04 | accessdate=2016-01-09 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127025035/http://web.kennedy-center.org/~/media/Files/KC/Press%20Releases/January%202016%20Releases/GIANANDREANOSEDANAMEDNATIONALSYMPHONYORCHESTRAMUSICDIRECTOR?_ga=1.156840187.1975559029.1452359132 | archivedate=2016-01-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2018, the NSO announced the extension of Noseda's contract through the 2024-2025 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anne Midgette | title=Noseda extends NSO contract; will stay through 2024-2025 season | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/noseda-extends-nso-contract-will-stay-through-2024-2025-season/2018/09/22/3c6f0a5e-bddf-11e8-be70-52bd11fe18af_story.html | work=The Washington Post | date=2018-09-23 | accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native American fashion''' (also known as '''Indigenous American fashion''') encompasses the [[Fashion design|design]] and creation of high-fashion [[clothing]] and [[fashion accessories]] by the Native peoples of the [[Americas]]. Indigenous designers frequently incorporate [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] and customary materials into their wearable artworks, providing a basis for creating items for the ''[[haute couture]]'' and international fashion markets. Their designs may result from techniques such as [[beadwork]], [[quillwork]], [[leather crafting|leather]], and [[Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas|textile arts]], such as weaving, twining, and tufting. In some cases, however, they choose not to include any materials associated with indigenous cultures.

In the United States, in accordance with the [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]], in order to qualify as Native American designers, artists must be enrolled in a [[State recognized tribes in the United States|state]] or [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized tribe]] or be certified by a specified tribal council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html|title=Indian Arts and Crafts Board: The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990|date=2006-09-25|access-date=2018-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020543/http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html|archivedate=2006-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, there are no specific laws to protect [[First Nations]] iconography and traditional arts, though two [[trademark]]s, "igloo tag"  and "Genuine Cowichan Approved" have been registered to protect [[Inuit]] peoples and clothing designs for the [[Cowichan Tribes]]. In [[Latin America]] legislation is sparse, but some countries or individual states within countries with high indigenous populations have passed laws to protect indigenous heritage and design.

When Native American designers first broke into the modern fashion industry in the 1950s, they adopted a [[pan-Indian]] approach. By selecting motifs and iconography easily identified as part of indigenous culture, they were able to gain acceptance and develop a [[market share]] with mainstream buyers. As the field of Native designers in high fashion expanded, individual designers moved away from pan-Indianism, expressing their individual identity, whether or not it was based on their traditional tribal heritage. Many have taken traditional themes and incorporated them into their works, while others have taken specific garments and updated them to contemporary aesthetics by changing necklines, sleeve lengths, hemlines and other features.

Controversy has emerged over the misappropriation or inappropriate use of cultural heritage by non-Native designers. Respectful use of imagery by mainstream designers who are not indigenous can help expand appreciation of Native cultures, but plagiarism of design or  malapropos use reinforces negative stereotypes and spurs controversy. Similarly, utilizing artisan craftwork can expand awareness if designers are fairly compensated for their work and given credit for their contributions. Contemporary controversies have spurred both crowd-sourced and legislative action to protect the designs and cultural heritage of indigenous designers.

==History==
Historical clothing of Native American peoples has been collected and displayed by curators of major museums, such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], with a focus on pre-20th century attire. For the most part, these collections failed to take into consideration the shift in clothing trends among indigenous peoples brought about by [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation policies]] or by access to tailoring training and industrially produced textiles.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=66–67}}

While Native peoples have always produced clothing, until the twentieth century the garments they made were for personal or ceremonial use.{{sfn|Lieber|2016}} In 1942, the American [[anthropologist]] [[Frederic H. Douglas]], sought to highlight the beauty of Native American fashion by presenting a [[fashion show]] featuring garments made by Native Americans between 1830 and 1950.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=66–68}} During the same decade, [[Lloyd Kiva New]], a [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] who had graduated from the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] began touring throughout Europe and the United States with clothing and [[Fashion accessory|accessory]] lines he had designed, using hand-[[Weaving|woven]] and [[Dyeing|dyed]] fabrics and [[Leather crafting|leather crafts]]. In 1945, New opened a studio in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], with financial backing from Douglas,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=69}} which initially focused on belts, hats and purses. Influenced by [[Navajo]] [[medicine bag]]s, his purses, decorated with [[Jewellery|hand-worked metals]] became a specialty.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=80–81}} Recognizing the need to reduce labor costs, he began combining machine work with handcrafting and instituted an [[apprenticeship]] program to meet increasing production demands while gearing his designs for the up-scale market.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=82}}

Gaining coverage from national magazines like ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'', New began selling his bags at the [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.|Elizabeth Arden Salon]] and [[Neiman Marcus]].{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=84}} Expanding into clothing with a focus on classic cuts and simple designs using quality materials, New incorporated woven Cherokee fabrics, [[beadwork|bead-]] and [[Native American jewelry|silver-work]] into a line of coats and dresses for women and men's suits,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=85-86}} capitalizing on the luxury clothing market which emerged after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=87}} "Southwestern chic" became a national trend in the early 1950s.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=89}} In 1951, New was the only Native American designer who participated in the Atlantic City International Fashion Show, winning national recognition.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=91}} He began to consult with artists and incorporated [[silk screen]]ed fabrics using native motifs, such as [[Pima people|Pima]] [[basket weaving]] designs, [[Hopi]] [[Puebloans#Pottery|pottery]] patterns, [[Navajo]] and [[Zuni]] [[Yeii|yei elements]], drawing from a variety of tribal aesthetics. As with designers who followed him, his sacred symbols and [[iconography]] were modified to become secularized.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=37, 96–97}}

To encourage other indigenous artists to enter fashion design and safeguard cultural traditions which he feared might be lost,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=102}} in 1959 New turned his attention to education, sponsoring a summer design project, known as the Southwest Indian Arts Project. The experimental project eventually resulted in the founding by New and other artists of the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]] (IAIA) in 1962.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=108, 113}} The purpose of the school was to provide an education which fostered pride in students' indigenous heritage and featured the development of skills designed to improve their economic opportunities.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=132–133}} New taught a printed textiles course focused on dying techniques, and [[Azalea Thorpe]] (Cherokee) taught weaving.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=133}} [[Josephine Myers-Wapp]] ([[Comanche]]) was hired to instruct students in the traditional techniques used to make garments and accessories, laying the groundwork for the aesthetic appreciation of tribal traditions.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=136}} She taught students to use traditional materials like feathers, leather and shells, and methods including beadwork, [[ribbonwork]] and weaving to create garments.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=155–156}} By 1965, IAIA was hosting local fashion shows and within three years, the students had begun showing their works in other venues in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and New York.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=139–140}} Within ten years, the reputation of the textile design programs at the school had gained international acclaim.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=147}}
[[File:Gilberto_Ortiz.jpg|alt=Gilberto Ortiz in 2015.|left|thumb|Gilberto Ortiz in 2015.]]

In Mexico, before 1950 many indigenous communities were isolated and produced their own traditional clothing. As roads improved and people began moving from the countryside to cities, many put aside their traditional clothing, to blend in with their new cosmopolitan neighbors.{{sfn|Gómez|2011}} In 1965, [[Gilberto Ortiz]] ([[Mixtec]]) moved from [[San Andrés Lagunas]], Oaxaca, to [[Mexico City]] and began training as a tailor under German businessman, José Schroeder. Acquiring traditional European styling, his first major client was movie icon, [[María Félix]]. In 1978, Ortiz left Schroeder and partnered with the Italian businessman, Edmundo Calanchini. He designed mainly for businessmen and politicians until 1997, when he opened his own shop aimed specifically at the haute couture market. In 2006, at the suggestion of his client [[Juan Gabriel]], Ortiz launched his own label, ''Gioros'', an acronym using the first two letters of each of his names, Gilberto Ortiz Osorio. In 2012, he was named one of the top three tailors in the world by the textile firm [[Scabal]]. Typically Ortiz produces classically-styled garments using high-end fabrics, but his latest offering in 2017 featured men's and women's jeans.{{sfn|Martínez|2014}}{{sfn|Kemchs|2017}}{{sfn|''El Diario de Chihuahua''|2017}}

In the 1960s, [[Frankie Welch]] (self-identified [[List of people of self-identified Cherokee ancestry|Eastern Cherokee]] descent) began working as a fashion consultant to Washington's elite. After purchasing goods others made for her clients, she decided to capitalize on the rapport she had built and opened a store in 1963 at 305 Cameron St. in [[Old Town Alexandria|Old Town]]. Most noted for scarves, such as her [[Cherokee syllabary]] design, she supplied [[List of First Ladies of the United States|First Ladies]] [[Pat Nixon]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Rosalynn Carter]], and [[Nancy Reagan]] with accessories. Welch also created dresses for the First Ladies, including a 1974 brocade gown for Betty Ford which was part of the 2016 ''Native Fashion Now'' tour. The green silk gown, which she also designed for Ford, is on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s First Ladies' Hall in the [[National Museum of American History]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1990}}{{sfn|Metcalfe|2012a}}{{sfn|Indursky|2017}}

During the 1970s, other Native American designers began to make a name for themselves during the [[1970s in Western fashion|Indian and Natural movements]], such as Jewel Gilham ([[Blackfeet]]) and Remonia Jacobsen ([[Otoe]]-[[Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma|Iowa]]).{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=199}} Gilham catered to working women, designing [[pantsuit]]s and long dresses made of polyester fabrics with felt insets depicting geometric figures and native motifs.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=199}}{{sfn|''The Missoulian''|1973|p=5}}{{sfn|''The Daily Inter Lake''|1977|p=14}} Jacobsen's work featured loose-fitting dresses featuring decorative techniques, such as embroidered [[ribbonwork]] in the Otoe and Iowa style, [[appliqué]] drawing on [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma|Seminole]] traditions, [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] [[leggings]] patterned on Kiowa designs, as well as influences from Pueblo and Sioux decorative silhouettes.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=214}} Fueled by the [[American Indian Movement|American Indian]] and [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Counterculture|countercultural consumers]] found appeal in Gilham and Jacobsen's work. Furthermore, their fashion fostered a [[Pan-Indianism|pan-Indian]] unity in the quest for political power through self-expression.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=216}}

==1975 to 1990==
When Josephine Wapp retired in 1975, [[Sandy Fife Wilson]] ([[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Muscogee]]) took over instruction of her traditional techniques course and offered "Traditional and Contemporary Fashion Design" to include current fashion trends.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=151}}{{sfn|Brown|2016}} Fife's students formed the Full Moon Fashions group and began targeting non-native women as prospective buyers for their products.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=152}} In 1982, when [[Wendy Ponca]] ([[Osage Nation|Osage]]){{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=86}} took over the fashion design courses at the IAIA, she renamed them [[fiber art]]s in accordance with other accredited university curricula, offering three levels of instruction.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=159}} She founded the Waves of the Earth Fashion Group and required her students to participate in the fashion shows of the IAIA, giving them an opportunity to show their creations and discover how to market their works.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=161–162}} Ponca changed the direction of Native American fashion{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=159}} by allowing the designers to determine whether their works would include traditional influences and media.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=160}} She taught them garment design, structural integrity, and color theory, but allowed students to interpret how they used the lessons.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=160-161}} Ponca's approach was to ignore demands to make designs fit stereotypical definitions of indigenous identity. Instead she encouraged creativity{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=165}} and innovation, like utilizing [[mylar]], a space-age material to create designs which reflected the Osage connection with the sky.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=169}}

The fashion show of the [[Santa Fe Indian Market]], hosted for nearly two decades by fashion expert, [[Jeri Ah-be-hill]] ([[Kiowa]]), quickly became another venue to showcase the students' work,{{sfn|Haywood|2015}}{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=165}} using the body as a venue to display designs, rather than galleries.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=165}} ''Native Uprising'', initially called ''Native Influx'' was founded in the 1980s as a collaborative association of indigenous artists, designers, and models, who were alumni of IAIA, with the express purpose of building a contemporary, Native fashion design movement and allowing members to profit from their fashion shows.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=177–179}} With New as an advisor and Ponca as the coordinator, the group included many members who made a name for themselves in fashion, for example [[Marcus Amerman]] ([[Choctaw]]), who acted as the stage director{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=180, 258}} and [[RoseMary Diaz]] ([[Santa Clara Pueblo]]), who majored in fashion design and creative writing, before turning to writing about fashion.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=163}}

In 1981, [[Margaret Wood (fashion designer)|Margaret Wood]] ([[Navajo Nation|Navajo]]/[[Seminole]]) of Arizona, known for fashion design as well as for her [[quilt]]s,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2016|pp=126–128}} published ''Native American Fashion: Modern Adaptations of Traditional Designs''.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=217}} The book was the first treatment of contemporary Native American fashion and remains the sole in-depth treatment of the subject.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=218}} Also in the 1980s, indigenous designers like Luanne Belcourt ([[Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation|Chippewa-Cree]]) and Myrtle Raining Bird (Chippewa-Cree) operated their company ''Sitting Eagles'', marketing custom-made garments on their reservation to high-end buyers.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=228–229}} [[Jeanette Ferrara]] ([[Isleta Pueblo]]) opened a design studio known for coats and vests incorporating cotton, wool, and velvet, and [[Ardina Moore]] ([[Quapaw]]-[[Osage Nation|Osage]]) founded ''Buffalo Sun'' in Oklahoma in 1983.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=228}} [[Geraldine M. Sherman|Geraldine Sherman]] ([[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Lakota]]) designed for non-native marketer and anthropologist [[Helene Hagan]] to produce garments featuring Native American iconography.

Healthcare professional and fashion designer, [[Marjorie Bear Don't Walk]] ([[Chippewa]]-[[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Salish]]) designed high-end couture for working women and displayed her fashions featuring appliqué techniques at conferences. Shed ran a [[mail order]] business, allowing customers to provide her with their preferred materials which she then worked into her designs.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=233}} In 1984, [[Selina Curley]] ([[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|Apache]]-Navajo) founded a design firm, Traditions by Selina, aimed at preserving the traditions of her heritage. Her typical designs are based on the Apache camp dress with a full, ankle-length skirt and long sleeves.{{sfn|Silversmith|2013}}{{sfn|Walker|2013}}

The [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]], located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, hosted ''Talking Threads: Contemporary Native American Fashions'' in 1986. The exhibit featured designs by [[Joyce Begay-Foss]] (Navajo), Loretta Tah-Martin ([[Plains Apache|Apache]]-[[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca]]) and [[Michelle Tsosie Naranjo]] (Santa Clara-Navajo-[[Laguna Pueblo]]-Mission), among others.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=230}} The following year, the [[Red Earth Festival]] was established in [[Oklahoma City]], showcasing creations by non-native designer [[Michael Kors]], along with [[Phyllis Fife]] (Muscogee), to demonstrate that Native clothing was part of mainstream fashion. Fife was part of a group of native designers known as the ''Fashion Drums of Red Earth'', who have made the fashion show of the Red Earth Festival an annual event, demonstrating that native clothing is wearable for every day and not simply as ceremonial costuming.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=231–232}} Also in 1987, [[Patta Joest]] (Choctaw) established her firm Patta LT with the label ''Dancing Rabbit'', to create high-fashion, producing contemporary garments with design elements from [[Southeastern Woodland]] tribal heritage. They included Cherokee tear dresses and [[Seminole patchwork]] vests, incorporating features such as [[Plains Tribes]]-style beadwork. Her line also included innovative bras and [[lingerie]] as well as [[broomstick skirt]]s.{{sfn|Baca|1999|pp=52–53}}

The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]]. It specified that for artists to market their works as Native American, they must be enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe or be certified by a tribal council as a member and must disclose their affiliated tribe.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=16}} The law aimed to curtail the misappropriation of Native American designs by non-Natives wishing to capitalize on the indigenous market. For indigenous Americans, their symbols, such as the [[War bonnet|headdress]] have ceremonial and sacred properties. Inappropriate use of such objects, like the 2014 ''[[Next Top Model]]'' use of the headdress for non-Native models and its use in Dallas by [[Chanel]] for their ''Métiers d'Art'' show, were all too frequent occurrences. Though the law made it illegal to sell items by those not affiliated as a tribe member, little could be done when designs, symbols, or names were usurped. The law, written to protect the tribes and their cultures as a whole, does not cover individuals, with the result that there is no protection for the works of fashion designers. As part of their tribal tradition, symbols of various tribes are not typically [[trademarked]], but one exception is the name "Navajo", which was legally trademarked in 1943.{{sfn|Lieber|2016}}

Soon after the change to US law, public debate in Canada over protection of intellectual property rights became a media topic. There are no Canadian laws which specifically protect against cultural appropriation. The government utilizes international agreements to uphold their fiduciary responsibility to First Nations. As in the US, laws cover communities as a whole and not individual copyright and it is difficult for indigenous peoples to prevent misappropriation of their names and symbols. Most protections that exist are to protect economic rather than heritage rights. In two cases, trademarks have been obtained to protect Native artists. Since 1959, the "igloo tag" may be used only by [[Inuit]] people to protect their works. The [[Cowichan Tribes|Cowichan Band Council]] has registered "Genuine Cowichan Approved" as a mark specifically for clothing designs.{{sfn|Udy|2015}}

==1991–2010==
The 1990s saw a split in the Native American fashion design styles, with one group pursuing simple silhouettes with defined, smooth transitions between fabric lines, while the other group focused on [[avant-garde]] indigenous couture. Among those who favored classic, clean-lines were [[Betty David]] ([[Spokane Tribe|Spokane]]),{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}} known for her [[shearling coat]]s;{{sfn|Phinney|2005}} [[Dorothy Grant]] ([[Haida people|Haida]]),{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}} who trained at [[Vancouver]]'s Helen Lefeaux School of Fashion Design and whose work includes images of flora and fauna of the [[Pacific Northwest]], [[formline art]] and basketry designs;{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Deerchild|2016}} and [[Penny Singer]] (Navajo),{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}} who added photographic images on fabric to her traditional men's and women's shirts and accessories decorated with beads and ribbon work.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z043}}{{sfn|López|2007|p=Z074}} [[Virgil Ortiz]] ([[Cochiti Pueblo]]) and Grant were the first Native American fashion designers to exhibit at an event in Manhattan. They held a show together at the Mercedes-Benz [[New York Fashion Week]] in 2009,{{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=84}} though Ortiz's work generally is known as more cutting-edge and noted for incorporating colors, shapes, and symbols from pottery in his fashion design.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z043}} [[Angela DeMontigny]] (Chippewa-Cree-[[Métis]]) of southwestern [[Ontario]], a Canadian First Nation designer, also followed the classic traditional lines, with edgy elements based initially on leather and suede garments before branching into jewelry and accessories.{{sfn|Falcon|2009}}{{sfn|''West of the City Magazine''|2016}}

In 1991, [[D’Arcy J. Moses]] ([[Pehdzeh Ki First Nation|Pehdzeh Ki]]), whose bold colors and designs featuring beaver and other furs were carried in high-end retail stores like [[Holt Renfrew]], Neiman Marcus and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], signed a contract with the Fur Council of Canada to help them improve their image, drawing anger from [[anti-fur]] activists. While the contract provided a steady income, the controversy created a distraction from his work.{{sfn|Busch|2015}}{{sfn|Nadeau|2005|p=186}} Other indigenous designers from the era included the master weaver [[Margaret Roach Wheeler]] ([[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw]]-[[Chickasaw Nation|Chickasaw]]), who earned a master's degree in art at [[Pittsburg State University]] in Kansas, under the tutelage of [[Marjorie Schick]];{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Monks|2016|pp=72–73}} [[Sean McCormick]] (Métis), who began designing [[footwear]] in the early 1990s and in 2008, launched ''Manitobah Mukluks'';{{sfn|Falcon|2009}}{{sfn|Sinopoli|2015}} and [[Virginia Yazzie Ballenger]] (Navajo), New Mexican designer,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Hardin-Burrola|Sarath|Rosebrough|2017|p=122}} most noted for her "fluted broomstick skirt and matching velveteen blouse".{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=237}} Aresta LaRusso founded ''Deerwater Design'' in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in 1994 featuring items made of traditional silk or wool fabrics and deer or elk skin. To update her contemporary patterning, she used zebra and impala hide, decorated with beadwork, fringe and silver.{{sfn|Reid|1999|pp=31,35}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|2002|p=78}}

Wendy Ponca, one of the leaders of the avant-garde group, left IAIA in 1993. After she was replaced by [[Pearl Sunrise]] (Navajo), a noted weaver, the fashion curricula at IAIA was eliminated in 1995,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=188, 242}} though momentum for high fashion works produced by native designers was rising.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=190}} Among Ponca's students at IAIA in the 1990s were the designers [[Pilar Agoyo]] ([[Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo]]-[[Cochiti Pueblo]]-[[Kewa Pueblo]]), who worked on costuming for several films, including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008) and [[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]] (2012),{{sfn|Avila|2015}} and [[Patricia Michaels]] ([[Taos Pueblo]]), who went on to take second place in season 11 of ''[[Project Runway]]''.{{sfn|Livingston|2013}} Her women's jacket titled "Weathered Text: No Trespassing by the Taos War Chief." won the Best of Class award in the textiles category at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2010.{{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=86}}  Another of Ponca's students, Brenda Wahnee ([[Comanche]]), developed her own line ''Com-N-Acha'', featuring fashion forward designs. Her works were featured in 2003 at the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] Fest party.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}}{{sfn|Begley|2003}} Tazbah Gaussoin 
([[Picuris Pueblo]]-Navajo), Consuelo Pascual (Navajo-[[Maya peoples|Maya]]), and Rose Bean Simpson (Santa Clara Pueblo) were other Ponca students who began making a name in fashion circles in the 1990s.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=246}}

Since 1995, the [[Canadian Aboriginal Festival]] (CANAB) has hosted a fashion show of [[First Nations]] designers. Dave Jones ([[Garden River First Nation|Garden River Ojibwe]]), began producing an annual fashion show for the Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards (CAMA) in 2001.{{sfn|Willmott|2016|p=187}}{{sfn|Durnan|2013}} By 2008, the CANAB Festival featured six fashion shows, as well as booths for designers to exhibit their wares.{{sfn|Willmott|2016|p=188}} In 1998, the [[Denver Art Museum]] hosted a fashion show, ''Indian Chic'' featuring the works of Dorothy Grant, Wendy Ponca and Margaret Roach Wheeler. It was the first time a major museum had shown works in their collection of indigenous garments, labeling them as "fashion".{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=243}} Other Native designers of the 2000s include [[Orlando Dugi]] (Navajo), [[Dallin Maybee]] ([[Northern Arapaho]]-[[Seneca Nation of Indians|Seneca]]), [[Connie Gaussoin]] (Navajo-[[Picuris Pueblo]]), the street style of [[Douglas Miles]] of Apache Skateboards ([[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos Apache]]-[[Akimel O'odham]]) and the custom shoes of [[Louie Gong]] ([[Nooksack people|Nooksack]]-[[Squamish Nation|Squamish]]).{{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=85}} Dugi is self-taught in fashion, learning to sew, measure and create patterns from online resources.{{Sfn|Bennett-Begaye|2015|p=95}} [[Jamie Okuma]] ([[Luiseño]]-[[Fort Hall Indian Reservation|Shoshone-Bannock]]), another self-taught artist, became the youngest person to earn the Best of Show ribbon at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2000.{{sfn|Grinberg|2013}}{{sfn|Indyke|2001}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/arts-entertainment/native-american-fashions-best-of-the-best-hit-the-runway-in-santa-fe-30-photos/|title=Native American Fashion's Best of the Best Hit the Runway in Santa Fe [30 Photos] – Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the turn of the 21st century, there has been a resurgence in [[Latin America]] for indigenous designs. The trend has been to partner with indigenous communities of [[artisans]] to create fabrics for non-native designers.{{sfn|Aconcha|2014}}{{sfn|Resnik|2016}}{{sfn|Castellanos Usigli|2016}}{{sfn|Campos L.|2016}}{{sfn|Contacto Hoy|2017}} In many countries, the indigenous heritage is seen as part of the national identity and there was little recognition that the design elements non-Native designers used and modified were part of the intellectual property of indigenous communities. Designers often used remnants of textiles or cut out embroidery on one garment to use on another. Imitations of indigenous designs were ordered from labor markets in Asia. After 2010, the trend began to change with slow recognition that original indigenous designs and designers should be respected.{{sfn|Gómez|2011}} One innovator in this period was Franklin Janeta ([[Puruhá]]), of [[Riobamba]], Ecuador, who began working as an [[embroidery]] artisan as a child, and in 2000 opened Vispu, a store to market his designs. Modifying traditional clothing styles, he altered components like [[necklines]] and sleeve length to create more contemporary fashions.{{sfn|''El Telégrafo''|2017}} Around the same time, [[Eliana Paco Paredes]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]) of Bolivia began to design fashions based on the traditional costumes of the ''[[Cholo#Bolivia|cholitas]]'', using wool or [[Aguayo (cloth)|aguayo]] fabrics, but fusing them with lace or silk and decorating them with rhinestones and sequins. In 2016, after showing her work at Bolivian Fashion Week, she was invited to participate in New York Fashion Week.{{sfn|''Prensa Libre''|2016}}

In 2005, the IAIA with support from the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation]], sponsored ''Tribal Fusions'', as a cross-cultural fashion endeavor, uniting designers from Africa with Marcus Amerman, Dorothy Grant, Patricia Michaels and Virginia Yazzie Ballenger for the annual fashion show at the Santa Fe Indian Market. It was a unique opportunity for designers from diverse indigenous populations to share designs and methods of economic empowerment.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=258}} In 2009, [[Jessica Metcalfe]] ([[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians|Chippewa]]), a scholar who earned her doctorate from the University of Arizona, created a fashion [[blog]] called "Beyond Buckskin".{{sfn|Ross|2017}} Metcalfe used the blog to promote Native American designers, to talk about how they fit into popular culture and also to hold companies accountable when they attempted to appropriate Native culture.{{sfn|Grinberg|2013}} The following year, Patricia Michaels formed ''UNRESERVED Alliance'', in an attempt to ensure that Native American fashion designers were represented at [[New York Fashion Week]].{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=263}} Similarly to Native Uprising founded two decades previously, the collective of designers aimed through collaboration to improve inclusion of indigenous artists.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=339}}

[[File:Santa_Fe_Indian_Market_Fashion_show_2014.jpg|thumb|Santa Fe Indian Market Fashion show 2014]]
As Native American designers recognized that marketing to indigenous peoples alone limited their business sustainability, they increasingly created clothing which is derived from their cultural heritage but has been adapted to appeal to a larger aesthetic. Early designers tended to approach fashion from a pan-Indian perspective, but contemporary indigenous designers often "stay within the realm of their own traditional tribal or regional clothing techniques".{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=354}} In 2012, Kelly Holmes ([[Cheyenne River Lakota]]), a former model, founded ''[[Native Max]]'', "the first Native American fashion magazine".{{sfn|Lieber|2016}} Jessica Metcalf ([[Turtle Mountain Chippewa]]), who wrote the "Beyond Buckskin" blog opened a fashion boutique in [[Gardena, North Dakota]], that same year.{{sfn|Ross|2017}} Metcalfe, along with photographer Anthony Thosh Collins and designer [[Bethany Yellowtail]] ([[Northern Cheyenne]]-[[Crow Nation|Crow]]) created a compilation of fashion called ''Beyond Buckskin Lookbook'' which she says is the "first compilation of modern Native fashion produced exclusively by Natives".{{sfn|Grinberg|2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-bethany-yellowtail-los-angeles-designer-20170609-htmlstory.html|title=Meet Bethany Yellowtail, a Native American fashion designer who's inspiring a whole generation of women|last=Paniogue|first=Tara|work=latimes.com|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ecuador]], [[Lucía Guillín]] ([[Puruhá]]) launched ''Churandy'' featuring the dress styles of indigenous Andes communities with contemporary modifications in 2012. Her clothing lines have expanded to include blouses, jackets and shorts featuring embroidery patterns and colors typical to the region.{{sfn|Alvarado|2015}} The same year, Sisa Morocho (Puruhá) also launched her design company ''Sumak Churay'' in [[Quito]], after studying fashion at the Ana MacAulife Institute. Her father's death had prompted her to leave the family hat business and branch out on her own. Using motifs from the Puruhá culture and adorning them with beads, embroidery and sequins on brightly colored fabrics, she first sold blouses and then became known for dresses. In 2015, Morocho was able to open a second store featuring her designs in Riobamba.{{sfn|Márquez|2017}}{{sfn|Mendieta T.|2017}} In 2013, [[Victoria Kakuktinniq]] (Inuit) founded ''Victoria's Arctic Fashion'' to market her designs. She creates fur and leather winterwear goods including headbands, jackets, [[gloves]] and [[parkas]], using sealskin and decorated with fox cuffs and embroidery.{{sfn|''Indian Country Today''|2017}}{{sfn|Tamoto|2013}} In 2015 Kakuktinniq won the Business of the Year award from the Nunavut annual trade show.{{sfn|Zerehi|2016}}

The Italian designing firm, [[Ermenegildo Zegna]], opened a fashion institute in 2016, in the [[Azcapotzalco]] neighborhood of [[Mexico City]] with the goal of teaching the techniques of design to indigenous women. Students enrolled were members of the [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomí]], [[Purépecha]], [[Trique people|Triqui]] and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] ethnic groups. The training the women received focused on [[tailoring]] techniques rather than on native design elements in an effort to allow the women to move from craftwork into the high fashion market.{{sfn|Hernández|2016}} That same year, Nala Peter (Inuit) began making sealskin bras and [[panties]] at the suggestion of her partner, marketing them on line and was invited to participate in the ''Floe Edge: Contemporary Art and Collaborations'' exhibition in [[Nunavut]]. Another exhibitor at the show was Nicole Camphaug (Inuit), who designs footwear with sealskin and fur heals and vamps.{{sfn|McCue|2016}}{{sfn|''Indian Country Today''|2017}}
 
In 2016, a major traveling exhibit, "Native Fashion Now," which traveled to venues from the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], to [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], to the [[Portland Art Museum]] in Oregon to the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[George Gustav Heye Center|National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Manhattan]], put the spotlight on contemporary Native American fashion. Featuring designs from 75 fashion designers from throughout Canada and the United States, the exhibit presented a range of styles and designs from diverse cultures, such as Alano Edzerza ([[Tahltan Nation]]), [[Maya Stewart]] (Chickasaw-Muscogee-Choctaw) and Bethany Yellowtail (Northern Cheyenne-Crow), among others.{{sfn|Lieber|2016}}{{Sfn|Lefevre|2016|p=20}} Becki Bitternose (George Gordon), who designs jackets and coats from Pendleton blankets, was featured at the 2016 New York Fashion Week.{{sfn|Latimer|2016}} [[File:Santa_Fe_Indian_Market_fashion_show_2015.jpg|alt=Contemporary Native American Fashion Show at the 2015 Santa Fe Indian Market.|left|thumb|Contemporary Native American Fashion Show at the 2015 Santa Fe Indian Market.]]

Non-Native companies and individuals have attempted to use Native American motifs and names in their clothing designs.{{sfn|Gilger|2011}} As early as the 1940s, Anglo designers in the United States had developed a type of one and two-piece dresses called "[[squaw dress]]es."{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=374-375}} These outfits were based on Mexican and Navajo skirts and Western Apache camp dresses.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=375}} The dresses, also known as Fiesta, Kachina, Tohono or Patio Dresses "represented both idealized femininity and Americanness because of their Native American origins."{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=375}} These dresses, knowingly appropriating Indigenous styles, were considered a "fashion sensation" of the time, according to the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16626059/arizona_daily_star/|title=Even Ike's Mamie Wears Squaw Dresses From Dolores' Shop|last=Roth|first=Bernie|date=1954-10-17|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-17|pages=20|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo style that influenced the creation of Squaw Dresses was itself an adaptation of European styles by Navajo women.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=384}} The bodice of a Squaw Dress drew from Western Apache and Tohono O'odham styles.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=385}} Squaw dresses were popular in the United States for around 20 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arizonasonoranewsservice.com/the-squaw-dress-tucsons-controversial-but-unique-fashion-history/|title=The squaw dress: Tucson’s controversial but unique fashion history|last=Driver|first=Maggie|date=21 April 2016|website=Arizona Sonora News|language=en-US|archive-url=http://arizonasonoranewsservice.com/the-squaw-dress-tucsons-controversial-but-unique-fashion-history/|archive-date=8 January 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original "designer" of the Squaw Dress was [[Dolores Gonzales]] of Tucson, Arizona.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gonzales herself said of her dresses, "I didn't design them; I lifted them. The Indian women were already wearing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16626885/arizona_daily_star/|title='Dior of the Desert'|last=Henry|first=Bonnie|date=1995-02-23|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-17|pages=29|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people involved in promoting and working on the designs included the designers [[Cele Peterson]] and [[George Fine]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Urban Outfitters]] created a collection in 2011 called "Navajo," featuring underwear, hats and other items with art based on traditional [[Navajo weaving|Navajo rugs]]. The [[Navajo Nation]] responded by issuing a cease and desist on their use of the word "Navajo".{{sfn|Gilger|2011}} Pop band [[No Doubt]] released a 2012 video featuring stereotypical images of the [[American frontier]] and ended up pulling the video and issuing an apology.{{sfn|Grinberg|2014}}{{sfn|Sinha-Roy|2012}} [[Victoria's Secret]] clothed a model in a "Native-inspired" bikini and giant war headdress at their fashion show that same year.{{sfn|Bhasin|2015}} Victoria's Secret was again accused of cultural appropriation in their 2017 fashion show, which featured outfits inspired by traditional Native fashion.{{sfn|Matera|2017}}

In 2015, the [[Congress of Oaxaca]] passed legislation to "award Cultural and Intangible Heritage status to the designs, costumes, and handicrafts, as well as the languages spoken by the Indigenous peoples in the state", after a French firm ''Antiquite Vatic'' attempted to claim a copyright on the designs of artisans from the [[Mixe]] community of [[Santa María Tlahuitoltepec]].{{sfn|''Telesur''|2016a}} The following year, indigenous designers from [[Panama]], who were part of the [[Guna people|Ipeti Guna community]], backed by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Trade sought legal action against textile companies who were misappropriating their [[Mola (art form)|molas]], which have governmental protection for the Guna designers as the only "genuine producers" of the cloth.{{sfn|''Telesur''|2016b}} Another action in 2016, found designers in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico, circulating a petition via [[Change.org]] to demand that fashion designers stop plagiarizing their work. The designs from [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] designers from [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]] were misappropriated by the Argentine fashion house ''Rapsodia''.{{sfn|''Telesur''|2016a}}

In 2017, Parisian designer [[Christian Louboutin]] drew criticism for paying [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatec]] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] artisans only 238 pesos (around $13 US) each for bags he sold for around $28,000 pesos (equivalent to $1,550 US). The controversy was sparked when activists called out Louboutin for exploiting the artisans. He paid for all of their materials and paid the workers 478 pesos per day for 6 hours of work, which compares to the average Mexican salary in the region of 80 pesos for 8 hours of work per day. The artisans were thankful for the work and the monies they received, but Louboutin's firm pulled the page advertising the bags from his website.{{sfn|Escobar|Rodríguez|2017}}{{sfn|Fregoso|2017}} That same year, the Peruvian textile company Kuna withdrew a collection after complaints that the company had misappropriated ''kené'' designs from the [[Shipibo-Conibo people]]. The controversy motivated [[Peruvian congress|Congresswoman]] [[Tania Pariona]] to introduce legislation to protect the cultural heritage and symbols of indigenous communities in Peru.{{sfn|''La Vanguardia''|2017}}

Another issue in regard to Native American fashion is the [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] representation of Indigenous peoples' clothing in mass media depictions.{{Sfn|Leavitt|Covarrubias|Perez|Fryberg|2015|p=40}} Native Americans are portrayed most often in historical contexts wearing traditional clothing.{{Sfn|Leavitt|Covarrubias|Perez|Fryberg|2015|p=40}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39443">The '''Nazario Collection''' ({{lang-es|Colección Nazario}}),&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt; also known as '''Agüeybaná's Library''' ({{lang-es|Biblioteca de Agüeybaná|links=no}}),&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; '''Father Nazario's Rocks''' ({{lang-es|Piedras del Padre Nazario|links=no}}),&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; and the '''Phoenician Rocks''' ({{lang-es|Piedras Fenicias|links=no}}), is the name commonly used to describe a cache of carved stones that originated at [[Guayanilla, Puerto Rico]]. According to contemporary accounts, the statuettes made of local serpentine rocks were first discovered by Catholic priest José María Nazario y Cancel during the 19th century, and feature unidentified [[petroglyphs]] that have been speculated to be connected to the [[Old World]] for over 130 years.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt; Their original site was not far from Yauco and was underground, where it was hidden under a slate that concealed a tunnel.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Overwhelmed with the quantity and difficulty of transporting a trove that totaled more than a ton, he opted to abandon his individual approach and recruited locals to aid in the moving of the rocks to his house, where he conducted the first research on them by comparing them to similar objects from other countries.&lt;ref name="Coll"/&gt; Nazario would combine his research with his religious background, leading to the hypothesis that there might be some connection between them and the [[Ten Lost Tribes]].

Due to the ramifications that their authentication would have on mainstream concepts of Pan-American history, the authenticity of the pieces has been in question from the onset, with researchers providing conflicting opinions.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt; Despite this, several foreign archeologists traveled to Puerto Rico in order to study the pieces.&lt;ref name="PLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ENDI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/piedrasantiguasreescribenlahistoria-2173532/|title=Piedras antiguas reescriben la historia|author=Gerardo E. Alvarado León|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''|language=Spanish|date=2016-04-18|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those that inquired on the matter was ethnographer [[Alphonse Pinart]], who examined the pieces and concluded that they were "undoubtedly authentic".&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; The explorer also expressed concern that some people could try to falsify pieces to receive gifts in exchange from them.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;  Locally, historians took an interest in the matter while archeologists did not study them for decades.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; After the death of Nazario, most pieces were kept at the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture]] (ICP), with others being kept by the UPR and foreign institutions in New York, Spain and Paris.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interes"/&gt; During the 1980s, the Collection attracted historian Salvador Tío, who tried to recruit a variety of institutions to the cause of studying the pieces.

During the 2010s, the study of the pieces has been taken by personnel of the archeology department of the [[University of Puerto Rico]] [[University of Puerto Rico at Utuado|at Utuado]]. Head archeologist Reniel Rodríguez decided to follow the scientific method to test several characteristics of the rocks and petroglyphs.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Among these are geological studies, which concluded that the petroglyphs were carved in Puerto Rico and that the rocks were likely not brought from abroad based on the raw materials used, serpentine rocks found near location of the discovery.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Another aspect of Rodríguez's research is based on using high power microscopes to determine the technique and instruments used to make the carvings, thus allowing for the detection of fraud if the tools are found not to have been available during the time.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Preliminary results from this area suggest that the technique used was unlike any of the ones used by the known native groups of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;
A new epigraphic study is also being conducted to determine the precedence of the petroglyphs or their closest parallels.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Preliminary results in this area have found similarities between the petroglyphs and the [[Tifinagh#Origins|Libyco-Berber]] alphabet as recorded in the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Tartessian language]] of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; During this research, Rodríguez has recruited experts from [[Universidad del Turabo]] and [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Additional studies planned include C-14 dating and thermoluminescence tests for burned pieces.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;

==Discovery and relocation==
===Exploration at Río Coayuco===
[[File:José María Nazario y Cancel.jpg|thumb|José M. Nazario in clergical clothing.]]
The discovery of the rocks is attributed to Catholic priest José María Nazario y Cancel, a native of the municipality of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]] that had settled in Guayanilla and had received education at the [[University of Salamanca]] that included, among other things, the study of ancient languages.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;{{efn|Nazario was first appointed priest of Guayanilla in 1866, serving the office for 46 years.&lt;ref name="EVT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvisitante.biz/new/component/content/article/54-tu-revista-es-vida/886-la-gesta-cultural-del-padre-nazario|title=La gesta cultural del padre Nazario|publisher=''El Visitante''|language=Spanish|date=2012-03-08|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his archeological and philosophical research and a particular interest in the influence of the Agüeybaná dynasty in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; Nazario was also an author and published ''Guayanilla y la Historia de Puerto Rico'', in which he analyzed the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] and cited evidence for the likelihood that the municipality was the landing point of this expedition at Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt;}} The popular story of the event was told by the priest to historian [[Adolfo de Hostos]].&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://periodicovision.com/buscan-conocer-origen-de-piedras-del-padre-nazario/|title=Buscan conocer origen de piedras del padre Nazario|publisher=''Periódico Visión''|language=Spanish|date=2015-09-09|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this narrative, sometime during the late 1870s the minister was summoned to the deathbed of a local woman of [[Taíno]] ascent.&lt;ref name="EVT"/&gt; There she, who was aware of Nazario's interest in archeology and native history, decided to reveal the location of a long-hidden collection of artifacts.&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticel.com/noticia/189148/piedras-antiguas-de-guayanilla-podrian-alterar-la-historia-oficial.html|title=Piedras antiguas de Guayanilla podrían alterar la historia oficial|author=Gabriela Saker Jímenez|publisher=[[NotiCel]]|language=Spanish|date=2016-04-16|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge had been covertly passed from generation to generation throughout the centuries, but she decided to reveal it in hopes that the priest would recognize its historical importance and safeguard it from that point on.&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt; With time, the old woman was given the name of "Juana Morales" and was claimed to be "the last descendant" of [[Agüeybaná II]] or Agüeybaná El Bravo, the last ruler of the Puerto Rico natives and military leader during the [[Spanish–Taíno War of San Juan–Borikén]] (from whom the rocks get one of their colloquial namesakes), elements that were not found in the original version.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; There is no record of an elder person by that name dying during the time in the municipality’s records, but there is a local Morales family that lives at Barrio Indio and has its own oral tradition of the events dating back to at least the 1970s.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Nazario then traveled between municipalities until he arrived at a riverside location in what is now speculated to have been the modern barrio Los Indios, reaching a stone slab that was meant as a marker.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; Digging the terrain, the priest found a tunnel and continued rummaging until he reached an alcove within which were more than 800 rocks and stones of varying sizes several of which had anthropomorphic shape, all covered in unknown petroglyphs that did not match any Amerindian civilization known to have lived in Puerto Rico or the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Coll"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cayetano Coll y Toste: Síntesis de estímulos humanos|chapter=El Padre Nazario|author=Edna Coll|publisher=Editorial Universitaria (University of Puerto Rico)|language=Spanish|year=1970|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1880 onwards, the rocks were taken to Nazario's personal house at Guayanilla, not the parochial house, where he kept the other fragments of this finding and several other archeological pieces as part of his collection.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|The structure was worth 250 Spanish pesos and he established an impromptu museum within it.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;}} Nazario gave the people involved in the extraction a modest reward for bringing pieces there.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 1883, [[Agustín Stahl]] and [[Román Baldorioty de Castro]] visited the house and discussed the possibility of creating the Puerto Rico Museum of Natural History.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

===Early research===
Nazario named them ''antropoglifitas'' (hispanized from the Greek "antropōmorphos", which relates to having human-like characteristics, and "gluphē", which refers to carvings) and considered each individual piece a volume in a larger story.&lt;ref name="antropoglifitas"/&gt; In his writings, Nazario stated that they had been found packed in a small area and at a distance that was "not extraordinarily away from Guayanilla", speculating if they had been hidden there to avoid being lost at war (between the local and foreign natives) due to its proximity to the chiefdom of Agüeybaná.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The priest was close to physician and author [[Manuel Zeno Gandía]], with whom he exchanged correspondence and would later join him in a historical debate over the location of Columbus' arrival to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Nazario gave him two pieces of the Collection to him and requested that they were kept safe and close.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 1881, when Zeno Gandía was chosen as representative of the Puerto Rican media in the activities held to commemorate [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]'s second centenary in Spain, he took the pieces to the founder of the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología (Madrid)|Museo Nacional de Antropología]], Pedro González de Velasco, who according to the author insisted in keeping one of them.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; An agreement was reached between both, where the Spaniard accepted naming it after Nazario and gave credit to its discovery in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; This event caused a temporary estrangement between Zeno Gandía and the priest.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; After González de Velasco died the following year, the destination of the piece became unknown.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

The first formal mention of the Collection was made by Alphonse Pinart in 1890, noting that the discovery was made near Yauco, in a place that he identifies as "Hanoa, Puerto Rico", and that some pieces displayed signs of being "undoubtedly authentic", but assumed that unscrupulous people fabricated their own to receive a reward.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; He further noted similarities between the characters in the Collection and known ancient alphabets, but declined speculating further on the matter.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Pinart also embarked some pieces with him to the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]] from which they were moved to the [[Musée du quai Branly]] when the former institution closed down, 38 pieces remain there and form the largest known concentration outside of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Nazario later noted that besides France, other pieces had been taken by the researcher to Copenhagen and Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

In 1893, Nazario wrote a piece named ''Escritura Aborigen de Carib'' (English: "Aboriginal writing of the Carib"), where he detailed his interpretations of the petroglyphs.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|"Carib" was the term used by Nazario when discussing the Taíno.&lt;ref name="antropoglifitas"/&gt;}} Analyzing the inscriptions, he dismissed a Taíno or [[Arawak]] origin and by 1897 had concluded that the carvings were more reminiscent of [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] languages, saying that he recognized some of the characters present.&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elvocero.com/las-piedras-antiguas-de-guayanilla-una-historia-que-puede-cambiar-la-historia/|title=Las piedras antiguas de Guayanilla: una historia que puede cambiar….la historia|author=Ileanexis Vera Rosado|publisher=''[[El Vocero]]''|language=Spanish|date=2016-04-18|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazario also asserted that based on the study of the petroglyphs, it was safe to conclude that the Pre-Columbian inhabitants of Puerto Rico had perfected writing beyond the natives of Mexico or Peru, speculating that the pieces could have been a Pre-Columbian national archive of some kind.&lt;ref name="antropoglifitas"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guayanilla y la historia de Puerto Rico|author=José María Nazario y Cancel|chapter=Prueba directa del arribaje de Colón en Guayanilla, deducidas las huellas de un pueblo caribitano fundado en la Playa. Residencia del cacique Augueybana.|publisher=Impresora de la Revista de Puerto Rico|language=Spanish|year=1893|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazario would then begin an effort to translate the characters phonetically after acquiring a copy of 1889's ''Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea'' (English: "History of the Nations: Chaldea") and using the characters present in a Babylonian religious artifact reproduced there.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The document would be modified and later become known as ''Escritura Fonética de los Indios de Puerto Rico'' (English: "Phonetic orthography of the Indians of Puerto Rico").&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Nazario hypothesized that perceived linguistic similarities could imply that some of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] crossed Asia making their way into the [[Bering Strait]] and traveled from there to North America, before dividing somewhere near Central America, from where they arrived to the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

The conclusions reached by Nazario were met with skepticism by mainstream archeologists who labeled him as "imaginative [and/or] crazy",&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; as it implied contact with the New World prior to Columbus' voyages, and speculation emerged that he had paid a local [[jíbaro]] (a class of Puerto Rican countrymen) to sculpt the stones with a machete and that the petroglyphs were meaningless. In 1894, Nazario met [[Cayetano Coll y Toste]], which whom he had been involved in a number of historical debates, at San Juan.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Both discussed the possibility of the historian aiding in the process of deciphering the characters in the Collection, but the effort was aborted when the condition of sending the pieces to San Juan (to be returned later) was proposed.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; According to historian Otto Sievens, several of the rocks were thrown into a cistern at Guayanilla's church when the Americans arrived during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5172:la-historia-se-reescribe-con-las-piedras-de-guayanilla&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342|title=Piedras de Guayanilla reescriben historia|author=Hector Sánchez|publisher=''[[La Perla del Sur]]''|language=Spanish|date=2013-06-12|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1903, Nazario was holding conferences about the Collection, which were unsuccessful in gaining the desired attention.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

That same year, [[Jesse Walter Fewkes]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], visited Puerto Rico and reportedly offered Nazario $800 to buy the pieces, but the offer was declined.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; In his subsequent report, the anthropologist concluded that the assemblage was the most intricate one among those that gathered native petroglyphs in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Fewkes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofbu0v25powe/annualreportofbu0v25powe_djvu.txt|title=Annual report of the Bureau of ethnology to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution|author=John Wesley Powell|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his examination of the carvings Fewkes also commented that the inscriptions were not Amerindian in origin and labeled them as "exotic", leading to an assumption that they may not be ancient.&lt;ref name="Fewkes"/&gt; In his field notes, Fewkes notes that he was unable to find Nazario during a first visit in 1902, returning the following year.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; He also stated that the entire Collection was under a roof, that the pieces were classified by priority, and that the priest gave him his writings (which he discarded as not being authored by a scientist).&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Despite his skepticism, Fewkes took some pieces with him, which he placed in an exhibit along pieces of dubious origin at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] based on his initial assessment.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; This led to unrelated American archeologists assuming that the rocks were a forgery, discontinuing their investigation for several decades.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; Influenced by their foreign peer, local archeologists also lost interest in the Collection and stopped their inquiry for decades.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;

In an interview held in 1905, the priest showed ''Escritura Fonética de los Indios de Puerto Rico'' to journalist Gabriel A. Piles and discussed hypotheses about the arrival of Old World travelers as well as his efforts to translate the characters using ''Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea''.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Between 1911 and 1912, Nazario was transferred to San Juan while facing health issues. After being relocated, the priest had the Collection moved to the capital and kept it in his room.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 1908, Nazario wrote to Zeno Gandía informing him that a letter from Pinart had arrived, in the process making a throwaway remark noting that "it was almost incredible that 28 years [had already passed since their first meeting]", which would later allow to date the philologist's visit to 1880 and placed the original date of discovery sometime during the late 1870s.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|Nazario had been moved away from Guayanilla for some time, so the discovery had to take place between his return to the office in 1875 and Pinart's visit in 1880.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;}} During this decade, [[Samuel Kirkland Lothrop]] visited Puerto Rico and took some pieces.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Archeologist [[Adolfo de Hostos]] visited Nazario in San Juan, where he was told the now-popular origin story.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Taking some pieces with him, Hostos was still not convinced that the Collection (which at this point he estimates rounds the 700 pieces) possessed cuneiform characters, but still felt that it required detailed study.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; With the death of Nazario in 1919, the pieces became segregated, with only around 250 being acquired by collector Robert Junhans and later preserved at the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture]].&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interes"/&gt; The first pieces arrived there during the 1950s, where they were placed in storage.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The pieces in Hostos possession were granted to the University of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; These were relocated to the Museo de Historia, Antropología y Arte at Río Piedras.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The ones owned by Lothrop were sent to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]].&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Alice de Santiago, a school teacher from Barceloneta, reportedly found a piece that was similar to those in possession of Nazario but made in limestone and contacted Zeno Gandía.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The current whereabouts of this rock are unknown.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

A number of writings authored by Nazario where later recovered by Zeno Gandía, who republished them in ''[[El Imparcial]]'' and claimed that he had seen Martin J. Berntsen of the Dominican priests of Bayamon taking some of the documents once his friend died, with the documents later being found by a priest in the parochial archives there.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The origin story was first published by Hostos more than three decades later in 1955, having already deviated slightly from its original account by integrating elements related to the adaptation of the account to then-concurrent concepts.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZECSNhTyhU&amp;app=desktop|title=Reniel Rodríguez Ramos: Piedras Padre Nazario|publisher=Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe (official YouTube channel)|language=Spanish|date=2016-05-22|accessdate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he discussed a booklet filled with notes from Nazario being the last known person to be see the lost document.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

==Media exposure==
===Late 20th century===
In 1969, Hostos sent one of the pieces to the [[British Museum]] so that it could be studied by scholar C.B.F. Walker, author of a number of books on cuneiform writing.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Afterwards, Walker responded with an assessment that it possessed characteristics similar to pieces recorded circa 2000 B.C. and that it could be Sumerian in origin.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; During the 1980s, the president of the ''Academia Puertorriqueña de la Historia'' (English: "Puerto Rican Academy of History") Aurelio Tió revived the debate surrounding the pieces and began insisting on the thorough study of the inscriptions, citing that the idea that they were randomly inscribed with a machete was implausible.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; This historian dismissed the prevailing conclusions surrounding the rocks, noting that too much emphasis had been given to Fewkes' insinuation and that, despite the lack of formal studies by the anthropologist, it had somehow become widely accepted among local archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Boletín de la Academia Puertorriqueña de la Historia, vol. 6|chapter=Las antropoglifitas del Padre Nazario y su possible relación con el predominio del cacicazgo de Guaybana|author=Aurelio Tío|publisher=Academia Puertorriqueña de la Historia|date=Jul 1980|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tío argued that if authenticated, the Collection could potentially represent one of the biggest archeological finds in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere, a position that he defended until his death.&lt;ref name="Interes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/cultura/nota/altointeresporlaspiedrasantiguasdeguayanilla-2194592/|title=Alto interés por las piedras antiguas de Guayanilla|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''|language=Spanish|date=2016-05-03|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt; He unsuccessfully tried encouraging the Smithsonian, [[Harvard University]], [[University of Valladolid]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[British Museum]] and archeologist Marcel Sigrist to retake the study of the pieces.&lt;ref name="PLP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5154:aunque-muchos-lo-nieguen-ila-clave-esta-en-guayanilla&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105093402/http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5154:aunque-muchos-lo-nieguen-ila-clave-esta-en-guayanilla&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342|title=Guayanilla: pieza clave de nuestra historia|author=Hector Sánchez|publisher=''[[La Perla del Sur]]''|language=Spanish|date=2013-06-05|archivedate=2003-11-05|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Tío wrote over 30 papers on the Collection evaluating its potential significance to local history and the possible influence on the Taíno population, which did not receive academic examination or rebuttals from the archeological community.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt; He also commissioned a professional photographer to capture the first high quality images of the pieces, which were to be re-published in the media.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Linguists from Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and France were  involved in the issue, with the latter concluding that they could be legitimate.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt;

===Phoenician hypothesis===
Despite not meeting with immediate success, the attempt to bring the topic to the mainstream did gather the interest of peripheral groups such as the Midwestern Epigraphic Society, which considered the pieces authentic in a report and established parallels between the symbols present in the petroglyphs and similar inscriptions present in cooper and gold slabs recovered in Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Fell"&gt;{{cite book|title=Epigraphic Society Occasional Publications, Vol. 16|author=Barry Fell|chapter=Inscribed Stone Artifacts from Guayanilla, Puerto Rico|publisher=Midwestern Epigraphic Society|year=1987|pages=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Barry Fell]] concluded that the inscriptions were not random, and that the characters correspond to Pre-Greek characters found in Cyprus, Turkey and Crete, rearranged so that they would be phonetically read in Pre-Incan [[Quechuan languages|Quechuan]].&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; The speculation being that ancient Cyprians had previously interacted with the South American ethnic group and learned to write that language with their alphabet before reaching Puerto Rico and doing the same with the local population.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; According to Fell, evidence suggesting the authenticity of the petroglyphs emerged with the discovery (along the relevant civilization) of a similar grid-based and acrostic language by Pedro I. Porrás Garcés at Ecuador in 1961, which was first detailed in his an article titled "Arqueología de la Región Oriental" (English: "Archeology of the Oriental Region").&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; The document also notes similarities with characters present in the royal robe of [[Viracocha Inca]], leading to the hypothesis that they were [[huaca]]s and that one particular piece was dedicated to a request to Mamai, the title invested to the Incan queen.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; Fell concludes that the Collection would represent the largest finding related to this culture and the only one outside South America.&lt;ref name="Fell"/&gt; The report gathered some interest, but conflicting views within the mainstream media resulted in stagnation of the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.isla.net/cronista/el_padre.htm |title=El Padre Nazario: A 166 años de su natalicio |author=Norberto Lugo Negrón |publisher=''Periódico Regional El Cronista'' |language=Spanish |date=September 2004 |accessdate=June 4, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131071945/http://personal.isla.net/cronista/el_padre.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public exhibitions===
After the death of Salvador Tió, others that have promoted the topic include Antonio Molina and his daughter, Zoé Tió.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In Guayanilla, biographer Norbeto Lugo and Irvin Sepúlveda have made efforts to foment the study on the pieces.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In 2008, interest in the pieces surrounded the 175th Anniversary of the municipality's foundation.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; It was due to this celebration, where interest in Guayanilla's history peaked, that arrangements were made to have the Collection in public exhibition for the first time and the first time in decades that the topic returned to the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/isla/nota/exponenpiedrasdelpadrenazario-161850/|title=Exponen Piedras del padre Nazario|publisher=''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]''|language=Spanish|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition took place between March 27 and 28 at the behest of Leandro Hernández, director of the ''Centro Cultural María Arzola'' (English: "María Arzola Cultural Center") which also hosted the pieces.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; The municipal administration of Guayanilla then announced arrangements to have them permanently moved there in order to exhibit them.&lt;ref name="2008exhibition"/&gt; During the following year, interest in the Collection grew and the municipality began efforts to create the ''Museo de Epigrafía Lítica Padre Nazario'' (English: "Father Nazario Museum of Lithic Epigraphy") to emphasize them.&lt;ref name="Museo2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/cultura/nota/porlapreservaciondelaarqueologia-613075/|title=Por la preservación de la arqueología|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''|language=Spanish|date=2009-09-09|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the finding became a central argument against the creation of an eolic park in the region.&lt;ref name="Museo2009"/&gt; Upon opening, the museum featured a permanent exhibition where 19 pieces of the Collection were on display, among other archeological exhibitions relevant to the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KWHVpi_d6R8J:www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D6182%26Itemid%3D342&amp;num=1&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=pr&amp;strip=1&amp;vwsrc=0|title=Exposición colectiva digna de admiración|author=Reinaldo Millán|publisher=''[[La Perla del Sur]]''|language=Spanish|date=2014-06-18|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic re-entered the mainstream media in April 2016, with coverage related to a conference covering his research that was organized by Zoé Tió.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;

==Recent research==
===Studies on composition and characteristics===

In 2012, research on the pieces returned to the mainstream academia with the involvement of  Reniel Rodríguez Ramos from the [[University of Puerto Rico at Utuado]], who was concerned that up to that point most of the local research had been carried by historians.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;{{efn|Rodríguez is a lithic artifact expert and Ripley B. Bullen Award winner for "Outstanding Research in Caribbean Archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohemis.uprm.edu/espa/docs/Vita_RenielRodriguez.pdf|title=Reniel Rodríguez: Ramos Programa de Ciencias Sociales Universidad de Puerto Rico Recinto de Utuado|publisher=[[University of Puerto Rico at Utuado]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} During his first visit to the ICP, he encountered part of the Collection being repurposed and the rest in storage.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;  While attending an activity in the British Museum in 2014, Rodríguez took some pieces with him to the cuneiform exhibit, where he was casually presented to C.B.F. Walker while showing [[Jago Cooper]] a copy of Hostos' letter to the now-retired cuneiform expert.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; None of the present gave a definitive answer to their nature, but agreed that further study was needed.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Parallel to this process, a documentary began being prepared by cinematographer Carlos García in collaboration with Rodríguez and his team.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

In terms of characteristics, most pieces depict individuals in what appear to be varying ceremonial postures while wearing headwear and a tunic in which the petroglyphs are present.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The group also examined other characters that deviated from the norm, such as those present at a site within the [[Guánica State Forest]] in an attempt to identify similar inscriptions.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In relation to local natives, analogues are scarce and not identical, with some a similar headwear appearing in a piece unearthed at Tecla in Guayanilla and elements of clothing in idols (and additional symbols) being found at La Hueca in Vieques.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez has been unable to pinpoint the place referred to as "Hanoa, Puerto Rico" in Pinart's notes.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Consequently, the research team carried sample collection in the south western coast of Puerto Rico, in particular the regions of Guayanilla and Yauco assumed to be near the initial discovery, such as Barrio Los Indios and Barina.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; After completing macroscopic examination, the prime matter is consonant with serpentinized peridotite with traces of bastite and mica typical in the region.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Efforts were made by the research team to retrieve as much firsthand information on the origin and history of the pieces as possible.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; With the collaboration of Laura Rodríguez from the [[Bayamón Central University]], the archeologist was able to rummage through the Zeno Gandía Collection (a repository of documents and artifacts that used to belong to him) and retrieve the correspondence between Nazario and the author.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; By establishing the date of Pinart's first visit, Rodríguez attempted to prove if Nazario had access to sources detailing ancient writing similar to that exhibited in the Collection prior to this.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In this regard, he concluded that since ''Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea'' was published at least nine years after the visit of Pinart, it could not have been used by Nazario to forge the characters.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; He also acquired Fewke's field notes with the help of Roberto Martínez.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez tried to pinpoint the location of González de Velasco's piece, but was told that it is no longer part of the Museo Nacional de Antropología's Puerto Rico exhibit.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

The archeologist discussed how to proceed with people from a number of fields, including geology, chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; To determine the chemical characteristics of the pieces, Antonio Martínez of the Physics Department of the UPR and Pablo Llerandi of General Studies at [[University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus]] (UPR-RP) have been involved in an initiative to complete studies on X-ray diffraction and spectrography, in order to further pinpoint the properties of the prime matter.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In order to determine the characteristics of the traces the high power microscopes of the UPR-RP were used to carry out high magnification studies in which perpendicular striations were noted as part of a pointer drag technique.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Some pieces do display characters that were added later than those in the others, implying that some were created afterwards.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; However, the manner in which some of the pieces have been [[erosion|intemperized]] (in particular the presence of differential intemperization in some that has rounded the edges of fractures in only one of the sides) is inconsistent with them being fabrications that were forged in the late 1870s and then stored indoors ever since, instead suggesting that they were exposed to the elements for a prolonged time period.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Further efforts are being made to fund a collaboration with [[Leiden University]] to advance this research area with their specialists.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

Carlos Silva of [[Universidad del Turabo]] has been involved in the 3D scanning of the pieces.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The high definition imaging has led to the interest of philologist [[Christopher Rollston]], whom Rodríguez considers a candidate to attempt the falsification of the Old World hypothesis.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Studies in thermoluminescence have been proposed to establish the last time that the rocks were set on fire.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Some of the artifacts were burned after the traces were made, with the pieces that fragmented during the process being plausible candidates.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Others have carbon remnants that could be dated by employing the C-14 method.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; The general plan is to send separate pieces to the [[University of Washington]] Luminescence Dating Laboratory and to Oxford Authentication to compare results, which Rodríguez considers possibly conclusive.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Towards this end, he has requested additional support from the ICP or the Official Historian of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;

===Potential hypotheses===
Based on his research, Rodríguez has formulated a number of hypotheses that are being currently examined without taking an a priori position about their authenticity or the possibility of fraud, with his initial position taking under consideration that some pieces where likely created after the initial discovery.&lt;ref name="ENDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interes"/&gt; If the entire Collection is proven to be fraudulent, he argues that the age of the pieces makes them archeological artifacts in their own right.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez has also formulated a preliminary hypothesis if several of the pieces are certified as authentic, for which he tried to identify similar geodesic characters, since these are not common, and have only been found in the Caribbean at [[Mona Island]], Salto Arriba in Puerto Rico, Bateyes de Viví in Cuba and Piedra Mapa in Santa Marta.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Throughout the rest of the globe, their closest analogues are found at the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Rodríguez also considers that religious idols found in this archipelago exhibit similar posture and facial features, which were not discovered until after the pieces were reportedly unearthed and he argues that Nazario could not have known.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; In terms of character analysis, there are some that are analogue to the [[Tifinagh#Origins|Libyco-Berber]] alphabet found in the Canary Islands.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

After the initial studies, a set of cave paintings was uncovered near Playa Los Tubos, which Rodríguez decided to capture and send to Renata Springer Bunk (a philologist who has authored several books about the Libyco-Berber characters at the Canary Islands) who responded in the affirmative about their nature but lost interest after being told that they were found at Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt; Ultimately, he combined these with the seafaring nature of Caribbean natives and studies like one in which archeologist Richard Thomas Callahan of the [[University of Calgary]] studied how far the [[Canary Current]] could have dragged a drifting vessel, to formulate a hypothesis that he wants to falsify.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;{{efn|Callahan has studied the topic and published papers on his research, including a 2015 article titled "Drift Voyages across the Mid-Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9756298|title=Drift voyages across the mid-Atlantic|author=Richard T. Callaghan|publisher=''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''|date=June 2015|accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In regards to other hypotheses, Rodríguez is skeptical of Fell's conclusion and notes that some of the words that the zoologist translated as phonetic Quechan such as ''yuca'', ''ungey'', ''chayote'' or ''papaya'' are in fact Arawak in origin.&lt;ref name="CEAPRC"/&gt;

An '''online book''' is a resource in [[book]]-like form that is only available to read on the [[Internet]]. It differs from the common idea of an [[e-book]], which is usually available for users to download and read locally on a computer, [[smartphone]] or on an [[e-reader]]. "Book-like" means: information is presented in a page format; pages are normally available to read sequentially (though "flipping" to another page is possible using a mouse, keyboard or other controllers); and pages are read passively, with little or no interaction or multimedia. This contrasts with a text which a user is reading on an interactive [[Web 2.0]] website, which usually enables the user to click on online links, look up words or keywords online, etc.   "Online" means the content may only be read while the reader is connected to the Internet. Thus the reader's experience with an online book is similar to reading a printed book, except that the book is read at a computer and is only accessible while the reader is online. 

Online books are a common resource in [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs). For example, the [[Moodle]] VLE defines an online book in this way. Over the last few years, there has been an increase of online books that are being used for notable events or to commemorate the memory of someone. The fundraising industry often uses online books as a way to fundraise, as online books are also a way to collect donations and engage with their audience.

'''Oreet Ashery''' (born 1966 in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]) is an Israeli interdisciplinary artist based in [[London]].&lt;ref name=EASCFA&gt;{{cite web|title=Oreet |url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/gallery/oreet_ashery.php|work=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: Feminist Art Base|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ashery received her BA (distinction) in [[Fine Art]] from [[Sheffield Hallam University]] in 1992, followed by her MA in Fine Arts from [[Central Saint Martins]] in 2000. Her work explores ideological, social and gender constructions through an interdisciplinary practice, spanning [[Installation art|installation]], [[Video art|video]], [[Performance art|live art]] and 2-D image making.

Ashery's earlier work was often produced as a male character of her own creation, exploring [[Gender role|gender relationships]] and those between woman and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/gallery/oreet_ashery.php&lt;/ref&gt; Ashery's most consistent character is Marcus Fisher, an [[orthodox Jewish]] man&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Maura|title=Curating Transnational Feminisms|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=36|series=RETHINKING THE GLOBAL|issue=1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Katrien|title=Hong Kong Screenscapes: From the New Wave to the Digital Frontier|date=2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9789888028566|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-pLCZq_TKRwC&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=Oreet%20Ashery&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=On Isaac Leung, Cyber Sex as Pseudo-Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in works such as ''Dancing with Men'' and ''Marcus Fisher | Say Cheese'', but she has produced as other male characters, including an Arab man, a Norwegian postman and a black man.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artangel.org.uk//projects/2010/staying/about_oreet_ashery/oreet_ashery&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashery's more recent work has been based on [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]]'s 1921 play ''[[Mystery-Bouffe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oreet Ashery's Party for Freedom|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/visual-cultures/calendar/?id=6519|website=Department of Visual Cultures: Archived Event|publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work confronts social and class biases alongside issues of political power and agency. Her performance at the [[Tate Modern]] ''The World is Flooding'' in 2014 was followed by an exhibition ''Animal with a Language'' at Waterside Contemporary, both of which saw Ashery work with participants from [[Freedom from Torture]], UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, Portugal Prints,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/performance-and-music/world-flooding&lt;/ref&gt; and others, to explore these themes.

Ashery has exhibited and performed at various international venues, such as [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]], [[Karlsruhe]]; [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]], Berlin; [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[New York City|New York]]; Overgaden, [[Copenhagen]]; DEPO, [[Istanbul]]; Whitstable Biennale; [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Centre Pompidou]], Paris; [[Auto Italia South East]], London; and [[Freud Museum]], London,&lt;ref name="oreetashery.net"&gt;http://oreetashery.net/cv/&lt;/ref&gt; producing works that explore her personal politics and identity in relation to wider social and cultural contexts.

==Life==
Cumper grew up in [[Jamaica]], with her English father and Jamaican mother. She followed her parents to study at [[Cambridge University]], for which she won a scholarship from [[Queen's School, Jamaica|The Queen's School]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], to study Archaeology and Anthropology at [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]] (1973–76).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/241/job-ladder "Patricia Cumper shares the route she took to her current role"], ''Arts Professional'', 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Cumper was a College Exhibitioner and was also awarded a full swimming [[Blue (university sport)#University of Cambridge|Blue]], captaining the swim team.&lt;ref name=govt2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=histbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=afrizidiak&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Sophia|title=Patricia Cumper|url=http://www.afridiziak.com/theatrenews/interviews/may2011/patricia-cumper.html|work=Afrizidiak|accessdate=10 March 2014|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Cumper returned to Jamaica, where she began a career writing for the radio, including two major soap operas, ''Malvina's Revenge'' and ''Mortimer Simmonds''.&lt;ref name=Gleaner&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20160701/large-abroad-theatre-screenplay-jamaican-driving-caribbean-identity-uk "Large Abroad | From Theatre To Screenplay - Jamaican Driving Caribbean Identity In The UK"], ''[[Jamaica Gleaner|The Gleaner]]'', 1 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Britain in 1993 she continued her career as a playwright, writing for [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite web|title=Trustee - Patricia Cumper|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/management/trustees/patricia_cumper.aspx|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gleaner /&gt;

In the [[2013 New Year Honours]] she was appointed a [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for services to the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gruner|first=Peter|title=Queen's New Year Honours – MBE salutes ‘inspirational’ creator of vibrant theatre

She has sons and grandsons, whom she describes as "the great joys of her life".&lt;ref name=bm /&gt;

==Career==
Cumper has written a large number of plays both for the stage and radio, episodes of ''[[Westway (1997 radio series)|Westway]]'', short stories, and a novel, ''One Bright Child'', published in 1998.&lt;ref name=writewords&gt;{{cite web|title=Patricia Cumper Interview|url=http://www.writewords.org.uk/interviews/patricia_cumper.asp|work=WriteWords|accessdate=10 March 2014|date=6 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumper began writing after watching a play of which she was critical, and being challenged to do better. She wrote a play called ''The Rapist'', which ran for six months and won an award. She continued to write and also produced plays, winning four awards for her work, which was produced in the Caribbean, the USA and Canada. She moved to Britain in 1993 to pursue her career.&lt;ref name=histbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=bm /&gt;

Cumper worked for the UK's largest Black-led theatre company, [[Talawa Theatre Company|Talawa]], from about 1999, as a writer, script reader, tutor, assistant director and dramaturge.&lt;ref name=bm /&gt;&lt;ref name=writewords /&gt;

She became artistic director of Talawa in 2006 and stepped down in 2012, after overseeing their 25th anniversary season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patricia Cumper ends five-year run at Talawa|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2011/06/patricia-cumper-ends-five-year-run-at-talawa/|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Stage|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumper became a [[List of trustees of the British Museum|trustee]] of the [[British Museum]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=govt2013 /&gt;

In January 2015, her adaptation of [[Toni Morrison]]'s novel ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' was broadcast in 10 episodes by [[BBC Radio 4]] as part of its ''[[15 Minute Drama]]'' programme.&lt;ref name="BBC Online"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tr5t3|title= 15 Minute Drama, Beloved Episode 1 of 10|author= | website= [[BBC Online]] |publisher= | accessdate= 4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumper's 2017 play ''Chigger Foot Boys'', which pays tribute to African and Caribbean soldiers who lost their lives in the [[First World War]], was produced at Tara Arts to a positive reception. Paul Vale in a four-star review for ''[[The Stage]]'' called it a "Richly textured play delivered with clarity and touchingly performed", commenting that "the perspective is wholly enlightening",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/chigger-foot-boys-review-tara-theatre-london/ "Chigger Foot Boys review at Tara Theatre, London – ‘richly textured’"], 27 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sonia Grant wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'': "In the dexterous hands of acclaimed playwright Patricia Cumper MBE, Chigger Foot Boys accomplished what a good theatrical production should by being bold, entertaining and enlightening. Indeed, Cumper's year and a half's research in both Britain and Jamaica shows; the play is jam-packed with little-known information on Jamaica's involvement in World War I."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sonia-grant/chigger-foot-boys-reviews_b_5573448.html "Review: Chigger Foot Boys"], ''HuffPost'', 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Awards==

She is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of the Arts]] and in 2013 was awarded an MBE for services to Black British Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanvoiceonline.co.uk/patricia-cumper-mbe-two-others-reappointed-trustees-british-museum/ "Patricia Cumper MBE, and two others reappointed trustees of the British Museum"], ''African Voice'', 25 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9524">'''Pavel Dmitriyevich Korin''' ({{lang-ru|Павел Дмитриевич Корин}}; {{OldStyleDate|8&amp;nbsp;July|1892|25&amp;nbsp;June}} - 22&amp;nbsp;November 1967) was a [[Russia]]n painter and art [[art conservation and restoration|restorer]]. He is famous for his preparational work for the unimplemented painting ''Farewell to Rus''.

==Life and career==
Pavel Korin was born in the village of [[Palekh]] (now in [[Ivanovo Oblast]]) to a family of a professional [[icon]]-painter Dmitry Nikolayevich Korin. In 1897, when Pavel was only five years old, his father died. In 1903-1907, he studied at the ''School for Icon Painting'' at Palekh getting a formal certificate as a professional icon-painter. In 1908, he moved to [[Moscow]] and until 1911 worked there at the icon shop of the [[Donskoy Monastery|Don Monastery]].

In 1911, he worked as an apprentice to [[Mikhail Nesterov]] on [[fresco]]es of [[The Intercession]] Church at the [[Marfo-Mariinsky Convent|Convent of Martha and Mary]] (''Marfo-Mariinsky'') on Bolshaya Ordynka Street in [[Moscow]]. Nesterov insisted that Korin gain a formal education in easel painting and arranged his admission to the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] in 1912. Pavel graduated  from that school in 1916, having been a student of [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[Leonid Pasternak]].

In 1916, he worked on frescoes for the mausoleum of [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]] at [[The Intercession]] Church at the Convent of Martha and Mary. In accordance with the wishes of the Grand Duchess, he traveled to [[Yaroslavl]] and [[Rostov]] to study traditional frescoes of antique Russian churches.
[[File:Korin konen.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portrait of sculptor [[Sergey Konenkov]], 1947]]

In February 1917, he started to work in his attic studio on [[Arbat Street]] in [[Moscow]] and worked there until 1934.

In 1918-1919, he taught at the ''2nd State Art Studios'' (2-ые ГСХМ). In 1919-1920 he worked at the ''Anatomic theatre'' of [[Moscow State University]], as he thought that, as a painter, he needed deeper knowledge of the human anatomy. In the evenings he copied paintings and sculptures of the [[Pushkin Museum|Museum of Fine Arts]].

In 1923, he traveled over Northern Russia, visiting [[Vologda]], [[Staraya Ladoga]], [[Ferapontov Monastery]], and [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]]. In 1926-1931, he worked as an instructor of painting classes for beginners at the Museum of Fine Arts.

In 1926, the Convent of Martha and Mary was closed by the Soviets and all the art there was to be destroyed. Pavel and his brother Alexander managed to smuggle out and save the [[iconostasis]] and some of the frescoes. On March&amp;nbsp;7 of that year he married Praskovya Tikhonovna Petrova, a disciple of the Convent of Martha and Mary.

In 1927, Korin's [[aquarelle]] ''Artist's studio'' and his oil landscape ''My Motherland'' were bought by the [[Tretyakov gallery]], showing recognition from the Soviets.

In 1931, Korin's studio was visited by [[Maxim Gorky]], who supported Korin since. In 1932, Korin followed Gorky to [[Sorrento]], painted Gorky's portrait, and visited [[Italy]] and [[Germany]].

In 1931, Korin started to work as the Head of the [[art conservation and restoration|Restoration]] Shop of [[Pushkin Museum|Museum of the Foreign Art]] (former Museum of Fine Arts later Pushkin Museum). He held this position for until 1959. After this he held the position of the Director of the ''State Central Art Restoration Works'' (ГЦРХМ) until his death. As one of the most senior Russian restorers of the time he contributed enormously to the saving and restoration of famous paintings.

In 1933, Korin moved to the studio on Malaya Pirogovka Street in [[Moscow]] where he worked until his death. Now the building is Korin's museum.

In the 1940s, he painted many portraits of members of the Soviet [[intelligentsia]] (including [[Leonid Leonidov]], [[Mikhail Nesterov]], [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|Alexey Tolstoy]], [[Kachalov]] and Nadezhda Peshkova (Gorky's daughter in law)). He painted the fresco ''Match to the Future'' for the ''Palace of Soviets'' in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] and a [[Triptych]] devoted to [[Alexander Nevsky]].
[[File:Korin russia walking away.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''Farewell to Rus'', preparational drawing showing the composition, 1935-1959]]

In the 1950s, Korin worked on mosaics for the [[Moscow Metro]]. His mosaics decorate the stations [[Komsomolskaya-Koltsevaya]], [[Arbatskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line)]] and [[Novoslobodskaya]], and also the Main Hall (Актовый Зал) of [[Moscow State University]]. He also won an impressive list of Soviet awards in the 1950s and 1960s: 
*[[Stalin Prize]] - 1954 for mosaics for the station Komsomolskaya-Koltsevaya,
*[[Lenin Prize]] - 1963 for portraits of [[Martiros Saryan]], group portrait of cartoonists [[Kukryniksy]], Italian painter [[Renato Guttuso]]
*Member of [[Imperial Academy of Arts|Academy of Arts of Soviet Union]] - since 1958
*Gold medal on [[World's Fair]] at [[Brussels]] - 1958 for the portrait of Martiros Saryan,
*[[People's Artist of the Russian SFSR]] 1958
*[[People's Artist of the USSR]] - 1962 ()
*[[Order of Lenin]] - 1967

Pavel Korin died in Moscow on 22 November 1967 and was buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].
[[File:Korins studio.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Photo of Korin's studio showing the canvas for the ''Farewell to Rus'' drawing, 1960s]]

==''Farewell to Rus''==
The biography of Korin shows an accomplished Soviet painter and a prominent art figure, but the job he had considered the main work of his life was left unfinished. During his student years Korin was impressed by the life of [[Alexander Ivanov (painter)|Alexander Ivanov]], who spent most of his adult life in creating a single painting ''The Appearance of Christ before the People'' (1835–1857). Pavel decided that he should live by Ivanov's example and devote his whole life to a single large painting. He began by preparing a very accurate, life sized copy of Ivanov's masterpiece (1920–1925). The initial name for this painting was ''Bless the Lord, oh my soul'' (''Благослови, душе моя, Господа'').

In 1925 Korin witnessed the intercession of [[Patriarch of Moscow|Patriarch]] [[Tikhon of Moscow]] in the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] of [[Moscow Kremlin]]. All people of importance in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], usually suppressed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s, were present. After the event Pavel decided that his magnum opus would be named ''[[Requiem]]'', or ''Requiem for Russia'', and would depict the intercession of Patriarch Tikhon and show the Russia that was lost after the [[October Revolution]].
[[File:Korin Beggar.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Beggar'', Etude for ''Farewell to Rus'', 1933]]

Korin feverishly painted people present at the burial service for Tikhon, often the last survivors of families of Russian nobility, or dissident priests, soon to be destroyed. Rumors about the dangerous painting soon became a matter of [[NKVD]] interest. In 1931 Maxim Gorky advised Korin that the name ''Requiem for Russia'' was too strong to be accepted and recommended a change to ''Русь Уходящая'' - literally ''[[Russia|Rus]] that is going away'', but usually translated as ''Farewell to Rus''. Gorky believed that the painting showing the last parade of the Orthodox Church, depicting the tragedy and at the same time the misery of those people who would will disappear into irrelevancy, would be accepted and even well received by the Government. Korin agreed with the new name of the painting.

For forty years Korin worked on the painting. He produced dozens of large (more than life size), detailed paintings that he preferred to call [[etude]]s for the ''Farewell to Rus'' masterpiece; he worked on composition. He ordered a huge canvas, designed a special stretcher for it, and spent years  coating the canvas with multiple layers of the special underlays. Korin was combining the ancient methods of the icon paintings with the science of [[art restoration]]s and claimed the painting prepared by his methods should survive hundreds, possibly thousands of years without the need for restoration.

In his lifetime, he had not put a single brushstroke on the canvas - forty-two years of preparational work was not enough for Pavel Korin. Though some might consider it an extreme case of [[procrastination]], the huge canvas became a popular art exhibit in the Korin Museum. Many consider it as an art masterpiece in its own right, similar to the ''Black Square'' of [[Kazimir Malevich]].

'''Plastered human skulls''' are reconstructed human skulls that were made in the ancient [[Levant]] between 7000 and 6000 BC in the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] period. They represent some of the oldest forms of art in the [[Middle East]] and demonstrate that the prehistoric population took great care in burying their [[ancestors]] below their homes. The skulls denote some of the earliest sculptural examples of [[portrait]]ure in the [[history of art]].

==Discovery==
One skull was accidentally unearthed in the 1930s by the archaeologist [[John Garstang]] at [[Jericho]] in the [[West Bank]]. A number of plastered skulls from Jericho were discovered by the British archaeologist [[Kathleen Kenyon]] in the 1950s and can now be found in the collections of the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the [[Nicholson Museum]] in Sydney and the [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;ROM Collection [http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2004_1044_7 ROM Images.

Other sites where plastered skulls were excavated include [[Ain Ghazal]] and [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], and [[Tell Ramad]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/p/plastered_skull.aspx The British Museum. "Plastered Skull."]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the plastered skulls were from adult males, but some belonged to women and children.

==Archaeological significance==
The plastered skulls represent some of the earliest forms of burial practices in the southern [[Levant]]. During the [[Neolithic]] period, the deceased were often buried under the floors of their homes.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; Sometimes the skull was removed, and its cavities filled with plaster and painted. In order to create more lifelike faces, [[Seashell|shells]] were inset for eyes, and paint was used to represent facial features, hair, and [[moustaches]].&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/the-neolithic-revolution.html German, Senta. "The Neolithic Revolution."]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars believe that this burial practice represents an early form of [[ancestor worship]], where the plastered skulls were used to commemorate and respect family ancestors.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; Other experts argue that the plastered skulls could be linked to the practice of head hunting, and used as trophies. Plastered skulls provide evidence about the earliest arts and [[religious]] practices in the [[ancient Near East]].

'''''Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics''''' is a ''[[roman à clef]]'', a work of fiction that actually describes real life characters and events – namely, [[Bill Clinton]]'s first [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|presidential campaign]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992]]. It has been compared to two other novels about American politics: [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1946)&lt;ref name="author author"/&gt; and ''[[O: A Presidential Novel]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="who wrote"/&gt;

The book was originally published by an anonymous author, who was later found to be columnist [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]]. Klein completed a sequel of sorts, ''The Running Mate'' in 2000, focusing on the ''Primary Colors'' character of Charlie Martin.&lt;ref name="crossfire"/&gt;

==Unmasking of "Anonymous"==
An early reviewer opined that the author wished to remain unknown because "Anonymity makes truthfulness much easier".&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Later commentators called the publishing of the book under an anonymous identity an effective marketing strategy that produced more publicity for the book, and thus more sales, without calling into question the author's actual inside knowledge.&lt;ref name="who wrote"/&gt;

Several people, including former Clinton speechwriter David Kusnet, believed the style of writing had similarities to that of Klein. This was also supported by a quantitative [[stylometry|stylometric]] analysis of the book by [[Vassar College|Vassar]] professor [[Donald Foster (professor)|Donald Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2000/11/02/foster_5/ ''Author Unknown'' by Gavin McNett Salon November 2, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Klein initially denied writing the book and publicly condemned Foster.&lt;ref name="enlightens readers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="great unknown"/&gt; Klein denied authorship again in ''[[Newsweek]]'', speculating that another writer wrote it. ''[[Washington Post]]'' Style editor David von Drehle, in an interview, asked Klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial, to which Klein agreed.&lt;ref name="media's true"/&gt;

On July 17, 1996, after ''The Washington Post'' published the results of a handwriting analysis of notes made on an early manuscript of the book, Klein finally admitted that he was "Anonymous".&lt;ref name="mea culpa"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book begins as an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton, joins the presidential campaign of Southern governor Jack Stanton, a thinly disguised stand-in for [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; The plot then follows the primary election calendar beginning in New Hampshire where Stanton's affair with Cashmere, his wife's hairdresser, and his participation in a Vietnam War era protest come to light and threaten to derail his presidential prospects.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; In Florida, Stanton revives his campaign by disingenuously portraying his Democratic opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel and as a weak supporter of Social Security.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Burton becomes increasingly disillusioned with Stanton, who is a policy wonk who talks too long, eats too much and is overly flirtatious toward women.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Stanton is also revealed to be insincere in his beliefs, saying whatever will help him to win.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Matters finally come to a head, and Burton is forced to choose between idealism and realism.

==Reviews==
''The New York Daily News'' described the book as a farce and praised it as funny, truthful, and as containing "uncannily accurate" portraits of its thinly disguised characters.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">The '''Sarcophagus of Stilicho''' is a marble [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] used since before the 10th-century as the base for the pulpit of the church of [[Sant'Ambrogio, Milan|San Ambrogio]] in Milan, Italy. It appears to have been made some decades prior to the death of Stilicho, and thus likely not associated with the Roman General. 

==Description==
The sarcophagus was carved from Marble from quarries near [[Como]], but appears to date stylistically from circa 390 and the reign of [[Theodosius the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1kSpN3Kfgc0C Early Christian and Byzantine Art], by John Beckwith, Richard Krautheimer, Slobodan Ćurčić; page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The panels depict both New and Old Testament scenes including:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-NhdelLo1oC DK Eyewitness Guide to Milan], page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sava Sekulić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Сава Секулић}}; Bilišane, [[Obrovac, Croatia|Obrovac]], February 17, 1902 – [[Belgrade]], January 26, 1989) was a [[Serbia]]n [[Naive art|Naïve]] and [[Outsider art|Outsider]] [[painter]].

==Biography==
He was born in Bilišani in [[Dalmatinska Zagora]] near [[Obrovac, Croatia|Obrovac]], as a [[Serb]] in [[Croatia]] at the [[Adriatic Sea]] coast, in 1902. His mother remarried when his father died when he was 10 years old.Sava Sekulić was raised by his uncle and his aunt. He never attended any schools. His father taught him to read and write. Also, Sava used to quote his father's last words: ''Learn by yourself, draw and write with a stone in your hand''. During [[World War I]], he was harmed and lost one eye when he was 15 years old. He started writing poems when he was 22 and painting in 1932, but he did not dedicate himself to painture exclusively. In 1943, during the [[World War II]] he began to work as a [[Construction worker|builder]]. Parallel to writing poems, after his retirement in 1962, Sava began to do [[painting]] in order to define his [[poetry]] more precisely. Sekulić belongs to the group of the so-called [[outsider art]]ists,  lonely, bizarre, asocial people who create new forms of beauty. His unusual associativity and ability for materialization of his intellectual energy as a complete [[self-taught]] was intuitively and instinctively released. He died in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;М. Бошковић; М.Маширевић, Самоуки ликовни уметници у Србији, Торино, 1977; 74, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Н. Крстић, Наивна уметност Србије, [https://www.sanu.ac.rs/english/ SANU], [http://www.mnmu.rs MNMA], Jagodina, 2003; p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic style ==
Sekulić is a painter of the universal, the timeless and the limitless. For him everything is generalized, from the individual he aspires to the universal, and is very successful. Therefore, his works are the highest achievements of [[Outsider art|L'art brut]], not only in the country, but worldwide. [[Allegories]] and [[metaphors]] are present in nearly all his works. With his visions he reduced a unique pictorial definition, minimized the subject matter to a metaphor. Most numerous are his compositions with [[human]] [[Shape|figures]], [[portraits]] and scenes with historical and [[mythological|beings]]. While painting historical personalities, he portrayed the [[wikt:victim|victims]] as [[hero]]es, and the members of his family as [[mythological]] beings. However, the most complex is the figure of a woman.

In many works there are [[philosophical]] stories and moralizing lessons. Figures are simplified, flat and highly stylised. In the background of every painting is an original story derived from numerous popular [[legend]]s and beliefs – [[pagan]], [[Christian]], [[mythological]], [[historical]] or [[contemporary]].
The [[myths]] with the pronounced respect for animals – primordial parents and beliefs on summing up people and animals are presented in his paintings by duplication and compaction of human and animal figure (fish, bird, horse, cow, snake, octopus, deer, bull, he-goat...), multiplication of heads and limbs. The artist prefigured the symbiosis of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, where all the [[alchemy]] of his pictorial expression is clearly visible. It is paradoxical that the artist’s very style counteracts the narrative aspect of the painting and concentrates totally on the pictorial value with the strength on an unconscious [[neo-primitive]].

His palette is restricted. He often paints surfaces with different applications of transparent colours, one over the other, without waiting for the earlier layer to dry, which leads to mixing and assimilation of colours. One colour is often predominant in each painting, which sometimes creates a [[monochrome]] [[wikt:impression|impression]]. He sometimes only partly paints the background of certain paintings, thus leaving whole surfaces unpainted. This additionally eliminated any [[illusion]] of spatial depth.

Sekulić’s paintings are pervaded with a number of inventive characteristics, the symbiosis of the real and the surreal, with the character of almost pure automatism. The superiority of the artist’s senses overgrows the perception of a beholder. An ordinary observer is not capable of noticing and understanding sensitive structure of purely [[pictorial]] [[phenomena]]; his paintings are firstly accepted as a kind of visual intrigue and are later intellectually experienced. Finally, Sava Sekulić is one of the greatest Serbian [[Outsider art|outsider]] and [[Naive art|naïve]] painters and a world classic also.&lt;ref name="krstic1"&gt;N. Krstić, Outsider Art in Serbia, monograph, MNMA, Јагодина, 2014, pp. 108-113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and awards==
The best of his paintings are in the collections of [http://www.mnmu.rs Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA)], [[Jagodina]], [[Serbia]] and in Galerie Charlotte Zander, Bönningheim, Germany. He participated in independent and group shows in the country: [[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]], [[Aranđelovac]], [[Jagodina]], as well as abroad in significant international exhibitions in:[[Munich]], [[Paris]], [[Cologne]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnmu.rs MNMA], Jagodina&lt;/ref&gt;
He received many prominent international awards. For his works he was also awarded posthumously at the ''Fifth World Triennial of Naïve and Marginal Art IN SITA'' in [[Bratislava]], 2000, etc.).&lt;ref name="krstic1"/&gt;

In [[drama]], a '''scene'''  is a unit of action, often a subdivision of an [[Act (drama)|act]]. 

==French scene==
A "French scene" is a scene in which the beginning and end are marked by a change in the presence of characters onstage, rather than by the lights going up or down or the set being changed.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George, Kathleen (1994) ''Playwriting: The First Workshop'', Focal Press, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80190-2}}, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obligatory scene==
From the French ''scène à faire'', an obligatory scene is a scene (usually highly charged with emotion) which is anticipated by the audience and provided by an obliging playwright. An example is ''[[Hamlet]]'' 3.4, when Hamlet confronts his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|authorlink=J. A. Cuddon|editor=C. E.

==Development of the play==
Each playwright worked with one of the women whose stories make up the play over a series of interviews in 2006-2007, and wrote a dramatic monologue based on these. The writers met in February 2007 to read the monologues together, and then worked them into a unified script during a Residency Fellowship retreat at [[Bard College]]. The first draft was read in July 2007.&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of Seven|url=https://seventheplay.com/the-story-of-seven/|website=Seven - a documentary play|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The play was first performed on 21 January 2008 at the [[92nd Street Y]] in [[New York City|New York]], directed by [[Evan Yionoulis]]. Since then it has been translated into 20 languages and performed in 32 countries, {{as of|lc=yes|May 2016}}.&lt;ref name=story /&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About Seven|url=https://seventheplay.com/about-seven/|website=Seven - a documentary play|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slanguage''' is an exhibition space and [[artist collective]] in [[Wilmington, Los Angeles]], [[California]] founded by Mario Ybarra and Karla Diaz in 2002. Slanguage works with community artists, [[curator]]s and [[historian]]s on projects and workshops. Slanguage describes its art-making practice as a "three pronged approach" including "education, community-building, and interactive exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slanguagestudio.com/about/|title=About »  Slanguage Studio|website=slanguagestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slanguage divides its space between experiments with media and ideas, and public performances and exhibitions. ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited Slanguage as an example of an "ever more important" type of exhibition space that provides a forum for work "uncongenial to an increasingly conservative art establishment" and for the work of students graduating from art schools "in numbers the commercial gallery system cannot begin to absorb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/arts/art-architecture-doing-their-own-thing-making-art-together.html|title=ART/ARCHITECTURE; Doing Their Own Thing, Making Art Together|first=Holland|last=Cotter|date=7 June 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September through November, 2009, Slanguage was the resident artist group with [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], as part of MOCA's Engagement Party program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130818033130/http://sites.moca.org/party/2013/01/09/slanguage/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/slanguage-at-engagement-party/|title=SLANGUAGE at Engagement Party - Announcements - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Slanguage projects include Sweeney Tate, a 2007 art installation at [[Tate Modern]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tateshots-sweeney-tate|title=TateShots: Sweeney Tate - Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Peacock Doesn’t See Its Own Ass/Let’s Twitch Again: Operation Bird Watching in London, for the [[Serpentine Gallery]]'s Uncertain States of America exhibition in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2006/08/uncertain_states_of_america_9.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904001948/http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2006/08/uncertain_states_of_america_9.html |archive-date=2013-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slanguagestudio.com/projects/|title=Projects Slanguage Studio|website=slanguagestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5848">'''TV Lab''' (short for Television Laboratory) was a program founded at [[WNET|Thirteen/WNET]] public television station in 1972 by [[David Loxton]] with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[New York State Council on the Arts]]. The program provided artists with advanced video making equipment through an artist-in-residence program. Between 1975 and 1977, the Video Tape Review series was established and broadcast through TV Lab. David Loxton created TV Lab's Independent Documentary Fund in 1977, aiming to provide funding for the creation of independent documentaries. Unable to match funds from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the IDF and TV Lab lost support, eventually ending in 1984.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=James|title=The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television|year=1995|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=9780520086593|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1971, the Rockefeller Foundation donated $150,000 for the establishment of TV Lab. At the time, [[Howard Klein (music critic)|Howard Klein]] was Assistant Director at the Rockefeller Foundation and played an instrumental role in the Rockefeller Foundation's decision to donate to TV Lab at Thirteen/WNET, working with [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]'s Fred Barzyk and artist Nam June Paik, among others. Initially, [[John Jay Iselin]], WNET's President at the time, suggested Robert Kotlowitz for the role of TV Lab director, but artists involved in the project expressed discontent with the proposal. Barzyk then suggested David Loxton for the position of Director, and in 1972 TV Lab began under Loxton's direction with additional grants from the New York State Council on the Arts.&lt;ref name="SturkenKlein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturken|first=Marita|title=Howard Klein and the Rockefeller Foundation's funding of the media arts|journal=Afterimage|date=January 1987|volume=14|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 1974, TV Lab primarily operated through an artist-in-residence program, supporting artists in the creation of [[video art]]. [[Nam June Paik]], [[Dimitri Devyatkin]], [[Ed Emshwiller]], [[Shirley Clarke]], and [[Douglas Davis (artist)|Douglas Davis]] were among artists who participated in the artist-in-residence program during this initial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=London|first=Barbara|title=Video: A Selected Chronology, 1963-1983|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1985|volume=45|issue=3|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[TVTV (video collective)|TVTV video collective]] came to Loxton seeking support for a guerrilla video project about guru Maharaj-Ji and his followers at the Houston Astrodome.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision" /&gt; This became TV Lab's first video documentary, ''Lord of the Universe'', marking the beginning of TV Lab's venture into non-fiction video.

In 1975, the Video Tape Review (VTR) series hosted by Russell Connor was established as part of TV Lab, airing until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gever|first=Martha|title=Pressure Points: Video in the Public Sphere|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1985|volume=45|issue=3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; VTR was used to introduce viewers to artists at TV Lab and provide some exposure to their work, and in its two years, featured the work of artists and video collectives including Jon Alpert and Keiko Tsuno, TVTV, Broadside TV, and Video Freex.  In 1977, David Loxton created the Independent Documentary Fund (IDF) at TV Lab, founded by the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. The IDF provided funds for independent documentaries such as [[Jack Willis|Jack Willis']] ''[[Paul Jacobs and the Nuclear Gang]]'' and [[Rob Epstein|Robert Epstein's]] ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Howard|title=Nam June Paik and TV Lab: License to Create|url=http://media.gfem.org/node/9494|publisher=Grantmakers in Film and Electronic Media|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006045021/http://media.gfem.org/node/9494|archivedate=2013-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, TV Lab lost funding from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] when Program Fund Director Lewis Freedman did not renew CPB funds, and TV Lab was unable to match required funds from the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SturkenKlein" /&gt;

The Dinner and Ball in honour of [[Paul I of Russia|Count]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Countess De Nord]]. Teatro San Benedetto, 22nd January 1782]]
[[File:L'italiana in Algeri set design by Francesco Bagnara.jpg|thumb|210 px|Set design by [[Francesco Bagnara]] for the production of ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' at the Teatro San Benedetto in 1826]]
The '''Teatro San Benedetto''' was a theatre in [[Venice]], particularly prominent in the operatic life of the city in the 18th and early 19th centuries. It saw the premieres of over 140 [[operas]], including Rossini's ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'', and was the theatre of choice for the presentation of ''[[opera seria]]'' until [[La Fenice]] was built in 1792.

==History==
The small, elegant theatre was first constructed by [[Grimani|Michele Grimani]] on land owned by the [[House of Venier|Venier]] family. It was inaugurated on 26 December 1755 with a performance of [[Gioacchino Cocchi]]'s opera ''Zoe''. In 1766 the ownership of the San Benedetto passed from Grimani to a consortium of [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] families in Venice who had been [[Box (theatre)|box]] holders at the theatre. The original design of the theatre was circular. However it was rebuilt in the traditional horseshoe shape following a fire in 1773. 

In 1765 [[Vincenzo Galeotti]] who danced here from 1761 became the ballet master of the theatre and staged his first ballet here (at that time besides Galeotty and his wife Antonia there were two soloists and 16 corps de ballet dancers in the company). In 1772—1773 the ballet master of San Benedetto was [[Gasparo Angiolini]].

In 1782 Teatro San Benedetto hosted the ball in honour of Count and Countess De Nord, Russian prince [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel Petrovich]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|his spouse]], visiting Venice. 

In 1786 the owners' consortium had to cede the theatre to the Venier family following a lawsuit, and later went on to build La Fenice. The theatre then became the '''Teatro Venier''' (or Teatro Venier in San Benedetto). 

In 1810, the ownership passed to the impresario Giovanni Gallo, and for a time it was known as the '''Teatro Gallo'''. His sons, who had inherited the theatre in 1847, renamed it '''Teatro Rossini''' in 1868 in honour of [[Gioachino Rossini]] whose operas ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' and ''[[Eduardo e Cristina]]'' had premiered there earlier in the century, but by then its glory days as an opera house were over.

In 1937 the building was completely remodelled as a [[movie theater]], the Cinema Rossini, with a new facade by the Italian architect [[Carlo Scarpa]]. The cinema was closed in 2007 and will undergo restoration in 2010 in a project financed by the City of Venice.

'''Temple Bar Gallery + Studios''' ('''TBG+S''') is located in the centre of [[Temple Bar, Dublin]]. 

==Description==
The organisation was founded in 1983 and the original studios and gallery were located in a former shirt factory. The current building is a mid-nineties structure that was built on the same site as part of the Temple Bar Architectural Framework Plan. The building is designed by Irish architects McCullough/Mulvin, who were one of the architectural practices involved in the Group 91 consortium that wrote the plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/tag/group-91-architects/|title=Group '91 Architects Archives – Archiseek – Irish Architecture|website=Archiseek – Irish Architecture|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The building contains a [[contemporary art|contemporary visual art]] gallery and thirty artists studios.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiseek.com/2010/1994-temple-bar-gallery-studios/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublinculturetrail.ie/Venue.aspx?id=124bc173-a5de-4b8d-ab1d-7568d9a34b17 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908025902/http://www.dublinculturetrail.ie/Venue.aspx?id=124bc173-a5de-4b8d-ab1d-7568d9a34b17 |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Temple Bar Gallery + Studios is a limited company with charitable status that is artist-led.  The voluntary Board is formally elected by the artist membership and comprises four artist members and five external professionals with different expertise and business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Board members :: Temple Bar Gallery + Studios :: Dublin Ireland.|url = http://www.templebargallery.com/info/about/board|website = ''templebargallery.com''|accessdate = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple Bar Gallery + Studios is a [[Non-profit organization|not for profit]] registered charity and receives its core funding from [[Arts Council of Ireland|the Arts Council of Ireland]]. TBG+ S is part of a residency exchange programme with HIAP International Residency Exchange Programme. The gallery has been chosen to receive funding of an exchange of a student in Finland. In 2008 the Finnish photographer [[Heli Rekula]] spent her year here.&lt;ref name=kias&gt;[http://www.finnish-institute.org.uk/en/articles/240-heli-rekula Irish/Finnish Artist Exchange Award 2008], Finnish Institute, 2008.

In 2013 a sculpture by Irish artist [[Garrett Phelan]] consisting of a metal arch bearing the words ''Our Union Only in Truth'' was added to the roof of the building. The commission was funded through an online crowd funding campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Union Only in Truth: Garrett Phelan on Dublin's newest landmark|url = http://totallydublin.ie/arts-culture/our-union-only-in-truth-garrett-phelan-on-dublins-newest-landmark/|website = Totally Dublin|accessdate = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Temple Bar Gallery + Studios – For Impact Learning {{!}} Newstream|url = http://www.businesstoarts.ie/newstream/blog/temple-bar-gallery-studios-for-impact-learning/|website = www.businesstoarts.ie|accessdate = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Death of Polydorus''''' is one of a set of seven tapestries showing a scene from the ''[[Iliad]]'' by Homer, here the death of Priam's son [[Polydorus (son of Priam)|Polydorus]] in book VI, link 290 and book XXIV, line 49. It was produced between 1623 and 1626 and is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]].

It was commissioned from a Chinese manufacturer during the [[Ming dynasty]] or [[Qing dynasty]] by Francisco Mascarenhas, Portuguese governor of Macao from 1623 to 1626, since the medallions bear a female serpent and there is a lion a shield in each corner, the Mascarenhas family arms.

The '''Theatre Royal''' in Manchester, England, opened in 1845. Situated next to the [[Free Trade Hall]], it is the oldest surviving theatre in Manchester.&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ManchesterEveningNews20111103"/&gt; It was commissioned by Mancunian businessman [[John Knowles (Manchester)|John Knowles]] who wanted a theatre venue in the city.

The Theatre Royal operated as a theatre from 1845 until 1921, when it closed in the face of growing competition from the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]] and [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]]. The building has since been converted numerous times for use as a cinema, bingo hall and nightclub. It has been unoccupied since 2009.

==Architecture==
The theatre, which stands on an island site on the south side of Peter Street, is constructed in [[sandstone]] [[ashlar]].  It is in two storeys, with an attic, and is in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style.  Around the building, between the upper storey and the attic, is a modillioned [[cornice]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1246667|desc= Royale Club, Manchester|accessdate= 26 September 2010|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its entrance front facing Peter Street is symmetrical with three [[bay (architecture)|bays]], the central bay being wider than the lateral bays.  The central bay is in the form of a [[portico]], with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns and [[pilaster]]s.  Its [[entablature]] contains a central semicircular arch breaking through to the [[gable]].  Steps lead up to entrances in each bay.  Above the central entrance is a [[pediment]]ed [[niche (architecture)|niche]] containing a statue of [[William Shakespeare]], which is based on the statue by [[Peter Scheemakers]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The lateral bays contain windows with balconies in the upper storey.{{sfn|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=322}}  Along the sides of the theatre are alternating rectangular windows and panels, with a blank semicircular arch above each window.  The interior of the theatre has been altered, but retains its 1875 gallery.  The theatre was designated as a Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[listed building]] on 3&amp;nbsp;October 1974.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  The authors of the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series describe it as a "splendid classical composition in stone, one of the best examples of theatre architecture surviving anywhere in England from the first half of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century".{{sfn|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=322}} The [[Theatres Trust]] described it as "unique and architecturally significant", with the façade being "one of the finest examples of theatre architecture to have survived in Britain from the first half of the nineteenth century", stating that it influenced the design of the [[Royal Opera House, London]].&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

==Use as a Theatre==
Manchester appears to have two previous Theatre Royals before the current building was constructed in 1845. The first opened in [[Spring Gardens, Manchester|Spring Gardens]] on 5 June 1775 and operated on that site until the expiration of the proprietors' lease in 1807.&lt;ref name=Collectanea&gt;{{citation |title=Collectanea relating to Manchester and its neighbourhood, at various periods |volume=2 |year=1867 |publisher=[[Chetham Society]] |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acI4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Theatre Royal opened in Fountain Street on 12 July 1807 and was destroyed by fire on 7 March 1844.&lt;ref name=Collectanea/&gt; John Knowles took over the management of this second Theatre Royal some time before the fire, at a time when the [[theatre]] in Manchester was at its lowest ebb.&lt;ref&gt;'Index to the report from the Select Committee on Theatrical Licenses and Regulations', 1866, House of Commons Parliamentary Papers, vol. XVI.1, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles set up a strong [[Stock company (acting)|stock company]] and proved himself a very capable, though somewhat authoritarian, [[theatre manager]]. However, following the 1844 fire the proprietors of the theatre in Fountain Street refused to rebuild it.

At a public dinner in his honour in July 1844, Knowles was presented a plate "in acknowledgement of his energetic and successful efforts to revive national drama in Manchester".&lt;ref name="John Knowles 1844, p. 5"&gt;'Dinner to John Knowles, Jun, Esq', ''The Manchester Guardian'', 17 July 1844, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles told the gathering that if they could get no one else to build a theatre then he would do it himself. As a result, Knowles bought the [[patent rights]] and set about finding a site for the new theatre.{{sfn|Manchester Central Library|1979|p=18}} Knowles had always been an admirer of theatrical performances and he was anxious to see their renovation in this, his native town. He desired to see the revival of the legitimate drama, and the plays represented in a manner duly worthy of them.&lt;ref name="John Knowles 1844, p. 5"/&gt;

[[Image:(Former) Theatre Royal and (Former) Free Trade Hall, Manchester.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre Royal front facade on the left with the [[Free Trade Hall]].]]
Knowles found a new site for his theatre on Peter Street. He demolished the Wellington Inn and Brogden's Horse Bazaar.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=87}}  Knowles employed Francis Chester and John Gould Irwin as the [[architect]]s for his new theatre.{{sfn|Rudyard|Wyke|1994|p=57}}  In preparation for the building of the new Theatre Royal, Knowles and Chester went to London and visited most of the metropolitan theatres, noting their areas, internal forms, [[Acoustics|acoustic capabilities]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;'The New Theatre Royal, Peter-Street', ''The Manchester Guardian'', 2 October 1844, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  With a cost of £23,000, the new Theatre Royal opened to an audience of 2,500.{{sfn|Manchester Central Library|1979|p=19}}  Precautionary measures against fire were taken by placing a [[Water tank|tank]] on the roof capable of holding 20,000&amp;nbsp;gallons of water, which was connected by pipes to the stage and the [[green room]]. Its programme that night included [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber's]] ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' overture, [[Douglas Jerrold]]'s "Time works wonders" and an elaborate [[ballet]] spectacle "The Court Ball in 1740". Knowles's schedule of productions was intensive&amp;nbsp;– in one season there were 157 performances at which two and sometimes three plays were performed. The popularity of the theatre grew. [[Charles Dickens]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] and [[George Cruikshank|George Cruickshank]]{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=87}} were amongst notable people who appeared at the theatre. The theatre was dedicated to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and Knowles installed a [[Carrara marble]] statue of the playwright above the entrance. It was Manchester's finest outdoor statue.{{sfn|Rudyard|Wyke|1994|p=57}} In 1875, after years of success, Knowles severed his connections with the theatre, disposing of it to a [[limited company]] for £50,000.{{sfn|Manchester Central Library|1979|p=19}}

==Later use==
In 1921 the theatre was converted to a [[Movie theater|cinema]] due to competition from the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester]] and the [[Manchester Opera House]]. In 1972 the theatre became a [[bingo hall]], then a [[nightclub]] in 1978,&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt; at which point various lighting bridges and rigs were added.&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org" /&gt; It was known successively as the "Discotheque Royale", Infinity then M2 and finally a rename and rebrand to Coliseum due to the trouble caused by the clientele it attracted. The nightclub closed in 2009.&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

In 2008 a {{convert|118|m|ft|abbr=on}} 28-storey office and retail tower was proposed, called "Theatre Royal Tower", that would be connected to the back of the original theatre. It was designed by [[Stephenson Bell]] with [[The Benmore Group]] as the developer.&lt;ref name="skyscraper" /&gt;

It was announced in 2011 by owners Benmore that the Theatre Royal would receive a £2&amp;nbsp;million refurbishment to convert the building into a live music venue.&lt;ref name="ManchesterEveningNews20111103"&gt;{{cite news |title=Theatre Royal to become live music venue&amp;nbsp;– with £2m refurb |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1463880_theatre-royal-to-become-live-music-venue---with-2m-refurb |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to convert the building into a hotel and live music venue never came about.&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

Despite the promise of investment, Benmore sold the building in November 2012.&lt;ref name="MC_21Nov12" /&gt; It was purchased by the [[Edwardian Group]], who owned the [[Radisson Blu]] Edwardian hotel adjacent to the theatre in the [[Free Trade Hall]].&lt;ref name="MEN_20Nov12" /&gt; The building could potentially be restored as a theatre or banqueting hall as a complimentary extension for the hotel.&lt;ref name="MC_21Nov12" /&gt;

{{Asof|December 2016}} the building remains unused, with the Edwardian Group carrying out feasibility studies for the building. [[Theatres Trust]] has placed the building on its "Theatre Buildings At Risk" reigster.&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

The 1845 exterior façade is virtually intact,&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org" /&gt; and the building retains the balcony from 1875.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Theatres Trust]] has said that the internal conversions for its past usage in various guises appear to have obscured&amp;nbsp;– rather than destroyed&amp;nbsp; – the interior. The Trust classify the original interior work as "restorable as a theatre".&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org" /&gt;

==Reception==
The series has received overwhelmingly enthusiastic critical reception. Journalist and critic Hugh Hart, writing for ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' noted: "[[Laurent Touil-Tartour]] exploits sharp edits, a driving score and spare cinematography to extract maximum tension and an handsomely filmed suspense drama.”&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|author=Wired Magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/03/urban-wolf/ |title=Spy Thriller Urban Wolf Crackles With Tension (But Without Words) |publisher=wired.com |date= March 31, 2010|accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Hart also enjoyed the usage of non-verbal storytelling: "Not a word gets spoken in Urban Wolf. But even without dialogue, French filmmaker Laurent Touil-Tartour has made an unusually sophisticated spy-tech thriller.”&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

Critic Jandy Stone Hardesty, in her review for Row Three, said that Touil-Tartour has “a nice flair for composition and a good sense of visual storytelling, he also knows how to do good twists and suggest things rather than spell them out, something I really appreciated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jandy Hardesty |url=http://www.rowthree.com/2010/05/16/urban-wolf-is-watching-you/ |title=Urban Wolf is watching you |publisher=rowthree.com |date= May 16, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bibbiani, in ''[[CraveOnline]]'', called it "an exciting little bit of filmmaking that deserves its notoriety and is worth howling about”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William Bibbiani |url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/reviews/138846-urban-wolf-review/ |title=Urban Wolf review |publisher=craveonline.com |date= May 12, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liz Shannon Miller writing in ''[[GigaOM]]'' wrote that "“Urban Wolf is a gripping thriller that stands out as proudly unique. Some of Wolf‘s execution might emulate classic 1970s thrillers, but the concept is pure 21st century, playing nimbly with issues of privacy and paranoia. When a director can make even the eating of a potato chip seem malevolent (as occurs in the yet-to-premiere episode 7), you know you’ve watching something special.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Liz Shannon Miller |url=http://gigaom.com/video/urban-wolf-a-near-perfect-21st-century-thriller/ |title=Urban Wolf a Near-Perfect 21st Century Thriller |publisher=gigaom.com |date= May 13, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing it for the ''[[Mingle Media TV Network]]'', journalist Kristyn Burtt wrote: "The reason this series stands out amongst the pack is its cinematic feel and the utilization of mise en scene.  You don't hear the main character utter a word until Episode 7, and boy, is it effective.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kristyn Burtt |url=http://redcarpetcloset.blogspot.com/2010/05/i-came-upon-this-series-at-last-years.html |title=Urban Wolf behind the scenes |publisher=The Web Files |date= May 17, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awarding the film a five out of five star rating, Feo Amante's film critic E.C.McMullen Jr. wrote: "The tension from episode to episode is incredible and Laurent just keeps ramping it up. With its beautiful settings (shot in Paris, France), excellent cinematography, and super tight, witty action, this could very well define the future of online cinema. I'm not kidding! URBAN WOLF is a Turbo Thrust Cat and Mouse Thriller with a V8 engine!”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=E.C.McMullen Jr. |url=http://www.feoamante.com/Movies/STU/urban_wolf.html/ |title=Urban Wolf review |publisher=feoamante.com |date= May 14, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Workington Opera House''', or ''The Opera'' as it was known, is a purpose built [[theatre]] located in Workington, Cumbria, England. Originally built as the Queen’s Jubilee Hall &amp; Opera House it was gutted by [[fire]] in 1927 and rebuilt with a fine wide [[auditorium]], and Ornamental ceiling with seating for 1200. The theatre has good sightlines and a large stage and currently sits empty after its former use as a bingo hall ended in 2004.

==History==
[[Image:Operahouse2010.jpg|thumb|alt=The Workington Opera House.|The Workington Opera House - 2010.]]
The theatre was designed by T. L. Banks &amp; Townsend and had a small [[auditorium]] with two [[balconies]] accommodating 1,130 people. The theatre was also equipped with a small [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] with a [[proscenium]] width of 11 metres, a depth of 9.14 metres and a grid height of 14 metres. An [[orchestra]] pit for 16 musicians was also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/OperaHouseWorkington.htm |title= The Opera House, Pow Street, Workington, Cumbria |publisher=arthurlloyd.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

"The novel ''Prípad medička'' [The Medical Student Case] is and is not about the actual murder of medical student Ľudmila Cervanová. It is, because Ľuba Lesná became familiar with this affair over a long period of time and discovered many facts and a lot of information used in the book. And it is not, because the novel is written as a literary fiction about the abduction and murder of a character, medical student Alena Hronská. Why did the famous author of non-fiction books (''The Abduction of the President's Son'', ''The Abduction of Democracy'') not stick to pure facts this time? And why did she decide to risk telling her own version of this affair? Because, as she says herself in the book's introduction, according to pure facts and documents it should be clear to readers that this case did not take place the way that official police and judicial versions described it. The question — so what happened? — remains unanswered." (Martin Mojžiš, ''.týždeň '')&lt;ref name=tyz1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tyzden.sk/sk/kultura/kniha01_29.php|publisher=''.týždeň''|title=Medička Cervanová|date=2007-07-14|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Just make sure nobody ever finds out what really happened. I have borrowed this sentence from Ľuba Lesná’s book, ''Prípad medička'' (Petrus Publishers, 238 pp)... One can’t help asking — could all this really be true? Because, if the murder of the medical student really happened the way the author describes it (and I hasten to add that personally I find it quite plausible) why has the truth not prevailed? The answer is probably in the times we live in, in our reality that easily turns lies into truth... While reading Ľuba Lesná’s latest book I could not get the first sentence from Péter Esterházy out of my head: 'It’s bloody hard to lie if one does not know the complete truth.' And I don’t mean the book’s 'heroes', the ŠtB officers... Luckily, the medical student’s sad story reminds us that the truth, even if revealed only in part, has the power to awaken our conscience, albeit painfully, with adrenaline throbbing in our veins. That is why politicians and many public officials consider it an unwanted commodity." (Štefan Markuš, ''SME'')&lt;ref name=sme&gt;{{cite news|url=http://komentare.sme.sk/c/3450022/chceme-poznat-pravdu.html|publisher=''SME''|title=Chceme poznať pravdu?|date=2007-08-22|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'The time is not yet right for me to speak the truth about the medical student’s case, he said in his unforgettable sonorous voice...' I quote from the book ''Prípad medička'' by Ľuba Lesná, inspired — quite openly — by Ľudmila Cervanová’s murder. Although it is a work of fiction, the author cannot hide the fact that she is a journalist par excellence, or her extraordinary personal commitment to uncovering the centre of the disgusting octopus, the nerve centre of an operation that entangled and destroyed six innocent lives. Ľuba Lesná seems to have intimate knowledge of all these horrors and because 'the time is not yet right' for the truth to come out, she had to do it herself, by turning Cervanová’s case into fiction. I salute you, Mrs. Lesná!..." ([[Lucia Piussi]], ''.týždeň)&lt;ref name=tyz2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tyzden.sk/casopis/2007/29/jednym-dychom-5.html|publisher=''.týždeň''|title=Jedným dychom|date=2007-07-14|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If the adversary in a detective story is a simpleton, the discovery of his identity is rarely pleasurable for the reader... The author of the novel demonstrates on a broad scale that everything in this case was fabricated by the communist intelligence service (ŠtB). All the ambitious investigator wanted to do was to indict as many young people as possible and he couldn't care less whether they were guilty or not, or if they had the means to commit the crime or not. Eventually the reader finds out that everything boils down to the so-called Arab link—the terrorist training facility for Arab students at Piešťany airport." (Michal Schuster, ''Knižná revue'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.litcentrum.sk/40458|publisher=Knižná revue|title=Keď je protivník primitívny|year=2007|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
