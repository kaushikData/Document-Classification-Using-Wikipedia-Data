'''''180''''' (also known as '''''180: Changing the Heart of a Nation''''' or '''''180 Movie''''') is a 33-minute 2011 [[anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion]] documentary film produced by New Zealand filmmaker [[Ray Comfort]], founder of [[Living Waters Publications]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/adl-slams-movie-that-compares-holocaust-to-abortion-1.395124 |title=ADL slams movie that compares Holocaust to abortion |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=November 12, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |first=Aimee |last=Neistat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Florida Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://floridaindependent.com/55473/180-movie |title=Group wants to push movie comparing abortion to the Holocaust into high schools |work=[[The Florida Independent]] |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |first=Ashley |last=Lopez}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is distributed by Living Waters on DVD and has been posted publicly on the film's official website and YouTube. The film is notable for comparing abortions to the [[Holocaust]].

==Synopsis==
The film begins by showing images of the [[Holocaust]], and stating that [[Adolf Hitler]] sanctioned the killing of 11 million people.  This is followed by Comfort interviewing people about Hitler; their responses indicate a lack of historical knowledge, although he also finds a neo-Nazi who says he loves Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dulaney|first=Josh|title=Holocaust Deniers in Huntington Beach Hear About Hayzoos|url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2012/03/holocaust_deniers_huntingto_beach.php|newspaper=OC Weekly|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort proposes a hypothetical situation to his interviewees, asking if they would kill Hitler if they had the opportunity at that time in history. He asks more hypotheticals dealing with what his interviewees might do in other circumstances related to the Holocaust.

He then switches his topic to make similar comparisons to abortion within the United States and the [[right to life]].

The documentary concludes with Comfort stating that over 50 million abortions have occurred to date; he calls this the "American Holocaust".

==Background==
The documentary was originally intended to be a free DVD supplement to Comfort's book ''Hitler, God, and the Bible''.&lt;ref name="CE1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Nov11/Art_Nov11_03.html |title=Pro-life documentary '180' gaining national attention |work=[[Christian Examiner]] |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort compared his film to the YouTube video ''[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]'', which had accumulated millions of views, and offered his hope that ''180'' would achieve the same viewership and thus serve to shift opinion on abortion.&lt;ref name="Florida Independent"/&gt;

==Reception==
Within days, ''180'' had over half a million views on YouTube,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.christiantoday.com/article/180-movie-reaches-half-a-million-views-after-9-days/12174.htm |title='180' movie reaches half a million views after 9 days |work=[[The Christian Post]] |publisher=[[Christian Today]] |last=Murashko |first=Alex |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while weeks later, it hit the 1.2 million mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctentertainment/2011/10/uncomfortable-video-raises-hac-1.html |title=Un-Comfort-able Video Raises Hackles Online |work=[[Christianity Today]] |last=Moring |first=Mark |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 180 movie passed 3 million views as of May 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y2KsU_dhwI |title="180" Movie |work=[[YouTube Video Counter]] |date=May 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, ''180'' has over 5.3 million views on YouTube.

On October 12, 2011, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' wrote an article critical of ''180''. The article quoted Holocaust survivor [[Elie Wiesel]], who said in a 1991 interview with ''On The Issues'' Magazine, "It is blasphemy to reduce a tragedy of such monumental proportions to this human tragedy, and abortion is a human tragedy."&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/180-abortion-holocaust-prolife_n_1007165.html |title='180' Documentary Compares Abortion To Holocaust, Goes Viral Among Pro-Life Groups |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |first=Ileana |last=Llorens |date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Huffington Post'', "the film, which shows a series of graphic images, is gaining attention not only because of its controversial comparison, but because it highlights 14 people who do not know who Adolf Hitler was".&lt;ref name="huff"/&gt;

''[[The Christian Examiner]]'' called the film "dramatic" and stated that it was "gaining national attention". It reported on Ray Comfort's use of "morally charged" questions and his attempts to change the minds of "mostly college-aged" interviewees, and how eight of those interviewed who previously espoused a pro-choice view changed their minds as a result of the interview.&lt;ref name="CE1"/&gt;

British newspaper ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'' criticised the film for bludgeoning and hectoring its subjects and audience and using "verbal violence" when love was the better way to change people's minds; however it also found that many of its readers agreed with the film's message and tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Francis|title=Should pro-life campaigners compare abortion to the Holocaust?|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2011/10/28/should-pro-life-campaigners-compare-abortion-to-the-holocaust/|newspaper=Catholic Herald|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] criticized the film for equating the [[World War II]] murder of [[Jew]]s during the Holocaust to abortion in the United States and called it "cynical and perverse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence, Jr|first=Calvin|title=Mike Huckabee Premieres Anti-Abortion Documentary in Latest of Films With Similar Message|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/mike-huckabee-premieres-anti-abortion-documentary-latest-2011/story?id=15138231#all|newspaper=ABC News|date=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticized the film's use of images of bodies in [[concentration camp]]s and Jews being shot and in mass graves intercut with segments of people offering opinions about the Holocaust and abortion. It also challenged Comfort's method of critically questioning those interviewees who spoke negatively about Hitler and yet were more liberal in the views about abortion and women's right to choose. [[Abraham H. Foxman]], the national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] and himself a Holocaust survivor, criticized the film, stating "This film is a perverse attempt to make a case against abortion in America through the cynical abuse of the memory of those killed in the Holocaust," adding "It is, quite frankly, one of the most offensive and outrageous abuses of the memory of the Holocaust we have seen in years."  He decried the film's assertion that there is somehow "a moral equivalency between the Holocaust and abortion" and its bringing Jews and Jewish history into a discussion that then urges viewers to "repent and accept Jesus as their savior."&lt;ref name="Haaretz1"/&gt;

''[[The Florida Independent]]'' reported that Ray Comfort is "turning his attention to high schools" in order to "fill in gaps in education about the Holocaust". It reports the film as "largely anti-abortion propaganda" which has "become extremely popular in [[anti-abortion]] circles".&lt;ref name="Florida Independent"/&gt;

The makers also had trouble with some [[billboard]] owners who refused to carry advertising for the film, with Comfort complaining one Jewish company owner was particularly opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billboard companies refuse to advertise pro-life film '180'|url=http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue14653.html|accessdate=July 13, 2012|newspaper=Christian Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort also said "three of the largest billboard companies in Southern California" refused to advertise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lopez|first=Ashley|title=Billboard companies refuse to advertise movie comparing abortion to the Holocaust|url=http://floridaindependent.com/58218/billboards-180-movie|newspaper=The Florida Independent|date=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a woman from the United Kingdom was dismissed from a Christian school and then contacted by [[Child Protective Services]] for showing the film to her own children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butts|first=Charlie|title=Woman reported for sharing pro-life film with her own children|url=http://www.onenewsnow.com/culture/2015/01/06/woman-reported-for-sharing-pro-life-film-with-her-own-children|publisher=OneNewsNow|date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The documentary was produced by Ray Comfort with the help of his ministry, [[Living Waters Publications]].  It was released on Sunday, September 18, 2011.  As of November 4, 2011, the film had received over 1 million views on its official website.&lt;ref name="Florida Independent"/&gt;

The '''African National Congress''' ('''ANC''') is the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa's]] governing political party. It has been the ruling party of [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post-apartheid South Africa]] on the national level, beginning with the election of [[Nelson Mandela]] in the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 election]]. Today, the ANC remains the dominant political party in South Africa, winning every election since 1994. [[Cyril Ramaphosa]], the incumbent [[President of South Africa]], has served as leader of the ANC since 18 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/cyril-ramaphosa-chosen-to-lead-south-africas-ruling-anc-party|title=Cyril Ramaphosa chosen to lead South Africa's ruling ANC party|last=Burke|first=Jason|date=2017-12-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=19 December 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded on 8 January 1912 by [[John Langalibalele Dube]] in [[Bloemfontein]] as the '''South African Native National Congress (SANNC)''', its primary mission was to give voting rights to black and mixed-race Africans and, from the 1940s, to end [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=African National Congress (ANC)|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/African-National-Congress|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ANC originally attempted to use nonviolent protests to end apartheid, however, the [[Sharpeville massacre]] resulted in the deaths of 69 black Africans and contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government. On 8 April 1960, the administration of [[Charles Robberts Swart]], banned the ANC and forced the party to leave South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa Bans African National Congress|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/south-africa-bans-african-national-congress|website=African American Registry|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ban, the ANC formed the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation) to fight against apartheid utilizing [[guerrilla warfare]] and sabotage. On 3 February 1990, State President [[F. W. de Klerk]] lifted the ban on the ANC and released [[Nelson Mandela]] on 11 February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ottaway|first1=David|title=S. Africa Lifts Ban on ANC, Other Groups|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/s_africa/stories/anc020390.htm|website=Washington Post|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 1992, the [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992|apartheid referendum]] was passed by the voters removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election. Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 60% in all general elections, including the most recent [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the African National Congress}}
The founding of the SANNC was in direct response to injustice against black South Africans at the hands of the government then in power. It can be said that the SANNC had its origins in a pronouncement by [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]] who said in 1911, "Forget all the past differences among Africans and unite in one national organisation." The SANNC was founded the following year on 8 January 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs/misc/2010/umzabalazo.html The African National Congress]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225042601/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs%2Fmisc%2F2010%2Fumzabalazo.html|date=25 February 2011}}. Anc.org.za. Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the newly formed [[Union of South Africa]] began a systematic oppression of black people in South Africa. The [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Land Act]] was promulgated in 1913 forcing many black South Africans from their farms into the cities and towns to work, and to restrict their movement within South Africa.

By 1919, the SANNC was leading a campaign against passes (an ID which black South Africans had to possess). However, it then became dormant in the mid-1920s. During that time, black people were also represented by the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union|ICU]] and the previously white-only Communist party. In 1923, the organisation became the African National Congress, and in 1929 the ANC supported a militant mineworkers' strike.

By 1927, [[Josiah Tshangana Gumede|J.T. Gumede]] (president of the ANC) proposed co-operation with the Communists in a bid to revitalise the organisation, but he was voted out of power in the 1930s. This led to the ANC becoming largely ineffectual and inactive, until the mid-1940s when the ANC was remodelled as a mass movement.

The ANC responded to attacks on the rights of black South Africans, as well as calling for strikes, boycotts, and defiance. This led to a later [[Defiance Campaign]] in the 1950s, a mass movement of resistance to [[apartheid]]. The government tried to stop the ANC by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the ANC, however these measures ultimately proved to be ineffective.

In 1955, the [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] officially adopted the [[Freedom Charter]], stating the core principles of the South African [[Congress Alliance]], which consisted of the African National Congress and its allies the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), the [[South African Indian Congress]], the [[South African Congress of Democrats]] (COD) and the Coloured People's Congress.&lt;ref name="pil-lut"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pillay|first=Gerald J.|title=Voices of Liberation: Albert Lutuli|year=1993|publisher=HSRC Press|isbn=0-7969-1356-0|pages=82–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government claimed that this was a communist document, and consequently leaders of the ANC and Congress were arrested. 1960 saw the [[Sharpeville massacre]], in which 69 people were killed when police opened fire on anti-apartheid protesters.

===uMkhonto we Sizwe===
{{main|uMkhonto we Sizwe}}
[[uMkhonto we Sizwe]] or MK, translated "The Spear of the Nation", was the military wing of the ANC. Partly in response to the [[Sharpeville massacre]] of 1960, individual members of the ANC found it necessary to consider violence to combat what passive protest had failed to quell. 

In co-operation with the [[South African Communist Party]], MK was founded in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/umkhonto-we-sizwe-mk SAhistory.org.za] Retrieved 26 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; MK commenced the military struggle against apartheid with acts of sabotage aimed at the installations of the state, and in the early stages was reluctant to target civilian targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02424/04lv02730/05lv02918/06lv02925.htm|title=Documented proof of ANC's sabotage plans - The O'Malley Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MK was responsible for the deaths of both civilians and members of the military. Acts committed by MK include the [[Church Street bombing]], the [[Durban beach-front bombing|Magoo's Bar bombing]] and bombing a branch of the Standard Bank in Roodepoort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/magoo039s-bar-bombed Magoo’s Bar is bombed, South African History Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1983"&gt;{{cite news|title=1983: Car bomb in South Africa kills 16|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 March 2015|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/20/newsid_4326000/4326975.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/04/world/4-die-in-worst-south-africa-bombing-in-a-year.html 4 Die in Worst South Africa Bombing in a Year], [[New York Times]], 4 June 1988&lt;/ref&gt; It was integrated into the [[South African National Defence Force]] by 1994.&lt;!--Citations on [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] and [[South African National Defence Force]] pages.--&gt;

The ANC and its members were officially removed from the US terrorism watch list in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7484517.stm Mandela taken off US terror list], [[BBC News]], 1 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The ANC deems itself a force of national liberation in the post-apartheid era; it officially defines its agenda as the ''National Democratic Revolution''. The ANC is a member of the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref name=socialistinternational/&gt; It also sets forth the redressing of socio-economic differences stemming from colonial- and apartheid-era policies as a central focus of ANC policy.

The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is described as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society in which people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or [[Concentric objects|concentric circles]] the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out of the success of the NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include [[Joe Slovo]], [[Joel Netshitenzhe]] and [[Tshilidzi Marwala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Slovo|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/slovo/1988/national-democratic-revolution.htm|title=The South African Working Class and the National Democratic Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Joel|last=Netshitenzhe|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|title=Understanding the tasks of the moment|work=Umrabulo|volume=25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622025249/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|archivedate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marwala|first=T|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2844|title=The anatomy of capital and the national democratic revolution|work=Umrabulo|volume=29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018065656/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2844 |archivedate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the ANC declared itself to be a social democratic party.&lt;ref&gt;The Mail &amp; Guardian A-Z of South African Politics by Barbara Ludman, Paul Stober, and Ferial Haffagee&lt;/ref&gt;

The 53rd National Conference of the ANC, held in 2015, stated in its "Discussion Document" that "China economic development trajectory remains a leading example of the triumph of humanity over adversity. The exemplary role of the collective leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] in this regard should be a guiding lodestar of our own struggle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf page 161]&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to state that "The collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]] and socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern European States influenced our transition towards the negotiated political settlement in our country. The cause of events in the world changed tremendously in favour of the US led imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf page 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripartite Alliance===
{{main|Tripartite Alliance}}
The ANC holds a historic alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) and [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU), known as the ''Tripartite Alliance''. The SACP and COSATU have not contested any election in South Africa, but field candidates through the ANC, hold senior positions in the ANC, and influence party policy and dialogue. During Mbeki's presidency, the government took a more pro-capitalist stance, often running counter to the demands of the SACP and COSATU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&amp;article_id=397|title=ANC 'At Fork in the Road'|author=Paul Trewhela|date=8 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205932/http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&amp;article_id=397|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_displaytei&amp;id=21131&amp;title=How%20the%20tripartite%20alliance%20works&amp;creator=|title=How the Tripartite Alliance works|work=Mayibuye|volume=2|year=1991|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=COSATU and the Tripartite Alliance since 1994|first=Dale|last=McKinley|work=Rethinking the Labour Movement in the 'New' South Africa|editors=T.

===2008 schism===
Following Zuma's accession to the ANC leadership in 2007 and Mbeki's resignation as president in 2008, a number of former ANC leaders led by [[Mosiuoa Lekota]] split away from the ANC to form the [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]].

===2013 NUMSA split from Cosatu===
On 20 December 2013, a special congress of the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa]] (NUMSA), the country's biggest trade union with 338,000 members,&lt;ref name=NUMSA&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/world/africa/south-africas-biggest-union-pulls-support-for-anc.html|title=South Africa's Biggest Trade Union Pulls Its Support for A.N.C.|first=Lydia|last=Polgreen|date=20 December 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; voted to withdraw support from the ANC and SACP, and form a socialist party to protect the interests of the working class. NUMSA secretary general Irvin Jim condemned the ANC and SACP's support for big business and stated: "It is clear that the working class cannot any longer see the ANC or the SACP as its class allies in any meaningful sense."&lt;ref name=NUMSA/&gt;

==ANC flag==
[[File:Flag of the African National Congress.svg|thumb|The ANC flag with three equal horizontal bands]]
The ANC flag comprises three equal horizontal stripes – black, green and gold. Black symbolises the native people of South Africa, green represents the land and gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/content/anc-logo-colours-and-flag|title=The Flag of the African National Congress|publisher= African National Congress|accessdate= 8 January 2017|quote=The flag of the ANC is made of equal horizontal bands of black, green and gold. The black symbolises the people of South Africa who, for generations, have fought for freedom. The green represents the land, which sustained our people for centuries and from which they were removed by colonial and apartheid governments. The gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa, which belongs to all its people, but which has been used to benefit only a small racial minority.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flag was also the [[War flag|battle flag]] of [[uMkhonto we Sizwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/kids/anc-logo-colours-and-flag|title=ANC logo, colours and flag {{!}} African National Congress|website=www.anc.org.za|language=en|access-date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] used an unrelated but identical flag from 1813 to 1897.
The black, green and gold tricolor was also used on the flag of the [[KwaZulu]] [[bantustan]].

Although the colours of the new national [[Flag of South Africa]] since the transition from apartheid in 1994 have no official meaning, the three colours of the ANC flag were included in it, together with red, white and blue.&lt;ref name="Chibba2014"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Fred Brownell and the creation of the South African flag |last=Chibba |first=Shamin |work=mediaclubsouthafrica.com |date=15 June 2014 |access-date=26 August 2018 |url= http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/democracy/3878-fred-brownell-and-the-creation-of-the-south-african-flag |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party list==
Politicians in the party win a place in parliament by being on the ''Party List'', which is drawn up before the elections and enumerates, in order, the party's preferred MPs. The number of seats allocated is proportional to the popular national vote, and this determines the cut-off point.

The ANC has also gained members through the controversial [[floor crossing (South Africa)|floor crossing]] process.

Although most South African parties announced their candidate list for provincial premierships in the 2009 election, the ANC did not, as it is not required for parties to do so.&lt;ref&gt;James Myburgh [http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=120071&amp;sn=Detail The ANC's secret premier candidates]. Politicsweb.co.za. 6 March 2009. Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''ANC Today''==
In 2001, the ANC launched an online weekly web-based [[newsletter]], ''ANC Today – Online Voice of the African National Congress'' to offset the alleged bias of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fourie|first=Pieter J.|year=2008|title=Media Studies Volume 2: Policy, management and media representation|edition=second|publisher=Juta and Company|location=Cape Town|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7531OTEpD_wC&amp;pg=PA44 44]|isbn=978-0-7021-7675-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists mainly of updates on current programmes and initiatives of the ANC.

==Role of the ANC in resolving the conflict==
[[File:Old ANC logo 1990.svg|right|thumb|150px|Old logo of the ANC from 1990]]
The ANC represented the main opposition to the government during [[apartheid]] and therefore they played a major role in resolving the conflict through participating in the peacemaking and peace-building processes. Initially intelligence agents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] met in secret with ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, to judge whether conflict resolution was possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid apartheid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054317/http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid |date=20 December 2008 }}. Student.britannica.com (8 May 1996). Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions and negotiations took place leading to the eventual unbanning of the ANC and other opposing political parties by then President [[F. W. de Klerk|de Klerk]] on 2 February 1990.

The next official step towards rebuilding South Africa was the Groote Schuur Minute where the government and the ANC agreed on a common commitment towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation, as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations. The ANC negotiated the release of political prisoners and the indemnity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the Government and the ANC.

Later the Pretoria Minute represented another step towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC – the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement that came out of the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.&lt;ref name=concise&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise History of South Africa|first=Robert|last=Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next significant steps towards resolution were the Repeal of the Population Registration Act, the repeal of the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a catch-all [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed.&lt;ref name=concise/&gt; These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.

In December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa ([[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|CODESA]]) was held with the aim of establishing an interim government. However, a few months later in June 1992 the [[Boipatong massacre]] occurred and all negotiations crumbled as the ANC pulled out. After this negotiations proceeded between two agents, [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] of the ANC, and [[Roelf Meyer]] of the National Party. In over 40 sessions the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system, the fate of over 40,000 government employees and if/how the country would be divided. The result of these negotiations was an interim constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the transition, which was vital for stability within the country. A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994.&lt;ref name=concise/&gt; The ANC won 62.5% of the votes and has been in power ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidfaq/f/HowEnded.htm Apartheid FAQ: When Did Apartheid End?].

{{recentism|section|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--The ANC is 100 years old but this section only covers the recent past--&gt;
===Corruption controversies===
{{details|South African Arms Deal}}
The most prominent corruption case involving the ANC relates to a series of bribes paid to companies involved in the ongoing R55 billion [[South African Arms Deal|Arms Deal saga]], which resulted in a long term jail sentence to then Deputy President [[Jacob Zuma]]'s legal adviser [[Schabir Shaik]]. Zuma, the former South African President, was charged with fraud, bribery and corruption in the Arms Deal, but the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa due to their delay in prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pretorianews.co.za/?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId=vn20081009055615571C284334|date=9 October 2008|title=Opposition hails challenge to ANC rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ANC has also been criticised for its subsequent abolition of the [[Scorpions (South Africa)|Scorpions]], the multidisciplinary agency that investigated and prosecuted organised crime and corruption, and was heavily involved in the investigation into Zuma and Shaik. Tony Yengeni, in his position as chief whip of the ANC and head of the Parliaments defence committee has recently been named as being involved in bribing the German company [[ThyssenKrupp]] over the purchase of four corvettes for the SANDF.

Other recent corruption issues include the sexual misconduct and criminal charges of [[Beaufort West Local Municipality|Beaufort West]] municipal manager [[Truman Prince]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1700232,00.html|title=Action against Prince 'a farce'|date=5 May 2005|first=Ronel|last=Bester|work=[[Die Burger]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507032712/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0%2C%2C2-7-1442_1700232%2C00.html|archivedate=7 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oilgate]] scandal, in which millions of Rand in funds from a state-owned company were  funnelled into ANC coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Special Report: Oilgate|url=http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=oilgate|work=Mail &amp; Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814083114/http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=oilgate|archivedate=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC has also been accused of using government and civil society to fight its political battles against opposition parties such as the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]. The result has been a number of complaints and allegations that none of the political parties truly represent the interests of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=vn20080220113540685C199776|title=DA councillor's role in Delft is 'criminal'|work=Cape Argus|date=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeargus.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=3571&amp;fArticleId=vn20080228113641490C401174|title=DA's Delft councillor denies claims|work=Cape Argus|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in the "No Land!

In 2018, the ''New York Times'' reported on the killings of ANC corruption whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Norimitsu Onishi |last2=Selam Gebrekidan |title=Hit Men and Power: South Africa’s Leaders Are Killing One Another |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/world/africa/south-africa-anc-killings.html?stream=world&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosworld&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=30 September 2018 |quote=“If you understand the Cosa Nostra, you don’t only kill the person, but you also send a strong message,” said Thabiso Zulu, another A.N.C. whistle-blower who, fearing for his life, is now in hiding.  “We broke the rule of omertà,” he added, saying that the party of Nelson Mandela had become like the Mafia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condemnation over Secrecy Bill===
{{further|Protection of State Information Bill}}
In late 2011 the ANC was heavily criticised over the passage of the [[Protection of State Information Bill]], which opponents claimed would improperly restrict the [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Charl|last=du Plessis|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2011/11/22/secrecy-bill-opposition-reaching-fever-pitch|title=Secrecy bill opposition reaching fever pitch|date=22 November 2011|work=Times Live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the bill included otherwise ANC-aligned groups such as [[Congress of South African Trade Unions|COSATU]]. Notably, [[Nelson Mandela]] and other Nobel laureates [[Nadine Gordimer]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[F. W. de Klerk]] have expressed disappointment with the bill for not meeting standards of constitutionality and aspirations for freedom of information and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/11/22/mandelas-office-comments-on-s-africas-secrecy-bill.html|title=Mandela's office comments on S Africa's secrecy bill|date=22 November 2011 |author=AFP|work=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the Marikana killings===
{{further|Marikana miners' strike}}
The ANC have been criticised for its role in failing to prevent 16 August 2012 massacre of Lonmin miners at Marikana in the North West. Some allege that Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega and Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa, a close confidant of Jacob Zuma, may have given the go ahead for the police action against the miners on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/companies/who-gave-permission-to-kill-bizos-1.1408535#.UIbgQxLJX_g|title=Who gave permission to kill?: Bizos|date=22 October 2012|publisher=IOL|work=Business Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioner Phiyega of the ANC came under further criticism as being insensitive and uncaring when she was caught smiling and laughing during the Farlam Commission's video playback of the 'massacre'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-24-marikana-families-horrified-at-phiyegas-behaviour|title=Marikana families horrified at Phiyegas behaviour|date=24 October 2012|publisher=M&amp;G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] has announced that he no longer can bring himself to exercise a vote for the ANC as it is no longer the party that he and Nelson Mandela fought for, and that the party has now lost its way, and is in danger of becoming a corrupt entity in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Desmond Tutu: why I won't vote ANC|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/25/desmond-tutu-mandela-wont-vote-anc|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional Failures===
The ANC has a growing list of constitutional failures. One of the most prominent relates to president of the ANC and of the Republic, [[Jacob Zuma]], and his [[Nkandla (homestead)|Nkandla homestead's]] security upgrades, valued at around R250 million. His swimming pool, for example, was termed a 'fire pool' and his amphitheatre an 'emergency meeting point', thus leaving the taxpayer to carry the costs. After the [[Public Protector]] released her report (Secure in Comfort) which found that Zuma must pay back the money spent on the non-security features, he refused to do so. In 2016 the Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma, as well as the National Assembly, had "breached the Constitution" and failed to uphold it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thamm|first1=Marianne|title=Nkandla ConCourt ruling: President Zuma and National Assembly in breach of Constitution|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-03-31-nkandla-concourt-ruling-president-zuma-and-national-assembly-in-breach-of-constitution/#.WRwsiVP5iRv|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma apologised to the nation as follows: “The matter has caused a lot of frustration and confusion for which I apologise on my behalf and on behalf of government.” However he claimed not to have asked nor known about the non-security upgrades, despite the media reporting on them almost daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Michelle|title=Zuma apologises to the nation for Nkandla|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-04-01-zuma-on-nkandla-i-apologise0|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualification fraud===
There is also a growing trend for ANC members as well as those individuals appointed by the ANC to public positions of power to misrepresent their qualifications. The result of such lies typically lead to those appointed being unable to fulfill their obligations while being paid very large salaries, and typically cost the taxpayer large amount of money while attempting to defend themselves in court. A small selection follows:

[[Carl Niehaus]], who served as ANC speaker, claimed to have a B.A., Masters and Doctorate degrees; in reality he never received the Masters or Doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The dodgy CV of Carl Niehaus|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/the-dodgy-cv-of-carl-niehaus|accessdate=17 May 2017|publisher=PoliticsWeb|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pallo Jordan]], who served as Minister of Arts and Culture claimed to be in possession of a PhD, when in reality he has no tertiary education at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Onselen|first1=Gareth|title=Pallo Jordan's phantom doctorate|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/08/04/Pallo-Jordans-phantom-doctorate|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Mtimkulu, who was employed as chief engineer at [[Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa]] (Prasa) claimed to have a PhD in engineering, which was a lie; he was merely qualified as an engineering technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alberts|first1=Anton|title=PRASA's Daniel Mtimkulu only an engineering technologist - Anton Alberts|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/prasas-daniel-mtimkulu-only-an-engineering-technol|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mtimkulu's leadership, Prasa ordered 70 new locomotives, valued at R3.5 billion. The first 13 Afro 4000 diesel locomotives to arrive, at a cost of R600 million, were too tall to be of use on their intended routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Africa’s R600 million train blunder|url=https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/92424/south-africas-r600-million-train-blunder/|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Tshabalala]], former chairperson of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC), claimed to have a BComm degree. In reality her marks were so poor (13% for one module and 35% for another, amongst others) that she was not allowed to rewrite some of her exams. She later claimed that he degree certificate was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Presence|first1=Chantall|title=Unisa reveals SABC chair Ellen Tshabalala's dismal marks|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2014-12-03-unisa-reveals-sabc-chair-ellen-tshabalalas-dismal-marks|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending Tshabalala in court cost the SABC more than R1 million.&lt;ref name="politicsweb.co.za"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Gavin|title=Motsoeneng &amp; Tshabalala should pay their own legal fees|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/motsoeneng--tshabalala-should-pay-their-own-legal-|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hlaudi Motsoeneng]], former COO of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] lied about being in possession of a Matric certificate. By his own admission, he simply invented marks for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sithole|first1=Sthembiso|last2=Dawjee|first2=Haji Mohamed|title=Matric-less Motsoeneng waxes lyrical about matric certificates|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2015-01-06-matric-less-motsoeneng-waxes-lyrical-about-matric-certificate|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed by Ellen Tshabalala, and his various court cases have cost the SABC more than R1.5 million.&lt;ref name="politicsweb.co.za"/&gt; Further, under Motsoeneng's reign, the broadcaster recorded a net loss of R411 million in the 2015/16 financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Regter|first1=Shimoney|title=CONTINUOUS ATTACKS ON SABC AFFECTING FINANCES|url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/16/continuous-attacks-on-sabc-affecting-finances|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dudu Myeni]], chairperson of [[South African Airways]] (SAA) and good friend of Jacob Zuma, claimed to have a Bachelor's degree in administration. This was proven false. Under her leadership "SAA’s losses for the 2014/15 financial year were R5.6-billion – close to R1-billion more than the expected amount of R4.7-billion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SAA’s losses for 2014/15 almost R1-billion more than expected|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-09-20-saas-losses-for-201415-almost-r1-billion-more-than-expected|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sicelo Shiceka]], Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs lied about being in possession of a Master's degree. He used taxpayer's money to fund a party for his mother and secured a government car for his girlfriend, whereafter he was appointed as a member of the inter-ministerial task team on corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mataboge|first1=Mmanaledi|title=Shiceka: Hey big spender|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2010-05-21-shiceka-hey-big-spender|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
A 2016 statement issued by Zizi Kodwa, the ANC National Spokesperson states that "[t]he ANC rejects these [racist] comments with the contempt they deserve and calls on all South Africans to join in the rejection of all racists in our country, wherever they are. It is sad that well meaning South Africans have to contend with this backward attitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kodwa|first1=Zizi|title=Statement on racist comments|url=http://www.anc.org.za/content/statement-racist-comments|website=ANC Official Website|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this statement, the ANC has publicly called for legal action to be taken against whites who have publicly made racist comments against blacks, usually through social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANC lays charges against racist guesthouse owner|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/anc-lays-charges-against-racist-guesthouse-owner|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=Africa News Agency|publisher=ENCA|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernardo|first1=Carla|title=ANC to lay charges against racist South Africans|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-01-05-anc-to-lay-charges-against-racist-south-africans|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=African News Agency|work=Mail and Guardian|date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penny Sparrow is one such high-profile case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:&lt;blockquote&gt;These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Jenni|title=Penny Sparrow back in court on criminal charges for racist comments|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/penny-sparrow-back-in-court-on-criminal-charges-for-racist-comments-20160912|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=News24|work=City Press|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sparrow pleaded guilty to crimen injuria, and was presented with a choice of either paying a R5,000 fine or 12 months in jail, in addition to paying the legal fees incurred by the ANC, who brought the matter to court. In a separate instance, she was also ordered to pay R150,000 to the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penny Sparrow pleads guilty to crimen injuria|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/penny-sparrow-pleads-guilty-to-crimen-injuria|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=ENCA|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the ANC's swift and decisive action towards Sparrow and other white racists, they have mostly ignored racist comments voiced by blacks, in particular ANC members. For example, Kenny Barrel Nkosi, an ANC ward councillor (Govan Mbeki Municipality, Mpumalanga) posted the following on his Facebook account: "The first people that need to fokkof [fuck off] are whites, cubans never oppressed us. these are our true friends they were there in the times on needs. welcom cdes welcome [sic]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korb|first1=Louise|title=Whites must f***off – ANC councillor|url=http://citizen.co.za/news/419775/whites-must-foff-anc-councillor/|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=The Citizen|date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality issued the following statement: “The matter has been investigated and at the time of the comment, the ward councillor was not representing the views of either the ANC or the Govan Mbeki Municipality, but merely as a personal opinion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Gerhard|title=Mpumulanga municipality defends "whites must f**koff" comment from ANC councillor|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/mpumulanga-municipality-defends-whites-must-fkoff-comment-from-anc-councillor/|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=The South African|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further action was taken.

At a [[Gupta family]] wedding held at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] in 2013, various incidents of racism occurred. The family made clear that they wanted only white workers, including waiters, security, bar staff and cleaning staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartley|first1=Aziz|title=Guptas’ guests weren’t racist - Sun City|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/guptas-guests-werent-racist---sun-city-1512764|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=Cape Times|publisher=IOL|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black workers were told to wash before they interacted with guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Wash first, blacks’|url=http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Wash-first-blacks-20150429|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=City Press|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were denied by the Gupta family. Nonetheless, in the Gupta e-mail leak of 2017 these allegations were shown to be correct.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scorpio and amaBhungane #GuptaLeaks: Emails offer further proof of Gupta racist attitudes|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-06-09-scorpio-and-amabhungane-guptaleaks-emails-offer-further-proof-of-gupta-racist-attitudes/#.WTpdtxP5gWo|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=SCORPIO and AMABHUNGANE|work=Daily Maverick|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the e-mails also make clear that a black worker was called a monkey by a member of the Gupta family.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick"/&gt; That the Gupta family is a large, vocal and powerful supporter of the ANC and a personal friend of Jacob Zuma, may explain why no action was taken against them with regards to racism.

[[Lindiwe Sisulu]], ANC member and Minister of Defence and Military Veterans (who demanded that the Estate Agency Affairs Board report to her regarding action taken against Sparrow) called the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] leader, Mmusi Maimane, a "hired native". Ironically – due to the fact that Chris Hart, prominent economist and investment strategist at [[Standard Bank]], was forced to resign for his racist tweet stating that "[m]ore than 25 years after Apartheid ended, the victims are increasing along with a sense of entitlement and hatred towards minorities…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Standard Bank's Chris Hart resigns|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-03-15-standard-banks-chris-hart-resigns|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=African News Agency|work=Mail and Guardian|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Sisulu said the following, while discussing the 2.3 million housing backlog: "What makes an 18-year-old think the state owes them a house? It’s a culture of entitlement … we can’t continue with a dependency culture." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ngwenya|first1=Gwen|title=‘Racist’ black South Africans who kept their jobs?|url=http://thoughtleader.co.za/amandangwenya/2016/01/07/racist-black-south-africans-who-kept-their-jobs%E2%80%A8/|work=Mail and Guardian|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No action has been taken against Sisulu.

[[Lulama Xingwana|Lulu Xingwana]], former ANC Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities, stated that "[y]oung Afrikaner men are brought up in the Calvinist religion believing that they own a woman, they own a child, they own everything and therefore they can take that life because they own it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roets|first1=Ernst|title=Anti-white racism in South Africa|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/antiwhite-racism-in-south-africa|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=PoliticsWeb|date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister apologised, and no further action was taken against her.

Jimmy Manyi, ANC director general of labour and later ANC spokesperson, is quotes as saying the following on a TV interview: “I think its very important for [[Coloureds|coloured]] people in this country to understand that South Africa belongs to them in totality, not just the Western Cape. So this over-concentration of coloureds in the Western Cape is not working for them. They should spread in the rest of the country ... so they must stop this over-concentration situation because they are in over-supply where they are so you must look into the country and see where you can meet the supply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manyi: 'Over-supply' of coloureds in Western Cape|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2011-02-24-coloureds-overconcentrated-in-wcape-says-manyi|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=SAPA-AFP|work=Mail and Guardian|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; No action has been taken against Manyi.

[[Julius Malema]], former [[African National Congress Youth League|ANCYL]] leader and current [[Economic Freedom Fighters|EFF]] leader, stated at a political rally in 2016 that “We [the EFF] are not calling for the slaughter of white people‚ at least for now". When asked for comment by a news agency, the ANC spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa stated that there will be no comment from the ANC, as "[h]e [Malema] was addressing his own party supporters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malema slammed for comments on whites|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/malema-%E2%80%98slaughter-statement%E2%80%99-rocks-sa|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=ENCA|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still the ANCYL leader, Malema was taken to the [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000|Equality Court]] by [[AfriForum]] for repeatedly singing “dubul’ ibhunu”, which translate as “shoot the boer [white farmer]”. The ANC supported Malema, though AfriForum and the ANC reached a settlement before the appeal case was due to be argued in the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]].

In partial response to the Penny Sparrow case, Velaphi Khumalo, while working for the Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation, posted the following on his Facebook account:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I want to cleans this country of all white people. we must act as Hitler did to the Jews. I don't believe any more that the is a large number of not so racist whit people. I'm starting to be sceptical even of those within our Movement the ANC. I will from today unfriend all white people I have as friends from today u must be put under the same blanket as any other racist white because secretly u all are a bunch of racist fuck heads. as we have already seen 
[all sic]."&lt;/blockquote&gt; He also posted:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Noo seriously though u oppressed us when u were a minority and then manje u call us monkeys and we supposed to let it slide . white people in south Africa deserve to be hacked and killed like Jews.

The Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation responded with a statement wherein it "views the hateful post by Velaphi Khumalo in a serious light. Our key mandate is nation-building and social cohesion. His sentiments take our country backwards and do not reflect what the Gauteng provincial government stands for.” Khumalo was suspended on full pay while an investigation was undertaken, was found to be guilty by an internal disciplinary procedure, and issued with a warning, whereafter he resumed his work at the department.&lt;ref name="The Citizen"/&gt;

An '''agricultural subsidy''' (also called an agricultural incentive), is a [[subsidy|'''government incentive''']] paid to [[agribusiness]]es, agricultural organizations and [[farm]]s to supplement their income, manage the supply of agricultural [[commodity|commodities]], and influence the cost and supply of such commodities. Examples of such commodities include: wheat, feed grains (grain used as fodder, such as [[maize]] or corn, sorghum, barley and oats), cotton, milk, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, oilseeds such as soybeans and meat products such as beef, pork, and [[lamb and mutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karnik | first1 = Ajit | last2 = Lalvani | first2 = Mala | year = 1996 | title = Interest Groups, Subsidies and Public Goods: Farm Lobby in Indian Agriculture | journal = Economic and Political Weekly | volume = 31 | issue = 13| pages = 818–820 | jstor=4403965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The system of agricultural subsidies was originally instituted to stabilize markets, help low-income farmers, and aid rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://food-studies.net/foodpolitics/agricultural-subsidies/jades-sample-page/|title=History of Agricultural Subsidies in the US and EU|website=food-studies.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Website created as part of an introductory class assignment, essentially self-published|certain=y|date=November 2018}} In the United States, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]], which created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). This came as a result of the series of programs, [[Public works|public work projects]], financial reforms and regulations enacted by the president known as the [[New Deal]]. The AAA helped to regulate agricultural production by reducing surplus and controlling the supply of agricultural products in society. Through the control of seven crops ([[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[cotton]], [[rice]], peanuts, [[tobacco]] and [[milk]]), Congress was able to balance the supply and demand for farm commodities by offering payment to farmers in return for taking some of their land out of the farming process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/water_11.html|title=AAA, the Agricultural Adjustment Act &amp; Administration|website=livinghistoryfarm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=may be unreliable, looks to be a SPS?|date=November 2018}} Unlike traditional subsidies that promote the growth of products, Congress recognized that agricultural prices needed to be boosted and did so by limiting the growth of these crops. 

In Europe, [[Common Agricultural Policy|Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)]] was launched in 1962 to improve agricultural productivity. According to the [[European Commission]], the act aims to

* Support farmers and improve agricultural productivity, so that consumers have a stable supply of affordable food
* Ensure that [[European Union]] (EU) farmers can make a reasonable living
* Help tackling climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources
* Maintain rural areas and landscapes across the EU
* Keep the rural economy alive promoting jobs in farming, agri-foods industries and associated sectors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/cap-glance_en|title=The common agricultural policy at a glance|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the EU spent €57 billion on agricultural development, of which €39 billion was spent on direct subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/budget/data/D2010_VOL4/EN/nmc-titleN123A5/index.html |accessdate=1 January 2011 |title=Title 05 – Agriculture and rural development |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719092134/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/budget/data/D2010_VOL4/EN/nmc-titleN123A5/index.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural and fisheries subsidies form over 40% of the EU budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/eu-budget-2010-pbKV3009138/downloads/KV-30-09-138-EN-C/KV3009138ENC_002.pdf?FileName=KV3009138ENC_002.pdf&amp;SKU=KV3009138ENC_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=KV-30-09-138-EN-C|title=EU Budget 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992 (and especially since 2005), the EU's Common Agricultural Policy has undergone significant change as subsidies have mostly been decoupled from production. The largest subsidy is the ''[[Single Farm Payment]]''.

=== Malawi ===
Increases in food and fertilizer prices have underlined the vulnerability of poor urban and rural households in many developing countries, especially in Africa, renewing policymakers' focus on the need to increase staple food crop productivity.

A study by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] evaluates the benefits of the Malawi Government Agricultural Inputs Subsidy Programme, which was implemented in 2006/2007 to promote access to and use of fertilizers in both maize and tobacco production to increase agricultural productivity and food security. The subsidy was implemented by means of a coupon system which could be redeemed by the recipients for [[Fertilizer Subsidies in Sub Saharan Africa#Input vouchers|fertilizer]] types at approximately one-third of the normal cash price.&lt;ref name=malawi /&gt; According to policy conclusions of the [[Overseas Development Institute]] the voucher for coupon system can be an effective way of rationing and targeting subsidy access to maximize production and economic and social gains. Many practical and political challenges remain in the program design and implementation required to increase efficiency, control costs, and limit patronage and fraud.&lt;ref name=malawi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/2464-towards-smart-subsidies-agriculture-lessons-recent-malawi|title=Towards 'smart' subsidies in agriculture?

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1984 New Zealand's Labor government took the dramatic step of ending all farm subsidies, which then consisted of 30 separate production payments and export incentives. This was a truly striking policy action, because New Zealand's economy is roughly five times more dependent on farming than is the U.S. economy, measured by either output or employment. Subsidies in New Zealand accounted for more than 30 percent of the value of production before reform, somewhat higher than U.S. subsidies today. And New Zealand farming was marred by the same problems caused by U.S. subsidies, including [[overproduction]], [[environmental degradation]] and inflated land prices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the country is a large agricultural exporter, continued subsidies by other countries are a long-standing bone of contention,&lt;ref name="TVNZ_2755476"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/business-news/return-us-dairy-subsidies-sours-kiwis-2755476 |title=Return of US dairy subsidies sours Kiwis |date=25 May 2009 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=15 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921001757/http://tvnz.co.nz/business-news/return-us-dairy-subsidies-sours-kiwis-2755476 |archivedate=21 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10633801"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/agriculture/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&amp;objectid=10633801&amp;pnum=0 |title=Why bother with a US FTA? |date=23 March 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with New Zealand being a founding member of the 20-member [[Cairns Group]] fighting to improve [[market access]] for exported agricultural goods.

{{See also|Agricultural policy of the United States|Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008}}
The [[Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002]], also known as the 2002 [[U.S. Farm Bill|Farm Bill]], addressed a great variety of issues related to [[agriculture]], [[ecology]], [[energy]], [[trade]], and [[nutrition]]. Signed after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th attacks]] of 2001, the act directs approximately $16.5 billion of government funding toward agricultural subsidies each year. This funding has had a great effect of the production of grains, oilseeds, and upland cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002|date=2018-10-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Farm_Security_and_Rural_Investment_Act_of_2002&amp;oldid=863512402|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States paid allegedly around $20 billion in 2005 to farmers in direct subsidies as "farm income stabilization"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/USbudget/fy10/sheets/hist03z2.xls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128135925/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/USbudget/fy10/sheets/hist03z2.xls|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/07/02/GR2006070200024.html |title=Farm Subsidies Over Time |work=The Washington Post |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Vogel |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances.aspx |title=Farm Income and Costs: Farms Receiving Government Payments |publisher=Ers.usda.gov |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; via [[United States farm bill|farm bills]]. Overall agricultural subsidies in 2010 were estimated at $172 billion by a European agricultural industry association; however, the majority of this estimate consists of food stamps and other consumer subsidies, so it is not comparable to the 2005 estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momagri.org/UK/press-reports/The-SGPA-Global-Support-to-Agricultural-Production--The-per-capita-farm-support-is-close-to-three-times-higher-in-the-United-States-than-in-the-European-Union_1123.html|title=The per-capita farm support is close to three times higher in the United States than in the European Union|publisher=Momagri|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bills pre-date  the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]] with the 1922 [[Grain Futures Act]], the 1929 [[Agricultural Marketing Act]], and the 1933 [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] creating a tradition of government support.

Agricultural policies of the United States are changed, incrementally or more radically, by Farm Bills that are passed every five years or so. Statements about how the program works might be right at one point in time, at best, but are probably not sufficient for assessing agricultural policies at other points in time. For example, a large part of the support to program crops has not been linked directly to current output since the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127). Instead, these payments were tied to historical entitlement, not current planting. For example, it is incorrect to attribute a payment associated with wheat base area to wheat production now because that land might be allocated to any of a number of permitted uses, including held idle. Over time, successive Farm Bills have linked these direct payments to market prices or revenue, but not to production. In contrast, some programs, like the Marketing Loan Program that can create something of a floor price that producers receive per unit sold, are tied to production.&lt;ref name='The_2002_Farm_Bill'&gt;{{cite web

Corn was the top crop for subsidy payments prior to 2011. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] mandated that billions of gallons of ethanol be blended into vehicle fuel each year, guaranteeing demand, but US corn ethanol subsidies were between $5.5 billion and $7.3 billion per year. Producers also benefited from a federal subsidy of 51 cents per gallon, additional state subsidies, and federal crop subsidies that had brought the total to 85 cents per gallon or more.  However, the federal ethanol subsidy expired December 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, William. "Corn-o-Copia". IEEE Spectrum.

Corn farmers, however, received reduced subsidies due to Beijing's 2017 policy that set out to reduce its huge stockpile. Soybean farmers in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia provinces will receive more subsidies from Beijing than corn farmers. The cutting of corn acreage and the lifting of soybean acreage came in 2016 as a push from China to re-balance grain stocks. Subsidies for agriculture machinery and equipment will also be provided by Beijing to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-agriculture-subsidies/china-grants-more-subsidies-to-soy-farmers-as-it-cuts-corn-stocks-idUSKCN1HA176|title=China grants more subsidies to soy farmers as it cuts corn stocks|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; low prices are harmful to farmers not receiving the subsidy.  Because it is usually wealthy countries that can afford domestic subsidies, critics argue that they promote poverty in [[developing country|developing countries]] by artificially driving down world crop prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Andrew Cassel| title = Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World | website = The Philadelphia Inquirer| date = 6 May 2002 | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm | accessdate =20 July 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609232802/http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, developing countries have a [[comparative advantage]] in producing agricultural goods,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but low crop prices encourage developing countries to be dependent buyers of food from wealthy countries. So local farmers, instead of improving the agricultural and economic self-sufficiency of their home country, are forced out of the market and perhaps even off their land. This occurs as a result of a process known as "[[Dumping (pricing policy)|international dumping]]" in which subsidized farmers are able to "dump" low-cost agricultural goods on foreign markets at costs that un-subsidized farmers cannot compete with. Agricultural subsidies often are a common stumbling block in trade negotiations.  In 2006, talks at the [[Doha round]] of WTO trade negotiations stalled because the US refused to cut subsidies to a level where other countries' non-subsidized exports would have been competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Alan Beattie |author2=Frances Williams | title = US blamed as Trade Talks end in acrimony |work=Financial Times | date = 24 July 2006 | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dfa460d0-1afd-11db-b164-0000779e2340.html | accessdate =18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that a world market with farm subsidies and other [[market distortion]]s (as happens today) results in higher food prices, rather than lower food prices, as compared to a free market.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Mark Malloch Brown]], former head of the [[United Nations Development Programme]], estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today's level of development assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2002/november/mmb-uganda.en;jsessionid=axbWzt8vXD9 |title=The Millennium Development Goals and Africa: A new framework for a new future |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727194456/http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2002/november/mmb-uganda.en%3Bjsessionid%3DaxbWzt8vXD9 |archivedate=27 July 2009 |df=dmy }} Address by Mark Malloch Brown, UNDP Administrator, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, 12 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/opinion/05KRIS.html?ex=1027081396&amp;ei=1&amp;en=6415bc0232476bf2 "Farm Subsidies That Kill"], 5 July 2002, by Nicholas D. Kristof, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Poverty in developing countries ===
The impact of agricultural subsidies in developed countries upon developing-country farmers and [[international development]] is well documented. Agricultural subsidies can help drive prices down to benefit consumers, but also mean that unsubsidised developing-country farmers have a more difficult time competing in the world market;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patel|first=Raj|title=Stuffed and Starved|date=2007|publisher=Portobello Books|location=UK|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects on poverty are particularly negative when subsidies are provided for crops that are also grown in developing countries since developing-country farmers must then compete directly with subsidised developed-country farmers, for example in cotton and sugar.&lt;ref name="boxes"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2009/10/green-box-web-1.pdf Agricultural Subsidies in the WTO Green Box] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112002442/http://ictsd.org/downloads/2009/10/green-box-web-1.pdf |date=12 November 2011 }}, [[ICTSD]], September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Agricultural Subsidies, Poverty and the Environment | publisher = World Resources Institute | date = January 2007 | url =http://pdf.wri.org/aspe_domestic_reform.pdf | accessdate =25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] has estimated in 2003 that the impact of subsidies costs developing countries $24 billion in lost incomes going to agricultural and agro-industrial production; and more than $40Bn is displaced from net agricultural exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much does it hurt? The Impact of Agricultural Trade Policies on Developing Countries |publisher=IFPRI |year=2010 |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/media/trade/trade.pdf |accessdate=25 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172604/http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/media/trade/trade.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the same study found that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] have a higher proportion of GDP dependent upon agriculture, at around 36.7%, thus may be even more vulnerable to the effects of subsidies.  It has been argued that subsidised agriculture in the developed world is one of the greatest obstacles to economic growth in the developing world; which has an indirect impact on reducing the income available to invest in rural infrastructure such as health, safe water supplies and electricity for the rural poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Farm subsidies: devastating the world's poor and the environment | url = http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba547 | accessdate =25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total amount of subsidies that go towards agriculture in OECD countries far exceeds the amount that countries provide in [[development aid]]. In the case of Africa, it is estimated that a 1% increase in its total agricultural exports could lift its GDP by $70 billion, nearly five times what the region is provided in total foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams|first=Brock |date=2005 |title=The Structure of American Industry |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Pearson |page=21 |isbn=0-13-143273-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Haiti and US rice imports ====
Haiti is an excellent example of a developing country negatively affected by agricultural subsidies in the developed world. Haiti is a nation with the capacity to produce rice and was at one time self-sufficient in meeting its own needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/haitirice.htm#endnote11 |title=Trade and the Disappearance of Haitian Rice |publisher=.american.edu |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/28350/56025477.pdf?sequence%3D1 |title=Impacts of Trade Liberalization on Rice Production in Haiti |accessdate=2012-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522162031/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/28350/56025477.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, Haiti does not produce enough to feed its people; 60 percent of the food consumed in the country is imported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/pl/factsheet/haiti_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Following advice to liberalize its economy by lowering tariffs, domestically produced rice was displaced by cheaper subsidised rice from the United States. The Food and Agriculture Organization describes this liberalization process as being the removal of barriers to trade and a simplification of tariffs, which lowers costs to consumers and promotes efficiency among producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4671e/y4671e08.htm#fnB52 |title=Chapter 4. Trade liberalization and food security in developing countries[45&amp;#93; |publisher=Fao.org |date=12 July 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening up Haiti's economy granted consumers access to food at a lower cost; allowing foreign producers to compete for the Haitian market drove down the price of rice. However, for Haitian rice farmers without access to subsidies, the downward pressure on prices led to a decline in profits. Subsidies received by American rice farmers, plus increased efficiencies, made it impossible for their Haitian counterparts to compete.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/305170611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/osgdp20053_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oxfam and the International Monetary Fund, tariffs on imports fell from 50 percent to three percent in 1995 and the nation is currently importing 80 percent of the rice it consumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/development/haiti-no-longer-grows-much-its-own-rice-and-families-now-go-hungry |title=Haiti No Longer Grows Much of Its Own Rice and Families Now Go Hungry &amp;#124; Oxfam International |publisher=Oxfam.org |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128093750/http://www.oxfam.org/development/haiti-no-longer-grows-much-its-own-rice-and-families-now-go-hungry |archivedate=28 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2001/cr0104.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of Agriculture notes that since 1980, rice production in Haiti has been largely unchanged, while consumption on the other hand, is roughly eight times what it was in that same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Rice%20Production%20and%20Trade%20Update_Santo%20Domingo_Haiti_11-9-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti is among the top three consumers of long grain milled rice produced in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchives.cdlib.org/sw1wp9v27r/http://ers.usda.gov/Briefing/Rice/SpecialArticle/USricemarket.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As rice farmers struggled to compete, many migrated from rural to urban areas in search of alternative economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle |first=Mark |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11472874 |title=BBC News – US urged to stop Haiti rice subsidies |publisher=BBC |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on nutrition ===
One peer-reviewed research suggests that any effects of US farm policies on US obesity patterns must have been negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919208000523 |title=Farm subsidies and obesity in the United States: National evidence and international comparisons  |accessdate=12 April 2012 | doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2008.05.008 |volume=33 |issue=6  |journal=Food Policy |pages=470–479|year=2008  |last1=Alston  |first1=Julian M.  |last2=Sumner  |first2=Daniel A.  |last3=Vosti  |first3=Stephen A.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some critics argue that the artificially low prices resulting from subsidies create unhealthy incentives for consumers. For example, in the USA, [[cane sugar]] was replaced with cheap [[corn syrup]], making high-sugar food cheaper;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-10-12-03-the-agri-cultural-contradictions-of-obesity.html?sec=health|title=  THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-12-03; The (Agri)Cultural Contradictions Of Obesity|accessdate=29 April 2008 |work=The New York Times|author= Pollan, Michael| date=12 October 2003| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502064130/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D61E3CF931A25753C1A9659C8B63&amp;sec=health| archivedate= 2 May 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; beet and cane sugar are subject to subsidies, price controls, and import tariffs that distort the prices of these products as well.

The lower price of energy-dense foods such as grains and sugars could be one reason why low-income people and food insecure people in industrialized countries are more vulnerable to being [[Food security|overweight and obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frac.org/initiatives/hunger-and-obesity/why-are-low-income-and-food-insecure-people-vulnerable-to-obesity/|title= FRAC Food Research and Action Center|author=|date=|website=frac.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]], meat and dairy production receive 63% of subsidies in the United States,&lt;ref name=pcfrm /&gt; as well as sugar subsidies for unhealthy foods, which contribute to heart disease, obesity and diabetes, with enormous costs for the health sector.&lt;ref name=pcfrm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrm.org/search/?cid=2586|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130415140347/http://www.pcrm.org/search/?cid=2586|deadurl=yes|title=PCRM - Taxing America’s Health: Subsidies for Meat and Dairy Products|author=|date=15 April 2013|archivedate=15 April 2013|website=archive.is|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market distortions due to subsidies have led to an increase in corn fed cattle rather than grass fed. Corn fed cattle require more antibiotics and their beef has a higher fat content.&lt;ref name=corn&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/kummer|title= Back To Grass|accessdate=29 April 2008 |work=The Atlantic|author= Kummer, Corby| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516174706/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/kummer| archivedate= 16 May 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cross-border movement of businesses ===
Tariffs on sugar have also caused large candy makers in the USA to relocate to Canada and Mexico, where sugar is often half to a third the price.&lt;ref name="The Sugar Industry and Corporate Welfare"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://reclaimdemocracy.org/articles_2005/sugar_industry_subsidies.php|title=The Sugar Industry and Corporate Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dominican Republic Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), though, does not seen to be very impact in this area but known to not amounting to much. The sugar issue causing alarm had reasoning due to what plausible effects could come through the tariffs as well as the undetermined future of these types of negotiations considering sugar importation in the United States. Due to various continuing disputes in trade, Mexico began to have fewer exports of sugar into the United States, where the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) allowed. Those who left and sought out other companies for sugar have leaned marginally more towards Canada than Mexico. The tariffs are what keeps the large pressure from competition from south of the Rio Grande at bay.&lt;ref name="The Sugar Industry and Corporate Welfare" /&gt;

=== Non-farming companies ===
Subsidies are also given to companies and individuals with little connection to traditional farming. It has been reported that the largest part of the sum given to these companies flow to multinational companies like food conglomerates, sugar manufacturers and liquor distillers. For example, in France, the single largest beneficiary was the chicken processor [[Groupe Doux]], at €62.8m, and was followed by about a dozen sugar manufacturers which together reaped more than €103m.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6111715/French-farmers-survive-but-multinationals-cash-in-on-EU-subsidies.html French farmers survive but multinationals cash in on EU subsidies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/eu-farm-subsidies-more-skewed-than-ever-report EU Farm Subsidies More Skewed than Ever: Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/business/global/30subsidy.html http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/ Europe’s Vast Farm Subsidies Face Challenges]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/ Farmsubsidy.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public economics implications ===
Government intervention, through agricultural subsidies, interferes with the price mechanism which would normally determine commodity prices, often creating crop overproduction and market discrimination. Subsidies are also an inefficient use of taxpayer’s money. For instance, in 2006, the Department of Agriculture estimated that the average farm household income was $77,654 or about 17% higher than the average US household income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Wyatt|author2=Mishra Ashok|author3= Joe Dewbre|title=Farm Household Income and Transfer Efficiency: An Evaluation of United States Farm Program Payments|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=91|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8276.2009.01300.x|pages=1296–1301|date=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a public economics perspective, subsidies of any kind work to create a socially and politically acceptable equilibrium that is not necessarily [[Pareto efficient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Harvey|title=Public Finance|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|location=New York|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental implications ===
The monoculture system associated with subsidized large-scale production has been implicated as a contributory factor in [[Colony Collapse Disorder]] which has affected bee populations.  Bee [[pollination]] is an essential ecosystem service essential for the production of many varieties of fruits and vegetables.  Subsidies often go towards subsidising meat production which has other nutritional and environmental implications; and it has been found that out of the $200Bn subsidies to subsidise crops from 1995–2010 around two thirds of this went to animal feed, tobacco and cotton production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-touts-fruit-and-vegetables-while-subsidizing-animals-that-become-meat/2011/08/22/gIQATFG5IL_story.html|title=U.S. touts fruit and vegetables while subsidizing animals that become meat|first=Arthur|last=Allen|date=3 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, farmers producing fruits and vegetables received no direct subsidies.  The [[environmental impact of meat production]] is high due to the resource and energy requirements that go into production of feed for livestock throughout their lifespan, for example, a kilogram of beef uses about 60 times as much water as an equivalent amount of potato.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Hoekstra-2012-Water-Meat-Dairy.pdf  Hoesktra et al 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidies contribute to meat consumption by allowing for an artificially low cost of meat products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yaleruddcenter.org/what_we_do.aspx?id=81|title=Home - UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity|author=|date=|website=www.yaleruddcenter.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
[[Neoliberalism|Neoliberals]] argue that the current subsidies distort incentives for the global trade of agricultural commodities in which other countries may have a comparative advantage. Allowing countries to specialize in commodities in which they have a comparative advantage in and then freely trade across borders would therefore increase global welfare and reduce food prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Kym|author2=Will Martin|title=Agricultural Trade Reform and the Doha Development Agenda|journal=The World Economy|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1301–1327|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9701.2005.00735.x|date=13 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ending direct payments to farmers and deregulating the farm industry would eliminate inefficiencies and deadweight loss created by government intervention.

However, others disagree, arguing that a more radical transformation of agriculture is needed, one guided by the notion that ecological change in agriculture cannot be promoted without comparable changes in the social, political, cultural and economic arenas that conform and determine agriculture. The organized peasant and indigenous based agrarian movements, e.g. [[Via Campesina]], consider that only by changing the export-led, free-trade based, industrial agriculture model of large farms can halt what they call the downward spiral of poverty, low wages, rural-urban migration, hunger and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altieri|first=Miguel|title=Agroecology, small farms, and food sovereignty|journal=Monthly Review|date=July 2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=102–113|doi=10.14452/mr-061-03-2009-07_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brazilian–Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials''' ('''ABACC'''; {{lang-pt|Agência Brasileiro-Argentina de Contabilidade e Controle de Materiais Nucleares}}; {{lang-es|Agencia Brasileño-Argentina de Contabilidad y Control de Materiales Nucleares}}) is a binational [[Nuclear_proliferation#Scope_of_safeguards|safeguards agency]] playing an active role in the verification of the peaceful use of [[nuclear material]]s that could be used, either directly or indirectly, for the manufacture of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].

Nuclear cooperation between Argentina and Brazil traces back to 1986 with the signature of a protocol about immediate sharing of information and mutual assistance in case of nuclear accidents and radiological emergencies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnea.gov.ar/que_es_la_cnea/historia.php# |title=CNEA DECADA 1980/1989 |access-date=2010-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014214149/http://www.cnea.gov.ar/que_es_la_cnea/historia.php# |archive-date=2010-10-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The warm personal relationship that existed between Argentina's democratically elected president [[Raul Alfonsin]] and his Brazilian counterpart, [[João Figueiredo]], further catalyzed the deepening of relations which is now understood to have begun under their authoritarian predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/npihp-partner-hosts-conference-brazils-and-argentinas-nuclear-history "NPIHP Partner Hosts Conference on Brazil's and Argentina's Nuclear History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABACC was created on July 18, 1991 and is the only binational safeguards organization existing in the world and the first binational organization created by Argentina and Brazil.  

As a regional agency dealing with safeguards, its main goal is guaranteeing Argentina, Brazil and the international community that all the nuclear materials are used exclusively for peaceful purposes.

'''Camp Bucca''' ({{lang-ar|سجن بوكا}}) was a detention facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7561952.stm |title=US jail guards in Iraq abuse case |accessdate=14 August 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=14 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained by the [[United States]] [[military]] in the vicinity of [[Umm Qasr|Umm Qasr, Iraq]]. As of June 2011, a group of entrepreneurial Iraqis and Americans are re-building Camp Bucca as Basra Gateway, a logistic center. The facility was initially called [[Tony Beckley|Camp Freddy]] and used by British Forces to hold Iraqi [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/800mp-bde.htm |title=800th Military Police Brigade |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being taken over by the U.S. military (800th Military Police Brigade) in April 2003, it was renamed after [[Ronald Bucca]], a  NYC [[Fire Marshal]] who died in the [[11 September 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;

Camp Bucca was built on a site where before the tallest structure of Iraq, a 492 metres high TV mast stood, which might have been used for propaganda TV to Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/#lang=de&amp;lat=30.059744&amp;lon=47.887779&amp;z=18&amp;m=bs|title=Wikimapia - Let's describe the whole world!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/#lang=de&amp;lat=30.059744&amp;lon=47.887779&amp;z=18&amp;m=b|title=Wikimapia - Let's describe the whole world!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/buildings/1249233/umm-qasr-tv-mast-az-zubayr-iraq|title=Umm Qasr TV Mast, Az Zubayr - 1249233 - EMPORIS|first=Emporis|last=GmbH|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal]], many detainees from [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] were transferred to Camp Bucca. After a substantial turn-over in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] at Camp Bucca and substantial amendments to camp policy, the US military held up Camp Bucca as an example of how a model detention facility should be run.&lt;ref name=Bucca-LA-times&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khalil|first1=Ashraf|title=Camp Bucca Turns 180 Degrees From Abu Ghraib|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/19/world/fg-bucca19|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=10 Jan 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the detainees were reportedly housed in cinder block housing units with wooden roofing rather than tents, while other detainees were held in hasty tent compounds until 2009. Cigarettes, tea, and the opportunity to listen to radio and T.V. programs were used as incentives for good behavior. Some detainees were allowed family visitation from Iraqi relatives not held at the facility.  Detainees were provided the opportunity for basic education including reading, writing (both English and Arabic), arithmetic, basic geography and art. Detainees organized and administered their own classes in subjects like literacy and religion, and competed in soccer matches. Soccer matches were encouraged to attempt to promote cooperation and trust between every aspect involved in the camp.

Additionally, the internment facility had its own U.S. Army run hospital to serve detainees. It offered comprehensive healthcare. There was an emergency room, internal medicine clinic, optometry clinic, psychiatric services, orthopedic/surgical unit, physical therapy clinic, pharmacy, dental clinic, dietary services and more. Detainees were screened by medics and doctors at the wire, that was right out where the detainees are housed, and then triaged to the hospital for further care. Some detainees were flown to larger medical facilities in Iraq to receive cataract surgery. U.S. Army medical staff was also given training on how to provide care while respecting Muslim traditions.

Militants regularly launched rockets into Camp Bucca. The rockets are widely believed to be often provided and set up by Iranians who teach the militants to launch them hours after they've returned to their nearby country (about {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}).{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} The lethal explosions averaged around 5 per month in a period from September 2007 to late April 2008, with the most intense barrage coming during The Ramadan period (October) when 12 aerial bombs (Believed to be stolen from a British camp in nearby (about {{convert|35|-|40|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}}) al Basrah){{citation needed|date=July 2008}} landed in a span of 8 days. On 17 September 2009, The US military announced that the base would be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2009/09/sec-090917-afns01.htm |title=Camp Bucca detention center closes in Iraq |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, the U.S. military handed the base to the government of Iraq, who, on the same day, gave Kufan Group of Iraq a license to invest in the new Basra Gateway, to provide a 21st-century logistics hub for Iraq's port.

===2003===
During the months of April and May 2003 two prisoners were shot, one killed, by soldiers of the 314th MP Company.  One was fired on during a riot, after he attempted to assault a staff-sergeant with a sharpened piece of metal re-bar removed from their housing tents.  He was struck in the lower side of his abdomen and died during surgery.  The other was fired on by a soldier as he attempted to crawl through barbed wire to obtain a pistol belt (which later turned out to be empty) left behind by a battalion MP when rioting prisoners threw rocks.  The prisoner was struck in the leg and abandoned his attempt to reach the pistol belt.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

On 18 May 2003, U.S. military forces mistakenly released Mohammed Jawad An-Neifus from the Camp Bucca. An-Neifus is suspected of being involved in the mass murder of thousands of Iraqi [[Shia]]s whose remains were later found at a [[mass grave]]site in the southern city of [[al-Mahawil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2950398.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Iraq killings suspect freed 'in error'|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004===
On 7 January 2004, a detainee escaped from Camp Bucca. Investigating officers concluded that 'the detainee escaped through an undetected weakness in the wire. Contributing factors were inexperienced guards, lapses in accountability, complacency, lack of leadership presence, poor visibility, and lack of clear and concise communication between the guards and the leadership.'

On 12 January 2004, 7 Detainees escaped during the night, 5 were recaptured.

On 26 January 2004 3 detainees escaped at night during a period of intense fog. An investigation 'concluded that the detainees crawled under a fence when visibility was only 10–15 meters due to fog'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/umm-qasr.htm |title=Umm Qasr |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2004, A 26-year-old security internee died of unknown causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/10/iraq-041020-centcom01.htm |title=Detainee Dies At Camp Bucca |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
On 5 January 2005, a 31-year-old security internee died of what appears to be natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2005/01/mil-050107-mnfi-mnci04.htm |title=Detainee Dies of Apparent Natural Causes |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, Compound 4. A riot broke out in which detainees threw rocks and fashioned weapons out of tent poles. Detainees held a military soldier hostage until the riot was dispelled by the use of lethal force. Four detainees were killed and six were injured. As is standard procedure in all cases of prison riots and the use of lethal force, the matter was investigated by the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigations Division. The investigation concluded that a detainee leader had incited the riot by making an accusation that camp soldiers were stepping on [[Koran]]s during a search for contraband. No soldiers were found guilty of any wrongdoing during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/18/opinion/web.0218abuse.php?page=3 |title=Jailed 2 years, Iraqi tells of abuse by Americans |date=18 February 2007 |work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 February 2005, the tabloid paper ''[[New York Daily News]]'' reported that units at Camp Bucca organized and held a [[mud wrestling]] party on 30 October 2004. The party was organized by members of the 160th MP Battalion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/160mp.htm |title=160th Military Police Battalion |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=1971-01-21 |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended by members of the incoming 105th MP Battalion, who were arriving to relieve the members of the 160th. At least three female [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] stripped to their [[undergarments]] and wrestled in a kiddie-pool full of sand and water in front of a crowd of male GIs, and one GI flashed her breasts. About 30 photos of the party, including one of the flasher, have been leaked to the press. The flasher, 19-year-old [[Private First Class|PFC]] Deanna Allen, was demoted for [[indecent exposure]], and reportedly later discharged from the military.

On 4 March 2005, Camp Bucca was targeted by 106&amp;nbsp;mm rocket fire directed from the port of [[Umm Qasr]]. Although no military personnel were injured or killed, a [[Third Country National]] took [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] to the leg. Four rockets targeted Camp Bucca, but only one detonated within the boundaries of the base.

On 25 March 2005, a complete [[escape tunnel]] was discovered, though no prisoners had yet managed to escape.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/03/25/iraq.tunnel/ |title=Escape tunnel found at Iraqi prison |publisher=CNN.com |date=25 March 2005 |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2005, two Iraqis and four US prison guards were wounded in a [[riot]] at Camp Bucca near the southern town of Umm Qasr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2005/04/mil-050404-mnfi-mnci01.htm |title=Multi-national Corps-Iraq/Multi-National Forces-Iraq News Release |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2005, a dispute broke out between two groups of detainees at one of the compounds of the Camp Bucca theater internment facility at approximately 11&amp;nbsp;pm. The fight left one detainee dead, was confined between the detainees in one compound, and was not directed at U.S. forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2005/04/mil-050415-mnfi-mnci03.htm |title=Multi-national Corps-Iraq/Multi-National Forces-Iraq News Release |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, a lawsuit was filed in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] by the father of SPC Monroe against the British private security firm [[Erinys International]]. In the lawsuit, Monroe's father alleges that his son actually died after he was struck by a vehicle operated by Erinys International. The lawsuit alleges Erinys personnel passed through a checkpoint where they were warned that there were more troops ahead of them but despite the warning proceeded in the dark at a high rate of speed with only [[parking lights]] on until they struck Monroe. Monroe was dismounted and standing guard near the 5-ton vehicle he was driving providing security after the convoy he was in stopped to render assistance to an Iraqi who had been involved in a car accident. The force of the accident sheared Monroe's right leg off and threw him 30–40 feet in the air. Monroe later "died on a Medavac helicopter en route to Shalib Airbase". In a statement in response to the lawsuit, a spokesperson for the company stated "It was a very tragic accident for which Erinys and its employees have been thoroughly exonerated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,2201538,00.html|title=US soldier's family brings legal action against British private security firm |date=30 October 2007 |work=The Guardian |author=Suzanne Goldenberg |accessdate=30 October 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664447&amp;imw=Y |title=AP: Family of U.S. Soldier Killed in Iraq Sues Private Contractor |date=28 October 2007 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |accessdate=30 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809165918/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664447&amp;imw=Y |archivedate=9 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced it had suspended its visits to Camp Bucca due to the deteriorating security situation in the area. The ICRC visits all detention facilities in Iraq to monitor the conditions detainees are receiving and make recommendations where they perceive improvements could be made. To maintain their neutral status, they refuse coalition security when traveling in Iraq, which causes them to occasionally suspend visits when they deem conditions too hazardous for their personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 31 October 2007, it was announced that Camp Bucca would be expanded once again to increase its capacity from 20,000 to 30,000 detainees. The $110 million project will be overseen by The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and would include $17.6 million retrofit of "13 existing compounds to add concrete pads to prevent tunneling, better segregation areas, and better shower and latrine facilities" as well as new housing, a waste water treatment plant, a water treatment plant and a $3.2 million brick factory for prisoner labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=49911 |title=Prison camp in Iraq once listed to close now sees major upgrades |date=31 October 2007 |work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] |accessdate=31 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212205214/http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=49911 |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, it was announced that 6 sailors had been charged and would face courts-martial for abusing detainees at Camp Bucca. The abuse allegedly occurred on 14 May and involved beatings of two detainees and the sealing of eight detainees in a cell filled with pepper spray while the cells' ventilation was secured. The abuse apparently occurred after some detainees attacked guards, spitting on them and throwing containers filled with human waste at them. Seven other sailors received [[Nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]] for failing to report the incidents. Two had their charges dismissed, and the remainder were reduced in rank or faced suspended punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2008-08-14-detainees-Iraq_N.htm?csp=34

[[Damage Controlman]] 2nd Class Adam M. White, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and assault and was sentenced to 89 days confinement and reduction of two pay grades. Adams claims he and other sailors participated in the beating of two detainees at the direction of Chief [[Aviation Structural Mechanic]] Tracy Necaise because the prisoners spit and threw feces at guards. Necaise's attorney blamed upper-level Navy officers for the incident because they assigned the sailors to Camp Bucca without any prior experience working in law enforcement or detention facilities. Necaise and the remaining sailors pleaded not guilty and could face trial in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wokv.com/localnews/2008/11/sailor-admits-assaulting-detai.html |title=Sailor Admits Assaulting Detainee in Iraq |date=14 November 2008 |publisher=[[WOKV]] |author=Jared Halpern |accessdate=16 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103124403/http://wokv.com/localnews/2008/11/sailor-admits-assaulting-detai.html |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/11/navy_detainee_abuse_111408w/|title=Hearing ends in detainee abuse case |date=14 November 2008 |work=[[Navy Times]] |author=Andrew Tilghman |accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===

On 17 September 2009 Camp Bucca closed down detainee operations.

The "SUPERMAX" security row known as "Waterfront" manned by the US Navy NPDB (Naval Provisional Detainee Battalion) was in charge of the custody of the most dangerous detainees, and the last to be closed, with Compound 16 having the remaining 180 detainees either transferred to the U.S. military's [[Camp Cropper]] detention facility near Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) or to an Iraqi, Navy, and Army manned prison at Camp Taji north of Baghdad.

NPDB 6 was attached to the US Army 306th Military Police Battalion, commanded by LTC Kenneth King. This was the last Navy unit to handle detainee operations in Camp Bucca.

{{Main|Abolitionism}}

Although many Enlightenment philosophers opposed slavery, it was Christian activists, attracted by strong religious elements, who initiated and organized an abolitionist movement. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/document.php?id=51 |title=The abolition of the slave trade: Christian conscience and political action |access-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Europe and the United States, Christians, usually from 'un-institutional' Christian faith movements, not directly connected with traditional state churches, or "[[non-conformist]]" believers within established churches, were to be found at the forefront of the abolitionist movements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Anstey, "Slavery and the Protestant Ethic", ''Historical Reflections'' 1979 6(1): 157–181. Pp. 157–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the effects of the [[Second Great Awakening]] resulted in many evangelicals working to see the theoretical Christian view, that all people are essentially equal, made more of a practical reality. Freedom of expression within the Western world also helped in enabling opportunity to express their position. Prominent among these [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] was [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] [[William Wilberforce]] in England, who wrote in his diary when he was 28 that, "God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and Reformation of Morals."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Piper, 2002, p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt; With others he labored, despite determined opposition, to finally abolish the British [[slave trade]]. English preacher [[Charles Spurgeon]] had some of his sermons burned in America due to his censure of slavery, calling it "the foulest blot" and which "may have to be washed out in blood."&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Cabinet, December 14, 1859&lt;/ref&gt; Methodist founder [[John Wesley]] denounced human bondage as "the sum of all villainies," and detailed its abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Thoughts Upon Slavery, John Wesley, Published in the year 1774, John Wesley: Holiness of Heart and Life, 1996 Ruth A. Daugherty&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia, primitive Methodists united with brethren elsewhere in condemning slavery. Many evangelical leaders in the United States such as [[Presbyterian]] [[Charles Finney]] and [[Theodore Weld]], and women such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] (daughter of abolitionist [[Lyman Beecher]]) and [[Sojourner Truth]] motivated hearers to support [[abolitionism in the United States|abolition]]. Finney preached that slavery was a moral sin, and so supported its elimination. "I had made up my mind on the question of slavery, and was exceedingly anxious to arouse public attention to the subject. In my prayers and preaching, I so often alluded to slavery, and denounced it.&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Finney, Memoirs (New York: A.S. Barnes, 1876), 324&lt;/ref&gt; Repentance from slavery was required of souls, once enlightened of the subject, while continued support of the system incurred "the greatest guilt" upon them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gospeltruth.net/1852OE/520818_guilt_ignorance.htm Guilt modified by ignorance—anti-slavery duties, by President Finney] 1852&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quaker]]s in particular were early leaders in [[abolitionism]]. In 1688 Dutch Quakers in Germantown, Pennsylvania, sent an antislavery petition to the Monthly Meeting of Quakers. By 1727 British Quakers had expressed their official disapproval of the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;London Yearly Meeting minutes, Vol.  6, 457–458&lt;/ref&gt; Three Quaker abolitionists, Benjamin Lay, John Woolman, and Anthony Benezet, devoted their lives to the abolitionist effort from the 1730s to the 1760s, with Lay founding the Negro School in 1770, which would serve more than 250 pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5913/Abolition-Movement.html|title=Abolition Movement - EARLY ANTISLAVERY EFFORTS, EARLY EFFORTS OF BLACKS, REVOLUTIONARY ERA ABOLITIONISM, NORTHERN ABOLITIONISM|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia.Jrank.org|access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1783 a petition from the London Yearly Meeting and signed by over 300 Quakers was presented to Parliament protesting the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;London Yearly Meeting minutes, Vol. 17, 298–307&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787 the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was formed, with 9 of the 12 founder members being Quakers. During the same year, William Wilberforce was persuaded to take up their cause; as an MP, Wilberforce was able to introduce a bill to abolish the slave trade. Wilberforce first attempted to abolish the trade in 1791, but could only muster half the necessary votes; however, after transferring his support to the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], it became an election issue. Abolitionist pressure had changed popular opinion, and in the 1806 election enough abolitionists entered parliament for Wilberforce to be able to see the passing of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. The [[Royal Navy]] subsequently declared that the slave trade was equal to piracy, the [[West Africa Squadron]] choosing to seize ships involved in the transfer of slaves and liberate the slaves on board, effectively crippling the transatlantic trade. Through abolitionist efforts, popular opinion continued to mount against slavery, and [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|in 1833 slavery itself was outlawed]] throughout the [[British Empire]] – at that time containing roughly 1/6 of the world's population (rising to 1/4 towards the end of the century).

In the United States, the abolition movement faced much opposition.  [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] notes that the appearance of the Christian abolitionist movement "with its religious ideology alarmed newsmen, politicians, and ordinary citizens. They angrily predicted the endangerment of secular democracy, the mongrelization, as it was called, of white society, and the destruction of the federal union. Speakers at huge rallies and editors of conservative papers in the North denounced these newcomers to radical reform as the same old “church-and-state” zealots, who tried to shut down post offices, taverns, carriage companies, shops, and other public places on Sundays. Mob violence sometimes ensued."{{Cite quote|date=June 2017}}

A postal campaign in 1835 by the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AA-SS) – founded by  [[African-American]] Presbyterian clergyman [[Theodore S. Wright]] – sent bundles of tracts and newspapers (over 100,000) to prominent clerical, legal, and political figures throughout the whole country, and culminated in massive demonstrations throughout the North and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/amabrel.htm|title=American Abolitionism and Religion, Divining America, TeacherServe©, National Humanities Center|author=|date=|website=NationalHumanitiesCenter.org|access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to stop these mailings, New York Postmaster Samuel L. Gouverneur unsuccessfully requested the AA-SS to cease sending it to the South. He therefore decided that he would “aid in preserving the public peace” by refusing to allow the mails to carry abolition pamphlets to the South himself, with the new [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Amos Kendall]] affirming, even though he admitted he had no legal authority to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Rose, ''The Culture of Honor: How Slaveholders Responded to the Abolitionist Mail Crisis of 1835'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://colfa.utsa.edu/users/jreynolds/Textbooks/Abolition/Abolitionists%20Mussey.htm David S.

Despite such determined opposition, many Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian members freed their slaves and sponsored black congregations, in which many black ministers encouraged slaves to believe that freedom could be gained during their lifetime. After a great [[Christian revival|revival]] occurred in 1801 at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, American Methodists made anti-slavery sentiments a condition of church membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ket.org/underground/history/westexpansion.htm|title=Kentucky’s Underground Railroad: Passage to Freedom|author=|date=|website=KET.org|access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist writings, such as "A Condensed Anti-Slavery Bible Argument" (1845) by George Bourne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/bourne/bourne.html|title=George Bourne, 1780-1845.

Cheever,&lt;ref&gt;See also "The guilt of slavery and the crime of slaveholding, demonstrated from the Hebrew and Greek scriptures"&lt;/ref&gt; used the Bible, logic and reason extensively in contending against the institution of slavery, and in particular the chattel form of it as seen in the South. In Cheever's speech entitled, "The Fire and Hammer of God’s Word Against the Sin of Slavery", his desire for eliminating the crime of slaveholding is clear, as he goes so far as to address it to the President.

Other Protestant missionaries of the Great Awakening initially opposed slavery in the South, but by the early decades of the 19th century, many Baptist and Methodist preachers in the South had come to an accommodation with it in order to evangelize the farmers and workers. Disagreements between the newer way of thinking and the old often created schisms within denominations at the time. Differences in views toward slavery resulted in the Baptist and Methodist churches dividing into regional associations by the beginning of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Dooley 11–15; McKivigan 27 (ritualism), 30, 51, 191, Osofsky; ''ANB'' [[Leonidas Polk]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic statements also became increasingly vehement against slavery during this era. In 1741 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] condemned slavery generally.  In 1815 [[Pope Pius VII]] demanded of the Congress of Vienna the suppression of the slave trade.  In the Bull of Canonization of [[Peter Claver]], one of the most illustrious adversaries of slavery, [[Pope Pius IX]] branded the "supreme villainy" (''summum nefas'') of the slave traders;&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Allard | first = Paul | title = Slavery and Christianity | encyclopedia = Catholic Enycyclopedia | volume = XIV | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | location = New York |year=1912 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14036a.htm | access-date = 4 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839 [[Pope Gregory XVI]] condemned the slave trade in ''[[In supremo apostolatus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16sup.htm |title=In supremo apostolatus|access-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1888 [[Pope Leo XIII]] condemned slavery in [[In Plurimis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13abl.htm |title=IN PLURIMIS – ON THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY |access-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic]] efforts extended to the Americas. The Roman Catholic leader of the Irish in Ireland, [[Daniel O'Connell]], supported the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and in America. With the black abolitionist [[Charles Lenox Remond]], and the temperance priest [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Theobold Mathew]], he organized a petition with 60,000 signatures urging the Irish of the United States to support abolition. O'Connell also spoke in the United States for abolition.

Preceding such, and while not explicitly expressing an abolitionist point of view, the Portuguese [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Gaspar da Cruz]] in 1569 strongly criticized the Portuguese traffic in Chinese slaves, explaining that any arguments by the slave traders that they "legally" purchased already-enslaved children were bogus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

On December 11, 2012, a shooting occurred at the [[Clackamas Town Center]] in unincorporated [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]], outside the city of [[Portland, Oregon]], United States. The gunman, 22-year-old Jacob Tyler Roberts, ran into the shopping center wearing tactical clothing and a [[hockey mask]] and opened fire on shoppers and employees with a stolen [[AR-15]]. He fired a total of 17 shots, killing two people and seriously wounding a third. Having attempted to reload his weapon and dropping three magazines, Roberts entered a stairwell and committed [[suicide]] after descending one level. He had no connection to any of his victims, and it was believed to be a random act of violence.&lt;ref name="randomattack"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carson|first=Teresa|title=Oregon mall shooting appears to be lone, random rampage|date=December 12, 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]] ''via [[Chicago Tribune]]''|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-shooting-oregonbre8bb017-20121211,0,4763419.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lydia Warren |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2246748/Jacob-Tyler-Roberts-Gunman-Oregon-mall-shooting-identified.html |title=Jacob Tyler Roberts: Gunman in Oregon mall shooting identified  |work=Daily Mail |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clackamas Town Center has a posted policy of prohibiting firearms on the premises.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Code of Conduct"&gt;[http://www.clackamastowncenter.com/en/code-of-conduct.html Code of Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==

===Prior to the shooting===
[[Image:1973 Colt AR15 SP1.jpg|thumb|left|1973 [[AR-15]], one of many models of the semi-automatic rifle used by the shooter]]
Sometime prior to the shooting, Roberts is stated to have stolen a [[AR-15]] [[rifle]] from an acquaintance. Immediately before the shooting, he visited a friend who lived two miles away from the Clackamas Town Center, smoked [[marijuana]] with him, and claimed that he was moving to [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"&gt;[http://www.wsema.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/13_-_CTC_SHT_WSEMA.pdf "Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"]&lt;/ref&gt; He drove to the mall sometime later and parked at the south side between [[Macy's]] and [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]]. He ran into the mall through Macy's department store at 3:28&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"/&gt; wearing a white hockey mask and a [[Individual Integrated Fighting System|load-bearing vest]] and armed with the AR-15. He was also carrying five loaded magazines, one of which he accidentally dropped in the parking lot while entering the mall.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"/&gt;

Roberts legally bought four additional standard capacity 30-round ammunition magazines and the ammunition to fill them at three local stores, including a [[Walmart]], The Gunbroker, and Wholesale Sports Outdoor Outfitters. When he stole the unsecured AR-15 from a friend, it was loaded with a standard capacity 30-round ammunition magazine. Between 8,000 and 10,000 people were inside the mall at the time. People who first saw him run into the mall believed the tactical clothing and hockey mask were a [[paintball]] outfit and that the rifle was a toy.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center shooting: 22 minutes of chaos and terror as a gunman meanders through the mall"&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/2012/12/clackamas_town_center_shooting_61.html "Clackamas Town Center shooting: 22 minutes of chaos and terror as a gunman meanders through the mall"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shooting===
Standing in a large atrium, Roberts first opened fire at the mall's food court that was across from him at his left. The first person shot was 54-year-old shopper Cindy Ann Yuille, a hospice nurse and mother of two who was shot in the back; she died despite efforts of bystanders to treat her wound.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"/&gt; 15-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, who was walking through the mall with her friend to reach the Town Center MAX station, was the second person to be shot; she received a bullet to the chest, but she survived and made it out of the mall, where she was treated for her gunshot wound.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center shooting: 22 minutes of chaos and terror as a gunman meanders through the mall"/&gt; The final victim was 46-year-old father of two and youth sports coach Steven Forsyth, who was sitting by a rented [[kiosk]] and talking with his father on his cell phone when he was shot in the head and killed.

At this point, hundreds of people fled the mall after hearing the gunshots, but many remained inside and dashed to cover. Roberts headed further toward the food court, firing at 16-year-old employee Alina Pavlenko, who was over 100 feet away, but missed. He also dropped three other magazines in his possession.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"/&gt; He then turned back and headed toward a [[JCPenney]] store. He attempted to reload the AR-15 at that point, but was unable to do so, the weapon having apparently jammed. During that time, Nick Meli, a [[concealed carry]] permit holder, drew his [[Glock 22]], claimed to have taken aim at Roberts, but did not fire since there was a bystander behind Roberts. Meli claims that Roberts saw him and that this may have contributed to Roberts' decision to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clackamas mall shooter faced man with concealed weapon|url=http://www.kgw.com/video/news/clackamas-mall-shooter-faced-man-with-concealed-weapon/283-606213|website=kgw.com|publisher=KGW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shooting ends===
Roberts then ran into a back storage corridor, where he encountered employee Rok Sang Kim, who had returned from recycling boxes and therefore hadn't heard the gunfire. Roberts pointed the rifle at him, but didn't shoot him, instead running down a flight of stairs onto a lower floor. There, he committed suicide at 3:50&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center shooting: 22 minutes of chaos and terror as a gunman meanders through the mall"/&gt; In the chaos of the first few minutes after the shooting, there were expectations of mass casualties. Police responded to the scene minutes later and spent the following hours searching the mall for hiding civilians, injured victims, and a possible second shooter, while dozens of ambulances arrived with the expectations of treating dozens of wounded victims, but treated only Kristina Shevchenko for a serious gunshot wound.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center shooting: 22 minutes of chaos and terror as a gunman meanders through the mall"/&gt; Roberts fired only seventeen rounds during the entire shooting, including the one to kill himself. An additional 128 rounds were found in the magazines he dropped and on his person.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"/&gt;

By the next day, the mall was cleared of civilians, but continued to remain under lock-down. It is believed Roberts targeted random people and did not have a specific target in mind.&lt;ref name=cnn1212&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title='I have lived one crazy life so far,' Oregon mall gunman says on Facebook|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=December 12, 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/12/us/oregon-mall-gunman-profile/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Ian|last2=Raftery|first2=Isolde|title=Two people shot to death at mall in Portland, Oregon; gunman also dies|date=December 11, 2012|publisher=[[NBC News]]|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/11/15849093-two-people-shot-to-death-at-mall-in-portland-oregon-gunman-also-dies?lite |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bella"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bella|first=Rick|title=Clackamas Town Center shooting: Killer was Jacob Tyler Roberts; fatalities were Steve Forsyth, Cindy Ann Yuille|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] ''via [[OregonLive.com]]''|date=December 12, 2012|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/2012/12/clackamas_town_center_shooting_13.htm|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Tyler Roberts''' (March 16, 1990 – December 11, 2012) was identified as the sole perpetrator of the shooting. He lived in the [[Lents, Portland, Oregon|Lents]] neighborhood in southeast Portland.&lt;ref name="cnn1212"/&gt; Roberts was raised by his aunt Tami Roberts; his biological mother, Teresa Anne Roberts, died from cancer in February 1993, shortly before his third birthday.  Court records and family indicated that the identity of his father is unknown.  He had been estranged from his aunt Tami Roberts since the time he was 18 years of age, though the aunt declined to comment on the reason, saying only that it was unrelated to an $18,000 inheritance from Roberts's grandmother that court documents allegedly show Tami Roberts misappropriated.&lt;ref name=Dubois&gt;{{cite web|last=Dubois|first=Steven|title=Jacob Tyler Roberts' Injury Dashed Oregon Mall Shooter's Hopes Of Being Marine|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/jacob-tyler-roberts-broken-foot-marines_n_2299611.html|work=Huffington Post Crime|publisher=Huffington Post|author2=Rachel La Corte|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Milwaukie High School]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon]] for the first three years and later transferred during his senior year to [[Oregon City High School]] in [[Oregon City, Oregon]], graduating in 2008.

Two years prior to the shooting, Roberts worked at a [[gyro (food)|gyro]] restaurant in downtown Portland,&lt;ref name="Bella"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portlandtribuneanderson"&gt;{{cite news|date=December 12, 2012|last=Anderson|first=Jennifer|title=Shooter: 'I'm the kind of person who's going to do what I want'|newspaper=[[Portland Tribune]]|url= http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/124731-shooter--im-the-kind-of-person-whos-going-to-do-what-i-want}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was well-liked by his employer.&lt;ref name=Dubois /&gt; Roberts lived with a few roommates in a house ten minutes away from the shopping center. He had plans of joining the [[United States Marine Corps]], but he abandoned these dreams after a bicycle accident that broke his foot. Within a week prior to the shooting, he had broken up with his girlfriend, sold his belongings, resigned from his job, and alleged to his friends and colleagues that he was planning to move to [[Hawaii]]. He also purchased at least four magazines and hundreds of rounds of ammunition from local stores during that same timeline.&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center Shooting: After-Action Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clackamas Town Center shooting: 22 minutes of chaos and terror as a gunman meanders through the mall"/&gt;

==Reaction==
When [[U.S. President|President]] [[Barack Obama]] delivered a speech regarding the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], he mentioned other shooting rampages that occurred in the U.S. within previous months, including the incident at the Clackamas Town Center.&lt;ref name="telegraphcouk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Connecticut school shooting: Barack Obama calls for 'meaningful action, regardless of politics'

==Works==
Hamilton has written about the issue of [[climate change]] politics over a period of some 15 years.&lt;ref name=km/&gt; His book ''[[Requiem for a Species]]'' ([[Earthscan]] 2010) explores [[climate change denial]] and its implications.  His earlier books, ''[[Scorcher (book)|Scorcher]]'' (2007) and ''Running from the Storm'' (2001), were critical of the Australian Government's efforts, especially in relation to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Flannery]]. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/book-reviews/scorcher-the-dirty-politics-of-climate-change/2007/05/25/1179601645988.html Scorcher: the dirty politics of climate change] ''The Age'', 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's general view about climate change is that the "world is on a path to a very unpleasant future and it is too late to stop it".&lt;ref name=km&gt;Kelsey Munro. [http://www.smh.com.au/environment/too-late-for-all-but-prayers-20100226-p95h.html Too late for all but prayers] ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 27 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton argues that to believe anything else is to deny the climate change truth and engage in wishful thinking.&lt;ref name=sy&gt;Steven Yearley. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411928 Book of the week: Requiem for a Species] ''Times Higher Education'', 3 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton has written several books relating to [[consumerism]] and [[overconsumption]]. ''[[Growth Fetish]]'' (2003) became an Australian best-seller and suggests that the unthinking pursuit of [[economic growth]] has become a [[Fixation (psychology)|fetish]], which has not led to any real improvements in levels of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Gittins. [http://www.smh.com.au/business/when-growth-turns-into-a-monster-20080506-2bky.html When growth turns into a monster] ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Growth Fetish'',  Hamilton advocates the politics of wellbeing over economic growth.&lt;ref name=kn/&gt; In ''[[Affluenza: When Too Much is Never Enough|Affluenza]]'' (2005), Hamilton describes how these themes play out at a personal level, as he explores the shallowness of modern consumer life.&lt;ref name=kn&gt;Kirsty Needham. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/A-serious-bout-of-affluenza/2005/05/28/1117129904238.html# A serious bout of affluenza]
''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 28 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[What's Left? The Death of Social Democracy|What's Left?]]'' (2006) Hamilton comments on topics written about in ''Growth Fetish'' and ''Affluenza''.  He argues that there is an emergence of new types of "alienation and exploitation", in the form of ravages of the [[free market]], which have "robbed life of its meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-16200577_ITM|title=When the left is half right|last=Maley|first=Barry|date=1 June 2006|work=Quadrant|accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Freedom Paradox: Towards a Post-Secular Ethics|The Freedom Paradox]]'' (2008) relates to the nature and consequences of advanced [[consumer capitalism]].  In the book Hamilton proposes a system of "post-secular ethics" that will serve as a challenge to the "moral malaise" occasioned by the "freedom of the marketplace".&lt;ref&gt;Richard King.

''[[Silencing Dissent: How the Australian Government Is Controlling Public Opinion and Stifling Debate]]'', edited with [[Sarah Maddison]] was published in 2007.

In February 2018 Hamilton published the book ''[[Silent Invasion (book)|Silent Invasion: China's influence in Australia]]'' on the increasing involvement of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in Australian civil society and politics.&lt;ref name="bookreview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/abr-online/current-issue/4663-david-brophy-reviews-silent-invasion-china-s-influence-in-australia-by-clive-hamilton |title=David Brophy reviews 'Silent Invasion: China’s Influence in Australia' by Clive Hamilton |last=Brophy |first=David |date=April 2018 |website=Australian Book Review |language=en-gb |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political candidate==
[[File:Clive Hamilton campaigning in higgins.jpg|right|thumb|Hamilton campaigning in the seat of Higgins in 2009]]
On 23 October 2009, Hamilton was announced as the [[Australian Greens]] candidate for the [[Higgins by-election, 2009|by-election]] in the federal seat of [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Greens announce candidate for Higgins | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/23/2722213.htm| publisher=ABC News | date=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran against nine others for the seat, and came second, receiving 32.40 percent of primary votes and 39.77 percent of preferred votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-14358-215.htm Australian Electoral Commission: Higgins By-election results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208102729/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-14358-215.htm |date=8 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Labor Party did not run a candidate in the election.

Hamilton is a supporter of [[internet censorship in Australia]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/technology/internet/12cyber.html?_r=1 Proposed Filter Criticized in Australia (New York Times)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/web-doesnt-belong-to-net-libertarians/story-0-1111118869227 Web doesn't belong to net libertarians]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee on International Relations''' ('''CIR''') is a one-year [[master's degree]] [[Graduate school|graduate program]] in the Division of Social Sciences at the [[University of Chicago]]. It is the oldest [[international relations]] graduate program in the [[United States]].

==History==
CIR was founded in 1928 by a group of University of Chicago [[professors]], including [[Hans Morgenthau]] and [[Quincy Wright]]. While CIR is known worldwide for one of the most distinguished programs in the study of [[international security]], CIR faculty and students are also well known for academic work in [[international political economy]], international institutions, [[globalization]], [[international law]], [[human rights]], [[comparative politics]], [[human development (humanity)|development]] and [[Area studies|regional studies]].

==Admissions==
Applicants from CIR come from around the world; about 25 percent of [[college application|applications]] and accepted [[students]] are from [[International student|outside the United States]]. Every year, CIR receives over 300 applicants for roughly 40-50 spots. In the admissions process, applicants are required to provide the standard CIR application, [[Recommendation letter|letters of recommendations]], a [[Statement of purpose|personal statement]], a 10-20 page writing sample, and their [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] scores. International applicants from non-English speaking countries also have to provide [[TOEFL]] or [[IELTS]] scores as all coursework is conducted in [[American English]]. Applicants typically have a [[Grade Point Average|GPA]] of 3.5 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher and must have a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree (or similar) from an [[accredited]] [[university]]. In addition to an applicant's academic background, relevant work experience and fit with the program are also taken into account.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Applications are evaluated by an admissions committee which includes CIR preceptors and CIR faculty.

==The program==
The combination of intellectual diversity and analytical strength provide a stimulating environment for CIR students.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The small size and intellectual rigor of the program ensure that students with differing perspectives will challenge each other and come to a more sophisticated understanding of the complicated interaction between the realities of [[international politics]] and [[international economics]]. The program provides excellent preparation for students, whether they choose to continue their graduate studies in leading [[doctoral programs]], or decide to work in [[government]] or the [[private sector]].

Each CIR graduate student is assigned a preceptor based on their own disciplinary and research interests in [[international relations]], such as [[war]], [[area studies|regional studies]], or [[international political economy|international economics]].

===Coursework===
Students take three credited courses per [[Academic term#Collegiate calendars|quarter]], which constitutes a full-load at the University of Chicago. Of the nine total courses, two are required "Core" classes, including a course on [[international security]] and another on [[international political economy]]. CIR students also take three mandatory non-credit classes, including two MA thesis workshops in the [[Autumn|Fall]] and Winter quarters and a class taught by the CIR preceptors called "Perspectives on International Relations" in the Fall quarter. With the remaining seven credited courses, students are allowed to take any graduate-level course, with the following three restrictions: (1) seven of the nine courses must be on the CIR-approved course list, (2) at least three courses must be within the [[Division of Social Sciences]], and (3) three courses must be taken in two of the four possible fields of study.

====Fields of study====
* International Relations Theory, Security and History
* International Political Economy and Development
* Regional Studies and Nationalism
* Human Rights, Environment, and International Law

===MA thesis===
CIR students must also complete a [[thesis]] under the guidance of their preceptor and a faculty adviser of their choosing. Students will be aided by the two required MA thesis workshop classes in the Fall and Winter quarters. Each thesis is expected to be between 35-45 pages in length and below 14,000 words.

===MA with specialization===
CIR students who wish to pursue a particular research topic in greater depth than is possible in one year may pursue the second-year specialization program. Specialization is best designed for students who plan to continue with graduate studies in a [[Ph.D.]] program at the University of Chicago or elsewhere. Specialization is competitive; on average 4-6 students apply, and 2-4 are accepted.

==Joint degrees==
CIR offers [[Double degree|joint degrees]] with different programs and schools at the University of Chicago.

* BA/MA - offered only to current University of Chicago [[undergraduates]] entering their senior year
* MA/MA - with the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies]]
* [[MBA]]/MA - with the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business]]
* [[Juris Doctor|JD]]/MA - with the [[University of Chicago Law School]]

{{nuclear weapons}}
'''Continuity of government''' ('''COG''') is the principle of establishing defined procedures that allow a [[government]] to continue its essential operations in case of a catastrophic event such as [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].

COG was developed by the [[His Majesty's Government|British government]] before and during [[World War II]] to counter threats, such as that of the [[Luftwaffe]] bombing during the [[Battle of Britain]]. The need for continuity of government plans gained new urgency with [[nuclear proliferation]].

During and after the [[Cold War]] countries developed such plans to avoid (or minimize) confusion and disorder due to a  [[power vacuum]] in the aftermath of a nuclear attack.

In the US at least, COG is no longer limited to nuclear emergencies; the [[Continuity of Operations Plan]] was activated following the [[September 11 attacks]].

==By country==

===Canada===
Canada built numerous nuclear bunkers across the country, nicknamed "[[Emergency Government Headquarters|Diefenbunkers]]" in a play on the last name of then-Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]]. In 2016, the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] made an agreement with the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] to open two bunkers for government officials amid the ongoing [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korean nuclear crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/north-korea-canada-cold-war-plan-1.4424523 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114083044/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/north-korea-canada-cold-war-plan-1.4424523 |archivedate=January 14, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China/People's Republic of China===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
{{see also|816 Nuclear Military Plant}}
[[Image:Project-131-tunnel-9756.jpg|thumb|In a tunnel of Project 131]]
The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) once operated [[Underground Project 131]], intended to be the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] headquarters in [[Hubei]] during a nuclear conflict. Built due to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] during that portion of the [[Cold War]], in 1981, the Project 131 site was turned over to the civilian authorities of the prefecture-level city of [[Xianning]], where it is located.

===Czech Republic===
The K-116 facility under Zlíchov hill in western [[Prague]] was designated to house the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak]] government in case of nuclear attack (together with the K-9 facility in [[Jihlava]]) and might still be used as the emergency headquarters of the Czech government and [[Military of the Czech Republic|military]].&lt;ref name="Kam by se ukryli komunističtí funkcionáři před třetí světovou válkou?"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/exkluzivne-na-ct24/203322-kam-by-se-ukryli-komunisticti-funkcionari-pred-treti-svetovou-valkou/ | title = Kam by se ukryli komunističtí funkcionáři před třetí světovou válkou?|language=Czech|trans-title=Where would communist functionaries hide in case of world war III?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
During the [[Cold War]], [[Denmark]] built two bunker complexes, named REGAN Vest and REGAN Øst (Danish: "REGeringsANlæg", translated: "Government Complex West and Government Complex East"), in [[Jutland]] and [[Zealand]] respectively. The idea was to have half of the government and the royal family in one bunker, and the other half in the other, allowing continuity of government, even if one of the bunkers were destroyed or cut off.

The [[Taverny Air Base|Centre d'Opération des Forces Aériennes Stratégiques]] (COFAS) is a [[hardened command centre]] for [[French nuclear forces]] at Taverny Air Base in [[Taverny]], [[Val d'Oise]].  The alternate national command center is located at [[Mont Verdun]] near [[Lyon]].

The hardened headquarters of [[Force Océanique Stratégique]] (FOST), France's nuclear [[SSBN]] fleet, is at [[Houilles]], [[Yvelines]].

===Germany===
[[Germany]] operated a government bunker ([[Government bunker (Germany)|Regierungsbunker]]) to house the German government, parliament and all federal personnel needed to keep the government working in the event of war or severe crisis. It was decommissioned in 1997.

===Ireland (Republic of)===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[National Security Committee (Ireland)|National Security Committee]] (NSC) is the conduit for officials to communicate with the [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister) and/or cabinet members if the normal channel of communication with their minister became unavailable. Drafts of emergency powers legislation have been drawn up in secret, including legislation to deal with circumstances such as an attack on cabinet involving numerous deaths.&lt;ref name="national security"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mulqueen|first1=Michael|title=Re-evaluating Irish national security policy : affordable threats?|date=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-8027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the period of the [[Cold War]], it was envisaged that cabinet ministers, senior civil servants and military advisers would use an underground nuclear bunker at [[Custume Barracks]] in [[Athlone]] in the event of a nuclear exchange. The bunker was equipped with a command and control centre with communications equipment – which had a hotline to the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] in [[Whitehall]] – a map room pointing out important areas for protection, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waking up to a nuclear nightmare...|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/waking-up-to-a-nuclear-nightmare-25908547.html|accessdate=29 October 2016|publisher=Irish Independent|date=31 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Breadun|first1=Deaglan|title=Memo reveals plans for nuclear bunker|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/memo-reveals-plans-for-nuclear-bunker-1.344168|publisher=The Irish Times|date=3 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand government believes the most likely disaster scenario to affect the government is a large earthquake in [[Wellington]]. The government has plans to move Parliament and essential staff to [[Devonport Naval Base]] in [[Auckland]] if such an event occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davison|first=Isaac|title=Parliament would relocate to Auckland if quake knocked out capital|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=11251869|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=NZ Herald|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The [[Norwegian government]] operates a nuclear bunker called [[Sentralanlegget]] in [[Buskerud]] County. The bunker is meant to accommodate the [[Norwegian Royal Family]] and the government in case of a nuclear/military attack on the nation, and also function as a wartime headquarters. There is also a bunker beneath [[Regjeringskvartalet|Høyblokka]] in downtown [[Oslo]].

===Soviet Union and Russia===

Very little, in the public domain, is known about [[Russia]]'s COG plans. One sprawling underground facility residing in tunnels cut into [[Mount Yamantau]] is likely to be related to the survival of Russia's government, given its size and decades long construction history, with a construction start during the rule of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] (1964–82).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/16/world/despite-cold-war-s-end-russia-keeps-building-a-secret-complex.html |title=
Despite Cold War's End, Russia Keeps Building a Secret Complex By MICHAEL R. GORDON Published: April 16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KGB]] defector Colonel [[Oleg Gordievsky]] states that an organization, known as Directorate 15, was (or is) tasked with building and maintaining a network of hundreds of underground command bunkers for the [[Soviet]] leadership; this includes the vast site beneath Yamantau Mountain, which is often called [[Beloretsk-16|Mezhgorye / Межго́рье]] after the [[closed city]] that is located nearby. However, there is speculation, due to its proximity to [[Chelyabinsk-70]], that Yamantau is a  400-square-mile underground complex which houses nuclear warheads, missiles, launch controls, and several nuclear weapons factories designed to continue production after a hypothetical nuclear war begins.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowonheartland.net/2012/02/russias-top-secret-bases.html |title=WINDOW ON HEARTLAND Geopolitical notes on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424050959/http://www.windowonheartland.net/2012/02/russias-top-secret-bases.html |archivedate=April 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second command and control center in the [[Urals]], after Yamantau, is similarly speculated to be underground and located near, or under, [[Kosvinsky Kamen]]. The site is believed to host the Russian [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] alternate command post, a post for the general staff built to compensate for the vulnerability of older Soviet era command posts in the Moscow region. In spite of this, the primary command posts for the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] remains [[Kuntsevo]] in Moscow and the secondary is the Kosvinsky Mountain in the Urals.&lt;ref&gt;Globalsecurity.org, [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/c3i_fac.htm Strategic C3I Facilities], accessed October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The facility at Kosvinsky, finished in early 1996, was designed to resist US [[nuclear bunker buster|earth-penetrating warheads]] and serves a similar role as the American [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]].&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

Further command centers, according to globalsecurity.org, include one near [[Chekhov, Moscow Oblast|Chekhov]], which is the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian General Staff]] wartime command post, buried deep underground,&lt;ref&gt;Globalsecurity.org. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/chekhov.htm Chekhov].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sharapovo]] about {{convert|80|km|-1}} south of Moscow, built in the 1950s, Sharapovo is believed to have been the primary backup command center for the Soviet era leadership. Both Chekhov and Sharapovo are each suggested to have the capability to accommodate about 30,000 individuals,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; As an alternative to Sharapovo, a secondary political leadership base is located at Chaadayevka, some 650 kilometers southeast of Moscow near the city of [[Penza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/chaadayevka.htm |title=Chaadayevka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also said to be as many as 12 underground levels beneath the Russian capital of [[Moscow]] to protect the government in the [[Kremlin]], known as the Main Directorate of special programs of the President (Glavnoye Upravlenie Specialnih Program: GUSP) &lt;small&gt;([[:ru:Главное управление специальных программ Президента Российской Федерации|ru]])&lt;/small&gt; the direct successor of the 15th Directorate of the KGB, which was established in 1977, GUSP is said to oversee, amongst other sites, a parallel track line alongside the [[Moscow metro]], known as the 'Kremlin line' [[Moscow Metro-2|Metro-2 or D-6]] to be used in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agentura.ru/english/dosie/gusp/ |title=The Main Directorate of special programs of the President, the GUSP Chief - Alexander Tsarenko }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two destinations of this system are suggested to be the old [[KGB]] headquarters, now the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] headquarters, at [[Lubyanka Square]], and the second being regarded as an enormous underground leadership bunker adjacent to [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref name="United States Department of Defense 1991 40"/&gt; Another alleged subterranean destination, apart from the aforementioned  underground town at [[Ramenki District|Ramenki]]/Moscow State University is ''[[Vnukovo]]-2'' airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/1997/fbuma04301997000507.htm|title=Global Security.

===Sweden===
During the [[Cold War]], the [[Klara shelter|Klara skyddsrum]] ("Klara shelter" or "Klara bunker") was built underneath [[Stockholm]]. The bunker is designed to accommodate two thirds of the government and between 8,000 and 12,000 civilians in the case of a military attack on Stockholm.  It is designed as a very large, two-story oval, with multiple entrances.  During peace time, parts of it are used as a parking garage.
Sweden built over 65,000 fallout shelters &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.se/20171101/why-sweden-is-home-to-65000-fallout-shelters&lt;/ref&gt; in regular houses, every county had at least one large hard-rock underground bunker that controlled a number of smaller bunkers that was located in the municipality's &lt;ref&gt;https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/halland/hemlig-bunker-i-halmstad-oppnades&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Turkey===
There is little public knowledge about continuity of government in Turkey. The cabinet and presidential offices, based in the capital of [[Ankara]], have secondary sites in [[İstanbul]] and [[İzmir]].

===United Kingdom===
The primary British COG headquarters is at the Ministry of Defence in [[Whitehall]].  The [[Central Government War Headquarters]] was previously maintained in a quarry complex near [[Corsham, Wiltshire]]. The above-ground support facility was [[RAF Rudloe Manor]].

Service command centres are [[Northwood Headquarters|Northwood]] for the [[Royal Navy Trident SSBN force]], and [[RAF High Wycombe]] for the Royal Air Force.

===United States===
{{Main article|Continuity of Operations Plan}}
Continuity of the national government was first threatened in late 1776, when British forces advanced toward the Continental capital at [[Philadelphia]]. On December 9 the [[Continental Congress]] passed a resolution in anticipation of a British capture:

:''Resolved'': That in case this Congress shall be under the necessity of removing from Philadelphia, it shall be adjourned to [[Baltimore]].

The Congress was adjourned as planned three days later.&lt;ref&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/ref&gt; Other relocations followed during the course of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].

For most of its existence, the United States operated without a standing continuity plan. When British forces [[Burning of Washington|burned Washington]] in 1814, Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] received only a few hours' notice to remove the government records. Although his staff saved many valuable records, much was nonetheless destroyed, and the next administration encountered a great deal of confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/short-history/staffing|title=Staffing and Administration - Short History - Department History - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 President [[Harry Truman|Truman]] ordered all federal offices to develop their own continuity plans for the event of a [[civil defense]] emergency. Plans have been maintained and adapted since then, at times requiring the construction of secret facilities such as the [[Project Greek Island|emergency Congress facility]] in [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia]]. The current continuity policy is defined in National Security Policy Directive 51&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-51.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and its implementation plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1384886826028-729844d3fd23ff85d94d52186c85748f/NCPIP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The continuity plan was activated for the first time during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060900891.html|title=Shadow Government Is at Work in Secret|first1=Barton|last1=Gellman|first2=Susan|last2=Schmidt|date=1 March 2002|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7171">'''Defensive computing''' is a form of practice for computer users to help reduce the risk of computing problems, by avoiding dangerous computing practices. The primary goal of this method of computing is to be able to anticipate and prepare for potentially problematic situations prior to their occurrence, despite any adverse conditions of a computer system or any mistakes made by other users. This can be achieved through adherence to a variety of general guidelines, as well as the practice of specific computing techniques.

Strategies for defensive computing could be divided into two categories, [[network security]] and the [[backup]] and restoration of data.

== Network security ==
Users put their computers at risk when accessing the [[Internet]] and other [[Computer network|networks]]. The use of either of these allows others to gain access to a user's system and important information. By implementing certain strategies, defensive users aim to reduce the risk associated with network access.

=== Firewall ===
A [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a collection of security measures that protects a computer from harmful inbound and outbound traffic on the Internet and prevents the unauthorized access of computer systems.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/02-12/firewall.pdf http://www.cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/02-12/firewall.pdf], A History and Survey of Network Firewalls&lt;/ref&gt; These security measures are integrated into the form of special software that runs autonomously either on individual computer systems, or externally through built in software within [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[modems]].

Not all firewall software will protect computers from sending unauthorized or harmful outbound traffic.
An important defensive computing strategy is to seek and implement quality firewall software that filters both inbound and outbound traffic.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-9923976-33.html http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-9923976-33.html], The Pillars of Defensive Computing&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-malware software ===
A basic strategy for all defensive computer users is to install and use anti-[[malware]] software.
Firewalls may not completely protect a computer. Malicious software may be able to get through a firewall and onto a system. Anti-Malware such as anti-virus, anti-phishing and email filtering software offer some protection against harmful software that reside within a computer. The amount of  malicious software available over the Internet is steadily increasing.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031901439.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031901439.html], Antivirus Firms Scrambling to Keep Up&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for defensive users to use to anti-malware that is both effective and easily updated in order to combat new strains of malicious software that are developed.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

=== Skepticism ===
	An important aspect of defensive computing is for users to be skeptical of the data to which they have access via the Internet.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2206/2206article6.htm http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2206/2206article6.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724025722/http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2206/2206article6.htm |date=2006-07-24 }}, How To Protect Yourself From Virus Infection&lt;/ref&gt; Malicious software can exist in a multitude of different forms and many are misleading to general computer users and even some anti-malware software. Defensive users think critically about the information they can access, to reduce their chances of downloading and spreading malicious software. Strategies include scanning [[email attachments]] prior to opening them and manually filtering suspicious emails from inboxes. Users should be aware of persuasive subject lines and headings in emails from any address, as they may actually contain malicious software or spam, which can mislead users into false advertisement resulting in identity theft.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
Defensive users can scan files they download prior to opening them and can also configure their computers to show [[file extensions]], revealing potentially dangerous files that appear harmless.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;
Skepticism can also be applied to the websites visited by users. As with emails, users can be led to false advertisements. Also, malicious software can unknowingly be downloaded and infect a computer, just by visiting a certain website.

== Backup and recovery procedures ==
Despite the efforts of a defensive computer user, the loss of important data can occur due to malware, power outages, equipment failure and general misuse. Although the loss of data cannot be completely prevented, defensive users can take steps to minimize the amount of data lost and restore systems to their previous state.

=== Backup of files ===
	A defensive strategy against unintentional data loss is the regular backup of important files. Users can make multiple copies of important data and store them either on the same computer or on another device such as a compact disc or an external hard drive.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/data/what.mspx http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/data/what.mspx], How to Decide what Data to Back Up&lt;/ref&gt; Users can also upload important files to the Internet, provided they have access to Internet storage services. 

=== Restoration ===
Some operating systems give users the option of performing a procedure that restores a computer to a predetermined state. If no option is available, a user can obtain the appropriate restoration software for their system. In the event of a system failure or a serious case of data loss, a user can restore any lost or changed files and remove any malicious files that did not previously exist.&lt;ref name="five"/&gt;

== Good practices for protecting data ==
* Regularly backup important files, documents and emails.
* Do not use the administrator account for day-to-day activities.
* Keep software up-to-date with the latest versions. 
* Keep antivirus and [[antispyware]] up-to-date with latest versions.
* Use different passwords 
* Disable auto run feature from USB [[flash drives]]. Some viruses, specially [[computer worm|worms]], spread automatically through USB flash drives &lt;ref name="seven"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-10027754-33.html http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-10027754-33.html], Be safer than NASA: Disable autorun&lt;/ref&gt;
* Always connect to the Internet behind a firewall
* When in doubt, throw it out

The [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) was first passed in 1973 and forms the basis of [[biodiversity]] and endangered species protection in the United States.  The original purpose of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was to prevent [[Endangered species|species endangerment]] and [[extinction]] due to the human impact on natural ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Volume 7"&gt;U.S. Congress (1979). “Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978, Legislative History.” U.S. Code Congressional and Administrating News Volume 7. St. Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three most powerful sections of the ESA are Sections 4,7 and 9.  Section 4 allows the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretaries of Interior]] and Commerce to list species as threatened or endangered based on best available data.&lt;ref name="Petersen"&gt;Petersen, Shannon (2002).  [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3854/is_/ai_n9202681 Acting for Endangered Species: The Statutory Ark.]  Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 7 requires federal agencies to consult with [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) or [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) before taking any action that may threaten a listed species.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  Section 9 forbids the taking of an endangered species.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  The first amendment to the ESA was passed by the [[95th United States Congress]] in 1978 to "introduce some flexibility into the Endangered Species Act."&lt;ref name="Volume 7"/&gt;

==The snail darter==
[[File:Percina tanasi.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Snail darter, ''Percina tanasi'']]
The [[Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill|snail darter case]] was important for the ESA because it made [[United States Congress|Congress]] realize how powerful the ESA really was.  In 1966, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] began construction on the [[Tellico Dam]] on the [[Little Tennessee River]]. For years, environmentalists tried to shut down the project, but their actions were unsuccessful until the discovery of the [[snail darter]], a small fish that feeds off aquatic snails. The snail darter was listed as an endangered species in 1975 and part of the Little Tennessee River was designated as critical habitat.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  The completion of the Tellico Dam threatened the survival of the snail darter, which was thought to be native only to the Little Tennessee River. In 1976, battle in the courts between the Tennessee Valley Authority and environmentalists began over the fate of the snail darter. Over the next three years, the decision was appealed all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In ''[[Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill]]'' the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of protecting the species "whatever the cost".  The Endangered Species Act was clear in stating that no federal project should be exempt from the provisions of Section 7.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;

==The whooping crane and weakening the ESA==
Starting in the spring of 1977, members of Congress made several attempts to pass legislation that weakened the ESA. Many large business interest groups, including the mining and timber industries, also spoke out against the power of the ESA.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  Beginning in April 1978, the Senate Subcommittee on Resources Protection began debating and developing a bill that would create a committee with power to exempt federal actions from Section 7 requirements.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  On April 12, 1978 [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Culver]] (D-IA) and Senate Minority Leader [[Howard Baker]] (R-TN) introduced a bill that would create a seven-member [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]-level committee with the authority to exempt a federal agency from Section 7 requirements.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;

Meanwhile, in [[Wheatland, Wyoming]], a consortium of energy utilities were attempting to build the Grayrocks Dam on the [[Laramie River]] to supply a coal fired power plant.&lt;ref name="snre.umich.edu"&gt;[http://www.snre.umich.edu/ecomgt/cases/pubs/acus/The_Grayrocks_Dam_Conflict.pdf Steven L. Yaffee and Julia M. Wondolleck, Negotiating Survival: An Assessment of the Potential Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution Techniques for Resolving Conflicts Between Endangered Species and Development (Ann Arbor, MI: School of Natural Resources and Environment, The University of Michigan, September 1994), a report prepared for the Administrative Conference of the United States.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Upset that water diversion would threaten the critically endangered [[whooping crane]], on October 2, 1978, the [[Nebraska Attorney General]]’s office obtained a federal injunction barring the dam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elr.info/litigation/%5Bfield_article_volume-raw%5D/20789/nebraska-v-rural-electrification-admin ''Nebraska v. Rural Electrification Admin.'', 8 ELR 20789, No. Nos. CV-76-L-242, CV-78-L-90, 12 ERC 1156/(D. Neb., 10/02/1978).]&lt;/ref&gt;
Grayrocks, however, enjoyed strong support in Congress, and by October 14 [[Teno Roncalio]] (D-WY) convinced the House to pass a bill exempting the dam from all federal regulation.&lt;ref name="snre.umich.edu"/&gt;  In lieu of that, Senator Culver (D-IA) adapted the bill to his own attempts to exempt the snail darter, creating the Endangered Species Committee and required the committee to decide on an exemption from protections of the snail darter and the whooping crane within 30 days.  Both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to amend the ESA and on November 10 President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed the amendment into law.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;
On December 4 Nebraska reached a settlement under which the power utilities would get to build Grayrocks dam by agreeing to purchase some habitat for the whooping crane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2087&amp;context=ndlr des Rosiers, Note, ''Exemption Process under the Endangered Species Act: How the God Squad Works and Why'', 66 Notre Dame L. Rev. 825 (1991).]&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 7, 1979, the God Squad met for the first time, refused to exempt the snail darter from protection, and granted Grayrocks an exemption from the whooping crane protections.

==The amendment of 1978 and the "God Squad"==
The 1978 amendment to the ESA "attempts to retain the basic integrity of the ESA, while introducing some flexibility which will permit exemptions from the Act's stringent requirements."&lt;ref name="Volume 7"/&gt;  The amendment clarified the ESA of 1973 in many ways, including clearly defining the term critical habitat, clearly defining penalties for non-compliance and determining the future appropriation of funds.&lt;ref name="Volume 2"&gt;U.S. Congress (1979). “Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978.” U.S. Code Congressional and Administrating News Volume 2. St. Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important change that was brought about by the 1978 amendment was the creation of the Endangered Species Committee, known as the "God Squad" because of the  substantial impact of its decisions on the natural world.&lt;ref name="Volume 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971548,00.html | title = Down with The God Squad | last = Gup | first = T | date = 1990-11-05 | accessdate = 2009-05-21 | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The God Squad is a committee composed of seven Cabinet-level members: The [[administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]], the administrator of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], the chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]], a representative from the [[U.S. state|state]] in question, the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]], the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], and the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;Abrams, Robert H., William Goldfarb, Robert L. Graham, and Zygmunt J.B. Plater (1998). Environmental Law and Policy: Nature, Law, and Society. St. Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This committee has the authority to allow the extinction by exempting a federal agency from Section 7 requirements.  To exempt a species, five of the seven members must vote in favor of the exemption.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;  The following conditions must be met for a species to be considered for exemption: 
# there must be no reasonable alternative to the agencies action
# the benefits of the action must outweigh the benefits of an alternative action where the species is conserved
# the action is of regional or national importance
# neither the federal agency or the exemption applicant made irreversible commitment to the resources.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;

Also, mitigation efforts must be taken to reduce the negative effects on the endangered species.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;

==The God Squad and the northern spotted owl==
Since the whooping crane, the only endangered species protections the God Squad has exempted was the [[northern spotted owl]]. It started in 1991, when a federal judge ordered the halting of logging on Pacific Northwest national lands because of the threat to the northern spotted owl.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, Emily (2001).  The God Squad and the Case of the Northern Spotted Owl.  Oley, Pennsylvania: Bullfrog Films.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this action, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) filed for exemption from Section 7.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;  The northern spotted owl is a medium-sized bird that is dependent on [[old-growth forest]] and large territories for survival.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  The BLM came up with a solution that allowed logging to continue in the area, which included the sale of timber on 44 timber tracts to the logging industry.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; The 44 tracts totaled 4400 acres (18&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;  The God Squad convened and discussed the issue.  In a 5:2 vote, the God Squad voted for approval of the exemption in thirteen of the sales where there was no reasonable alternative to the sale.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  However, the exemption was soon overturned when Judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]] on the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found it had been illegal for the President to talk to his cabinet about the exemption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1302&amp;context=plrlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dportland%2Baudubon%2Bsociety%2Bv.%2Bendangered%2Bspecies%2Bcommittee%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22portland%20audubon%20society%20v.%20endangered%20species%20committee%22 Victor M. Sher, ''Travels With Strix: The Spotted Owl's Journey Through the Federal Courts'', 14 Pub. Land L. Rev. 41 (1993)] ''discussing'' [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8702512949267915687&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Portland Audubon Soc. v. Endangered Species'', 984 F.2d 1534 (9th Cir. 1993)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmentalists and the BLM agreed on a compromise that allowed the timber sale to continue. The BLM would develop a Long Range Forest Management Plan that would need to be approved by the FWS before any future timber sales.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;  When the Clinton administration came into office, they withdrew the exemption request and convened a conference resulting in appointment of the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team (FEMAT).&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;  The FEMAT was created to develop a plan to protect the owl while still maintaining logging and forest management across the region. FEMAT and the Clinton administration agreed to protect 10 million acres (40,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of old growth forest for the owl, while limiting logging to 1 billion board feet (2 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) per year.&lt;ref name="Petersen"/&gt;

'''Fernando Mezzasoma''' (August 3, 1907 &amp;ndash; April 28, 1945) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Fascism|fascist]] journalist and political figure.

==Biography==
Mezzasoma was born in [[Rome]], the son of middle-class [[Perugia]]ns; from his late teens he showed himself to be a passionate supporter of [[Benito Mussolini]].

Mezzasoma had to contribute to his impoverished family's income from early on, and took several jobs before finishing studies in [[accounting]]. A secretary to the lawyer [[Amedeo Fani]], he was integrated to the state [[bureaucracy]] in 1929, after Fani became undersecretary to the ministry of [[Dino Grandi]] (the [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]). In 1931, he joined the ranks of the [[National Fascist Party]] (PNF), and soon after became secretary of the Perugia branch of the [[Gruppo Universitario Fascista]] (GUF), the Fascist [[student organization]].

The following year, Mezzasoma was appointed one of the local PNF leaders in Perugia (holding the position until 1935). He began writing for official magazines, such as ''Dottrina Fascista'' and ''Roma Fascista'', usually under the [[pen name]] ''[[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogene]]''. Editor of ''[[Assalto]]'' in 1934, he became co-editor of the GUF mouthpiece ''[[Libro e Moschetto]]''; in 1937, he published ''Essenza dei GUF'' ("Essence of the GUF"), a [[propaganda]] volume that was distributed throughout the network of Fascist [[youth organization]]s.

A national deputy-secretary of the GUF in 1935, he was included to the leadership group of the PNF in January 1937, and its deputy-secretary on February 23, 1939. When Italy entered [[World War II]] as an [[Axis Powers|Axis Power]], he volunteered for the 7th Artillery Division. In 1942, he quit the army to become the director of the Italian press; he continued in that role until 1943. Unlike a great many leading figures of the government (such as [[Galeazzo Ciano]] and [[Dino Grandi]]), he stayed loyal to Mussolini long after the July 1943 [[Grand Council of Fascism]] crisis which ended the latter's rule in [[Rome]].

With the foundation of the [[Nazi Germany]]-assisted [[Italian Social Republic]], he was appointed Mussolini's Minister of Popular Culture, and held this post until the Republic collapsed less than two years later.

He clashed with [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] and, on April 19, 1945, left for [[Milano]] - parting with his collaborators (including [[Giorgio Almirante]]). It seems that he had the opportunity to flee the region following Germany's defeat, but would have refused, saying: "''I am a minister of Mussolini, I shall die with him''".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

He was shot by the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] in [[Dongo, Italy|Dongo]], captured while he was trying to make his way to [[Switzerland]].

The '''Football Governance Inquiry''' was a British public inquiry into the governance of football in the United Kingdom. The inquiry was announced on 7 December 2010.&lt;ref name="launch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee launches inquiry on Football Governance|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/committee-launches-a-new-inquiry-on-football-governance/|publisher=parliament.uk|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Whittingdale, the Committee Chair said: "The Government has said that it will encourage the reform of football governance rules to support the co-operative ownership of football clubs by supporters, and there is widespread concern that the current governance arrangements are not fit-for-purpose."&lt;ref name="launch"/&gt;

==Background==

After several high-profile controversial events in football including but not limited to [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s ownership of [[Manchester City F.C.]], leveraged buyouts by [[Tom Hicks]] and [[George N. Gillett, Jr.|George Gillett]] at [[Liverpool F.C.]] and [[Malcolm Glazer]] at [[Manchester United]], [[Portsmouth F.C.]]'s [[administration (law)|administration]] and four successive ownerships within the space of 12 months, public in-fighting within [[The Football Association]], England's unsuccessful multi-million pound bid for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], record high amount of money being paid to [[sports agent]]s and record numbers of clubs entering administration, there was scope to see what could be done to improve Governance of football in United Kingdom.

===Criticism===

[[BBC]]'s Sports Editor David Bond criticised the scope of the inquiry as being "too broad to deliver anything worthwhile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=David|title=Is football governance inquiry too broad to hit target?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/davidbond/2011/03/inquiry_into_football_governan.html|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The inquiry==

Members of the public were asked to submit written evidence for the inquiry, the following questions were asked:

* Should football clubs in the UK be treated differently from other commercial organisations?
* Are football governance rules in England and Wales, and the governing bodies which set and apply them, fit for purpose?
* Is there too much debt in the professional game?
* What are the pros and cons of the Supporter Trust share-holding model?
* Is Government intervention justified and, if so, what form should it take?
* Are there lessons to be learned from football governance models across the UK and abroad, and from governance models in other sports?

The Government published a 447-page document containing written information from members of the public, football supporters' trusts, universities and football clubs notably [[Chester F.C.]] and [[Scarborough Athletic F.C.]]&lt;ref name="written-evidence-2011-02-08"&gt;{{cite web|title=Written Evidence – at 8 February 2011|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmcumeds/writev/792/792we.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 2011, the Committee held the first evidence session for its inquiry into football governance took place at [[Portcullis House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee to hear from former FA insiders|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/committee-to-hear-from-lord-burns-on-football-governance/|publisher=parliament.uk|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict''' ('''GPPAC''') is a member-led network of civil society organisations (CSOs) active in the field of conflict prevention and peacebuilding across the world. The network is organised around 15 regional networks of local organisations, each region having its own priorities, character and agenda. Each region is represented in an International Steering Group, which determines joint global priorities and actions. GPPAC was initiated through extensive consultations in 2003-4, and officially launched as part of a global conference in 2005 at the UN headquarters in New York.

As part of its mission to work towards a global shift from reaction to prevention of violent conflict, GPPAC strives towards multi-actor collaboration and local ownership. Together, GPPAC members aim to achieve greater synergy in the field of conflict prevention and peacebuilding  by connecting different levels (from national to regional and global), and to strengthen the role of local civil society groups in conflict regions.

GPPAC supports the capacity of the regional networks to interact and act together, and facilitates regional and global exchanges, where members from different parts of the world come together and learn from each other's experiences and develop joint strategies. GPPAC also connect its members with other relevant actors, including the UN, regional intergovernmental organisations, state actors, the media and academia. This has enabled unique initiatives, showing GPPAC’s ability to bridge global policy making with local ownership and practice on the ground.

Achievements of GPPAC so far have included:

* Greater access and direct involvement of local civil society in policy processes such as the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development and UN initiatives such as the UN Peacebuilding Commission;
* Mobilisation of the global network in support of local CSOs - through tools, advice, contacts, political leverage or international civil society delegations – contributing to efforts to prevent or constrain violence in times of crisis or political change, as seen during the post-election crisis in Kenya, the political transition in Guinea Conakry, and recent clashes in Kyrgyzstan;
* The development of a Preventive Action framework to enable CSOs to engage from the stage of conflict assessment to the implementation and monitoring of conflict prevention strategies;
* Promotion of networks and dialogue initiatives (track II diplomacy) in the Caucasus, Latin America and other politically sensitive regions such as South Asia and Northeast Asia;
* Initiation of a dialogue and collaboration between CSOs and regional organisations such as the OAS, ECOWAS, SAARC and ASEAN on security issues
* Increased capacity of CSOs to work together in reaching out to the media and policy makers through ‘Media Focal Points’, quiet diplomacy workshops and policy liaison functions.
* Setting up of the Peace Portal, an online platform that is being custom-built to support the interaction, information-sharing and joint action of actors and initiatives in the conflict prevention and peacebuilding field.
* A global mapping of expertise and initiatives within the GPPAC network related to the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security
�

==Five Main Programme Areas==
GPPAC focuses on the following thematic priorities:

* '''Preventive Action''': developing effective tools and operational capacities to mobilise action and enable CSOs to contribute to preventing conflict in collaboration with other key stakeholders
* '''Dialogue &amp; Mediation''': building capacity and mobilising the expertise within the network to directly support dialogue and mediation efforts in conflict situations
* '''Peace Education''': enhancing methodologies for formal and informal education that fosters a culture of dialogue and peaceful handling of conflict, and collaborating with governments to institutionalise such initiatives in educational and local authority systems
* '''Human Security:''' developing a bottom-up approach to Security, by providing the input of grassroots CSOs in the development and implementation of security strategies including DDR, SSR, measures to address [[violent extremism]], and civil-military interventions.
* '''Gender''' and UNSCR 1325 as a cross-cutting priority for GPPAC themes and strategies.

GPPAC has also launched the [http://www.peaceportal.org Peace Portal] January 2012. The Peace Portal is a unique online platform for learning, sharing and collaborating in the conflict prevention and  peacebuilding field. It aims to bring people together and transform their online work into active, more effective peacebuilding.The Portal encourages information sharing and participation from civil society and grassroots organisations, whose voices often can not find the online visibility they need. Open to everybody, the Peace Portal is an important tool for GPPAC, to support its peacebuilding activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9760">[[File:Mobilizaiton for Global Justice.jpg|thumb|320px|Activists protest policies of the [[World Bank]] in Washington, DC.]]
The '''global justice movement''' is a network of [[globalization|globalized]] [[social movements]] opposing what is often known as the “[[Economic globalization|corporate globalization]]” and promoting equal distribution of economic resources.

==Movement of movements==
The global justice movement describes the loose collection of individuals and groups&amp;mdash;often referred to as a “[[movement of movements]]”&amp;mdash;who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and are negative to current institutions of global economics such as the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate Milberry: [http://geeksandglobaljustice.com/wp-content/Milberry-Dissertation-for-Library.pdf ''GEEKS AND GLOBAL JUSTICE: ANOTHER (CYBER)WORLD IS POSSIBLE] 2009 geeksandglobaljustice.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is often labeled the [[anti-globalization movement]] by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the [[globalization]] of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of [[corporate power]].&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. “The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum.” Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The term further indicates an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[Moral universalism|universalist]] perspective on globalization, distinguishing the movement from those opponents of globalization whose politics are based on a [[Conservatism|conservative]] defence of [[national sovereignty]]. It is, however, argued by some scholars of social movements, that a new concept of justice, alongside some old notions, underlies many critical ideas and practices developed in this movement. S. A. Hamed Hosseini coins this new mode of conceptualizing justice ''accommodative justice''  and argues that both the unique nature of the movement and the global complexities of the post-[[Cold War era]] can be accounted for the rise of such notion. According to him, "this new concept of justice has emerged from many activists’ experiences of and reflections on the complexities of globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosseini|first=S. A. Hamed|title=Global Complexities and the Rise of Global Justice Movement: A New Notion of Justice|journal=The Global Studies  Journal| year= 2009|volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=15–36|url= http://gsj.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.184/prod.118}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Important organizational pillars of the movement are [[Via Campesina]], the family farmers' international; [[Peoples' Global Action]], a loose collection of often youthful groups; [[Jubilee 2000]], the Christian-based movement for relieving international debt; [[Friends of the Earth]], the environmentalist international; and some think-tanks like [[Focus on the Global South]] and [[Third World Network]],&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reitan: Global Activism, Routledge 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some large internationalist and transnational trade union organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/35/1/63.abstract ''The Construction of a Trans-European Labour Movement'', Capital &amp; Class, February 2011, by Daniel Jakopovich]&lt;/ref&gt;
Participants include worldwide student groups, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], trade unions, faith-based and peace groups, and publications such as ''[[New Internationalist]]''. A loose coordination of the movement is taking place on the [[World Social Forum|Social Forums]]. However, although formal power is often situated in the global South, the resources of North-based NGOs give these disproportionate power to often informally marginalize popular organizations from the South.&lt;ref&gt;Jai Sen, Peter Waterman, [http://openword.in/challenging-empires-2 World Social Forum - Challenging Empires]. Black Rose 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massive protests===
The movement is characterized by the massive citizen protests and alternative summits which have, for the last decade, accompanied most meetings of the [[G8]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], and [[World Bank]]. The movement came to the attention of many in the US when activists temporarily shut down the 1999 [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Ministerial]] in Seattle. This represented, however, just one of a series of Global Justice protests, including those at the 1988 World Bank/IMF meetings in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/berlin.htm Berlin 1988 IMF World Bank Conference protests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219063747/http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/berlin.htm |date=2005-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "IMF riots" beginning in Lima in 1975, over cuts in the [[social safety net]] presided over by IMF and other international organizations, and spreading through the world,&lt;ref&gt;Greg Palast interviewing Joseph Steiglitz, "IMF’s Four steps to Damnation" The Observer (London), 29 April 2001: http://www.jubileeresearch.org/analysis/articles/IMF_Four_steps_Damnation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Walton, David Seddon, Free Markets &amp; Food Riots. Blackwell 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and "water wars" in Bolivia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;The Democracy Center, "Bechtel Vs. Bolivia: The Bolivian Water Revolt", http://www.democracyctr.org/bechtel/&lt;/ref&gt;

===International solidarity===
The global justice movement claims to place a significant emphasis on transnational solidarity uniting activists in the [[Global North|global South and global North]]. Some{{who|date=August 2012}} have argued that the [[World Social Forum]] is one excellent example of this emphasis, bringing activists together from around the world to focus on shared philosophy and campaigning. However others{{who|date=August 2012}} see the World Social Forum as dominated by Northern NGOs, donors and activists and argue that Southern representation is largely organized via Northern donors and their NGOs and that popular organizations in the global South are systematically marginalized or included in a deeply subordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;See for instances criticisms of how Northern donors and NGOs have determined African participation in the World Social Forum at [http://abahlali.org/node/845 Brief Reflection on World Social Forum 2007 (Kenya, Nairobi)] by David Ntseng. World Social Forum, 2007-03-06&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason many grassroots movements in the South boycott the forum and the NGOs that gate-keep representation at the forum or, in some instance, actively oppose it as just one more space of domination.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20547">The '''governance of the University of St Andrews''' is laid down in a series of [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] (the Universities (Scotland) Acts) enacted between 1858 and 1966, and the Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Act 2016.

In common with the other [[Ancient university|Ancient universities]] of [[Scotland]], there are three bodies responsible for governance, as determined by the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]].  This Act created three bodies: the [[General Council of the University of St Andrews|General Council]], [[University Court]] and [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'').

The General Council, chaired by the [[Chancellor of the University of St Andrews|Chancellor]], represents the interests of all staff and graduates of the University and has an advisory role, but the Principal and University Court are required to present an annual report to the General Council. The University Court, chaired by the [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|Rector]], is the ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' supreme governing body of the University with the authority to appoint the [[Principal of the University of St Andrews|Principal]], and the power to overrule the ''Senatus Academicus''. The ''Senatus Academicus'', chaired by the Principal, is charged with determining the programmes of teaching for the students, and deciding on the regulations for the awarding of degrees. The ''Senatus Academicus'' has the ''de facto'' responsibility for student discipline, subject to the [[appellate jurisdiction]] of the Court.

==General Council==
{{main|General Council of the University of St Andrews}}

The General Council is a standing advisory body of all the [[alumnus|graduates]], [[academics]] and former academics of the University.  It meets twice a year and appoints a [[Business Committee]] to transact business between those meetings.  The most important jobs it performs is in appointing two [[Assessor (law)|Assessor]]s to the [[University Court]] and electing the University [[Chancellor of the University of St Andrews|Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/general-council/|title=General Council {{!}} University of St Andrews|last=|first=|date=|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|publisher=University of St Andrews|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutile|first=Fernand N.|date=1 January 1997|title=Law and Governance Affecting the Resolution of Academic and Disciplinary Disputes at Scottish Universities: An American Perspective|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/iicl8&amp;collection=journals&amp;startid=&amp;endid=76&amp;id=9|journal=Indiana International Comparative Law Review|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1-68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="act_1858"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1858|chapter=83|act=Universities (Scotland) Act 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University Court==

=== Remit and jurisdiction ===
The [[University Court]] was established by the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]] as the supreme governing body of the University, in effect the University's [[board of directors]], which has responsibility for the [[finances]] and [[Administration (business)|administration]] of the University. The University Court has the power to overturn decisions made by the ''Senatus Academicus'' and all of the academic staff of the University are ''de jure'' appointed by the Court, but ''de facto'' such decisions are made by the Principal and the Academic Council.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Membership ===
At its creation the Court had a small membership representing the Chancellor, Rector, Principal and Senate, but the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 non-professorial staff were added to the Court. The Court maintains a significant majority of members drawn from within, or appointed by those within, the University community itself. The only person appointed from outwith the University is the Assessor of the Provost of Fife Council. Six of the eight co-opted members could come from beyond the University community.&lt;ref name="act_1858" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|year=1966|act=Universities (Scotland) Act 1966|chapter=13|type=act}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court is chaired by the [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|Rector]] who is elected by all the [[matriculation|matriculated]] students of the University, and is the ordinary president of the Court.

The membership of the Court was set by Court Ordinance No. 121 of May 2002 (as approved by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]) which is:&lt;ref name="privycouncil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orders Approved at the Council Held by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on 22 May 2002|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page480.asp|website=www.privy-council.org.uk|publisher=Privy Council Office|accessdate=21 April 2017|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103140224/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/word/May%20Draft%20List.doc|archive-date=3 November 2010|page=1|date=22 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ordinance121"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/about/governance/documents/ordinances-resolutions/acts-ordinances-resolutions-university-court.pdf|title=The Acts, Ordinances and Resolutions Affecting the University Of St Andrews|last=|first=|date=February 2017|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|publisher=University of St Andrews|page=|language=en|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|83}}

===Rector===
The [[Rector of the University of St Andrews]] is the ordinary president of the University Court, and is chosen every three years by the matriculated students of the University. The office of [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] was created by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] when it passed the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], which regulated academic governance and provided for the election of a Rector at all of the universities in existence at the time in [[Scotland]]. To this day it is only the four [[ancient universities of Scotland]]: [[University of St Andrews]], [[University of Glasgow]], [[University of Aberdeen]], and [[University of Edinburgh]], as well as the [[University of Dundee]], that elect a rector, whereas modern universities do not.&lt;ref name="act_1858" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scottish_rector2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/documents/scottish-university-rector.pdf|title=The Scottish University Rector - Introduction to the role of University Rector in Scotland|last=|first=|date=2007|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|publisher=Scottish Rectors’ Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior Governor===

The University created the position of Senior Governor to undertake the other responsibilities of a [[Chairman]] of a [[Board of directors|Board]], to ensure that the Court fulfils its responsibility of superintending the Universities officials, and enabling the effective functioning of the Court's committee. The Senior Governor is selected by the Court from among its lay members (those members who come from outside the University community.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/key-officials/senior-governor/|title=Senior Governor {{!}} University of St Andrews|last=|first=|date=August 2016|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|publisher=University of St Andrews|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the Scottish Parliament mandated that a senior lay member be appointed for the governing body of, in Section 1 of the Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Act 2016. At the same time, the 2016 Act affirmed the continued position of Rector as President of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|act=Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Act 2016|chapter=15|type=act|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rector, when present, will preside over meetings of the Court but may not otherwise normally be involved in Court business in the way that a company chairman might be. They have a more active role in the business of court.  They have become ''de jure'' the working President of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://applications.appointed-for-scotland.org/pages/job_search_view.aspx?jobId=864|title=Senior Governor and Non Executive Members|last=|first=|date=17 August 2015|website=appointed-for-scotland.org|publisher=Scottish Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/7958/UCU-Scotland-briefing-on-the-Scotland-HE-governance-bill-Jan-16/pdf/ucuscotland_hebillbriefing_feb16.pdf|title=UCU Scotland briefing for the stage one debate on the Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Bill on Thursday 14 January 2016|last=Mathison|first=Murdo|date=14 January 2016|website=ucu.org.uk|publisher=UCU Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous Senior Governor was Professor [[Ewan Brown]], who was appointed in June 2007. Professor Brown is an alumnus of the University.{{refneeded|date=April 2017}}

==Academic Senate==

=== Remit and jurisdiction ===
The [[Academic Senate|''Senatus Academicus'']] is the supreme academic body under the presidency of the [[Principal of the University of St Andrews|University Principal]]. It consists of all [[professor]]s, [[dean (education)|deans of faculties]], heads of school, a number of elected non-professorial members of staff, and four student members.  Another function of the Senate is the discipline of students. Under the ''[[Sponsio Academica]]'' the Senate has the power to expel a student should they bring the University into disrepute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/capod/staff/inductionresources/universityintroduction/uniquetraditions/|title=Unique university traditions {{!}} University of St. Andrews|last=|first=|date=2015|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|publisher=University of St Andrews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007060530/https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/capod/staff/inductionresources/universityintroduction/uniquetraditions|archive-date=7 October 2015|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the full ''Senatus Academicus'' has not met as a governing body since 1995, with only ceremonial meetings taking place, such as graduation. Much of the Senate's business is delegated to a smaller body, the Academic Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/about/documents/governance/general-council/minutes/general-council-06-2017.pdf|title=Minute of The Statutory Half-Yearly Meeting of The General Council Held on Saturday 24 June 2017|last=|first=|date=2017-06-24|website=University of St Andrews|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23|quote=Although Senate has not met as a body since 1995 when it devolved all its functions to a much smaller Academic Council of 45 members, it still constitutes the governing body as defined by the Act.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/senate/|title=Senate|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal's Office===

The [[Principal of the University of St Andrews]] is the [[chief executive]] of the University and is assisted in that role by several key officers. The Principal is analogous to a [[Vice-chancellor|Vice-Chancellor]] in [[England]] or a President of an [[Higher education in the United States|American university]].&lt;ref name="principalsoffice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principal's Office {{!}} University of St Andrews|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/principals-office/|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=21 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 23 October 2018 the members of the Principal's Office were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/principals-office/|title=Principal's Office|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculties===

The University is divided into four [[Faculty (division)|Faculties]] - [[Arts]], [[Divinity]], [[Science]], [[Medicine]] - each one governed by a [[Faculty Council]] comprising all permanent members of academic staff in each school in the Faculty (members of cross faculty schools may attend either or both Faculty Councils). These Faculty Councils, in association with the Senatus Academicus, are ultimately responsible inter alia for the approval of new undergraduate and postgraduate courses and for overseeing monitoring of the progress of students. The Deans of Faculties and other faculty officers, including those responsible for postgraduate matters, are elected by the Faculty Councils.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Faculty Councils meet once annually, towards the end of each academic year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Teaching, Learning and Assessment Committee===

The routine business of the Faculties is conducted throughout the year by the Teaching, Learning and Assessment (TLA) Committee, a standing committee reporting to Senate, and by the Faculty Business Committees. The Faculty Business Committees, comprising the Faculty officers and any other co-opted members, meet in advance of each TLA committee to dispatch routine affairs and review issues arising from the implementation of policy or course proposals, highlighting issues which may need discussion in the wider forum of the TLA.{{When|date=April 2017}}

== Planning and Resources Committee ==
The Planning and Resources Committee is a joint committee of both the University Court and the ''Senatus Academicus'' and attempts to bring a unified approach to both academic and financial planning. The Planning and Resources Committee has student representation with the President and Director of Education of the [[University of St Andrews Students' Association]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Student representation==

=== Students' Representative Council ===
Students are represented by the statutory [[Students' Representative Council#Scotland|Students' Representative Council]], which was instituted by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889&lt;ref name="ordinance121" /&gt;{{Rp|9}} The Students' Representative Council is currently part of [[University of St Andrews Students' Association]], and has representatives elected from [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourunion.net/voice/studentrepresentativecouncil/|title=Students' Representative Council|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=www.yourunion.net|publisher=University of St Andrews Students' Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election of Rector ===
All matriculated students of the University have the right to vote in the election of the Rector, who holds office for a three-year period, and is President of the University Court.&lt;ref name="rector"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/key-officials/rector/|title=Rector {{!}} University of St Andrews|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|publisher=University of St Andrews|language=en|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scottish_rector"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/documents/scottish-university-rector.pdf|title=The Scottish University Rector - Introduction to the role of University Rector in Scotland|last=|first=|date=2007|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|publisher=Scottish Rectors’ Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rector appoints the Rector's Assessor who is also a member of the University Court, and since 1970 the Rector has appointed a student as Assessor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31818">The phrase "'''greed versus grievance'''" or "'''greed and grievance'''" refer to the two baseline arguments put forward by scholars of [[armed conflict]] on the causes of [[civil war]], though the argument has been extended to other forms of [[war]], such as violent conflict in general, rebellion and insurgency for example.

"Greed" is shorthand for the argument that combatants in armed conflicts are motivated by a desire to better their situation, and perform an informal [[cost-benefit analysis]] in examining if the rewards of joining a [[rebellion]] are greater than not joining. "[[Grievance]]" stands for the argument that people rebel over issues of identity, e.g. [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social class]], etc., rather than over [[economics]]. In practice, even proponents of strong versions of these arguments admit that the opposing argument has some influence in the development of a conflict.

Whether the cause of war is attributed to 'greed' or 'grievance' the common factor is the perception of a certain deprivation. If it is an economic deprivation, the inequality will be a '[[vertical inequality]]' and the cause of war will be 'greed'. If the deprivation is caused by ethnicity, age, religion or gender, it will be a '[[horizontal inequality]]' and the cause of war will be due to the 'grievances'. 

== Cornerstones ==
The "greed versus grievance" theory provides opposing arguments on the cause of civil war. Proponents of the greed argument posit that armed conflicts are caused by a combatant's desire for self-enrichment. These motivations are manifested in multiple ways, including economic gain through control of goods and resources or by increased power within a given state. Conflicts started through greed are often seen in states with negative economic growth and/or systemic poverty, as this implies limited state capacity to provide opposition groups with economic concessions as well as the likelihood of the absence of an effective military or police apparatus to contend with those seeking power or resources.

Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler wrote one of the seminal pieces defending greed over grievance. They found that factors that increase the military or financial viability of rebellion correlated with more instances of conflict than factors leading to grievances. They argue that certain natural resources such as oil are tied to increased likelihood of conflict onset, and other natural resources such as diamonds are tied to increases in conflict duration. This is because natural resources may lower the startup cost of war, and provide rebels with an easy way of financing prolonged conflicts. Natural resources may also make the state a more lucrative prize for capture, further decreasing the opportunity cost of insurgency. For the same reason, Collier and Hoeffler also conclude that states with low per capita GDP are more likely to experience civil war, because low average income makes wage earning through conflict a more lucrative prospect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collier and Hoeffler also make an important distinction between preferences and constraints in terms of circumstances that favor rebellions. Societies can be more prone to conflict because preferences for rebellion are unusually strong or because constraints on rebellion are unusually weak – the former being aligned with grievance and the latter with greed. Measures such as democracy or political repression are hard to draw conclusions from because they may increase grievances among some groups, but empower other groups to repress potential insurgents. While most states harbor some level of grievance with the sitting regime, few states experience civil war. This is because although not everyone is content with the established order, rebellion only occurs when conflict is a viable option for dissatisfied parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Collier and Hoeffler conclude that on their own most variables that seek to explain civil war onset through measurements of grievance alone prove insufficient. Instead Collier and Hoeffler advocate using the looking at greed, that is to say the opportunity cost of initiating and sustaining conflict. [[James Fearon|Fearon]] and Laitin (2003) offer a contrasting view. They see opportunity structures created by weakness state capacity to be a cause of civil war onset. They find evidence in favor of the technology of insurgency as a mechanism. Further, they find that ethnicity, religion or any cultural or demography characteristic do not seems to have a positive relationship with civil war onset.&lt;ref&gt;'''Fearon, James D. and Laitin, David D'''. "Ethnicity, Insurgency and Civil War." ''American Political Science Review'', 2003, 97(1), pp 75-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing combatants is crucial to the success of any rebellion. Extortion and donations from diasporas are two possible financial sources used by rebellion groups. The extortion of primary commodity resources is especially suited to the operations of rebel groups, as they are often made up of unskilled labor and given whatever weapons are available. As rebel organizations need to be fairly large to have a significant impact and incite a civil war, the looting of primary commodity resources is the best way for them to maintain financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include diamonds in Sierra Leone and Angola, timber in Cambodia, coca in Colombia, and poppy in Afghanistan. Another factor that relates to lower constraints on rebellion is that primary resources are often found in rural locales. Thus, they often require an army to defend a large area, something that is much less likely in weak states that cannot sustain a military apparatus.&lt;ref name="Collier_7"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diaspora populations are also likely funding sources for rebel groups, as was the case with the Tamil population in North America funding the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. Diaspora populations, who are usually wealthier than their native counterparts, are able to mobilize for collective action, and do not directly suffer the consequences of a conflict. While the potential for diasporas to be financial backers of rebel groups was noted, Collier and Hoeffler found that diasporas themselves do not increase the risk of conflict.&lt;ref name="Collier_8"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Overall, Collier and Hoeffler's study drew multiple conclusions in support of the greed model. Faster economic growth reduces risk, likely because it raises the opportunity costs of joining a rebellion. The higher a state's dependence on primary commodities, the greater the risk of conflict; this is due to the resources being a main financial component of rebel groups and a weak governmental structure. However, they observed that if there is a particularly high dependence on primary commodity resources, conflict risk declines as states find ways to protect their resources and deter looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
David Keen elaborates on the economic incentives for warfare and argues that there is more to war than simply "winning." In some instances, it could be more beneficial for certain parties to prolong war, so long as they are in control of economic resources or power positions. This can become common in states with weak rule of law where violence becomes privatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elite groups within weak states attempt to harness economic agendas and resources within a given civil society and are motivated to create private profit by mobilizing violent means. Keen continues by citing various possible economic functions of violence.
 
His first example of violent means to promote economic gain is pillaging, whether to gain resources or to supplement or supply wages of soldiers. Another function is extortion of protection money from people who can afford it so they can be spared violence inflicted upon them. A third economic function is the monopolistic control of trade. When state control breaks down, trade that was previously prohibited is more easily facilitated and has the potential to generate substantial amounts of profit for those involved. Primary examples of this are weapons and drugs. A fourth function of conflict is the possible exploitation of labor. The threat of violence can be used to coerce cheap or free labor, with extreme cases resulting in forms of slavery. A fifth short-term function is the ability to stake a claim to land and its resources. Similar to Collier and Hoeffler's argument that weak states cannot easily maintain control over their natural resources due to their rural location and potentially wide dispersion, it is economically beneficial to assert control over minimally defended, resource-rich areas. Extracting benefits from aid that is sent to a conflict area is also beneficial for rebel groups as there are often possibilities to raid resources sent from abroad. Appropriation of aid becomes difficult in a weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Unlike Collier, Keen does not attribute conflict to be driven more by greed than by grievance; he stresses how the two forces interact so that greed generates grievances and rebellion, which in turn legitimizes further greed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen uses the conflict perpetuated by Milosevic in Serbia as an example of how an extended, endless conflict is preferable to one with a definitive end and a clear winner. Milosevic controlled the media to create grievances among the Serbian population, rally them together, and create a common enemy following NATO bombing. The small group of elites surrounding Milosevic perpetuated conditions that warranted international sanctions in order to better control trade and loot resources. Milosevic realized sanctions were necessary to facilitate the profitable black market transactions that were being made by those closest to him. Had he demobilized or embraced a more peaceful policy, the sanctions would have been lifted and his economic advantage would have disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is what Keen was referring to in his argument that greed and grievance are often tied together and interact with one another. In this way, Milosevic's initial desire for power spurred him to create grievances amongst the Serbs that created the popular support for his sanction-warranting policies to further his economic and political power – the use of grievances to produce further greed.

The strong case for the "greed" argument was made by [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler in a study they performed for the [[World Bank]] at the turn of the millennium. Since then, the Collier-Hoeffler Model has been the focus of much of the greed-grievance debate.

One of the leading critics on the 'greed' argument is [[Frances Stewart (economist)|Frances Stewart]]. In her article 'Horizontal Inequalities: A neglected Dimension of Development' she stresses the need to focus on the grievances of the populations since too much focus on inequality between individuals is dangerous for successful development. By using nine case studies she proves how horizontal inequalities have led to violent conflict. 

=== Case study: Afghanistan ===
In south central Asia, along the lawless Afghani-Pakistani border a group called the Taliban have been engaging in what could best be described as a greed based insurgency since 2001. The Taliban's insurgency is in opposition to the NATO and United States supported Afghan transitional government of Hamid Karzai. This brief case study will provide concrete examples of the factors that compose the Greed Model. 
	
One of the primary characteristics of a Greed-based conflict as listed above is the ability to derive income or revenue from natural resource predation.&lt;ref name="Collier_7"/&gt; This requires the presence of a "lootable" resource. In the case of the Taliban insurgency, this resource is the opium poppy. Afghanistan supplies the majority of the world's opium, the market share being as high as 90% in the years directly following the NATO invasion.&lt;ref&gt;BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS AND LAW ENFORC. "2012 INCSR: Country Reports - Afghanistan through Costa Rica."&lt;/ref&gt; The high volume, high revenue nature of the Afghan opium market allows the Taliban to "loot" the resource at every stage of development, from cultivation to heroin sale. Benefits from opium production begin for the Taliban with imposing a 10% tax on farmers growing opium (a protection fee), followed by control over heroin labs and heroin sales to smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|2009|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban, like FARC before them also blur the line between membership to the Taliban and membership to the transnational group of opium smugglers, therefore allowing the insurgency to reap financial rewards from the price bump that comes when the smuggler crosses an international border. In these ways the Taliban are able to fund their insurgency and begin to fall under the characterization of a group of actors in pursuit of greed based conflict.

A second component of the Greed Model is the presence of a large diaspora funding the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we use the traditional definition of a diaspora, the Taliban do not have one. However, they have two extraterritorial means of support based on ethnic affiliation. One comes from funding from wealthy Arabs in the Middle East. This revenue source has been relatively under-researched as the funds are coming from individuals rather than an ethnic bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Walsh. "Taliban raked in $400 million from diverse sources-UN." Reuters, September 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting the diffuse nature of the Arab funding, the Taliban receive considerable support from their Pakistani Pashtun brethren. Pashtun influence has a large impact on the Afghan insurgency. Pakistan's role encompasses a number of characteristics important to the greed model; ethnic homogeneity, a supply of unskilled labor, and lawless borderlands. Collier and Hoeffler discuss the idea that diversity makes conflict more difficult as it is harder to mobilize a heterogeneous ethnic base into rebellion.&lt;ref name="Collier_11"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pashtun ethnic group that straddles the Afghani-Pakistani border is anything but diverse. This allows the Taliban to rapidly acquire recruits. In addition, many Pashtuns in the region are uneducated and poor. This provides the Taliban with another requirement for greed based rebellion; unskilled workers who can fill out security and infantry requirements. The insecurity and lack of formal state governance over the Afghan south-east and the Pakistani west also makes a significant contribution to the robustness of a greed based argument here. The mountainous region between the two states is an ideal hiding place for insurgents and also provides many circuitous avenues for smuggling heroin.

Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan extends beyond the simple trans-border ethnic affiliation. Gretchen Peters cites a strained relationship with its Pakistani neighbors as a problem limiting the success of the Karzai government. Pakistan's government is hostile towards the Afghan transitional government because the transitional government is backed and heavily influenced by international entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|2009|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Inter-Service Intelligence Agency (ISI) of Pakistan has been known to directly support the Taliban with funding, tip offs, and the corruption of government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Waldman. "The sun in the sky: the relationship between Pakistan's ISI and Afghan insurgents", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This constitutes the greed model factor of extraterritorial governmental support for an insurgency laid out by Collier.&lt;ref name="Collier_8"/&gt;

The final explanatory feature important to the Taliban's insurgency as a greed-based rebellion is the influence of a previous rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the CIA and ISI the young Taliban in the 1990s were pitted against the Soviet Union in proxy war. This enabled the Taliban to do a number of things. They became involved in opium trade, were provided with weapons, and began to construct the organizational aptitude that allows for their continued success today.&lt;ref&gt;Namit Arora. "America, the Cold War, and the Taliban."&lt;/ref&gt; The previous involvement of the Taliban in an armed insurgency allows one of the issues with a greed-based insurgency to be dismissed. Collier and Hoeffler assert that the government has an innate advantage in greed-based conflicts as the government is more organized.&lt;ref name="Collier_11"/&gt; However, in the case of the Afghan conflict this is not true. The transitional government is more fractionalized, less cooperative, and more ethnically divided than the Taliban. Therefore, using the greed-model we should actually expect the Taliban to defeat the transitional government after NATO's withdrawal, as the government possesses few advantages.

This case shows the explanatory power of the greed model, enabling a better understanding of what the variables look like in the real world. In the Afghan case there haven't been many successes in peace building. As the following section will illustrate, the greed model is not without holes or needed additions, but the Taliban insurgency can definitively be characterized as an actor motivated primarily by the conditions that foster the greed model.

Probably the most coherent rebuttal of Collier's work comes from [[David Keen]], articulated in his book ''Complex Emergencies''.


=== Case study 2: Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka is an island country in South Asia that suffered from a violent civil war for more than 25 years. The fighting took place between the majority of the Buddhist Sinhalese population and the minority Hindu Tamils. This brief case study will demonstrate how the civil war was caused by horizontal inequalities and how it therefore supports the 'grievance' argument. 

Injustices can be seen across different ethnic groups. When the people from a certain ethnic group perceive that they are being given less opportunities by the government simply because they belong to that ethnic group, in terms of education and economy for example, it creates grievances. These grievances, which are called horizontal inequalities, lead to violent conflict. The war that took place in Sri Lanka was due to the perceived grievances that the Tamil population experienced during Sinhalese rule. 

Sri Lanka -then called Ceylon- was under British colonial rule from 1815 to 1948&lt;ref name=thoughtco&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Sri Lankan Civil War|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-sri-lankan-civil-war-195086|website=ThoughtCo|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even though the majority of the population was Buddhist Sinhalese, with over three million people, the British people favored the Hindu Tamils, which accounted to 300,000 people. The Tamil population therefore enjoyed privileged access to education and to government employment&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Frances|title=Working Paper Number 81 Horizontal Inequalities: A Neglected Dimension of Development|date=February 2002|volume=Working Paper number 81|issue=QEH Working Paper Series – QEHWPS81|pages=40|url=http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps81.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They held around 40% of University places in science and engineering, medicine and agriculture and veterinary science&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. The appointment of Tamils to bureaucratic positions angered the Sinhalese population and when Great Britain granted Ceylon independence in 1948, the Sinhalese majority aimed at correcting these horizontal inequalities perceived as disadvantageous to them. They made Sinhalese the official language, which drove the Tamils out of the civil service and incorporated educational quotas. The result was an increase on the Sinhalese incomes and a drop in those of the Tamil, which eliminated the previous differential between the two groups&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. However, by the end of the 1970s, Sinhalese were gaining more places at University and because civil service recruitment policies, such as the use of Sinhalese in examinations favored the Sinhalese, their recruitment in relation to population was four times more favorable than that of the Tamils&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. 

While the initial aim was to correct the horizontal inequalities perceived by the Sinhalese population, the result was that instead of just correcting them, they introduced them in their favor. This meant that the Tamil population now felt economically and politically excluded and threatened. As seen, these horizontal inequalities translated into grievances and it was these grievances that allowed extremist leaders to exploit the growing resentment to gain support and start a violent conflict. 

After years of ethnic tensions, the violence was initiated by an insurgent group called the Tamil Tigers, who declared the ‘First Eelam War (1983-87) with the aim of creating a separate Tamil state in northern Sri Lanka&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. The peacekeepers sent by India in 1987 did little to stop the violence and they were forced to retire in 1990. It was then that the Tamil Tigers initiated what they called the second Eelam War, which was even bloodier than the first. Horrible atrocities were committed by both sides, including the use of child suicide bombers and child soldiers and it was not until 2009 that the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the Tamil Tigers&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. It is estimated that at least 100,000 died during the conflict&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. 

As seen, the Tamil Tigers did not start violent conflict due to greed. It was grievances such as a perceived disadvantage over education possibilities, work opportunities, language use and economic prospects that increased the ethnic tensions between the two groups and drove the Tamil Tigers to start a war. 

While there is no doubt that war causes poverty and that once war has broken out it feeds on economic deprivation and underdevelopment, one cannot declare the ‘greed’ argument as a sole explanation of violent conflict. Poverty does not cause war directly, so the greed argument is not strong enough. It is the grievances perceived by a group within a society that drives violent conflict. These grievances do include economic deprivation but also ethnic discrimination, age and gender. As seen with Sri Lanka, these factors are more likely to drive conflict since they also provide a specific environment where charismatic leaders can pick on the grievances and create a sense of group membership that facilitates the outbreak of war.

=== Critiques===
There are many works that rebut the idea of greed vs. grievance. Authors set up alternative ideas that need to be introduced and explored. Even the staunchest proponents of the Greed vs. Grievance theory believe that other outside forces (beyond the greed and/or grievance) can have an effect on conflict, which makes the critiques all the more vital in understanding the theory itself. One of the most prevalent authors in rebutting greed vs. grievance is author David Keen, in his book ''Complex Emergencies''.
	
David Keen, a professor at the Development Studies Institute at the London School of Economics, has several innovative and new ideas regarding the ideas of war.&lt;ref&gt;T. Allen. "Complex emergencies and humanitarian responses." University of London: International Issues (2012): 2-17.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is considered by many to be one of the leading arguments against greed vs. grievance theory. His ideas look into the specifics of complex emergencies, which is a term officially defined by the InterAgency Standing Committee (IASC) as:
"A multifaceted humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is a total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires a multi-sectoral, international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing UN country program. Such emergencies have, in particular, a devastating effect on children and women and call for a complex range of responses."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (2008). OCHA Glossary of Humanitarian Terms 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Keen discusses how a conflict can never be simply a greed scenario. His definition of a "complex emergency" demonstrates this broader term and all of its various implications. 
	
In his book, Keen goes into several different conflict scenarios, such as 'war', 'famine', and 'information', and then sets up an argument against the idea of greed. He believes that although a conflict, whether it be the 'War on Terror' or the conflict in Sierra Leone, may be centered around some concept of greed or grievance, this can never solely explain a conflict. Although seemingly obvious, Keen looks to demonstrate that, "the aims in a war are complex".&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;David Keen. "Complex Emergencies: David Keen Responds" African Arguments: Royal African Society.&lt;/ref&gt; He does not believe that greed and grievance can be examined separately, but rather that they are partner terms that must be implemented in a complementary way. For example, when Keen discusses the conflict in Sudan, he says, " the grievances of northern pastoralists were useful for a government trying to get its hands on oil in areas that famine and militia attacks helped to depopulate; meanwhile, the 'greed' of the Arab militias themselves (for labour, cattle and land) was itself intimately linked to their grievances".&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt; He makes it clear that it is necessary to first spend ample time defining the type of conflict at hand because the differences between genocide and a civil war are substantial, so it is necessary to diagnose the incentives and solutions for the conflict with a mix of multiple theories. 
	
Keen specifically critiques Paul Collier, a leading expert in greed vs. grievance theory, by claiming that Collier became too comfortable with "numbers", and needed to rely more on the actual opinions of people involved in conflicts. He spoke of Collier's work and said, "This is where econometrics tips over into arrogance and starts closing down the possibility of a genuine understanding of conflicts or, by extension, of a political settlement that addresses underlying grievances".&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt; He doesn't believe that it can be dismissed so easily. He was documented saying, "It also annoys me that a lot of the 'scientific air' of the Collier work is quite bogus as the selection of proxies is so arbitrary", which demonstrated a distinct attack on Collier's work, which emphasizes quantitative data.&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;

David Keen is one of the major critics of greed vs. grievance theory, defined primarily by Paul Collier, and argues the point that a conflict, although he cannot define it, cannot be pinpointed to simply one motive. He believes that conflicts are much more complex and thus should not be analyzed through simplified methods. He disagrees with the quantitative research methods of Collier and believes a stronger emphasis should be put on personal data and human perspective of the people in conflict. This isn't necessarily a complete dismissal of the greed vs. grievance theory, but rather a critique on its polarity and methods of data collection. 
	
Beyond Keen, several other authors have introduced works that either disprove greed vs. grievance theory with empirical data, or dismiss its ultimate conclusion. Authors such as Cristina Bodea and Ibrahim Elbadawi, who co-wrote the entry, "Riots, coups and civil war: Revisiting the greed and grievance debate", argue that empirical data can disprove many of the proponents of greed theory and make the idea "irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bodea. "Riots, coups and civil war : revisiting the greed and grievance debate." Policy Research 1 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; They examine a myriad of factors and conclude that too many factors come into play with conflict, which cannot be confined to simply greed or grievance. 
	
Anthony Vinci makes a strong argument that, "fungible concept of power and the primary motivation of survival provide superior explanations of armed group motivation and, more broadly, the conduct of internal conflicts".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Vinci. "Greed-Grievance Reconsidered: The Role of Power and Survival in the Motivation of Armed Groups." Civil Wars "8(1)" (2007): 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G7 summit 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Heads of the [[Group of Eight|G7 nations]] in 2015]]
A '''head of government''' (or '''chief of government''') is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a [[sovereign state]], a [[federated state]], or a [[self-governing colony]], who often presides over a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term "head of government" is often differentiated from the term "[[head of state]]" (as in article 7 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], article 1 of the [[Protection of Diplomats Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents]] and the United Nations protocol list),&lt;ref name="unprotocol"&gt;[http://www.un.int/protocol/documents/Hspmfm.pdf HEADS OF STATE, HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, MINISTERS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CDCJ728N?url=http://www.un.int/protocol/documents/Hspmfm.pdf |date=2012-11-16 }}, Protocol and Liaison Service, United Nations (2012-10-19). Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969], [[International Law Commission]], United Nations. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_4_1973.pdf Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents 1973], [[International Law Commission]], United Nations. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; as they may be separate positions, individuals, or roles depending on the country.

The authority of a head of government, such as a president, chancellor, or prime minister and the relationship between that position and other state institutions, such as the relation between the head of state and of the [[legislature]], varies greatly among sovereign states, depending largely on the particular system of the government that has been chosen, won, or evolved over time.

In [[parliamentary system]]s, including [[constitutional monarchies]], the head of government is the ''[[de facto]]'' political leader of the government, and is answerable to [[Chambers of parliament|one chamber]] or the entire legislature. Although there is often a formal reporting relationship to a [[head of state]], the latter usually acts as a [[figurehead]] who may take the role of chief executive on limited occasions, either when receiving [[constitutional advice]] from the head of government or under specific provisions in a constitution.

In [[presidential systems|presidential]] republics or in [[absolute monarchies]], the head of state is also usually the head of government. The relationship between that leader and the government, however, can vary greatly, ranging from [[separation of powers]] to [[autocracy]], according to the constitution (or other basic laws) of the particular state.

In [[semi-presidential system]]s, the head of government may answer to both the head of state and the legislature, with the specifics provided by each country's constitution. A modern example is the present French government, which originated as the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958.  In France, the [[President of France|president]], the head of state, appoints the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]], who is the head of government.  However, the president must choose someone who can act effectively as an executive, but who also enjoys the support of the France's legislature, the  [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], in order to be able to pass legislation. In some cases, the head of state may represent one political party but the majority in the National Assembly is of a different party. Given that the majority party has greater control over state funding and [[primary legislation]], the president is in effect forced to choose a prime minister from the opposition party in order to ensure an effective, functioning legislature. In this case, known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]], the prime minister, along with the cabinet, controls domestic policy, with the president's influence largely restricted to foreign affairs.

In [[directorial system]]s, the executive responsibilities of the head of government are spread among a group of people. A prominent example is the [[Swiss Federal Council]], where each member of the council heads a department and also votes on proposals relating to all departments.

== Titles of respective heads of government ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
{{Executive}}
A common title for many heads of government is [[prime minister]]. This is used as a formal title in many states, but also informally a generic term to describe whichever office is considered the principal minister under an otherwise styled [[head of state]], as ''Minister''&amp;nbsp;— [[Latin language|Latin]] for servants or subordinates&amp;nbsp;— is a common title for members of a government (but many other titles are in use, e.g. [[chancellor]] and [[secretary of state]]). Formally the head of state can also be the head of government as well ([[ex officio]] or by [[ad hoc]] cumulation, such as a ruling monarch exercising all powers himself) but otherwise has formal precedence over the Head of Government and other ministers, whether he is their actual political superior (ruling monarch, executive president) or rather theoretical or ceremonial in character (constitutional monarch, non-executive president). Various constitutions use different titles, and even the same title can have various multiple meanings, depending on the constitutional order and political system of the state in question.

=== As political chief ===
In addition to prime minister, titles used for the democratic model, where there is an elected legislative body checking the Head of government, include the following. Some of these titles relate to governments below the national level (e.g., states or provinces).

=== Under a dominant head of state ===
In a broader sense, a head of government can be used loosely when referring to various comparable positions under a dominant head of state (especially is the case of ancient or feudal eras, so the term "head of government", in this case, could be considered a contradiction in terms). In this case, the prime minister serves at the pleasure of the monarch and holds no more power than the monarch allows. Some such titles are diwan, [[mahamantri]], [[pradhan]], [[wasir]] or [[vizier]].

However, just because the head of state is the ''[[de jure]]'' dominant position does not mean that he/she will not always be the ''[[de facto]]'' political leader. A skilled head of government like 19th-century German [[Politician|statesman]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Minister President of Prussia]] and later [[Chancellor of Germany]] under [[German Emperor|Emperor]]/[[King of Prussia|King]] [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]], serves as an example showing that possession of formal powers does not equal political influence.

=== Indirectly referred as the head of state ===
In some cases, the head of state is a [[figurehead]] whilst the head of the government leads the ruling party. In some cases a head of government may even pass on the title in hereditary fashion. Such titles include the following:
* [[Mayor of the palace]] of the Merovingian kingdoms
* [[Nawab wasir]] of the Mughal Empire (also governor of [[Awadh]])
* [[Peshwa]] of [[Satara State|Satara]] and the [[Maratha empire]]
* ''[[Shōgun]]'' in feudal Japan
* [[Sultan]] in the original case of the [[Seljuk Turks]] who made the [[caliph]]s of [[Baghdad]] their puppets; later both styles were often used for absolute rulers in Nepal

=== Combined heads of state and government ===
[[File:Dilma Rousseff e Cristina Kirchner em 2015.jpg|thumb|President [[Dilma Rousseff]] of Brazil and President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Christina Kirchner]] of Argentina in 2015.]]

In some models the head of state and head of government are one and the same. These include:
* [[President]] (executive)
* An [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] reigning and [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|ruling]] without a separate principal minister
* [[Chief magistrate]]
* [[Führer]] (used in [[Nazi Germany]] for [[Adolf Hitler]])
* [[Supreme leader]]
* A [[Governor (United States)|State Governor in the United States]] (subnational executives)
An alternative formula is a single chief political body (e.g., [[presidium]]) which collectively leads the government and provides (e.g. by turns) the ceremonial Head of state
* [[Sultan of Brunei]]
* [[King of Saudi Arabia]]
''See [[Head of state]] for further explanation of these cases.''

== Parliamentary heads of government ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The heads of government of five members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] at the 1944 [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]. From left to right, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] ([[Canada]]), [[Jan Smuts]] ([[South Africa]]), [[Winston Churchill]] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[Peter Fraser]] ([[New Zealand]]), and [[John Curtin]] ([[Australia]]).]]

In parliamentary systems, government functions along the following lines:
* The head of government&amp;nbsp;— usually the leader of the majority party or [[Coalition government|coalition]]&amp;nbsp;— forms the government, which is answerable to parliament;
* Full answerability of government to parliament is achieved through
** The ability of parliament to pass a [[vote of no confidence]].
** The ability to vote down legislative proposals of the government.
** Control over or ability to vote down fiscal measures and the budget (or [[Loss of Supply|supply]]); a government is powerless without control of the state finances. In a [[bicameral]] system, it is often the so-called [[lower house]], e.g. the [[British House of Commons]] that exercises the major elements of control and oversight; in some others, e.g. Australia and Italy, the government is constitutionally or by convention answerable to both chambers/Houses of Parliament.

All of these requirements directly impact the Head of government's role. Consequently, they often play a 'day to day' role in parliament, answering questions and defending the government on the 'floor of the House', while in [[semi-presidential]] systems they may not be required to play as much of a role in the functioning of parliament.

=== Appointment ===
In many countries, the Head of government is commissioned by the Head of state to form a government, on the basis of the strength of party support in the lower house, in some other states directly elected by parliament. Many parliamentary systems require ministers to serve in parliament, while others ban ministers from sitting in parliament; they must resign on becoming ministers.

=== Removal ===
Heads of government are typically removed from power in a parliamentary system by
* Resignation, following:
** Defeat in a general election.
** Defeat in a [[leadership vote]] at their party [[caucus]], to be replaced by another member of the same party.
** Defeat in a parliamentary vote on a major issue, e.g., [[loss of supply]], [[Motion of No Confidence|loss of confidence]]. (In such cases, a head of government may seek a [[parliamentary dissolution]] from the Head of state and attempt to regain support by popular vote.)
* Dismissal&amp;nbsp;— some constitutions allow a Head of state (or their designated representative, as is the case in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries) to dismiss a Head of government, though its use can be controversial, as occurred in 1975 when then Australian Governor-General, Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], dismissed Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] in the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|Australian Constitutional Crisis]].
* Death&amp;nbsp;— in this case, the deputy Head of government typically acts as the head of government until a new head of government is appointed.

=== First among equals or dominating the cabinet? ===
Constitutions differ in the range and scope of powers granted to the head of government. Some older constitutions; for example, Australia's [[Constitution of Australia|1900 text]], and Belgium's [[Constitution of Belgium|1830 text]]; do not mention their prime ministerial offices at all, the offices became a ''de facto'' political reality without a formal constitutional status. Some constitutions make a Prime Minister [[primus inter pares]] ([[first among equals]]) and that remains the practical reality for the [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] and the [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. Other states however, make their head of government a central and dominant figure within the cabinet system; Ireland's [[Taoiseach]], for example, alone can decide when to seek a parliamentary dissolution, in contrast to other countries where this is a cabinet decision, with the Prime Minister just one member voting on the suggestion. The [[Prime Minister of Sweden]], under the [[1974 Instrument of Government]], is a constitutional office with all key executive powers at his disposal; either directly, or indirectly through the collegial [[Government of Sweden|Government]]; whose members are all appointed and dismissed at the Prime Minister's sole discretion.

Under the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|unwritten British constitution]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s role has evolved, based often on the individual's personal appeal and strength of character, as contrasted between, for example, [[Winston Churchill]] as against [[Clement Attlee]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] as against [[John Major]]. It is alleged that the increased personalisation of leadership in a number of states has led to heads of government becoming themselves "semi-presidential" figures, due in part to media coverage of politics that focuses on the leader and his or her mandate, rather than on parliament; and to the increasing centralisation of power in the hands of the head of government. Such allegations have been made against two recent British Prime ministers; [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Tony Blair]]. They were also made against Italian prime ministers [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Matteo Renzi]], Canadian prime minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]] (later all of Germany), [[Helmut Kohl]], when in power.

== Official residence ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
The Head of government is often provided with an [[official residence]], often in the same fashion as [[head of state|heads of state]] often are. The name of the residence is often used as a [[metonym]] or alternate title for 'the government' when the office is politically the highest, e.g. in the UK "Downing Street announced today…"

Well-known official residences of heads of government include:
* [[10 Downing Street]] in London&amp;nbsp;— Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (who also has a country residence, [[Chequers]])
* [[Seri Perdana]] in [[Putrajaya]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]]
* [[7, Race Course Road]] in New Delhi&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of India]]
* [[Catshuis]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]
* [[24 Sussex Drive]] in Ottawa&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Canada]] (who also has a country residence, [[Harrington Lake]])
* [[Zhongnanhai]] in Beijing&amp;nbsp;— [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]]
* [[Kantei]] in Tokyo&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Japan]]
* [[Palazzo Chigi]] in Rome&amp;nbsp;— [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy]]
* [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] in [[Canberra]] (with an additional residence, [[Kirribilli House]], in [[Sydney]])&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Australia]]
* [[Hôtel Matignon]]&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with a hotel, as a grand palace is called a ''hôtel'' in French.&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris— [[Prime Minister of France]]
* [[The Lambermont]] in Brussels&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Belgium]]
* [[Palacio de la Moncloa]] in Madrid&amp;nbsp;— [[President of the Government of Spain]]
* [[Premier House]] in [[Wellington]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]
* [[Kesäranta]] in Helsinki&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Finland]]
* [[Sager House]] in Stockholm&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] (who also has a country residence, [[Harpsund]])
* Daehwa Palace in Seoul and Sejong Mission in [[Sejong City]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of South Korea]]
Fuller list in the [[official residence]] article.

Similarly, heads of government of (con)federal entities below the level of the [[sovereign state]] (often without an actual head of state, at least under international law) may also be given an official residence, sometimes used as an opportunity to display aspirations of statehood:
* ''[[Hotel Errera]]'' in [[Brussels]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Minister-President]] of the [[Flemish community]] and region
* ''[[Élysette]]'' in [[Namur (city)|Namur]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Minister-President of the Walloon Region]]
* [[Bute House]], [[Edinburgh]]; [[First Minister of Scotland]]
* [[Kazan Kremlin]], Kazan - [[President of Tatarstan]]
* [[Government House, Hong Kong]] - [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]]
* [[Macau Government Headquarters]] - [[Chief Executive of Macau]]

Usually, the residence of the heads of government is not as prestigious and grand as that of the head of state, even if the head of state only performs ceremonial duties. Even the formal representative of the head of state, such as a [[governor-general]], may well be housed in a grander, palace-type residence. However, this is not the case when both positions are combined into one:

* The [[White House]] (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue) in Washington, D.C.&amp;nbsp;— President of the United States of America
* [[Istana Nurul Iman]] in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Sultan of Brunei]]
* [[Palácio da Alvorada]] in [[Brasília]]&amp;nbsp;— [[President of the Federative Republic of Brazil]]

'''[[Instant-runoff voting]]''' ('''IRV''') is a [[electoral system|voting method]] used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates. Instead of [[First-past-the-post voting|voting only for a single candidate]], voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each elector's top choice, losing candidates are eliminated, and ballots for losing candidates are redistributed until one candidate is the top remaining choice of a majority of the voters. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an "instant runoff" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.

IRV more commonly known outside the USA as the '''alternative vote''' or '''preferential voting''', was devised around 1870 by the US architect [[William Robert Ware|W. R. Ware]]. Today it is in use at a national level to elect the [[Australian House of Representatives]], the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea]], the [[President of Ireland]] and [[President of India]]. In Australia it is also used for elections to the [[legislative assembly|legislative assemblies]] ([[lower house]]s) of all states and territories except [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], and for the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] ([[upper house]]).

IRV is also used a number of municipal elections in Australia, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[New Zealand]]. Because of its relationship to the [[Single Transferable Vote]] (STV) system, IRV is used for by-elections in a some jurisdictions that use STV for ordinary parliamentary elections, such as the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Scotland]].

IRV is known by different names in the various countries in which it is used. It is also known as the 'Alternative Vote', 'Ranked Choice Voting', and 'Preferential Voting', although IRV is only one of a number of forms of [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] systems.

== History ==

Instant-runoff voting is based on the Single Transferable Vote [[electoral system]], invented independently by [[Thomas Hare (political scientist)|Thomas Hare]] in 1857 and [[Carl Andrae]] in 1855. Unlike IRV, the Single Transferable Vote was designed as a form of [[proportional representation]] involving multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], and today STV is used in a number of countries, including Australia, the Republic of Ireland and [[Malta]].

[[William Robert Ware]], the founder of the schools of architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Columbia University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/research/collections/collections-mc/mc14.html|title=William R. Ware Papers 1826-1914: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invented IRV around 1870  by applying the Single Transferable Vote system to single winner elections.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} IRV was adopted for the Australian House of Representatives in 1918 and has been used to elect the President of Ireland since the office came into being in 1937. It was introduced in [[Fiji]] in 1999 and in [[Papua New Guinea]] in 2007.

IRV (in Australia called preferential voting) was introduced for [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] elections in Australia after the [[Swan by-election, 1918|Swan by-election]] in October 1918, when the conservative [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], representing small farmers, split the non-[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] vote in conservative country areas, allowing Labor candidates to win on a first-past-the-post vote then in place. The conservative [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] government of [[Billy Hughes]] introduced preferential voting to enable the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] parties to field candidates in the same electorates without putting Coalition seats at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Green | first = Antony | authorlink = Antony Green | title = History of Preferential Voting in Australia | work = Antony Green Election Guide: Federal Election 2004 | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | year = 2004 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/guide/prefhistory.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first used at the [[Corangamite by-election, 1918|Corangamite by-election]] on 14 December 1918, and nationwide at the [[Australian federal election, 1919|1919 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australianpolitics.com/elections/features/voting-methods-history.shtml |title=Australian Electoral History: Voting Methods |publisher=Australianpolitics.com |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319034900/http://australianpolitics.com/elections/features/voting-methods-history.shtml |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferential voting continued to benefit the Coalition until the [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 election]], when for the first time the Labor [[Bob Hawke]] government obtained a net benefit from preferential voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2015/09/the-orogins-of-senate-group-ticket-voting-and-it-wasnt-the-major-parties.html|title=The Origin of Senate Group Ticket Voting, and it didn't come from the Major Parties|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] found that every [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] electorate had at least four candidates, and the average number of candidates was seven. 76 candidates depended on preferences to win, which represented more than half of the 150 winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/international-snapshot-australia-2007|title=International Snapshot: Australia 2007|publisher=fairvote.org |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preferential voting is used for most state and local elections in Australia, but sometimes with optional preferential voting where voters are allowed to limit their number of rankings.

=== Canada ===

Under the name 'preferential' or 'elimination ballot', IRV was used in the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|British Columbia's general elections of 1952]] and [[British Columbia general election, 1953|1953]]. IRV was initially brought in by the governing coalition consisting of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|Liberal]] and [[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative]] parties.  In the next election many CCF supporters chose the relatively unknown [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]], a minor party that had never held any seats in the British Columbia legislature, as their second choice. The Social Credit Party achieved an upset victory in the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|1952 election]], winning 19 seats in the 48-member legislature to 18 for the CCF, 6 for the Liberals and 4 for the Conservatives. The Socreds formed a short-lived minority government until the [[British Columbia general election, 1953|1953 election]], in which they won a majority of seats (28 of 48). After the 1953 election, the Liberal and renamed Progressive Conservative Parties were reduced to third parties in the province, and first-past-the-post was reinstated by the government.

Today IRV is used for certain party and private elections in Canada, including such large-scale elections at the [[Canadian Wheat Board]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwbelection.com/electionprocess.asp#voting 2006 CWB Election of Directors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106090900/http://www.cwbelection.com/electionprocess.asp#voting |date=January 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2006]], where it has generated high turnout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwb.ca/public/en/newsroom/releases/2002/121602.jsp |title=Canadian Wheat Board - 2002 |publisher=Cwb.ca |date=2002-12-16 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party leadership election, 2011]]. The Liberal Party of Canada had adopted IRV with a national primary for its leadership elections.&lt;ref name="thetyee.ca"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zehr |first=Garrett |url=https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/Federal-Politics/2009/05/02/Liberals-one-member-one-vote/ |title=Liberals adopt one-member, one-vote election system :: The Hook |publisher=Thetyee.ca |date=2 May 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India ===

The [[President of India]] is chosen by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both houses of the Parliament and the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabha). The election is held with IRV, which in the Indian Constitution (Article 55) is called [[single transferable vote]].

===New Zealand===

The [[single transferable vote]] (STV), a multi-seat variation of IRV, is used for all district health board elections.&lt;ref name="Single Transferable Vote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stv.govt.nz |title=Single Transferable Vote |publisher=Stv.govt.nz |date=2004-10-05 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2004, several [[New Zealand]] cities and local authorities began to use STV for their elections—including the nation's second largest city and capital Wellington and its fifth largest city Dunedin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stv.govt.nz/STV/legislation.htm |title=Single Transferable Vote |publisher=Stv.govt.nz |date=2004-10-05 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where electing a mayor directly, these cities used instant runoff voting. In 2007, for example, Wellington's mayor Kerry Prendergast defeated her 10 rivals on the 9th round of counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellington.govt.nz/haveyoursay/elections/results/2007/final/2007results.html |title=Elections - 2007 Results - Wellington - New Zealand |publisher=Wellington |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contested IRV races have included the [[Dunedin mayoral election, 2010]] and [[Wellington City mayoral election, 2010]].

As of September 2013, seven authorities are elected with STV: Dunedin City Council, Greater Wellington Council, Kapiti Coast District Council, Marlborough District Council, Palmerston North City Council, Porirua City Council, and Wellington City Council.&lt;ref name="Single Transferable Vote"/&gt; Wellington upheld STV in a 2008 ballot measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wellington.govt.nz/have-your-say/elections/electoral-systems |title=Electoral Systems |publisher=Wellington City Council |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in 2013 was using IRV to pick a new party leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11120935 |title=Back me, Jones tells supporters of Robertson |publisher=New Zealand Herald |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papua New Guinea===

A form of IRV has been used to elect members of parliament since last plurality voting election in 2002. Called "limited preferential voting" because voters are limited to ranking three candidates, the system has been credited with reducing election violence in a highly fractured political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garamut.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/the-voters-guide-to-lpv-how-does-it-work/ |title=The Voter's Guide to LPV |publisher=The Garamut |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===

In the [[Republic of Ireland]] IRV is used for presidential elections and for by-elections to the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] (the [[lower house]] of parliament). Most elections in the Republic use the [[Single Transferable Vote]], STV. The STV system was first introduced for a national election when the abortive [[Parliament of Southern Ireland]] was elected in 1921. It was provided, at the same time, that by-elections for the body would occur under IRV. When what is now the Republic seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922 STV was adopted for ordinary elections to Dáil Éireann and IRV for by-elections, and this combination has been used ever since. STV is also used for local and European elections, but in these cases by-elections do not occur. Instead local council vacancies are filled by [[co-option]] and European vacancies by an individual from a list of replacements nominated by the [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] at the time of his election.

The office of [[President of Ireland]] has existed since the adoption of the current [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, which provided that the President would be elected by IRV. However the first election did not occur until 1945. This is because the constitution also allows that, where there is agreement among political parties, a consensus candidate can come to office without the occurrence of an election. The President occupies a largely ceremonial position, as real power is exercised by the [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister) and Dáil.

On the island of [[Ireland]] IRV is not referred to as 'instant-runoff voting' and only rarely as the 'Alternative Vote', the name popular in [[Great Britain]]. Instead it is usually called the 'Single Transferable Vote' or, sometimes, incorrectly, 'proportional representation'. The name ''Single Transferable Vote'' is used because when the rules of STV are applied to a single-winner election, such as a presidential election or by-election, STV becomes one and the same as IRV. However this can be confusing because there are many important differences between the use of STV for multi-seat elections and IRV. For this reason many scholars regard STV as a separate system from IRV,{{CN|date=March 2016}} and that is the convention followed in this article. It is incorrect to refer to IRV as 'proportional representation' because the term ''proportional representation'' can only meaningfully be applied to an election in which more than a single candidate is returned.{{CN|date=March 2016}}

===United Kingdom===

IRV is currently used in the [[United Kingdom]] for by-elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and to local assemblies in [[Scotland]], both of which use the [[single transferable vote]] method of proportional representation in regularly scheduled elections. It is used in its contingent vote form (also called the [[supplementary vote]]), for all direct elections for mayor in England, including in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonelects.org.uk|title=London Elects - Your London. Your vote.|website=www.londonelects.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to fill vacancies within the House of Lords,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/lordsbe.html |title=House of Lords Byelection |publisher=Election.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to elect the leaders of the Liberal Democrats &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcwestsussex.org.uk/glossary.html#Alternative%20vote |title=Make Votes Count In West Sussex |publisher=Mvcwestsussex.org.uk |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Labour Party &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makemyvotecount.org.uk/blog/archives/labour/labour_leadership_contest/index.html |title=Labour Leadership Contest Archives |publisher=Make My Vote Count |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for many private elections, including for Chancellor of Oxford University &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2002-3/supps/1_4645.htm |title=Oxford University Gazette: Election of Chancellor of the University (supplement) |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rectorial elections at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/rectorialelection/regulations.html The University of Edinburgh - Rectorial Election] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111005603/http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/rectorialelection/regulations.html |date=January 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IRV was the electoral method available to select a replacement MEP by election for the [[Northern Ireland]] constituency of the European parliament, however now a party can co-opt a replacement without the need for a by-election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7778653.stm System for replacing MEPs changed] BBC Northern Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

IRV has been debated vigorously in the country since the early 20th century. In 1917, for example, the Speaker's Conference advocated the adoption of IRV for 358 of the 569 constituencies in the UK, and STV for the rest; its intention was that STV would be used in densely populated urban areas but, in order to keep constituencies from being too large, IRV would be used in more sparsely populated rural areas. Although the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] voted in favour of the proposals five times, the [[House of Lords]] rejected it until the nationwide effort was ultimately abandoned in parliament.

In 1921 the Government of Ireland Act established two home rule parliaments in [[Ireland]]&amp;ndash;the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland]]&amp;ndash;and while STV was used for regular elections to these bodies IRV was used for by-elections. This combination of IRV and STV has been used in what is now the Republic of Ireland ever since. The Northern Ireland Parliament continued to use the combination until the late 1920s when it switched to the '[[plurality voting system|first past the post]]' plurality system. However STV for regular elections, and IRV for by-elections, has been reintroduced and used there to elect devolved assemblies since the 1970s.

IRV is usually referred to in the UK as the 'Alternative Vote' or 'AV'. In 1998 the [[Jenkins Commission (UK)|Jenkins Commission]], charged by the government with suggesting an alternative system to plurality, devised a new system called the [[Alternative vote top-up|Alternative Vote Plus]] (AV+) for elections to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. This involved a combination of [[party-list proportional representation]] and single seat constituencies elected under IRV. However no action has been taken on the Commission's report.

In March 2009 the government announced that it would run an inquiry into the use of IRV at future general elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8092235.stm |title=Brown plan to reform UK politics |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2010 the House of Commons voted to hold a national referendum on AV. The government's term expired before this legislation was approved, but in July 2010, newly elected Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced a referendum on AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-07-05a.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A11812#g23.1 |title=Political and Constitutional Reform: 5 Jul 2010: House of Commons debates |publisher=TheyWorkForYou.com |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 5, 2011, the referendum was defeated by 68% to 32%, as detailed in [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011]].

===United States===

{{main|IRV implementations in the United States}}

Since 1917, IRV has been used in various [[United States]] jurisdictions. Since 2002, IRV has been adopted by more than a dozen cities, with some adoptions pending implementation. As of September 2013, American cities currently using IRV to elect at least one office include [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]; [[Oakland, California]]; [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]; [[San Francisco, California]]; [[Takoma Park, Maryland]]; [[Berkeley, California]]; [[San Leandro, California]]; and [[Telluride, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instantrunoff.com/in-the-united-states-2/|title=InstantRunoff.com - In the United States|website=www.instantrunoff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1941, the [[single transferable vote]], a multi-seat variation of IRV, has been used to elect the city council and school committee in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=MPR&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Curtis|title=Instant runoff voting FAQ|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/10/30/runoff-voting-qa|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco's system of IRV was challenged in federal court, but a unanimous panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld San Francisco's IRV law, finding that the plaintiff failed to establish that the City's chosen electoral system was unconstitutional. &lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=dudum+v+arntz&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003&amp;case=438379963242494061&amp;scilh=0 Dudum v.

{{main|Scottish Socialist Party}}
In [[Scotland]], the '''Scottish Socialist Party''' (SSP) is a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[political party]]. The party was formed in 1998 from an alliance of left-wing organisations in [[Scotland]]. In 1999, it saw its first MSP returned to [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]], with five more MSPs elected in 2003. It lost all MSPs in the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 elections]] and has lacked representation in the Scottish Parliament ever since.

==Early years (1996-1998)==
The forerunner of the SSP was the '''Scottish Socialist Alliance''' (SSA), a coalition of left-wing bodies in [[Scotland]] formed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redpepper.org.uk/article158.html Scotland’s brave new world]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4361047.stm Profile: Scottish Socialist Party]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 400 people attended the SSA's launch rally in [[Glasgow]] in February 1996, which attracted [[socialists]] and [[communists]] from various party backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12041800.Party_launched_to_unite_the_left/|title=Party launched to unite the left|date=12 February 1996|accessdate=18 April 2017|work=The Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group involved was [[Scottish Militant Labour]].

The first election fought by the SSA was the [[Toryglen]] [[by-election]] for [[Glasgow City Council]] in August 1996, with [[Rosie Kane]] as the candidate, where it won a respectable 18% of the vote. The SSA went on to contest 16 seats in Scotland at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997]], including all ten Glasgow seats, [[Edinburgh North and Leith (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh North and Leith]], and both [[Dundee]] seats. [[Tommy Sheridan]] saved his deposit in [[Glasgow Pollok (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Pollok]], and Jim McVicar and [[Alan McCombes]] picked up a significant vote in [[Glasgow Baillieston (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Baillieston]] and [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] respectively.

The SSA's electoral stance was that there needed to be a left-wing alternative to [[New Labour]] and the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], and the SSA felt that the experience had been enough of a success to go on to form the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (SSP) in 1998, with [[Tommy Sheridan]] as its convenor, in advance of the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 1999]].

==Formation and growth of the SSP==
The SSP contested the by-election for the European Parliament constituent of [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] that took place in November 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/politics-euro-election-woofie-factor-sees-off-labour-in-scots-poll-1187743.html |title=Politics: Euro Election: Woofie factor sees off Labour in Scots poll |first=Andrew |last=Grice |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 November 1998 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scottish Parliament general election, 1999===
{{Main|Scottish Parliament general election, 1999}}
In April 1999 the SSP announced their manifesto for the first elections to the devolved Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/parties_and_issues/313560.stm |title=Vote 99. Scotland. Parties and Issues. Scottish Socialist Party |work=BBC News |date=12 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only having a party membership of around 1,200 the SSP contested all the regions, with the party's National Convenor [[Tommy Sheridan]] the top-placed on their [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow]] regional list. Sheridan was elected, becoming their first MSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/news/337573.stm |title=Socialists' foot in Holyrood door |work=BBC News |date=7 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period following the election of Scotland's only socialist MSP saw sustained growth for the SSP. During this period of sustained and rapid growth, it recruited extensively from former members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Scottish National Party]], in addition to trade unionists, environmentalists, and community campaigners. It also achieved what was, for a minor party, a respectable vote at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]] and a series of by-elections for the UK and Scottish parliaments ([[Hamilton South by-election, 1999|Hamilton South]], [[Ayr by-election, 2000|Ayr]], [[Glasgow Anniesland by-elections, 2000|Glasgow Anniesland]], and [[Falkirk West by-election, 2000|Falkirk West]]).

===Scottish Parliament general election, 2003===
{{Main|Scottish Parliament general election, 2003}}
The 2003 elections to the Scottish Parliament took place shortly after the decision of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] to invade [[Iraq]] and the [[UK firefighter dispute 2002–2003]]. The SSP had been active in the anti-war movement and the firefighters' dispute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/fire-union-switches-allegiance-to-ssp-1-544830 |title=Fire union switches allegiance to SSP |first=Hamish |last=MacDonnell |work=The Scotsman |date=5 February 2003 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fielded candidates in all seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11989303.Sheridan_apos_s_socialists_now_a_force_all_over_the_country_Rosie_Kane_joins_Sheridan_in_Glasgow/ |title=Sheridan's socialists now a force all over the country Rosie Kane joins Sheridan in Glasgow |first=Catherine |last=MacLeod |work=The Herald |date=2 May 2003 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;They gained five additional regional list MSPs across Scotland: [[Frances Curran]]; [[Rosie Kane]]; [[Carolyn Leckie]]; [[Colin Fox (politician)|Colin Fox]]; and [[Rosemary Byrne]].

The party had a boost when the Scottish section of the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]] (RMT) affiliated with them, breaking their historical association with Labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3467637.stm |title=Rail union breaks with Labour |work=BBC News |date=7 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Campbell Martin]], a former SNP MSP who had become an independent, came fairly close to joining the SSP. The party did, however, recruit [[John McAllion]], a former Labour MSP who lost his seat at the 2003 election. He stood for the SSP in the [[Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, 2006]], but gained only 537 votes (1.6%).

==Crisis and split==
{{wikinews|Scottish Socialist Party to split as Sheridan launches new party}}
On 11 November 2004, [[Tommy Sheridan]] resigned as convener of the Scottish Socialist Party, citing personal reasons. It later emerged that he had been pressured into resignation by the party's National Executive because he intended to sue a national tabloid newspaper over stories he knew to be true. [[Colin Fox (politician)|Colin Fox]] was elected to replace him at the party's [[Scottish Socialist Party leadership election, 2005|2005 leadership election]].

By early August 2006, Sheridan was looking to become leader of the Scottish Socialist Party again{{mdash}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5247842.stm|title=Fight on for future of Socialists|date=5 August 2006|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 29 August 2006, before the election had taken place, Sheridan announced his intention to leave and found a new political party which he called [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5297040.stm New socialist party for Sheridan]", ''BBC News'', 29 August 2006, (retrieved 10 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; His move was supported by [[Rosemary Byrne]] MSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/ssp-executive-says-sheridan-is-on-the-road-to-oblivion-former-leader-claims-party-now-distorted-1.98070|title=SSP executive says Sheridan is on the road to oblivion|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan hoped his splinter group would attract as many as 700 SSP members.&lt;ref name="split"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5307316.stm|title=Sheridan unveils Solidarity party|date=3 September 2006|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSP met immediately before the split at a national rally on 2 September 2006, at which Fox said "the vast majority of SSP members" had not been persuaded of the need for a new party.&lt;ref name="split" /&gt; As a result of the split, the party's national conference was brought forward from the following Spring to that October, and all of the party positions went up for election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5246956.stm|title=Split on the cards for Socialists|date=4 August 2006|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the incumbents were re-elected, including Colin Fox as National Convener.

In October 2006 the RMT withdrew their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/socialist-msp-jailed-for-nuclear-protest-1-723198 |title=Socialist MSP jailed for nuclear protest |work=The Scotsman |date=28 October 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament election]], the SSP hemorrhaged votes while Solidarity failed to win a seat. At the local elections that year, the SSP retained one councillor, [[Jim Bollan]], who was re-elected in [[West Dunbartonshire]].

== Scottish referendum campaign ==
Following the 2011 elections to the Scottish Parliament and the resulting SNP majority, the Scottish Government announced its intent to hold an [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|independence referendum in 2014]]. In May 2012, a cross-party organisation called [[Yes Scotland]] was established to campaign for a Yes vote. The SSP's national co-spokesperson, Colin Fox, was invited to sit on its Advisory Board, reflecting the party's crucial support for independence over the past fifteen years. This was done at the insistence of Yes Scotland's non-partisan chief executive, [[Blair Jenkins]], in the face of SNP opposition.&lt;ref name="shinterview" /&gt; During the referendum campaign, the party continued to campaign on other issues including the [[bedroom tax]], [[fuel poverty]], [[same-sex marriage|equal marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/07/18/video-scottish-socialist-party-says-scotland-needs-equal-marriage-to-be-a-beacon-to-the-world/|title=Video: Scottish Socialist Party says Scotland needs equal marriage ‘to be a beacon to the world’|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latest [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict|Israel-Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastdunbartonshiressp.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/israel-must-stop.html|title=Israel must stop|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sspglasgowsouth.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/powerful-speeches-made-at-ssp-glasgow-souths-gaza-crisis-public-meeting/|title=Powerful speeches made at SSP Glasgow South’s Gaza crisis public meeting|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 2013, the SSP launched a pamphlet called ''[[The Case for an Independent Socialist Scotland]]'',&lt;ref name="scottishsocialistparty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishsocialistparty.org/new-ssp-pamphlet-case-independent-socialist-scotland/|title=Out now ‘The Case for an Independent Socialist Scotland’ a new pamphlet from the SSP|date=10 September 2013|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the publication of which has been welcomed by MSPs.&lt;ref name="scottish.parliament.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28877.aspx?SearchType=Advance&amp;ReferenceNumbers=S4M-07572&amp;ResultsPerPage=10|title=Motion S4M-07572: John Finnie, Highlands and Islands, Independent, Date Lodged: 03/09/2013|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become the party's fastest-selling pamphlet ever. A launch event was held in the [[Scottish Parliament]], hosted by Independent MSP [[John Finnie]], and subsequent launch events took place in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] and [[Aberdeen]]. In June 2014, the party published another pamphlet outlining its case for "a modern democratic republic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scottishsocialistparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ssv439.pdf|title=For a modern democratic republic|page=8|publisher=''Scottish Socialist Voice''|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the publication of ''[[Scotland's Future]]'', the party issued a statement which said the Scottish Government's document had set out a vision that represents "very significant advance for the people of Scotland", but reaffirmed the SSP's commitment to a socialist Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-opinion/8401-colin-fox-gives-the-ssp-response-to-the-white-paper|title=Colin Fox gives the SSP response to the Independence White Paper|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the party's campaign for independence, it held dozens of public meetings across Scotland with a range of speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midlothianadvertiser.co.uk/news/local-headlines/socialist-campaign-comes-to-penicuik-1-3044947|title=Socialist campaign comes to Penicuik|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's final meeting, scheduled to take place in Drumchapel Community Centre, was cancelled after unionist protests. In the aftermath, [[Richie Venton]] said: "Those demonstrating may have learned that their support for a Westminster regime was impoverishing themselves and their communities. But what they should know is we shall continue to fight against austerity and the tyranny of the Tories over communities like Drumchapel, Govan, Easterhouse and indeed, Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnetscotland.scot/index.php/scottish-news/in-brief/9757-ssp-referendum-meeting-halted-after-pro-union-protestors-berate-locals|title=SSP referendum meeting halted after pro-Union protestors berate locals|date=16 November 2014|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''Sunday Herald'' in late August 2014, Colin Fox said: "The SSP has brought a proletarian sense to Yes Scotland and reminded people the decisive issue is whether people think they're going to be better off. It's not the currency, it's not the EU, it's not those highfalutin' chattering class issues." He said that the party brought "a sense of the schemes, the workplaces, the unions" to the campaign.&lt;ref name="shinterview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Tom|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/the-middle-classes-in-scotland-are-complacent-they-pay-lip-service-to-pover.25053495|title=Yes's Colin Fox: middle classes in Scotland are complacent...they pay lip service to poverty|date=17 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014|publisher=''Sunday Herald''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The SSP after the referendum ==

After the announcement of the referendum result, the SSP was amongst the political parties that reported significant increases in the size of their membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29311147|title=Scottish referendum: 'Yes' parties see surge in members|date=22 September 2014|accessdate=22 September 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-surgeon-reveals-5000-new-4297575|title=Nicola Surgeon reveals 5000 new members have joined SNP since independence referendum|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014|publisher=''Daily Record''}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 23 September, more than 2,100 people had joined the party since the referendum result was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSP Membership Tweet|url=https://twitter.com/The_SSP_/status/514544902093688832|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, new branches were established across the country.

When the make-up of the [[Smith Commission]] was announced, Colin Fox protested the decision to "uniquely exclude" the SSP from proceedings. He wrote to the Smith Commission: "The argument some use to justify our exclusion on the grounds that we currently have no 'parliamentary representation' fails to appreciate that the referendum was not a parliamentary process but an unprecedented public debate that resulted in an extraordinary level of engagement from all sections of society. To exclude the SSP is to exclude an important constituency of opinion in Scottish society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sspcolinfox.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/ssp-protest-our-exclusion-form-lord.html|title=SSP protests our exclusion from Lord Smith's Devolution Commission|date=5 October 2014|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSP's 2014 National Conference took place in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 October and the party reported it had been better attended than the preceding several years and that their membership had trebled during the weeks following the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=Tom|url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/ssp-welcomes-new-members-conference|title=SSP welcomes new members at conference|date=27 October 2014|work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first SSP conference to be [[streaming media|streamed live over the Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.livestream.com/IndependenceLive/ssp2014|title=Scottish Independence Live Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uncle Sam]] sees hyphenated voters and asks, "Why should I let these freaks cast whole ballots when they are only half Americans?"]]
In the [[United States]], the term '''hyphenated American''' refers to the use of a [[hyphen]] (in some styles of writing) between the name of an ethnicity and the word "American" in [[compound noun]]s, e.g., as in "[[Irish-American]]". It was an [[epithet]] used from 1890 to 1920 to disparage Americans who were of foreign birth or origin, and who displayed an allegiance to a foreign country through the use of the hyphen. It was most commonly directed at [[German Americans]] or [[Irish American]]s ([[Irish Catholic|Catholic]]s) who called for U.S. neutrality in [[World War I]].

In this context, the term "the hyphen" was a [[metonymy|metonymical]] reference to this kind of ethnicity descriptor, and "dropping the hyphen" referred to full integration into the American identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3MMWiPSdutcC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107]&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was an outspoken anti-hyphenate and [[Woodrow Wilson]] followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, ''Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860–1925'' (1955) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UzVhOx7WuMMC&amp;pg=PA198 online text p 198]&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary studies and debates refer to hyphenated-American identities to discuss issues such as multiculturalism and immigration in the U.S. political climate, however the hyphen is rarely used per the recommendation of modern style guides.

== Nativism and Hyphenated-Americanism, 1890-1920 ==
The term "hyphenated American" was published by 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = The Deseret Weekly | title = Letter from 'Junius' | author = Charles William Penrose | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | publisher = Deseret News Co | pages = 53–54 | date = July 6, 1889 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=FawUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22hyphenated+american%22+date:0-1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was common as a derogatory term by 1904. During World War I the issue arose of the primary political loyalty of ethnic groups with close ties to Europe, especially German Americans and also Irish Americans. Former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in speaking to the largely Irish Catholic [[Knights of Columbus]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] on Columbus Day 1915, asserted that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/10/13/105042745.pdf |title=Roosevelt Bars the Hyphenated |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 13, 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all ... The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities, an intricate knot of German-Americans, Irish-Americans, English-Americans, French-Americans, Scandinavian-Americans or Italian-Americans, each preserving its separate nationality, each at heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality, than with the other citizens of the American Republic ... There is no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The only man who is a good American is the man who is an American and nothing else.}}

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] regarded "hyphenated Americans" with suspicion, saying, "Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/wilsonleagueofnations.htm ''Woodrow Wilson: Final Address in Support of the League of Nations''], americanrhetoric.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Di Nunzio |editor-first=Mario R. |title=Woodrow Wilson: Essential Writings and Speeches of the Scholar-President |publisher=NYU Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-8147-1984-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qP2eeyB3QkYC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;lpg=PA412 |page=412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/09/27/96343689.pdf |title=Explains our Voting Power in the League |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 27, 1919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyphenated-American identities==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{See also|Identity politics|Social solidarity|Social cohesion}}
Some groups recommend dropping the hyphen because it implies to some people dual nationalism and inability to be accepted as truly American.  The [[Japanese American Citizens League]] is supportive of dropping the hyphen because the non-hyphenated form uses their ancestral origin as an adjective for "American."&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Strasheim|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, other groups have embraced the hyphen, arguing that the American identity is compatible with alternative identities and that the mixture of identities within the United States [[melting pot|strengthens the nation]] rather than weakens it.

"[[European American]]", as opposed to White or [[Whites|Caucasian]], has been coined in response to the increasing racial and ethnic [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] of the US, as well as to this diversity moving more into the mainstream of the society in the latter half of the twentieth century.  The term distinguishes whites of European ancestry from those of other ancestries.  In 1977, it was proposed that the term "European American" replace "white" as a racial label in the US Census, although this was not done.  The term "European American" is not in common use in the US among the general public or in the mass media, and the terms "white" or "white American" are commonly used instead.

=== Usage of the hyphen ===
Modern style guides{{Which|date=October 2010}} most often recommend dropping the hyphen between the two names except when the compound is used as an adjective; some, including [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], recommend dropping the hyphen even for the adjective form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Editorial Style Guide|url=http://www.calstatela.edu/style/editfullguide.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626130831/http://www.calstatela.edu/style/editfullguide.htm|publisher=California State University at Los Angeles|accessdate=2007-12-13|archivedate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, compounds with name fragments, such as ''Afro-American'' and ''Indo-European'', are recommended to be hyphenated.

==== American English ====
The first term typically indicates a region or culture of origin [[ancestry]] paired with "American".
Examples:
* Region, continent or [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[European American]], [[Latino American]], [[Middle-Eastern Americans|Middle-Eastern American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American, or American Indian]], [[Pacific Islands American]].
* Ethnicity or nationality: [[Arab American]], [[Armenian American]], [[British American]], [[Chinese American]], [[Colombian American]], [[English American]], [[Filipino American]], [[French American]], [[German American]], [[Greek American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[Italian American]], [[Japanese American]], [[Jewish American]], [[Korean American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Norwegian American]], [[Pakistani American]], [[Polish American]], [[Russian American]], [[Scottish American]], [[Swedish American]], [[Ukrainian American]], [[Vietnamese American]], and so on.

The hyphen is occasionally but not consistently employed when the compound term is used as an adjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Falcon Style Guide: A Comprehensive Guide for Travel and Outdoor Writers and Editors|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UP1oopO3mcUC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=hyphen+adjective+mexican-american|year=2000|author=Erica S. Olsen|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1-58592-005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic style guides (including APA, ASA, MLA, and Chicago Manual) do not use a hyphen in these compounds even when they are used as adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title="Hyphens, En Dashes, Em Dashes." The Chicago Manual Style Online|url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/HyphensEnDashesEmDashes.html?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[linguistics|linguistic]] construction functionally indicates [[ancestry]], but also may connote a sense that these individuals straddle two worlds&amp;mdash;one experience is specific to their unique [[ethnicity|ethnic]] [[cultural identity|identity]], while the other is the broader multicultural amalgam that is [[Americana]].

==== In relation to Latin America ====
{{main|American (word)}}
[[Latin America]] includes most of the [[Western Hemisphere]] south of the United States, including [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and (in some cases) the [[Caribbean]]. U.S. nationals with origins in Latin America are often referred to as [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic or Latino Americans]], or by their specific country of origin, e.g., Mexican Americans, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Cuban Americans]].

'''Individual and political action on climate change''' can take many forms. Many actions aim to build social and political support to limit, and subsequently reduce, the concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], with the goal of [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating climate change]]. Other actions seek to address the ethical and moral aspects of [[climate justice]], especially with regard to the anticipated unequal impacts of [[climate change adaptation]].

== Political action ==
{{Main|Politics of global warming}}
Political action can change laws and regulations that relate to [[climate change]].

[[Carbon price|Carbon pricing]] methods, such as a [[carbon tax]] or an [[emissions trading]] system, are favored by many economists as the most efficient and effective means to reduce GHG emissions, and are increasingly being deployed around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25160|title=State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2016|last=The World Bank|first=|date=October 2016|website=The World Bank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., groups such as the bipartisan legislative Climate Solutions Caucus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/274061-creating-a-bipartisan-climate-to-discuss-climate|title=Creating a bipartisan climate to discuss climate change in Congress|last=Picard|first=Joe|date=2016-03-24|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Citizens Climate Lobby]] work to build support for carbon pricing.

Regulations can strengthen GHG [[emission standard]]s from particular sectors of the economy, such as the EPA's proposed [[Clean Power Plan]] for United States power plants, or vehicle standards in [[European emission standards|Europe]] and the [[United States emission standards|United States]].

Political action can also gain [[Media coverage of climate change|media]] and public attention to climate change. Political action from the community, however, is often challenged by interests within the [[fossil-fuel industry]],&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Clive (2007), "[[Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] "Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens Our Future" {{ISBN|978-1-55963-484-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been charged with promoting [[climate change denial]] views&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming|title=Exxon's Own Research Confirmed Fossil Fuels' Role in Global Warming Decades Ago {{!}} InsideClimate News|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to hold off a "[[carbon bubble]]" valuation crash.

There are many forms of political action on climate change including letter writing, direct [[lobbying]], and public [[Shame|sham]]ing of politicians and media organizations. Political action campaigns require building a base of support at local level.

The [[climate movement]] has emerged in recent years, given there is an increased awareness of the importance of [[global warming]] as a factor in a range of issues. Many [[Environmental policy|environmental]], [[economics of global warming|economic]], and [[social issues]] find common ground in [[mitigation of global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/insights/sustainabledevelopmentlinkingeconomysocietyenvironment.htm |title=Sustainable Development: Linking economy, society, environment |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=oecd.org |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |access-date=August 30, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/journals/weather-climate-and-society/ Weather, Climate, and Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of groups from around the world have come together to work on the issue of global warming. [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) from diverse fields of work have united on this issue. A [[coalition]] of 50 NGOs called [[Stop Climate Chaos]] launched in Britain (September 2005) to highlight the issue of climate change.

The [[Campaign against Climate Change]] was created to focus purely on the issue of climate change and to pressure governments into action by building a protest movement of sufficient magnitude to effect political change.

[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in various cities around the world wherein [[bicyclist]]s and, less frequently, [[unicycle|unicyclists]], [[skateboard]]ers, [[inline skate]]rs, [[rollerskates|roller skaters]] and other self-propelled commuters take to the streets ''[[en masse]].'' While the ride was founded in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the [[direct action]] of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city or town streets.

One of the elements of the [[Occupy movement]] is global warming action.

Succeeding environmentalist Bill McKibben's mantra that "if it's wrong to wreck the climate, it's wrong to profit from that wreckage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-case-for-fossil-fuel-divestment-20130222|title=The Case for Fossil-Fuel Divestment|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;" [[fossil fuel divestment]] campaigns attempt to get public institutions, such as universities and churches, to remove investment assets from fossil fuel companies. By December 2016, a total of 688 institutions and over 58,000 individuals representing $5.5 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in assets worldwide had been divested from fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gofossilfree.org/commitments/|title=Commitments|newspaper=Fossil Free|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-double-5tn-in-a-year|title=Fossil fuel divestment funds double to $5tn in a year|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=2016-12-12|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as [[NextGen America]] and [[Climate Hawks Vote]] are working in the [[United States]] to elect officials who will make action on climate change a high priority.

== Climate disobedience ==
{{See also|Ende Gelände 2016|Ende Gelände 2017|Extinction Rebellion}}

Climate disobedience is a form of [[civil disobedience]], deliberate action intended to critique government climate policy. In 2008, American climate activist [[Tim DeChristopher]] posed as a bidder at an auction of US [[Bureau of Land Management]] oil and gas leases of public land in [[Utah]], won the auction, reneged on payment, and was imprisoned for 21 months. In September 2015, five climate activists known as the Delta 5 obstructed an oil train in [[Everett, Washington]]. At trial, the Delta 5 were allowed the [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity defense]], that is, breaking a law in the service of preventing a greater harm. After testimony, the judge determined the grounds for the necessity defense were not met and instructed the jury to disregard testimony admitted under the necessity defense. The Delta 5 were fined for trespassing but were acquitted of more serious charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How to Stop an Oil Train: The Hearts-and-Minds Climate Defense That Won Over a Courtroom |magazine=[[Yes!

The first example of a judge accepting the climate necessity defense was on March 27, 2018 when Judge Mary Ann Driscoll acquitted all 13 defendants of civil charges from a protest held in 2016 in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcum|first1=Marla|title=Exciting News from West Roxbury|url=http://www.climatedisobedience.org/exciting_news_from_west_roxbury|website=Climate Disobedience|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International political frameworks ==

=== Paris Agreement ===
The [[Paris Agreement]] is an agreement within the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) dealing with [[Climate change mitigation|greenhouse gases emissions mitigation]], [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and finance starting in the year 2020. The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] (COP21) in [[Paris]] and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.

The head of the Paris Conference, France's foreign minister [[Laurent Fabius]], called the plan "ambitious and balanced" and an "historic turning point" in the goal of reducing global warming. [[Paris Agreement#Concerns|Critics note]] that the agreement is not sufficient to achieve the 2&amp;nbsp;°C warming target, and the lack of any binding enforcement mechanism. Subsequent Conference of the Parties meetings are expected to address shortcomings in the Paris Agreement.

Amid fierce opposition from scientists and other leaders around the world, U.S. President Donald Trump has [[Political positions of Donald Trump#Opposition to international cooperation on climate change|pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement]].

=== The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ===
Under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The [[European Union]] has decided to work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]]. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their legally binding commitments under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a [[free market]] system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).&lt;ref&gt;Gippner, Olivia (2014) Framing it right: China-EU relations
and patterns of interaction on climate change Chinese Journal of
Urban and Environmental Studies, 2 (1). ISSN 2345-7481&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contraction and Convergence ===
The concept of Cap, [[Contraction and Convergence]] was proposed as a replacement to the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]]. The idea here is that the limits to carbon emissions need to be capped at 350-450 parts per million, currently considered to produce a raise in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. It is currently believed that further increases would bring about major positive feedbacks (the burning of forests and the loss of carbon from soils and oceans) which currently limit greenhouse gas emissions, and would lead to a run-away global warming similar to the [[Eocene]] period, during which there was no ice at the poles.

To sustain this figure, it has been proposed that on equity grounds, all people should be allocated an equal carbon footprint (currently about 2 tonnes per person, which by 2050 could fall to 1.5 tonnes per person through population increase). World per capita carbon emissions, currently in excess of 4 tonnes per person needs to contract to those levels, if these targets are to be met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonsense.org/ CarbonSense&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in the name of global and inter-generational equity, policies needing to be instituted need to converge, over a fixed period towards this figure for every country. A trading regime, whereby which countries in excess of these figures (from example the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US at 20 tonnes per capita]]), purchase [[carbon credit]]s from a country using less than its allocation (e.g. [[Kenya]] at 1.3 tonnes per capita), is considered by many as the best way of solving this problem.

For example, the Contract and Converge strategy was adopted by India, [[PRC|China]] and many African countries as the basis for future negotiations. The UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] said in 2000 "the [[UK]] should be prepared to accept the contraction and convergence principle is the basis for international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Aubrey (2000), "Contraction and Convergence:The Global Solution to Climate Change" Schumacher Briefings 5, published by Green Books on behalf of the [[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher]] Society&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-national level action ==
Some states, regions, and cities in the world are taking the lead on developing emissions reduction methods in the absence of federal policy, and may provide models for future national efforts. Their efforts are achieving real measurable emissions reductions and by pursuing policies and programs that have climate benefits, they have promoted state economic development, improved air quality and trimmed their vulnerability to energy price spikes. In the long run, addressing climate change will require comprehensive national policy and international agreements. However, in the absence of federal policy, states and regions are taking the lead on developing policies that may provide models for future national efforts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite paper |author= Engel, Kirsten and Barak Orbach |title= Micro-Motives for State and Local Climate Change Initiatives |version= |publisher= [[Harvard Law &amp; Policy Review]], Vol. 2, pp. 119-137 |year= 2008 |ssrn= 1014749 |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (United States) ===
The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI, pronounced "Reggie") is the first mandatory market based program in the United States to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. RGGI is a cooperative effort among the states of [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]] to cap and reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from the power sector. In effect since January 1, 2009, the program is now in its third 3-year compliance period (2015-2017). As of 2016, RGGI has cut power plant carbon emissions in the region by 37%, while saving customers over $395 million on their bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jackson-morris/pioneering-carbon-cutting-program-turns-10-what-now-rggi|title=Pioneering Carbon-Cutting Program Turns 10: What Now, RGGI?|newspaper=NRDC|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghent, Belgium ===
The city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called Veggiedag,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegetarisme.be/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=767 "Ghent's veggie day: for English speaking visitors"] on Vegetarisme.be&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm "Belgian city plans 'veggie' days"] on [[BBC News]] (2009-05-12).&lt;/ref&gt; with [[vegetarian]]-only food in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, soon in all schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of "veggie street maps"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the [[Environmental effects of meat production#Fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions|detrimental environmental effects of meat production]], which the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

=== United Kingdom ===
The town of [[Totnes]] in Devon through its "Transition Town Totnes" Project has adopted an Energy Descent Plan, as a response in answer to the twin problems of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and [[peak oil]]. As a result of a series of large, well attended public gatherings with key experts from around the world, and the organisation of a number of special interest groups, the community has come together with lecturers and trainers shared with [[Schumacher College]], through a process of participative strategic planning, to hone their skills in project development. As a result of the initiatives in Totnes, a large number of other communities have started "[[Transition Towns|Transition Town]]" projects, and there are now more than 400 around the world,&lt;ref name="Transition Initiatives Directory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transition Initiatives Directory|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives|accessdate=30 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from small communities to whole cities (e.g. [[Berlin]]).

The concepts of including [[food miles]] or carbon neutral labels on packaging has been gaining interest in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10000217 NPR: Taking a Practical Approach to 'Green' Living&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual action ==
{{main|Individual action on climate change}}

=== Carbon Conversations ===
The Carbon Conversations is a [[psychosocial]] project that focuses on the [[Moral agency|agency]] of individuals to encourage personal action to reduce carbon emissions. The project touches on four main topics: i) home energy; ii) food; iii) travel; iv) consumption and waste; and v) talking with family and friends. The project understands that individuals often fail to adopt low-carbon lifestyles not because of practical barriers to change (e.g.: there is no renewable energy available), but because of aspects related to their values, emotions, and identity. The project offers a supportive group experience that helps people reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by 1 tonne CO2 on average and aim at halving it in the long term. They deal with the difficulties of change by connecting to values, emotions and identity. The groups are based on a [[psychosocial]] understanding of how people change. Groups of 6-8 members meet six or twelve times with trained facilitators in homes, community centres, workplaces or other venues. The meetings create a non-judgmental atmosphere where people are encouraged to make serious lifestyle changes.

Carbon Conversations was cited in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as one of the 20 best ideas to tackle climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Ian (2009). [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-climate-change Twenty Ideas That Could Save the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international relations]], '''institutionalism''' comprises a group of differing theories on [[international relations]] (IR). [[functionalism in international relations|Functionalist]] and [[neofunctionalism|neofunctionalist]] approaches, [[regime theory]], and [[state cartel theory]] have in common their focus on the role of formal and informal rules, norms, practices, and conventions for international politics.

==Functionalist approaches==
{{Main|Functionalism in international relations}}
The functional theory of [[David Mitrany]] is the oldest institutional theory of IR. Mitrany suggested that slim "functional agencies" should organize the needs of cooperation among even conflicting states. The [[neofunctionalism]] and the communitarian method of [[Jean Monnet]] advocated the principle of [[supranationality]]: international bodies superordinated to the nation states should administer the common interests. The functionalist approaches have been often criticized to be idealistic and normative in their positive view on [[International organization|international institutions]].

== Institutionalism ==
===Regime theory ===
{{Main|Regime theory}}
Regime theory holds that the international system is not—in practice—anarchic, but that it has an implicit or explicit structure which determines how states will act within the system.

''Regimes'' are ''institutions'' or ''rules'' that determine the decision-making process. In the international arena, ''institution'' has been used interchangeably with ''regime'', which has been defined by [[Stephen D. Krasner|Krasner]] as a set of explicit or implicit "principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actors' expectations converge in a given issue-area".

Regime theorists hold a wide array of beliefs stemming from the central proposition that regimes as international institutions "matter" in answering the question, what explains a particular outcome? There are four reasons for this:

#They structure choices,
#they provide incentives,
#they distribute power and
#they define identities and roles.

===State cartel theory===
{{Main|State cartel theory}}
State cartel theory imported its terminology from the classical cartel theory of economic enterprises and thus is much more concrete than regime theory. On the field of international relations nation states are searching advantages by cooperation or by fighting out conflicts. But from a certain degree both of the compaction of international (economic) relations and of the development of [[military technology]] war discards more and more as a method of conflict. Now the states have to get along with each other, and hence they cartelize more and more issues of their politics in international institutions. Like in enterprise cartels the ''members' assembly'' is always the main institution of the combinations: the respective council of ministers or delegates, e.g., the [[Council of the European Union]]. All further institutions are the result of the will and the needs of the members and have serving functions (secretary, operative commissions, arbitration board), e.g., [[European Commission]] and [[European Court of Justice|European Court]].

==Rational choice institutionalism==
{{main|Rational choice institutionalism}}  

This school attempts to explain collective choices by rational actors. Outcomes are a product of the interaction between actor preferences ''and'' institutional rules.  

Rational institutionalists also regard institutions as themselves being rationally chosen by actors who view the rules as facilitating the pursuit of their goals. For example, the institutional decision-making rules of the [[European Union]] are such that the largest states can structure political outcomes.

==Historical institutionalism==
The [[historical institutionalism]] school believes that institutional factors account for differences in cross-national political outcomes. There are two elements:

#Institutions could shape actor preferences by structuring incentives, redistributing power, and by influencing the cultural context.
#History is "[[path dependent]]". Choices or events early in the process can force a path from which it becomes increasingly difficult to deviate.

[[Theda Skocpol]]'s work illustrates an example of historical institutionalism. Responses to the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s differed greatly between [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]], which had similar problems in terms of severity and duration. The two countries responded with vastly different policies due to differences in existing domestic institutional structures.

==Related theories==
===Neorealism===
{{main|Neorealism (international relations)}}

Neorealism, or structural realism, is a theory of international relations, outlined by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in his 1979 book, ''[[Theory of International Politics]]''. Waltz argues in favor of a systemic realist approach: the international structure acts as a constraint on state behavior, so that different states behave in a similar rational manner, and outcomes fall within an expected range.

===Neoliberalism===
{{main|Neoliberalism in international relations}}

Neoliberalism refers to a school of thought which believes that nation-states are, or at least should be, concerned first and foremost with [[absolute gain (international relations)|absolute gain]]s (economic, strategic, etc.), rather than [[relative gain (international relations)|relative gain]]s to other nation-states. Since their approach tends to emphasize the possibility of mutual wins, they are interested in institutions which can arrange jointly profitable arrangements and compromises.

JobBridge's stated aim was to "assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers were unable to get a job without experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jobbridge.ie/|title=Job Bridge National Internship Scheme|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; €50 was added to the trainee's weekly unemployment allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmitsugalway.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=182 |title=USI Welcomes 5,000 New Places on 'Job Bridge' Initiative |work=GMIT Students' Union |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331045016/http://www.gmitsugalway.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=182 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to prevent abuse, employers could not have laid anyone off within three months prior to signing up for the scheme and trainees must had been on the live register for three months or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmarrecruitment.com/nationalinternshipscheme.html |title=Reaction to Job Bridge - the National Internship Scheme |work=Sigmar Recruitment |date=29 June 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331045016/http://www.sigmarrecruitment.com/nationalinternshipscheme.html |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2011|August}}, 1,285 internships had been listed on the scheme's website, with a further 500 being vetted for listing, 473 interns had been selected and 292 had started their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0805/1224301864199.html | title=Internship candidates can get back what they put in|work=The Irish Times|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=24 August 2011|author=Lillington, Karlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2011 the [[National Economic and Social Council]] called for the scheme to be expanded beyond the initial 5000 internships originally planned in order to make a bigger difference to unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0809/unemployment.html|title=Stark warning issued for Irish labour market|work=RTÉ|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/jobless-face-years-on-dole-as-training-system-fails-2844145.html|title=Jobless face years on dole as training system 'fails'|work=Irish Independent|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=24 August 2011|author=Brennan, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2016, it was announced by Social Protection Minister [[Leo Varadkar]], that the internship scheme was to be discontinued after five years. Varadkar said that he was going to replace the JobBridge internship scheme with a more targeted scheme in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0522/790165-varadkar-jobbridge-scheme&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement came a week after Minister of State for Training and Skills [[John Halligan (politician)|John Halligan]] called for the controversial scheme to be cut.

On 21 October 2016, the JobBridge scheme was officially closed down.

==History== 
JobBridge attracted criticism from campaign groups, politicians and trainees alike. Disability rights organisations, including the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (Ahead) and The Irish Wheelchair Association, had in the past criticised JobBridge for excluding people with disabilities who were in receipt of disability allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2011/0726/1224301372670.html|title=Call for intern scheme to include those with disabilities|work=The Irish Times|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=4 April 2012|author=Smyth, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/kenny-denies-forced-labour-claims-are-behind-drop-in-unemployed-30066252.html|title=Kenny denies 'forced labour' claims are behind drop in unemployed|work=Irish Independent|date=5 March 2014|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Ireland's opposition political parties spoke out against JobBridge. [[Fianna Fáil]] called for the abolition of JobBridge to end the “exploitation of young Irish people by the programme”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/fianna-fail-ard-fheis-2014-motions-1370205-Mar2014/|title=Shutting down social media and 11 other motions at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis|work=The Journal.ie|date=21 March 2014|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] leader [[Gerry Adams]] accused the government of massaging unemployment figures through "forced labour" schemes like JobBridge and Gateways. Former [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] MEP [[Paul Murphy (Irish politician)|Paul Murphy]] said “the taxpayer is subsidising free labour for big companies as well as the exploitation of the interns themselves”. He criticised car repair firm Advance Pitstop for seeking to hire 28 interns through the scheme, which he claimed would save it €377,000 compared to the cost of hiring full-time staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/abuse-of-jobbridge-by-firms-minimal-1.1666126&lt;/ref&gt; Joe O'Connor, [[Union of Students in Ireland|USI]] President, said that while the USI believed there was a need for quality internships and real upskilling opportunities for young people in Ireland, it was clear that JobBridge was “broken beyond repair”.“Any internship scheme should be properly monitored and regulated, and should not displace fully paid labour. Clearly, JobBridge is failing in that respect, and we believe it should be brought to an end.”&lt;ref name="galwayindependent.com"/&gt;

Ireland's former social affairs minister [[Joan Burton]], meanwhile, considered the scheme to have been a success. She said that a further 1,000 internships would be provided for and claimed on 9 May 2012 that 38% of those on JobBridge (797 people) had gone on to full-time employment. At first sight, that looked like a qualified success, but at closer inspection, it became clear that JobBridge failed to provide proper jobs for the unemployed. The government's Indecon report showed that 59% of people did not complete their internships. The government euphemistically referred to them as internships that ‘were ended before their scheduled timeframe', or as 'early-completers'. The government claimed that nearly 60% of internships resulted in employment. This was just more spin, only 19.5% progressed immediately to get a job with their 'host company', the rest was made up of people who gain employment afterwards which did not have any direct link to JobBridge. Also, only 45% of these were in full-time paid employment.

The government study also found a large percentage of employers were highly or fairly unlikely to take on a paid employee in the absence of the JobBridge scheme. This meant that the scheme was creating a process where workers went through what was in effect a 9-month long interview process. The government study found that 3% of employers (over 200 companies) admitted to displacing existing jobs, yet the government only barred 35 companies from the scheme.

“JobBridge is not just an attack on those seeking work but also part of a much broader attempt to reduce the pay and conditions of workers in all sectors of the economy,” commented CWU Youth Committee Chair, Derek Keenan. “The scheme has depressed real job creation by allowing employers to avail of a free labour pool of unemployed workers desperate to get a foothold within the labour market. This abuse must cease; everyone deserves to be paid for their labour and we are calling on the government to phase out the scheme,” he added.&lt;ref name="galwayindependent.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor |last=Harrington |url=http://www.galwayindependent.com/20140202/news/youth-groups-call-for-end-jobbridge-scheme-S31372.html |title=Youth groups call for end JobBridge scheme: Youth advocacy groups have this week declared their opposition to the JobBridge scheme |work=Galway Independent |date=2 February 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214095158/http://galwayindependent.com/20140202/news/youth-groups-call-for-end-jobbridge-scheme-S31372.html |archivedate=14 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Republic of Telly]]'' sketch compared JobBridge with the Oscar-winning film ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]''. The sketch compared the government's JobBridge scheme to slavery, making several salient points, including "Why don't they just create real jobs" and "I thought the whole point of an internship was that you had a job at the end?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Clare|last=Cullen|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/ThreeTrending/video/oscarwinning-film-trailer-spoof-12-years-of-jobbridge-30145042.html|title=Oscar-winning film trailer spoof: '12 years of Jobbridge'|work=Irish Independent|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, there was controversy over the scheme's use for hiring school cleaners. The Department of Social Protection subsequently removed all references to school cleaners and caretakers from the JobBridge register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0920/645105-jobbridge/|title=All JobBridge advertisements for school cleaners and caretakers removed|work=RTÉ News|date=20 September 2014|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2008, a politically motivated&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt; fatal shooting took place at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Motivated by a desire to kill [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], gunman Jim David Adkisson fired a [[shotgun]] at members of the congregation during a youth performance of a musical, killing two people and wounding seven others.

==Shooting==

The [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] church hosted a youth performance of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie Jr.]]'' Some 200 people were watching the performance by 25 children when Adkisson entered the church and opened fire on the audience. 60-year-old Greg McKendry, a longtime church member and usher who deliberately stood in front of the gunman to protect others, was killed at the scene. A 61-year-old woman, Linda Kraeger, died from wounds suffered during the attack later that night. Kraeger was a member of Westside Unitarian Universalist Church in Farragut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Donald E.|last=Skinner|url=http://www.uuworld.org/news/articles/117286.shtml|title=Two Unitarian Universalists killed in church shooting|date=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooter was stopped when church members John Bohstedt, Robert Birdwell, Arthur Bolds, and Terry Uselton, along with visitor Jamie Parkey, restrained him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=J.J.|last=Stambaugh|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/jul/29/takedown-alleged-shooter-recounted/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729184422/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/jul/29/takedown-alleged-shooter-recounted/|archivedate=2008-07-29|deadurl=yes|title=Takedown of alleged shooter recounted|work=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]|date=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the interview Adkisson stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country, and that he felt that the Democrats had tied his country's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of major media outlets.  Adkisson made statements that because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them into office.  Adkisson stated that he had held these beliefs for about the last ten years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, one of Adkisson's former wives had been a member (in the 1990s) of the church where the attack occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Fowler|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/jul/29/friends-suspect-had-two-sides/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729184819/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/jul/29/friends-suspect-had-two-sides/|archivedate=2008-07-29|deadurl=yes|title=Friends: Suspect had two sides; Court records detail troubled marriage, DUI|work=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]|date=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[manifesto]] stated that he intended to keep shooting until police arrived and expected to be killed by police.  Adkisson had a waist satchel with more ammunition, totaling 76 [[Shotgun shell|shells]] of [[Lead shot|#4 shot]].

In his manifesto, Adkisson also included the Democratic members of the House and Senate,&lt;ref name="letter" /&gt; and the ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]''&lt;ref name="letter" /&gt; of [[Bernard Goldberg]] in his list of wished-for targets.

The TVUUC Board voted to rename the 'greeting hall' to honor Greg McKendry, citing his outgoing and friendly personality, and to rename the church library to honor Linda Kraeger, citing her work as an author and professor.

==Legal proceedings==
At his first court appearance, Adkisson waived his rights to the preliminary hearing and requested the case go directly to the [[grand jury]]. Adkisson was represented by [[public defender]] Mark Stephens. Stephens indicated that this move was taken to get the case to trial stage as quickly as possible so resources would become available for a mental health assessment of Adkisson, indicating a possible [[insanity defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=61780&amp;catid=2|title=Church shooting suspect waives preliminary hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2008, Adkisson was arraigned on charges of murder and attempted murder and a trial date of March 16, 2009 was set. He remained in jail on a $1 million bond. It was reported that the FBI had opened a civil rights probe in regards to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/aug/21/march-trial-date-set-church-shooter-bond-remains-1/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205011421/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/aug/21/march-trial-date-set-church-shooter-bond-remains-1/|archivedate = 2008-12-05|deadurl=yes|title = March trial date set for church shooter; bond remains $1 million|date = 2008-08-21|accessdate = 2014-05-14|website = knoxnews.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2009, lawyers representing Adkisson announced that he would plead guilty to two counts of murder, accepting a [[life sentence]] without possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Duncan|last=Mansfield|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20090204/church-shooting/|title=Lawyer: Guilty plea coming in TN church shooting|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2009, Adkisson pleaded guilty to killing two people and wounding six others. "Yes, ma'am, I am guilty as charged," he told Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz before she sentenced him to life in prison without parole. A mental health expert had determined that Adkisson was competent to make the plea, although public defender Mark Stephens was prepared to argue at the trial that his client was insane at the time the crime was committed.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29104696/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/man-gets-life-sentence-church-shooting/#.UPnC6Sc70y4|title=Man sentenced to life in church shooting - US news - Crime &amp; courts - NBC News|author=|date=|work=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims and church members wept as the prosecutor described the wounds that killed Greg McKendry and Linda Kraeger.  The judge gave Adkisson a chance to address members of the congregation before sentencing him. "No, ma'am," he snapped. "I have nothing to say."&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;

John Bohstedt, one of the church members who tackled Adkisson, said he didn't believe that Adkisson was insane, but that he had been manipulated by anti-liberal rhetoric. "Unbalanced, yes. Bitter, yes. Evil, yes. Insane, not in our ordinary use of the word," Bohstedt said.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;

Assistant District Attorney Leslie Nassios said Adkisson gave a statement to police, which showed that he planned the attack on the church because he believed that Democrats and the church's liberal politics "were responsible for his woes." Evidence showed that Adkisson bought the shotgun a month before the attack, sawed off the barrel at his home and carried the weapon into the church in a guitar case he had purchased two days before the shooting. He had written a suicide note and intended to keep firing until police officers arrived and killed him.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;

As of 2016, Adkisson, TOMIS ID 00450456, is incarcerated in the [[Northwest Correctional Complex]] (NWCX) prison of the [[Tennessee Department of Corrections]].

The '''Lincoln–Douglas debates''' (also known as '''The Great Debates of 1858''') were a series of seven debates between [[Abraham Lincoln]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Illinois]], and incumbent Senator [[Stephen Douglas]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate. At the time, U.S. senators were elected by [[state legislature (United States)|state legislatures]]; thus Lincoln and Douglas were trying for their respective parties to win control of the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. The debates previewed the issues that Lincoln would face in the aftermath of his victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. Although Illinois was a [[slave and free states|free state]], the main issue discussed in all seven debates was [[slavery in the United States]].

In agreeing to the official debates, Lincoln and Douglas decided to hold one debate in each of the nine [[Illinois's congressional districts|congressional districts in Illinois]]. Because both had already spoken in two—[[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and [[Chicago]]—within a day of each other, they decided that their "joint appearances" would be held in the remaining seven districts.

{{Lincoln-Douglas debates (map)}}
The debates were held in seven towns in the state of Illinois:
* [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]] on August 21
* [[Freeport, Illinois|Freeport]] on August 27
* [[Jonesboro, Illinois|Jonesboro]] on September 15
* [[Charleston, Illinois|Charleston]] on September 18
* [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]] on October 7
* [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]] on October 13
* [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]] on October 15

The debates in Freeport, Quincy, and Alton drew especially large numbers of people from neighboring states, as the issue of slavery was of monumental importance to citizens across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, Fruits of Manifest Destiny, 1847–1852, page 163 — "As the fifties wore on, an exhaustive, exacerbating and essentially futile conflict over slavery raged to the exclusion of nearly all other topics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, Speech at New Haven, Conn., March 6, 1860 — "This question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present."&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper coverages of the debates were intense.  Major papers from Chicago sent [[Court reporter|stenographers]] to create complete texts of each debate, which newspapers across the United States reprinted in full, with some partisan edits. Newspapers that supported Douglas edited his speeches to remove any errors made by the stenographers and to correct grammatical errors, while they left Lincoln's speeches in the rough form in which they had been transcribed.  In the same way, pro-Lincoln papers edited Lincoln's speeches, but left the Douglas texts as reported.

After winning a plurality of the voters but losing in the legislature, Lincoln edited the texts of all the debates and had them published in a book.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln''. Volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread coverage of the original debates and the subsequent popularity of the book led eventually to Lincoln's nomination for [[President of the United States]] by the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago.

The format for each debate was: one candidate spoke for 60 minutes, then the other candidate spoke for 90 minutes, and then the first candidate was allowed a 30-minute "rejoinder." The candidates alternated speaking first. As the incumbent, Douglas spoke first in four of the debates.

==Background==
Stephen Douglas was first elected to the United States Senate in 1846.  In 1858, he was seeking re-election for a third term.  During his time in the Senate, the issue of slavery was raised several times, particularly with respect to the [[Compromise of 1850]].  As chairman of the committee on territories, Douglas argued for an approach to slavery termed [[popular sovereignty]]; electorates at a local level would vote whether to adopt or reject a state constitution which prohibited slavery. Decisions about whether slavery was permitted or prohibited within certain states and territories had been made previously at a federal level. Douglas was successful with passage of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] in 1854.  Abraham Lincoln, like Douglas, had also been elected to Congress in 1846.  He served one two-year term in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].  During his time in the House, Lincoln disagreed with Douglas and supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which sought to ban slavery in new territory.  Lincoln returned to politics in the 1850s to oppose the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and help develop the new Republican party.

Before the debates, Lincoln said that Douglas was encouraging his fears of [[Amalgamation (history)|amalgamation]] of the races with enough success to drive thousands of people away from the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, Notes for Speech at Chicago, February 28, 1857&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas tried to convince, especially the Democrats, that Lincoln was an abolitionist for saying that the [[American Declaration of Independence]] did apply to blacks as well as whites. Lincoln called a self-evident truth "the electric cord ... that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together" of different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/251/1003.html Speech in Reply to Senator Stephen Douglas in the Lincoln-Douglas debates of the 1858 campaign for the U.S. Senate, at Chicago, Illinois (July 10, 1858)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln argued in his [[House Divided Speech]] that Douglas was part of a conspiracy to nationalize slavery. Lincoln said that ending the [[Missouri Compromise]] ban on slavery in Kansas and Nebraska was the first step in this direction, and that the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] was another step in the direction of spreading slavery into Northern territories. Lincoln expressed the fear that the next Dred Scott decision would make Illinois a [[slave state]].&lt;ref&gt;David Herbert Donald, Lincoln, pages 206–210&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Lincoln and Douglas had opposition. Although Lincoln was a former [[Whig (United States)|Whig]], the prominent former Whig Judge [[Theophilus Lyle Dickey]] said that Lincoln was too closely tied to the abolitionists, and supported Douglas. But Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] opposed Douglas for defeating the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have made Kansas a slave state, and set up a rival National Democratic party that drew votes away from him.&lt;ref&gt;David Herbert Donald, Lincoln, pages 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;

==The debates==
[[File:Lincoln Douglas Debates 1958 issue-4c.jpg|thumb|300px|U.S. Postage, 1958 issue, commemorating the Lincoln and Douglas debates.]]
The main theme of the Lincoln–Douglas debates was slavery, particularly the issue of slavery's expansion into the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. It was Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] that repealed the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri Compromise's]] ban on slavery in the territories of [[Territory of Kansas|Kansas]] and [[Territory of Nebraska|Nebraska]], and replaced it with the doctrine of [[popular sovereignty]], which meant that the people of a territory could decide for themselves whether to allow slavery. Lincoln said that popular sovereignty would nationalize and perpetuate slavery.&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Abraham Lincoln said, "when the Judge re have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it-restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave-trade thus putting the seal of legislation against its spread. The public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. [Cries of "Yes,yes yes,no"] But lately, I think—and in this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives—lately, I think, that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery. [Loud cheers.] And while it is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South."&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas argued that both Whigs and Democrats believed in popular sovereignty and that the [[Compromise of 1850]] was an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Stephen Douglas said, "During the session of Congress of 1853–54, I introduced into the Senate of the United States a bill to organize the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska on that principle which had been adopted in the compromise measures of 1850, approved by the Whig party and the Democratic party in Illinois in 1851, and endorsed by the Whig party and the Democratic party in national convention in 1852. In order that there might be no misunderstanding in relation to the principle involved in the Kansas and Nebraska bill, I put forth the true intent and meaning of the act in these words: "It is the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the federal constitution."&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said that the national policy was to limit the spread of slavery, and mentioned (both at Jonesboro&lt;ref&gt;Third Debate: Jonesboro, Illinois, September 15, 1858 – Lincoln mentioned that Douglas' fellow Democrats had said that the policy of the framers of the Constitution was to prevent the expansion of slavery beginning with the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Lincoln used the following to prove the point:
"So again, in that same race of 1850, there was a Congressional Convention assembled at Joliet, and it nominated R. S. Molony for Congress, and unanimously adopted the following resolution:

'Resolved, that we are uncompromisingly opposed to the extension of slavery; and while we would not make such opposition a ground of interference with the interests of the States where it exists, yet we moderately but firmly insist that it is the duty of Congress to oppose its extension into Territory now free, by all means compatible with the obligations of the Constitution, and with good faith to our sister States; that these principles were recognized by the Ordinance of 1787, which received the sanction of Thomas Jefferson, who is acknowledged by all to be the great oracle and expounder of our faith.'"&lt;/ref&gt; and later in his ''[[Cooper Union Address]]'') the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which banned slavery from a large part of the modern-day [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], as an example of this policy.&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Abraham Lincoln advocated returning to the policy of preventing the expansion of slavery, putting it in "the position in which our fathers originally placed it—restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone." Lincoln expanded on this point especially in his''Cooper Union Address'', in which he argued that most of the framers of the Constitution voted to prevent slavery expansion by means of the Ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri Compromise.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compromise of 1850 allowed the territories of [[Utah Territory|Utah]] and [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] to decide for or against slavery, but it also allowed the admission of [[California]] as a free state, reduced the size of the [[slave state]] of [[Texas]] by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the [[District of Columbia]]. In return, the South got a stronger [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]] than the version mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: Fruits of Manifest Destiny 1847–1852, pages 219–345&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Douglas said that the Compromise of 1850 replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north and west of the state of [[Missouri]], Lincoln said that this was false,&lt;ref&gt;Third Debate: Jonesboro, Illinois, September 15, 1858 – Lincoln said, "When that Compromise was made it did not repeal the old Missouri Compromise. It left a region of United States territory half as large as the present territory of the United States, north of the line of [[Parallel 36°30' north|36 degrees 30 minutes]], in which slavery was prohibited by act of Congress. This compromise did not repeal that one. It did not affect or propose to repeal it. But at last it became Judge Douglas's duty, as he thought (and I find no fault with him), as Chairman of the Committee on Territories, to bring in a bill for the organization of a Territorial Government—first of one, then of two Territories north of that line. When he did so it ended in his inserting a provision substantially repealing the Missouri Compromise. That was because the Compromise of 1850 had not repealed it. And now I ask why he could not have let that compromise alone?"&lt;/ref&gt; and that Popular Sovereignty and the Dred Scott decision were a departure from the policies of the past that would nationalize slavery.&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Lincoln said, "Then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no State under the Constitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under the Constitution neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature can do it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Third Debate: Jonesboro, Illinois, September 15, 1858 – Lincoln said, "I say when this Government was first established, it was the policy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new Territories of the United States, where it had not existed. But Judge Douglas and his friends have broken up that policy, and placed it upon a new basis by which it is to become national and perpetual. All I have asked or desired any where is that it should be placed back again upon the basis that the fathers of our Government originally placed it upon. I have no doubt that it would become extinct, for all time to come, if we but readopted the policy of the fathers by restricting it to the limits it has already covered—restricting it from the new Territories." Lincoln added that Douglas "has himself been chiefly instrumental in changing the policy of the fathers."&lt;/ref&gt;

There were partisan remarks, such as Douglas' accusations that members of the "Black Republican" party,&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Stephen Douglas read articles from one Republican Party group that opposed slavery expansion and the fugitive slave law and said, "Now, gentlemen, your Black Republicans have cheered every one of those propositions, ("good and cheers") and yet I venture to say that you cannot get Mr. Lincoln to come out and say that he is now in favor of each one of them. (Laughter and applause. "Hit him again.)"&lt;/ref&gt; such as Lincoln, were abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Stephen Douglas said, "Lincoln went to work to abolitionize the Old Whig party all over the State, pretending that he was then as good a Whig as ever; (laughter) and Trumbull went to work in his part of the State preaching Abolitionism in its milder and lighter form, and trying to abolitionize the Democratic party, and bring old Democrats handcuffed and bound hand and foot into the Abolition camp. ("Good," "hurrah for Douglas," and cheers.) In pursuance of the arrangement, the parties met at Springfield in October, 1854, and proclaimed their new platform. Lincoln was to bring into the Abolition camp the old line Whigs, and transfer them over to Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass, and Parson Lovejoy, who were ready to receive them and christen them in their new faith. (Laughter and cheers.) They laid down on that occasion a platform for their new Republican party, which was to be thus constructed."&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas cited as proof [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech]]&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Stephen Douglas said the following about Lincoln's ''House Divided'' Speech – Lincoln now takes his stand and proclaims his Abolition doctrines. Let me read a part of them. In his speech at Springfield to the Convention, which nominated him for the Senate, he said:

"In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure permanently half Slave and half Free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall – but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction: or its advocates will push it forward till it shall became alike lawful in all the States—old as well as new, North as well as South."&lt;/ref&gt; in which he said, "I believe this government cannot endure permanently half Slave and half Free." As Douglas said (audience response in parentheses):

{{quote|Uniformity in the local laws and institutions of the different States is neither possible or desirable. If uniformity had been adopted when the Government was established, it must inevitably have been the uniformity of slavery everywhere, or else the uniformity of negro citizenship and negro equality everywhere. ...

I ask you, are you in favor of conferring upon the negro the rights and privileges of citizenship? ("No, no.") Do you desire to strike out of our State Constitution that clause which keeps slaves and free negroes out of the State, and allow the free negroes to flow in, ("never,") and cover your prairies with black settlements? Do you desire to turn this beautiful State into a free negro colony, ("no, no,") in order that when Missouri abolishes slavery she can send one hundred thousand emancipated slaves into Illinois, to become citizens and voters, on an equality with yourselves? ("Never," "no.") If you desire negro citizenship, if you desire to allow them to come into the State and settle with the white man, if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves, and to make them eligible to office, to serve on juries, and to adjudge your rights, then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. ("Never, never.") For one, I am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form. (Cheers.) I believe this Government was made on the white basis. ("Good.") I believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity for ever, and I am in favor of confining citizenship to white men, men of European birth and descent, instead of conferring it upon negroes, Indians, and other inferior races. ("Good for you." "Douglas forever.")

Mr. Lincoln, following the example and lead of all the little Abolition orators, who go around and lecture in the basements of schools and churches, reads from the Declaration of Independence, that all men were created equal, and then asks, how can you deprive a negro of that equality which God and the Declaration of Independence awards to him? ... Now, I hold that Illinois had a right to abolish and prohibit slavery as she did, and I hold that Kentucky has the same right to continue and protect slavery that Illinois had to abolish it. I hold that New York had as much right to abolish slavery as Virginia has to continue it, and that each and every State of this Union is a sovereign power, with the right to do as it pleases upon this question of slavery, and upon all its domestic institutions. ... And why can we not adhere to the great principle of self-government, upon which our institutions were originally based. ("We can.") I believe that this new doctrine preached by Mr. Lincoln and his party will dissolve the Union if it succeeds. They are trying to array all the Northern States in one body against the South, to excite a sectional war between the free States and the slave States, in order that the one or the other may be driven to the wall.&lt;ref name="DouglasQuote"&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, Douglas quote, August 21, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Douglas also charged Lincoln with opposing the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]]'' decision because "it deprives the negro of the rights and privileges of citizenship." Lincoln responded that "the next Dred Scott decision" could allow slavery to spread into free states.&lt;ref&gt;First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858 – Abraham Lincoln said, "Then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no State under the Constitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under the Constitution neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature can do it. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing is done."&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas accused Lincoln of wanting to overthrow state laws that excluded blacks from states such as Illinois, which were popular with the northern Democrats. Lincoln did not argue for complete social equality. However, he did say Douglas ignored the basic humanity of blacks, and that slaves did have an equal right to liberty. As Lincoln said: 

{{quote|I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects—certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.&lt;ref name="LincolnQuote"&gt;Debate at Ottawa, Illinois, Lincoln quote, August 21, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
As Lincoln said: 

{{quote|This declared indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world—enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites—causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty—criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest.&lt;ref name="LincolnQuote"/&gt;}}

Lincoln said he himself did not know how emancipation should happen. He believed in colonization, but admitted that this was impractical. Without colonization he said that it would be wrong for emancipated slaves to be treated as "underlings," but that there was a large opposition to social and political equality, and that "a universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, cannot be safely disregarded."&lt;ref name="LincolnQuote"/&gt; Lincoln said that Douglas' public indifference to slavery would result in the expansion of slavery because it would mold public sentiment to accept slavery. As Lincoln said: 

{{quote|Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently he who molds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed.&lt;ref name="LincolnQuote"/&gt;}}

Lincoln said Douglas "cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted up,"&lt;ref name="LincolnQuote"/&gt; and that, in the words of [[Henry Clay]], he would "blow out the moral lights around us" and eradicate the love of liberty.

At the debate at Freeport&lt;ref&gt;Debate at Freeport, Illinois, August 27, 1858&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln forced Douglas to choose between two options, either of which would damage Douglas' popularity and chances of getting reelected. Lincoln asked Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Supreme Court's ''Dred Scott'' decision. Douglas responded that the people of a territory could keep slavery out even though the Supreme Court said that the federal government had no authority to exclude slavery, simply by refusing to pass a slave code and other legislation needed to protect slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Second Debate: Freeport, Illinois, August 27, 1858 – Douglas' stated his Freeport Doctrine as follows – "It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. (Right, right.) Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature, and if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill."&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas alienated Southerners with this [[Freeport Doctrine]], which damaged his chances of winning the Presidency in 1860. As a result, Southern politicians would use their demand for a slave code for territories such as Kansas to drive a wedge between the Northern and Southern wings of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, page 195&lt;/ref&gt; In splitting what was the majority political party in 1858 (the Democratic Party), Southerners guaranteed the election of Lincoln, the nominee of the newly formed Republican Party, in 1860.

Douglas' efforts to gain support in all sections of the country through popular sovereignty failed. By allowing slavery where the majority wanted it, he lost the support of Republicans led by Lincoln who thought Douglas was unprincipled. By defeating a pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and advocating a Freeport Doctrine to stop slavery in Kansas where the majority were anti-slavery, he lost the support of the South.

Before the debate at Charleston, Democrats held up a banner that read "Negro equality" with a picture of a white man, a negro woman and a mulatto child.&lt;ref&gt;David Herbert Donald, Lincoln, pages 220&lt;/ref&gt; At this debate Lincoln went further than before in denying the charge that he was an abolitionist, saying that:

{{quote|I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And in as much as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding is that I can just let her alone.&lt;ref&gt;Debate at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858&lt;/ref&gt; }}

While denying abolitionist tendencies was effective politics, the African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]] remarked on Lincoln's "entire freedom from popular prejudice against the colored race."&lt;ref&gt;David Herbert Donald, Lincoln, page 221&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Lincoln's denial of abolitionist tendencies, Stephen Douglas charged Lincoln with having an ally in Frederick Douglass in preaching "abolition doctrines." Stephen Douglas said that "the negro" Frederick Douglass told "all the friends of negro equality and negro citizenship to rally as one man around Abraham Lincoln." Stephen Douglas also charged Lincoln with a lack of consistency when speaking on the issue of racial equality,&lt;ref&gt;Charleston debate — Douglas said, "Their principles in the north are jet-black, in the center they are in color a decent mulatto, and in lower Egypt they are almost white. Why, I admired many of the white sentiments contained in Lincoln's speech at Jonesboro, and could not help but contrast them with the speeches of the same distinguished orator made in the northern part of the State."&lt;/ref&gt; and cited Lincoln's previous statements that the declaration that [[all men are created equal]] applies to blacks as well as whites.

Lincoln said that slavery expansion endangered the Union, and mentioned the controversies caused by it in Missouri in 1820, in the territories conquered from Mexico that led to the Compromise of 1850, and again with the [[Bleeding Kansas]] controversy over slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Third Debate: Jonesboro, Illinois, September 15, 1858 – Lincoln said, "It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican war, and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance. Now, I appeal to this audience (very few of whom are my political friends), as national men, whether we have reason to expect that the agitation in regard to this subject will cease while the causes that tend to reproduce agitation are actively at work? Will not the same cause that produced agitation in 1820, when the Missouri Compromise was formed—that which produced the agitation upon the annexation of Texas, and at other times—work out the same results always?"&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said that the crisis would be reached and passed when slavery was put "in the course of ultimate extinction."

At Galesburg,&lt;ref&gt;Debate at Galesburg, Illinois, October 7, 1858 — These quotes were originally from a speech made by Lincoln at Chicago, July 10, 1858&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas sought again to prove that Lincoln was an abolitionist with the following quotations from Lincoln:

{{quote|I should like to know, if taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop? If one man says it does not mean a negro, why may not another man say it does not mean another man? If that declaration is not the truth, let us get this statute book in which we find it and tear it out.

Let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man—this race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position, discarding our standard that we have left us. Let us discard all these things, and unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal.}}

At Alton, Lincoln tried to reconcile his statements on equality. He said that the authors of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]:

{{quote|intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal — equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ... They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all: constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, every where.&lt;ref name="Alton"&gt;Debate at Alton, Illinois, October 15, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln contrasted his support for the Declaration with opposing statements made by the Southern politician [[John C. Calhoun]] and Senator [[John Pettit]] of Indiana, who called the Declaration "a self-evident lie." Lincoln said that [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger Taney]] (in his Dred Scott decision) and Stephen Douglas were opposing [[Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson's]] self-evident truth, dehumanizing blacks and preparing the public mind to think of them as only property. Lincoln thought slavery had to be treated as a wrong, and kept from growing. As Lincoln said:

{{quote|That is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles—right and wrong—throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, "You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it." No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle.&lt;ref name="Alton"/&gt;}}

Lincoln used a number of colorful phrases in the debates, such as when he said that one argument by Douglas made a horse chestnut into a chestnut horse, and compared an evasion by Douglas to the sepia cloud from a cuttlefish. Lincoln said that Douglas' Freeport Doctrine was a do-nothing sovereignty that was "as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death."&lt;ref&gt;Debate at Quincy, Illinois, October 13, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[October surprise]] of the election was the endorsement of the Democrat Douglas by former Whig [[John J. Crittenden]]. Non-Republican former Whigs comprised the biggest block of swing voters, and Crittenden's endorsement of Douglas rather than Lincoln, also a former Whig, reduced Lincoln's chances of winning.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Guelzo, Allen C. (2008). Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates That Defined America. Pages 273–277, 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

On election day, as the districts were drawn to favor Douglas' party, the Democrats won 40 seats in the state house of Representatives, and the Republicans won 35. In the state senate, Republicans held 11 seats, and Democrats held 14. [[Stephen A. Douglas]] was reelected by the legislature, 54-46, even though Lincoln's Republicans won the popular vote with a percentage of 50.6%, or by 3,402 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|title=''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America''|year=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York, NY|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the widespread media coverage of the debates greatly raised Lincoln's national profile, making him a viable candidate for nomination as the Republican candidate in the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. He would go on to secure both the nomination and the presidency, beating Douglas (as the [[Northern Democratic (United States)|Northern Democratic]] candidate), among others, in the process.

Lincoln also went on to be in contact with editors looking to publish the debate texts. George Parsons, the Ohio Republican committee chairman, got Lincoln in touch with Ohio's main political publisher, Follett and Foster, of Columbus. They published copies of the text, and titled the book, ''Political Debates Between Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas in the Celebrated Campaign of 1858, in Illinois.'' Four printings were made, and the fourth sold 16,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|title=Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America|year=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York, NY|pages=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lincoln–Douglas debate format]] that is used in high school and college competition today is named after this series of debates. Modern presidential debates trace their roots to the Lincoln–Douglas Debates, though the format today is remarkably different from the original.

The '''Ministry of Health and Population''' is a [[Government of Nepal|governmental body]] of [[Nepal]] in charge of regulating the healthcare system and its implementation. The ministries tasks are manifold and include managing the development of the healthcare in Nepal, overseeing population policies, planning and implementation and overseeing [[List of non-governmental organizations in Nepal|non-governmental]] associated with health services in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mohp.gov.np/english/function/mohp.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103401/http://www.mohp.gov.np/english/function/mohp.php |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heath care facilities ==
The Ministry of Health and Population runs and oversees all public hospitals in Nepal. These include four Regional Hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Hospitals |url=http://www.mohp.gov.np/content/regional-hospitals |publisher=Ministry of Health &amp; Population |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 Zonal Hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zonal Hospitals |url=http://www.mohp.gov.np/content/zonal-hospitals |publisher=Ministry of Health &amp; Population |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; five [[Teaching hospital]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Teaching Hospitals |url=http://www.mohp.gov.np/content/teaching-hospitals |publisher=Ministry of Health &amp; Population |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as district hospitals and general hospitals.

==Organisational Structure==
The Department of Health Services serves under the ministry to facilitate and implement its work, mainly deliver health services and to maintain public hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Department of Health Services |url=http://mohp.gov.np/content/department-of-health-services |publisher=Ministry of Health &amp; Population |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, two other departments also work under and with the ministry:

==Former Ministers of Minister of Health and Population==
This is a list of former Minister of Health and Population since the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2013|Nepalese Constituent Assembly election in 2013]]. The name/portfolio of the ministry was adjusted several times, as the term ''population'' was dropped from the official name from 2015 to 2018.

The '''Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR)''' is the [[Politics of Iraq|Iraq government]] [[government agency|agency]] responsible for higher education and scientific research. It monitors the work of universities and allocates their budgets. It is also responsible for the sponsorship of Iraqi students to study in overseas universities in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and other countries, and has consulates in those places as well.

'''Mutual assured destruction''' or '''mutually assured destruction''' ('''MAD''') is a [[doctrine]] of military [[strategy]] and [[national security|national security policy]] in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapon]]s by two or more opposing sides would cause the [[nuclear holocaust|complete annihilation]] of both the attacker and the defender (see [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] and [[second strike]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm Mutual Assured Destruction]; Col. Alan J. Parrington, USAF, [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html Mutually Assured Destruction Revisited, Strategic Doctrine in Question] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620055606/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html |date=2015-06-20 }}, Airpower Journal, Winter 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theory of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]], which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of [[Nash equilibrium]] in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

==Theory==
{{more footnotes|date=October 2013}}
Under MAD, [[Deterrence theory|each side has enough nuclear weaponry to destroy the other side]] and that either side, if attacked for any reason by the other, would retaliate with equal or greater force. The expected result is an immediate, irreversible escalation of hostilities resulting in both combatants' mutual, total, and [[assured destruction]]. The doctrine requires that neither side construct shelters on a massive scale.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17026538|title=How did we forget about mutually assured destruction?|last=Castella|first=Tom de|date=2012-02-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one side constructed a similar system of shelters, it would violate the MAD doctrine and destabilize the situation, because it would not have to fear the consequences of a [[second strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Disturbing the Universe'', Chapter 13, ''The Ethics of Defense'', Basic Books, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Weapons and Hope'', Freeman Dyson, Harper Collins, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The same principle is invoked against [[missile defense]].

The doctrine further assumes that neither side will dare to launch a [[first strike]] because the other side would [[launch on warning]] (also called [[fail-deadly]]) or with surviving forces (a [[second strike]]), resulting in unacceptable losses for both parties. The payoff of the MAD doctrine was and still is expected to be a tense but stable global peace.

The primary application of this doctrine started during the [[Cold War]] (1940s to 1991), in which MAD was seen as helping to prevent any direct full-scale conflicts between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] while they engaged in smaller [[proxy war]]s around the world. It was also responsible for the [[arms race]], as both nations struggled to keep nuclear parity, or at least retain [[second-strike capability]]. Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the MAD doctrine continues to be applied.

Proponents of MAD as part of U.S. and [[USSR]] strategic doctrine believed that [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] could best be prevented if neither side could expect to survive a full-scale nuclear exchange as a functioning state. Since the credibility of the threat is critical to such assurance, each side had to invest substantial [[capital (economics)|capital]] in their nuclear arsenals even if they were not intended for use. In addition, neither side could be expected or allowed to adequately defend itself against the other's nuclear missiles.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  This led both to the hardening and diversification of nuclear delivery systems (such as nuclear [[missile silo]]s, [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, and nuclear [[bomber]]s kept at [[fail-safe]] points) and to the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]].

This MAD scenario is often referred to as [[strategic deterrence|nuclear deterrence]]. The term "deterrence" is now used in this context;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17648714|title=The Oxford English Dictionary.|date=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|others=Simpson, J.

==History==

===Pre-1945===
One of the earliest references to the concept comes from the English author [[Wilkie Collins]], writing at the time of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870: "I begin to believe in only one civilizing influence—the discovery one of these days of a destructive agent so terrible that War shall mean annihilation and men's fears will force them to keep the peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wilkiecollinssociety.org/newsletter-spring-2009/ | title=Wilkie Collins and Mutually Assured Destruction | publisher=The Wilkie Collins Society | date=Spring 2009 | accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Jordan Gatling]] patented his namesake [[Gatling gun|rotary gun]] in 1862 with the partial intention of illustrating the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wahl and Don Toppel, ''The Gatling Gun'', Arco Publishing, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 1867 invention of [[dynamite]], Alfred Nobel stated that "The day when two army corps can annihilate each other in one second, all civilized nations, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/medicaladvancesissues/a/nobelhistory.htm|title=Everything You Need to Know About the First Nobel Prizes|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Gotlib Bloch]] in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLvgtcpuJ3oC&amp;printsec=frontcover The Future of War]'', published in 1898, argued that the state could not fight a war "under modern conditions with any prospect of being able to carry that war to a conclusion by defeating its adversary by force of arms on the battlefield. No decisive war is possible that will not entail even upon the victorious Power, the destruction of its resources and the breakup of society. War has therefore become impossible, except at the price of suicide."&lt;ref&gt;tr. R. C. Long, Boston, 1914, p XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, [[Nikola Tesla]] published ''The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media'',&lt;ref&gt;Tesla, Nikola, [http://www.teslaradio.com/pages/teleforce.htm ''THE NEW ART OF PROJECTING CONCENTRATED NON-DISPERSIVE ENERGY THROUGH NATURAL MEDIA, System of Particle Acceleration for Use in National Defense]'', Circa 16 May 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; a treatise concerning [[charged particle beam]] weapons.&lt;ref name="Seifer454"&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla described his device as a "superweapon that would put an end to all war."

In March 1940, the [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]] anticipated deterrence as the principal means of combating an enemy with nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Andrew|last2=Arnold|first2=Lorna|date=2010-09-20|title=The Quirks of Nuclear Deterrence|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047117810377278|journal=International Relations|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=293–312|doi=10.1177/0047117810377278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Cold War===
[[File:Atomic bombing of Japan.jpg|thumb|right|Atomic bomb explosions over Hiroshima, Japan, 6 August 1945 (left) and over Nagasaki, Japan, 9 August 1945 (right).]]
In August 1945, the United States accepted the surrender of Japan after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its own nuclear device. At the time, both sides lacked the means to effectively use nuclear devices against each other. However, with the development of aircraft like the American [[Convair B-36]] and the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-95]], both sides were gaining a greater ability to deliver nuclear weapons into the interior of the opposing country. The official nuclear policy of the United States became one of "[[massive retaliation]]", as coined by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], which called for massive attack against the Soviet Union if they were to invade Europe, regardless of whether it was a conventional or a nuclear attack.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

By the time of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], both the United States and the Soviet Union had developed the capability of launching a nuclear-tipped missile from a submerged submarine, which completed the ''third leg'' of the ''[[nuclear triad]]'' weapons strategy necessary to fully implement the MAD doctrine. Having a three-branched nuclear capability eliminated the possibility that an enemy could destroy all of a nation's nuclear forces in a [[first strike|first-strike]] attack; this, in turn, ensured the credible threat of a devastating [[second strike|retaliatory strike]] against the aggressor, increasing a nation's [[nuclear deterrence]].&lt;ref name="NW"&gt;{{cite web |author=John Barry |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/226494 |title=Do We Still Need a Nuclear 'Triad'? |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |date=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/USNuclearDeterrence.html |title=Nuclear Stockpile |publisher=US Department of Defense |author=Office for the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters |date= |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510015329/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/USNuclearDeterrence.html |archivedate=2010-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959948,00.html |title=Toning Up the Nuclear Triad |publisher=''Time'' |date=1985-09-23 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two doomsday devices===
The [[RAND corporation]] futurist and cold war strategist [[Herman Kahn]] (1922–1982) believed that although MAD was useful as a metaphor, when pushed to its logical conclusion it became absurd. In his 1960 book ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]'' he advocated a more reasoned approach to nuclear warfare and was understood by some of his critics to be a nuclear war hawk in his writings. (He did however hold a profound belief in the possibility of success in the event of a nuclear war.) He used the concept of the [[Doomsday device|Doomsday Machine]] as an "idealized (almost caricaturized) device"&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Herman. ''On Thermonuclear War,'' Transaction Publishers, 2006. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the danger of taking MAD to its extreme. He writes, "I used to be wary of discussing the concept for fear that some colonel would get out a General Operating Requirement or Development Planning Objective for the device".&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Herman. ''On Thermonuclear War'', Transaction Publishers, 2006. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, "mutual assured destruction", was coined by Donald Brennan, a strategist working in Kahn's [[Hudson Institute]], in  1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9833320|title=Whole earth security : a geopolitics of peace|last=Daniel.|first=Deudney,|date=1983|publisher=Worldwatch Institute|year=|isbn=0916468542|location=Washington, D.C., USA|pages=80|oclc=9833320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' parodies some of Kahn's work, and the titular character makes parodic references to Kahn's research, as in this quote from the film (after the United States mistakenly launched a nuclear attack on the USSR): "Under the authority granted me as director of weapons research and development, I commissioned last year a study of this project [of a doomsday machine] by the Bland Corporation. Based on the findings of the report, my conclusion was that this idea was not a practical deterrent, for reasons which, at this moment, must be all too obvious."

Sometime in the 1980s, a second, but real, doomsday device, called [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|The Dead Hand]], entered the picture in the Soviet Union. Unlike Kahn's device, it was not based on radioactive cobalt, but it was self-activated and could not be stopped.&lt;ref name=still_alive&gt;{{Citation | url = http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-10/mf_deadhand | title = Inside the Apocalyptic Soviet Doomsday Machine | first = Nicholas | last = Thompson | publisher = Wired Magazine | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | date = 21 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1955, the United States [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) kept one-third of its bombers on alert, with crews ready to take off within fifteen minutes and fly to designated targets inside the [[Soviet Union]] and destroy them with nuclear bombs in the event of a Soviet first-strike attack on the United States. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy increased funding for this program and raised the commitment to 50 percent of SAC aircraft.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

During periods of increased tension in the early 1960s, SAC kept part of its B-52 fleet airborne at all times, to allow an extremely fast retaliatory strike against the Soviet Union in the event of a surprise attack on the United States. This program continued until 1969. Between 1954 and 1992, bomber wings had approximately one-third of their assigned aircraft on quick reaction ground alert and were able to take off within a few minutes.{{citation needed |date=October 2017}} SAC also maintained the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP, pronounced "kneecap"), also known as "Looking Glass," which consisted of several EC-135s, one of which was airborne at all times from 1961 through 1990.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} During the [[Cuban missile crisis]] the bombers were dispersed to several different airfields, and also were sometimes airborne. For example, some were sent to [[Wright Patterson]], which normally did not have B-52s.{{citation needed |date=October 2017}}

During the height of the tensions between the US and the USSR in the 1960s, two popular films were made dealing with what could go terribly wrong with the policy of keeping nuclear-bomb carrying airplanes at the ready: ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tvovermind.com/movies/50-years-later-2001-a-space-odyssey-is-still-an-unparalleled-marvel-on-the-big-screen |title=50 Years Later, ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ Is Still an Unparalleled Marvel on the Big Screen |date=2018-08-31 |work=TVOvermind |access-date=2018-09-15 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gerald-hirschfeld-dead-young-frankenstein-fail-safe-cinematographer-was-95-977763 |title=Gerald Hirschfeld, Cinematographer on 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Fail-Safe,' Dies at 95 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2018-09-15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retaliation capability (second strike)===
{{see also|Second strike|Duck and Cover}}
[[File:Robert McNamara official portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Robert McNamara]]]]
The strategy of MAD was fully declared in the early 1960s, primarily by United States Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]]. In McNamara's formulation there was the very real danger that a nation with nuclear weapons could attempt to eliminate another nation's retaliatory forces with a surprise, devastating first strike and theoretically "win" a nuclear war relatively unharmed. True second-strike capability could be achieved only when a nation had a ''guaranteed'' ability to fully retaliate after a first-strike attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The United States had achieved an early form of second-strike capability by fielding continual patrols of strategic nuclear bombers, with a large number of planes always in the air, on their way to or from [[Fail-Safe (novel)#Explanation of the .22Fail Safe.22 title|fail-safe points]] close to the borders of the Soviet Union. This meant the United States could still retaliate, even after a devastating first-strike attack. The tactic was expensive and problematic because of the high cost of keeping enough planes in the air at all times and the possibility they would be shot down by Soviet [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]]s before reaching their targets. In addition, as the idea of a [[missile gap]] existing between the US and the Soviet Union developed, there was increasing priority being given to [[ICBM]]s over bombers.

It was only with the advent of [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, starting with the [[George Washington class submarine|''George Washington'' class]] in 1959, that a genuine [[Survivability|survivable]] nuclear force became possible and a retaliatory second strike capability guaranteed.

The deployment of fleets of ballistic missile submarines established a guaranteed second-strike capability because of their stealth and by the number fielded by each Cold War adversary—it was highly unlikely that all of them could be targeted and preemptively destroyed (in contrast to, for example, a missile silo with a fixed location that could be targeted during a first strike). Given their long range, high [[survivability]] and ability to carry many medium- and long-range nuclear missiles, submarines were credible and effective means for full-scale retaliation even after a massive first strike.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

This deterrence strategy and program has continued into the 21st century, with nuclear submarines carrying [[Trident II]] ballistic missiles as one leg of the U.S. [[strategic deterrence|strategic nuclear deterrent]] and as the sole deterrent of the United Kingdom. The USA's other such deterrent comprises the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM)s on alert in the continental United States. Ballistic missile submarines are also operated by the navies of China, France, India and Russia.

The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] anticipates a continued need for a [[Nuclear triad|sea-based strategic nuclear force]].&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/ssbn-x.htm |title=SSBN-X Future Follow-on Submarine |website=Global Security |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the current [[Ohio-class submarine|''Ohio''-class SSBNs]] are expected to be retired by 2029,&lt;ref name="GS" /&gt; meaning that a replacement platform must already be seaworthy by that time.

=== ABMs threaten MAD ===
{{main|Anti-ballistic missile}}
In the 1960s both the Soviet Union ([[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]]) and the United States ([[LIM-49 Nike Zeus]]) developed anti-ballistic missile systems. Had such systems been able to effectively defend against a retaliatory [[second strike]], MAD would have been undermined, because a superpower could launch a [[first strike]] without fearing the consequences of a retaliatory second strike. See also [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===MIRVs===
{{main|Multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle}}
{{Unreferenced Section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Peacekeeper RV vehicles.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A time exposure of seven [[multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle|MIRVs]] from [[Peacekeeper missile]] passing through clouds]]

==== MIRVs as counter against ABM ====
The [[multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle]] (MIRV) was another weapons system designed specifically to aid with the MAD nuclear deterrence doctrine. With a MIRV payload, one [[ICBM]] could hold many separate warheads. MIRVs were first created by the United States in order to counterbalance the Soviet [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]]s around Moscow. Since each defensive missile could be counted on to destroy only one offensive missile, making each offensive missile have, for example, three warheads (as with early MIRV systems) meant that three times as many defensive missiles were needed for each offensive missile. This made defending against missile attacks more costly and difficult. One of the largest U.S. MIRVed missiles, the [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper]], could hold up to 10 warheads, each with a yield of around {{convert|300|ktonTNT|PJ|lk=in}}—all together, an explosive payload equivalent to 230 [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-type]] bombs. The multiple warheads made defense untenable with the available technology, leaving the threat of retaliatory attack as the only viable defensive option. MIRVed land-based ICBMs tend to put a premium on striking first.&lt;!--For example, assume that each side has 100 missiles, with 5 warheads each, and further that each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing 2 warheads at each silo. In this case, the side that strikes first can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about 5 by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads, and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. --&gt; The [[START II]] agreement was proposed to ban this type of weapon, but never entered into force.

In the event of a Soviet conventional attack on [[Western Europe]], [[NATO]] planned to use [[tactical nuclear weapons]]. The Soviet Union countered this threat by issuing a statement that any use of nuclear weapons (tactical or otherwise) against Soviet forces would be grounds for a full-scale Soviet retaliatory strike ([[massive retaliation]]). Thus it was generally assumed that any combat in Europe would end with [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] conclusions.
{{-}}

==== Land-based MIRVed ICBMs threaten MAD ====

[[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRVed]] land-based ICBMs are generally considered suitable for a first strike (inherently [[counterforce]]) or a counterforce [[second strike]], due to:
# Their high accuracy (low [[circular error probable]]), compared to submarine-launched ballistic missiles which used to be less accurate, and more prone to defects;
# Their fast response time, compared to bombers which are considered too slow;
# Their ability to carry multiple MIRV warheads at once, useful for destroying a whole missile field or several cities with one missile.

Unlike a [[decapitation strike]] or a [[countervalue strike]], a [[counterforce strike]] might result in a potentially more constrained retaliation. Though the Minuteman III of the mid-1960s was MIRVed with three warheads, heavily MIRVed vehicles threatened to upset the balance; these included the [[SS-18 Satan]] which was deployed in 1976, and was considered to threaten [[Minuteman III]] silos, which led [[Team B|some]] [[neoconservatives]] to conclude a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] first strike was being prepared for. This led to the development of the aforementioned [[Pershing II]], the [[Trident I]] and [[Trident II]], as well as the [[MX missile]], and the [[B-1 Lancer]].

MIRVed land-based [[ICBM]]s are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. When a missile is MIRVed, it is able to carry many [[warhead]]s (up to eight in existing U.S. missiles, limited by [[New START]], though Trident II is capable of carrying up to 12&lt;ref&gt;http://missilethreat.com/missiles/ugm-133-trident-d-5/&lt;/ref&gt;) and deliver them to separate targets. If it is assumed that each side has 100 missiles, with five warheads each, and further that each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing two warheads at each silo, then the attacking side can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about five by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads, and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. As such, this type of weapon was intended to be banned under the [[START II]] agreement; however, the START II agreement was never brought into force, and neither Russia nor the United States ratified the agreement.

===Late Cold War===
The original U.S. MAD doctrine was modified on July 25, 1980, with U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s adoption of ''countervailing strategy'' with [[National security directive|Presidential Directive]]&amp;nbsp;59. According to its architect, Secretary of Defense [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], "countervailing strategy" stressed that the planned response to a Soviet attack was no longer to bomb Soviet population centers and cities primarily, but first to kill the Soviet leadership, then attack military targets, in the hope of a Soviet surrender before total destruction of the Soviet Union (and the United States). This modified version of MAD was seen as a winnable nuclear war, while still maintaining the possibility of assured destruction for at least one party. This policy was further developed by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] with the announcement of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI, nicknamed "Star Wars"), the goal of which was to develop space-based technology to destroy Soviet missiles before they reached the United States.

SDI was criticized by both the Soviets and many of America's allies (including Prime Minister of the United Kingdom [[Margaret Thatcher]]) because, were it ever operational and effective, it would have undermined the "assured destruction" required for MAD. If the United States had a guarantee against Soviet nuclear attacks, its critics argued, it would have first-strike capability, which would have been a politically and militarily destabilizing position. Critics further argued that it could trigger a new arms race, this time to develop countermeasures for SDI. Despite its promise of nuclear safety, SDI was described by many of its critics (including Soviet nuclear physicist and later peace activist [[Andrei Sakharov]]) as being even more dangerous than MAD because of these political implications. Supporters also argued that SDI could trigger a new arms race, forcing the USSR to spend an increasing proportion of GDP on defense—something which has been claimed to have been an indirect cause of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.

Proponents of [[ballistic missile defense]] (BMD) argue that MAD is exceptionally dangerous in that it essentially offers a single course of action in the event of nuclear attack: full retaliatory response. The fact that [[nuclear proliferation]] has led to an increase in the number of nations in the "[[nuclear club]]", including nations of questionable stability (e.g. [[North Korea]]), and that a nuclear nation might be hijacked by a [[Despotism|despot]] or other person or persons who might use nuclear weapons without a sane regard for the consequences, presents a strong case for proponents of BMD who seek a policy which both protects against attack, but also does not require an escalation into what might become [[World War III|global nuclear war]]. Russia continues to have a strong public distaste for Western BMD initiatives, presumably because proprietary operative BMD systems could exceed their technical and financial resources and therefore degrade their larger military standing and sense of security in a post-MAD environment. Russian refusal to accept invitations to participate in NATO BMD may be indicative of the lack of an alternative to MAD in current Russian war fighting strategy due to dilapidation of conventional forces after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]].

===Post-Cold War===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:EKV prototype launch.jpg|thumb|200px|A payload launch vehicle carrying a prototype exoatmospheric kill vehicle is launched from [[Meck Island]] at the [[Kwajalein Missile Range]] on December 3, 2001, for an intercept of a ballistic missile target over the central Pacific Ocean.]]

After the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the [[Russian Federation]] emerged as a sovereign entity encompassing most of the territory of the former USSR. Relations between the United States and Russia were, at least for a time, less tense than they had been with the Soviet Union.

The administration of U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] withdrew from the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in June 2002, claiming that the limited national missile defense system which they proposed to build was designed only to prevent [[nuclear blackmail]] by a state with limited nuclear capability and was not planned to alter the nuclear posture between Russia and the United States.

While relations have improved and an intentional nuclear exchange is more unlikely, the decay in Russian nuclear capability in the [[post-Cold War era]] may have had an effect on the continued viability of the MAD doctrine. A 2006 article by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press stated that the United States could carry out a nuclear first strike on Russia and would "have a good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base, submarine, and ICBM." This was attributed to reductions in Russian nuclear stockpiles and the increasing inefficiency and age of that which remains. Lieber and Press argued that the MAD era is coming to an end and that the United States is on the cusp of global nuclear primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Keir A. Lieber and Daryl G. Press "The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy," ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', March/April 2006, pp 42–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a follow-up article in the same publication, others criticized the analysis, including Peter Flory, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, who began by writing "The essay by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press contains so many errors, on a topic of such gravity, that a Department of Defense response is required to correct the record."&lt;ref name="PCWF"&gt;Peter C. W. Flory ''Nuclear Exchange: Does Washington Really Have (or Want) Nuclear Primacy?'' [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060901faresponse85514/peter-c-w-flory-keith-payne-pavel-podvig-alexei-arbatov-keir-a-lieber-daryl-g-press/nuclear-exchange.html Foreign Affairs, September/October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding reductions in Russian stockpiles, another response stated that "a similarly one-sided examination of [reductions in] U.S. forces would have painted a similarly dire portrait".

A situation in which the United States might actually be expected to carry out a "successful" attack is perceived as a disadvantage for both countries. The strategic balance between the United States and Russia is becoming less stable, and the objective, technical possibility of a first strike by the United States is increasing. At a time of crisis, this instability could lead to an accidental nuclear war. For example, if Russia feared a U.S. nuclear attack, Moscow might make rash moves (such as putting its forces on alert) that would provoke a U.S. preemptive strike.&lt;ref name="PCWF" /&gt;

An outline of current U.S. nuclear strategy toward both Russia and other nations was published as the document "[[Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence]]" in 1995.

==Official policy==
Whether MAD was the officially accepted doctrine of the United States military during the Cold War is largely a matter of interpretation. The [[United States Air Force]], for example, has retrospectively contended that it never advocated MAD as a sole strategy, and that this form of deterrence was seen as one of numerous options in U.S. nuclear policy.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration, RG 200, Defense Programs and Operations, LeMay's Memo to President and JCS Views, Box 83. Secret.&lt;/ref&gt; Former officers have emphasized that they never felt as limited by the logic of MAD (and were prepared to use nuclear weapons in smaller-scale situations than "assured destruction" allowed), and did not deliberately target civilian cities (though they acknowledge that the result of a "purely military" attack would certainly devastate the cities as well). However, according to a declassified 1959 [[Strategic Air Command]] study, U.S. nuclear weapons plans specifically targeted the populations of Beijing, Moscow, Leningrad, East Berlin, and Warsaw for systematic destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Strategic Air Command Declassifies Nuclear Target List from 1950s|url = http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/|website = nsarchive.gwu.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAD was implied in several U.S. policies and used in the political rhetoric of leaders in both the United States and the USSR during many periods of the Cold War.

[[File:Redwing Apache.jpg|thumb|280px|Nuclear weapon test Apache (yield {{convert|1.85|Mt(TNT)|disp=or|abbr=on}})]]

===The doctrine of nuclear deterrence depends on several challengeable assumptions===

;Second-strike capability
{{main|Second strike}}
* A first strike must not be capable of preventing a retaliatory second strike or else mutual destruction is not assured. In this case, a state would have nothing to lose with a first strike, or might try to preempt the development of an opponent's second-strike capability with a first strike (i.e., a [[decapitation strike]]). To avoid this, countries may design their nuclear forces to make decapitation strike almost impossible, by dispersing launchers over wide areas and using a combination of sea-based, air-based, underground, and mobile land-based launchers.

;Perfect detection
* No false positives (errors) in the equipment and/or procedures that must identify a launch by the other side. The implication of this is that an accident could lead to a full nuclear exchange. During the Cold War there were several instances of false positives, as in the case of [[Stanislav Petrov]].
* No possibility of camouflaging a launch. The use of [[stealth technology]] in aircraft such as the [[B-2 Spirit|B-2 bomber]] makes this assumption less likely to be fulfilled.
* No means of delivery that does not have the characteristics of a long-range missile delivery, i.e. detectable far ahead of detonation. Again, this assumption is challengeable with, for instance, stealth aircraft, but also with other means, such as smuggling weapons to the target undetected (using devices like a [[suitcase nuke]]). A close-range missile attack from a submarine would also negate this assumption, as would positioning the weapons close to the intended target.
* Perfect attribution. If there is a launch from the Sino-Russian border, it could be difficult to distinguish which nation is responsible—both [[Russia]] and [[China]] have the capability—and, hence, against which nation retaliation should occur.

;Perfect rationality
* No rogue commanders will have the ability to corrupt the launch decision process. Such an incident very nearly occurred during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] when an argument broke out aboard a nuclear-armed submarine cut off from radio communication. The second-in-command, [[Vasili Arkhipov]], refused to launch despite an order from Captain Savitsky to do so.&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cold-war/sovietsbomb.htm  |  date=13 October 2002  |first=Marion |last=Lloyd | journal=[[Boston Globe]] |title=Soviets Close to Using A-Bomb in 1962 Crisis, Forum is Told |accessdate=7 August 2012 |pages=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All leaders with launch capability care about the survival of their subjects (an extremist leader may welcome [[Armageddon]] and launch an unprovoked attack). [[Winston Churchill]] warned that any strategy will not "cover the case of lunatics or dictators in the mood of Hitler when he found himself in his final dugout."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Wolfgang Panofsky, "The Mutual-Hostage Relations between America and Russia," ''Foreign Affairs'', 52/1, (October 1973): p 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Inability to defend
* No [[fallout shelter]] networks of sufficient capacity to protect large segments of the population and/or industry.
* No development of anti-missile technology or deployment of remedial protective gear.

===Nuclear Weapons are Morally Indefensible, Oxford Union debate, 1985===
At an [[Oxford Union]] debate in 1985, debating the proposition that Nuclear Weapons are Morally Indefensible, former New Zealand Prime Minister [[David Lange]] argued "that the fear [nuclear weapons] inspire is not a justification for their existence," arguing instead that nuclear armament is irrational, morally indefensible and makes us insecure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://publicaddress.net/great-new-zealand-argument/nuclear-weapons-are-morally-indefensible/ | title=Nuclear Weapons are Morally Indefensible | publisher=Public Address | date=14 October 2004 | accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://publicaddress.net/great-new-zealand-argument/nuclear-weapons-are-morally-indefensible/ | title=Nuclear Weapons are Morally Indefensible (Audio) | publisher=Public Address | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is, Mr President, a quality of irrationality about nuclear weapons which does not sit well with good intentions. A system of defence serves its purpose if it guarantees the security of those it protects. A system of nuclear defence guarantees only insecurity. The means of defence terrorise as much as the threat of attack.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''National Association of Manufacturers''' ('''NAM''') is an [[advocacy group]] headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States, with additional offices across the country. It is the nation's largest manufacturing industrial trade association, representing 14,000 small and large manufacturing companies in every industrial sector and in all 50 states.&lt;ref name="nam.org"&gt;[http://www.nam.org/About-Us/About-the-NAM/US-Manufacturers-Association.aspx About the NAM - National Association of Manufacturers]&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Timmons has led the organization as President and CEO since 2011.

A 2018 article by Business Insider described the NAM as "a behemoth in the US capital, receiving unfettered access to the White House and top lawmakers on Capitol Hill."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/national-association-of-manufacturers-have-exploded-in-the-trump-era-2018-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady commented that passage of the [[Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] would not have happened without leadership from the National Association of Manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;https://waysandmeans.house.gov/chairman-brady-marks-six-months-of-tax-reform-wins/&lt;/ref&gt;

President Donald Trump addressed the NAM board in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/09/29/trump-national-association-of-manufacturers-full-speech.cnn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy issues==
The NAM's policy issue work is focused in the areas of labor, employment, health care, energy, corporate finance, tax, bilateral trade, multilateral trade, export controls, technology, regulatory and infrastructure policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nam.org/Issues/Manufacturing-Policy.aspx Policy Issues - National Association of Manufacturers]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization emphasizes four pillars that make America great: free enterprise, competitiveness, individual liberty, and equal opportunity. 

The NAM releases a Manufacturing Outlook Survey every quarter. As of the second quarter of 2018, according to the NAM, 95.1% of manufacturers registered a positive outlook for their company, “the highest level recorded in the survey’s 20-year history.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nam.org/outlook/&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey found that manufacturers rated “the inability to attract and retain a quality workforce” as their top concern. President Donald Trump mentioned the NAM’s survey in an event at the White House in April 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-tax-cuts-energizing-american-employers-sizes/&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAM’s Manufacturing Institute is a 501(c)3 dedicated to developing a modern manufacturing workforce to help manufacturers get skilled, qualified and productive workers to remain competitive. The Institute sponsors Manufacturing Day on the first Friday of October, a nation-wide event for manufacturers to host students, parents, and policy-leaders and “address common misperceptions about manufacturing.”

In 2017, the NAM launched the Manufacturers’ Accountability Project (MAP), a campaign run through the Manufacturers’ Center for Legal Action (MCLA) to combat frivolous, politically-motivated lawsuits against energy manufacturers. As of August 2018, three of those lawsuits have been dismissed from court.&lt;ref&gt;http://mfgaccountabilityproject.org/2018/08/08/climate-litigation-scorecard-manufacturers-3-trial-lawyers-0/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NAM, manufacturing employs nearly 12 million workers, contributes more than $2.25 trillion to the U.S. economy annually, is the largest driver of economic growth in the nation and accounts for the lion's share of private sector research and development.&lt;ref name="nam.org"/&gt;

==History==
NAM was founded by Thomas P. Egan, late President of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and head of the J.A. Fay and Egan Co., woodworking and machinery company, not long after reading an editorial in the magazine "Dixie," out of Atlanta, Georgia, during the depression of 1894.  This editorial urged the manufacturers of the time to organize and work together to improve business conditions nationally.  Under Egan's leadership, organization began, and a group was created; they called themselves the "Big 50"; he invited them, and asked them to invite others, to Cincinnati.  On Jan 25, 1895, in the Oddfellows Temple, where 583 manufacturers attended, NAM was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hoodoo-Conjuration-Witchcraft-Rootwork|last=Hyatt|first=Harry Middleton|publisher=Western Publishing, Inc., Hannibal, Mo.|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The U.S. was in the midst of a deep recession and many of the nation's manufacturers saw a strong need to export their products in other countries. One of the NAM's earliest efforts was to call for the creation of the U.S. Department of Commerce".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nam.org/About-Us/History/Landing-Page.aspx NAM website's history page]&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's first president was Thomas Dolan of Philadelphia &lt;ref&gt;American industries, Volume 13 By National Association of Manufacturers (U.S.), May 1913, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; (not, as erroneously listed in some sources, [[Samuel P. Bush]]).

The early history of NAM was marked by frank verbal attacks on labor.  In 1903, then-president [[David MacLean Parry]]&lt;ref&gt;For more on Parry and his views, see ''[[The Scarlet Empire]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; delivered a speech at its annual convention which argued that unions' goals would result in "despotism, tyranny, and slavery."  Parry advocated the establishment of a great national anti-union federation under the control of the NAM, and the NAM responded by initiating such an effort.&lt;ref&gt;George G. Suggs, Jr., ''Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners.''  Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 1972, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address at its 1911 convention, NAM president [[John Kirby, Jr.]] proclaimed, "The [[American Federation of Labor]] is engaged in an open warfare against Jesus Christ and his cause."  &lt;ref&gt;Violations of free speech and assembly and interference with rights of labor: hearings before a subcommittee, Seventy-fourth Congress, second session, on S. Res. 266, a resolution to investigate violations of the right of free speech and assembly and interference with the right of labor to organize and bargain collectively. April 10–11, 14-17, 21, 23, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAM also encouraged the creation and propagation of a network of local anti-union organizations, many of which took the name [[Citizens' Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, George G. Suggs, Jr., 1972, page 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1903 the local Citizens' Alliance groups were united by a national called the Citizens' Industrial Alliance of America.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart B.

Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1997; pg. 193, fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Papal regalia and insignia''' are the official items of attire and decoration proper to the [[Pope]] in his capacity as the head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Monarch|sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]].

== Regalia ==
The [[regalia]] of the [[Pope|papacy]] include the [[papal tiara|triregnum]], a headgear with three crowns or levels, also called the triple tiara&lt;ref name=stinger&gt;{{cite book| title=The Renaissance in Rome| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyuqCdm4SRsC&amp;pg=PA216| date=22 September 1998| first=Charles L.| last=Stinger| page=216| isbn=978-0253212085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slovak&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3orG2yZ9mBkC&amp;pg=PA285#v=onepage&amp;q=tiara&amp;f=false| page=285| title=Slovak History: Chronology &amp; Lexicon| first1=Viliam| last1=Cicaj| first2=Vladimir| last2=Seges| first3=Julius| last3=Bartl| first4=Dusan| last4=Skvarna| first5=Robert| last5=Letz| first6=Maria| last6=Kohutova| last-author-amp=yes| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers| isbn= 9780865164444| date=15 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=congar&gt;{{cite book| title=Yves Congar: Theologian of the Church| last=Flynn| first=Gabirel|  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxucHPqvy5cC&amp;pg=PA25| publisher=Peeters Publishers| date=31 December 2005| page=261| isbn=9789042916685| accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seldes&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA97| title=The Vatican: yesterday, today, tomorrow| last=Seldes| first=George| publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis| year=1934| page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=answer&gt;{{cite book| title=The Catholicism Answer Book: The 300 Most Frequently Asked Questions| date=1 January 2007| first1=Kenneth |last1=Brighenti| first2=John, Jr.| last2=Trigilio| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEmaqHANzXsC&amp;pg=PA381| page=381| isbn=978-1402208065| accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or triple crown. "Tiara" is the name of the headdress, even in the forms it had before a third crown was added to it. For several centuries, Popes wore it during processions, as when entering or leaving [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], but during liturgies they used an episcopal [[mitre]] instead. Paul VI used it on 30 June 1963 at his [[Papal Coronation|coronation]], but abandoned its use later. None of his successors have used it. On his [[coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|personal coat of arms]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] replaced the tiara with a mitre, but the tiara remains on the [[coat of arms of the Holy See]] and of [[Vatican City State]].

The [[Ring of the Fisherman]], another item of papal regalia, is a gold ring decorated with a depiction of St. Peter in a boat casting his net, with the name of the reigning Pope surrounding it. It was first mentioned in 1265 by [[Pope Clement IV]], who wrote in a letter to his nephew that Popes were accustomed to sealing public documents with a leaden "[[Papal bull|bulla]]" attached and private letters with "the seal of the Fisherman". By the fifteenth century, the Fisherman's Ring was used to seal [[Papal brief]]s. The Fisherman's Ring is placed on the newly elected Pope's finger by the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]]; on the Pope's death, the Cardinal Chamberlain used to deface and smash the Fisherman's Ring with a hammer as a symbolic representation of the end of the late Pope's authority.

Modern popes bear the [[Papal ferula]], a staff topped by a [[crucifix]], rather than a [[crozier]], a bent pastoral staff styled after a shepherd's crook. The use of the papal ferula is an ancient custom, established before the thirteenth century, though some popes since that time, notably [[Pope Leo XIII]], have used a crozier-like staff.

The use of other items of papal regalia has been discontinued, though they have not been abolished. The ''[[Sedia gestatoria]]'', a portable throne or armchair carried by twelve footmen (''palafrenieri'') in red uniforms was accompanied by two attendants bearing the ''[[flabella]]'', large ceremonial fans made of white ostrich-feathers. The ''sedia gestatoria'' was used for the Pope's solemn entrance into a church or hall and for his departure on the occasion of [[liturgy|liturgical]] celebrations such as a [[papal Mass]] and for [[Audience (head of state)|papal audiences]]. The use of the ''flabella'' was discontinued by Pope Paul VI, and that of the ''sedia gestatoria'' by [[Pope John Paul II]].

==Vestments==
[[Image:LeoXIIIcrown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pope Leo XIII]] in papal vestments (falda, [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[mantum]] and tiara).]]
The Pope wears the [[Pallium]] over his [[chasuble]] when celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. The pallium is a circular band of fabric about two inches wide, from which two twelve-inch-long pendants hang down, one in the front and one in back. It is ornamented with six small, black crosses distributed about the shoulders, breast and back, and is fixed in place by three golden pins, symbolic of the nails with which Christ was crucified. Only the pope wears the pallium by right, and he may wear it at all ecclesiastical functions without restriction. In the Latin/Western rite of the church, metropolitans (that is, archbishops who are the senior bishops of an ecclesiastical province) also wear a form of the pallium within their own province, and which they must receive from the pope, either personally or in a ceremony at which another bishop delegated by the pope presides. [[Pope Benedict XVI]], for his inauguration in 2005, introduced a special type of pallium that is worn only by the pope. The new papal pallium is based upon the earlier form of the pallium, similar to the [[omophorion]] which is still worn by [[Eastern Christian]] bishops. The papal pallium is wider and longer than the ordinary pallium, and has red crosses on it.  On the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul in 2014, Pope Francis returned to the use of the usual black pallium.
A [[vestment]] which is restricted to the pope alone is the [[Papal Fanon|Fanon]] made out of alternating silver and gold stripes. The fanon is similar to a shawl, one end of which is passed under the [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and the second over the chasuble; the pallium is then placed over the fanon. The fanon has gone out of common use, but Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI wore the fanon on a few occasions.

Prior to the liturgical reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]], there were a number of other vestments which were worn only by the pope:
*The [[Sub-cinctorium]]—a strip of embroidered fabric similar to a [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]] which was suspended from the [[cincture]]. It was embroidered with a [[Christian cross|cross]] and the ''[[Agnus Dei]]''.
*The [[Falda]]—a particular papal vestment which forms a long skirt extending beneath the hem of the [[alb]]. The skirts of the falda were so long that the pope had train-bearers both in front and in back whenever he walked.
*The [[Mantum]]—a very long [[cope]] worn only by the pope. Originally, it was red in color, but later was made to correspond to the [[liturgical colours]].
When the pope would stand on his throne or at the ''sedia gestatoria'', both the falda and the mantum would flow down to the lower steps, and had the effect of making the pope look taller than the other dignitaries present. All three of these vestments were discontinued during the reign of Pope Paul VI.
* A special [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]], much the same in form as maniples formerly worn by priests, but with intertwined red and gold threads to symbolize the union of the Eastern and Western Churches.

==Choir dress==
[[Image:Choir Dress (Pope).svg|thumb|upright|The Pope's choir dress: cassock in white, rochet, [[mozzetta]], and pectoral cross on gold and white cord.]]
When not celebrating religious services, the Pope wears a cassock. Choir dress is worn when attending—but not celebrating—services, and formal occasions, such as audiences.
The most immediately noticeable feature is a white cassock and zucchetto (skull cap). Only the Pope is permitted to wear a cassock made out of [[watered silk]]. The cassock used to have a train on it, but Pope Pius XII discontinued this custom. For convenience, the train could be folded up and fastened to the back of the cassock. He used to wear a tufted fascia (white sash-like belt fastened about the waist, the ends of which fall down past the knees and are often embroidered with the Pope's coat of arms), until Paul VI replaced it with a simpler fringed sash. Previously, the tufted fascia (terminating in gold tassels) was worn with choir dress, and the fringed fascia (terminating in a simpler gold fringe) was worn with ordinary dress.
Over his cassock the Pope will wear a lace rochet. Over the rochet is worn the red [[Papal mozzetta]], a shoulder cape that has a collar and is buttoned all the way down the front. The red color is a vestige from the days when scarlet was the Papal color (white only became associated with the papacy after the Napoleonic wars). The Papal mozzetta had a small hood on the back, which disappeared after Vatican II but has recently been restored. In wintertime, the Papal mozzetta is of red velvet trimmed with ermine (this also fell out of use after Vatican II, but Pope Benedict XVI began again to wear a winter mozzetta trimmed in ermine fur). In summer, the Papal mozzetta is of red satin. The Pope wears a pectoral cross suspended on a gold cord over the mozzetta. He may also choose to wear a red stole with gold embroidery over the mozzetta, even when he is not officiating at a service.

Traditionally during the Octave of Easter, the Pope wears the white paschal mozzetta, which is of white damask silk trimmed with white ermine. While the paschal mozzetta fell out of use during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, it was returned to use in 2008 by Pope Benedict XVI.
Since the 13th Century many Papal portraits have shown the pontiff wearing the [[camauro]], a red velvet cap which covers the ears, and is trimmed with ermine. The camauro fell out of fashion with the death of Pope John XXIII, but has recently been revived by Pope Benedict XVI.
Traditionally, he wears special red satin or velvet Papal slippers indoors, and red leather Papal shoes outdoors. The Papal shoes were traditionally red, though Pope John Paul II would sometimes wear black or brown leather shoes. Pope Benedict XVI restored the use of the traditional red Papal shoes, but Pope Francis has reverted to black shoes.

==Ordinary dress==
[[Image:BentoXVI-58-12052007.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope Benedict XVI in ordinary dress (red [[papal shoes]], white [[cassock]] with matching [[pellegrina]] and with white fringed [[Fascia (sash)|fascia]], [[pectoral cross]], and white [[zucchetto]]).]]

The pope's ordinary dress (also called house dress), which is worn for daily use outside of liturgical functions, consists of a white [[cassock]] with attached [[pellegrina]] and girded with a fringed white [[fascia (sash)|fascia]] (often with the papal coat of arms embroidered on it), a [[pectoral cross]] suspended from a gold cord, red [[papal shoes]], and a white [[zucchetto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/03/13/papal-clothing/1983263/| work=[[USA Today]]| date=14 March 2013| title=18th-century tailor shop prepares clothes for Francis| first=Eric J.| last=Lyman| accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://beaconnews.suntimes.com/news/18541547-418/like-benedict-bookstore-in-geneva-will-be-retiring-papal-figure.html| work=The Beacon News| date=28 February 2013| title=Like Benedict, bookstore will be retiring papal figure| accessdate=28 May 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524110043/http://beaconnews.suntimes.com/news/18541547-418/like-benedict-bookstore-in-geneva-will-be-retiring-papal-figure.html| archivedate=24 May 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On more formal occasions, the pope may wear a red cape similar to the [[ferraiuolo]] except for its gold decoration. Alternatively, he may wear a red cape with a shoulder cape attached. Outdoors, the pope may wear the ''[[cappello romano]]'', a wide-brimmed hat used by all grades of clergy. While most other clergy wear a black ''cappello romano'', the pope's is usually red (although it may also be white).

== Insignia ==
The insignia of the papacy includes the image of two Crossed Keys, one gold and one silver, bound with a red cord. This represents the "keys to the Kingdom of Heaven" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|16:19|KJV}}; ''cf.'' [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|22:22|KJV}}) and is in many ways the quintessential symbol of the Papacy as an institution and of its central role within the Catholic Church. Jesus's statement to [[Simon Peter]], "whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven",&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|18:18|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; is understood in Roman Catholic theology as establishing two jurisdictions, Heaven and Earth; the silver and gold keys are said to represent these two jurisdictions. The silver key symbolises the power to bind and loose on Earth, and the gold key the power to bind and loose in Heaven (another interpretation says that the silver key represents "binding" and the golden key represents "loosing").

The primary emblem of the Papacy is these two keys beneath a ''triregnum'' ([[Papal tiara]]). This symbol is used in several instances. The Pope's personal arms are surmounted by the aforementioned two keys in [[saltire]] behind the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (one key silver and one key gold, tied with a red cord), and above them the silver ''triregnum'' bearing three gold crowns and red ''infulae'' (the [[lappet]]s which hang down from the back of the tiara and fall over the shoulders when it is worn).  This tradition goes back to the 15th century, the symbolism of the [[keys of Peter]] was first used by [[Pope Nicholas V]] (elected 1447).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The latest two Popes (as of 2013; [[Benedict XVI]] and [[Pope Francis]]) have replaced the tiara with a simple mitre on which is depicted the three tiered cross of the papacy, reminiscent of the three tiers of the tiara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| quote=The Holy Father Benedict XVI decided not to include the tiara in his official personal coat of arms. He replaced it with a simple mitre which is not, therefore, surmounted by a small [[globus cruciger|globe and cross]] as was the tiara.| title=Coat of Arms of His Holiness Benedict XVI| url=http://gsearch.vatican.va/search?q=cache:5XOru23f1voJ:www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html+arms+of+benedict+xvi&amp;site=default_collection&amp;client=default_frontend&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;proxystylesheet=default_frontend&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;access=p&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1| first=Mons. Andrea Cordero| last=Lanza di Montezemolo| publisher=Vatican Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A listing of the coats of arms of the Popes can be found at: [[Papal coats of arms]].

The yellow and white flag of [[Vatican City]] also makes use of this emblem on the right hand side in the white half of the flag. The yellow and white colours were first adopted in 1808 as the flag of the personal guard of [[Pius VII]], when the other forces of what had been the Papal States were brought under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] control. The previous flag was red and gold, the traditional colours of the city of Rome. The 1808 flag was of course not that of Vatican City, which did not come into existence until 1929.

The [[coat of arms of the Holy See]] and that of Vatican City also use this papal emblem. The arms of the Holy See are [[blazon]]ed: ''gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or.'' This means: on a red field are placed two keys, crossed as in the letter X, one gold, the other silver, bound by a gold cord placed through the rings, and, above the keys, a silver (white-coloured) tiara with gold (yellow-coloured) crowns. The arms of Vatican City are identical, except that the gold and silver keys are reversed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/va2.html| title=Vatican City (Holy See)| date=4 September 2017| publisher=[[Flags of the World]]| accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;!--Myth #5 in this reference specifically contradicts this allegation--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the cord is red ("gules") and interlaced at the intersection of the two keys, as illustrated in Appendix B of the Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, 7 June 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uniroma2.it/didattica/Ecclesiastico/deposito/Leggi_Vaticane.pdf| title=All. B. Stemma Ufficiale dello Stato della Città del Vaticano| language=Italian|trans-title=Fundamental Law of the Vatican City State| accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[umbraculum]]'' (Latin form for ''little umbrella'') is a canopy or umbrella (consisting of alternating red and gold stripes, the traditional colours of the city of Rome and so, until 1808, of the papacy) whose original function was quite simply to provide shade. As it was traditionally a royal prerogative to walk beneath a canopy, [[Pope Alexander VI]] began using the ''umbraculum'' to symbolise the temporal powers of the Papacy; it was formerly carried by a man standing behind the Pope.  It featured in the former arms of the [[Papal States]]. The practice of walking with the ''umbraculum'' has been discontinued, although it continues to feature in [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] and remains the insigne of a [[basilica]], usually displayed to the right of the [[high altar|main altar]]. It is sometimes carried in processions as a sign of a basilica's dignity.  It also currently features in the [[Coat of arms]] of the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]]: because the Camerlengo administers the property of the Holy See during a [[sede vacante]], there isn't any papal insignia when there is not a Pope in office, and the umbraculum represents the powers of Holy See, which did not cease with Pope's death, since they are entrusted to the Church itself. (see figure below).

'''Paul Jennings Hill''' (February 6, 1954 – September 3, 2003) was a convicted American murderer. Hill murdered physician [[John Britton (doctor)|Dr. John Britton]] and Britton's bodyguard James Barrett in 1994, justifying his actions with his anti-abortion beliefs. Hill was sentenced to [[capital punishment in the United States|death by lethal injection]] and was executed on September 3, 2003.

==Early life==
Paul Hill was born in [[Miami, Florida]] on February 6, 1954, to Oscar Jennings Hill, an airline pilot, and his wife Louise. He was raised in [[Coral Gables]]. He was charged with assault at the age of 17, by his father, when his father attempted to get treatment for Hill's drug problem.
Hill said he experienced a [[religious conversion]] two years later in 1973, after being sent to a military school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm "Turning From 'Weapon of the Spirit' to the Shotgun"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623151437/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm# |date=2017-06-23 }}, ''Washington Post'', August 7, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Hill later enrolled in [[Belhaven University]] where he met his future wife, Karen Demuth, with whom he would have three children.

==Early career==
Hill graduated from [[Reformed Theological Seminary]], where he studied under [[Greg Bahnsen]], a founder of the right-wing [[Christian Reconstructionist]] movement.&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;''Religion in Today's World: Global Issues, Sociological Perspectives'' By Melissa M. Wilcox. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended St. Paul Presbyterian Church, which espoused [[theonomy]], a movement related to Reconstructionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm|title=WashingtonPost.com: Abortion Violence|work=washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623151437/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/hill.htm#|archive-date=2017-06-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his ordination in 1984, Hill became a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] affiliated with both the [[Presbyterian Church in America]] and the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]. He was [[excommunication#Calvin's view on excommunication|excommunicated]] in 1993 following a number of nationally televised appearances in which he claimed to be the new national spokesperson for "defensive action" [[Anti-abortion violence|against abortion providers]] and claimed a connection to the [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armyofgod.com/PaulHillWhoIs.html|title=Who Is Paul Hill?|author=Rev.

A01. August 7, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his excommunication, Hill supported his family with a franchised auto detailing business, cleaning and detailing automobiles. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Crime, trial, and execution==
On July 29, 1994, Hill approached the [[American Family Planning|Ladies Center]], an abortion clinic in [[Pensacola, Florida]].  When he spotted clinic doctor [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]] and his [[bodyguard]], retired [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Lieutenant Colonel James H. Barrett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jbarrett.htm Arlington National Cemetery records page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209005443/http://arlingtoncemetery.net/jbarrett.htm# |date=2013-02-09 }} James H. Barrett Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force&lt;/ref&gt; outside the clinic, he fired on both of them at close range with a [[Mossberg 500|Mossberg]] Model 500A [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[pump-action shotgun]].&lt;ref name="USvHill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/criminal-section-selected-case-summaries | title=Criminal Section Selected Case Summaries; Hate Crimes; U.S. vs. Hill | publisher=United States Department of Justice | accessdate=August 16, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825044254/http://www.justice.gov/crt/criminal-section-selected-case-summaries# | archive-date=2015-08-25 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Britton and Barrett died; Barrett's wife, June, was also wounded. Following the shots, Hill laid his shotgun on the ground and waited to be arrested.

Following his arrest, Hill was brought to trial in the Circuit Court of Florida for the First Circuit, charged with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Hill moved, successfully, to be allowed to appear [[pro se]]. i.e., he represented himself. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. Hill's motion to use the [[affirmative defense]] of justification was denied. According to Hill, his actions were a defensive act, rather than a retribution. On December 6, 1994, Hill was found guilty of the charges and was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; Appeals to the First District Court of Appeals, 656 So.2d 1271 (Fla. 1995), and subsequently to the Florida Supreme Court, 688 So.2d 901 (Fla.1996), were unsuccessful. Hill petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of [[certiorari]] (asked the Court to hear his appeal). The petition was denied. 522 U.S. 907 (1997).

The [[execution warrant]] for Hill was not signed until July 2003, at which time it was signed by Governor [[Jeb Bush]]. Hill died by [[lethal injection]] in [[Florida State Prison]] on September 3, 2003, aged 49. His last words were, "If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it. May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

Hill chose Rev. [[Donald Spitz]] as his spiritual adviser during the last week of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://pilotonline.com/news/article_c2ab92ff-58e8-5432-91d8-c0538170f65b.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925025935/https://pilotonline.com/news/article_c2ab92ff-58e8-5432-91d8-c0538170f65b.html# |archive-date=2018-09-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill was close friends with Spitz both before and after he killed Dr. John Britton and James H. Barrett. Spitz was with Hill during the last week of his life and with Hill when he was executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Spitz# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303193757/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Spitz# |archive-date=2017-03-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives and aftermath==
Prior to the murders, Hill sent two position papers to [[Christian reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]] author [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], which set out Hill's views of abortion and why he considered murder of abortionists to be warranted. The papers were followed by three additional letters to North in October 1994. North's responses, issued after the murders, comprised two letters that were made available to the public. The letters rejected and refuted Hill's theological arguments, and concluded that, "...the public will regard your dual assassination as the act of a condemned man outside of God's church and acting on his own in defiance of Bible-revealed law and therefore also God's moral law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://s155777461.onlinehome.us/docs/html/gnlg/gnlg.html ''Lone Gunners for Jesus: Letters to Paul J. Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224101646/http://s155777461.onlinehome.us/docs/html/gnlg/gnlg.html |date=2008-02-24 }} by [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] (critical response to Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill spent almost a decade in prison awaiting his execution. In a statement made before his execution, Hill's views on the murders remained unchanged; he said that he felt no [[remorse]] for his actions, and that he expected "a great reward in [[Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/hill873.htm|title=Paul Jennings Hill #873|work=clarkprosecutor.org|access-date=2007-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608031153/http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/hill873.htm#|archive-date=2007-06-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill left behind a manuscript manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armyofgod.com/PHillbookIntro.html|title=Mix My Blood with the Blood of the Unborn|author=Paul Jennings Hill|work=armyofgod.com|access-date=2006-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613033629/http://armyofgod.com/PHillbookIntro.html#|archive-date=2006-06-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which his backers promised him they would publish. Hill also encouraged others who believe abortion is an illegitimate use of lethal force to "do what you have to do to stop it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armyofgod.com/Paulhillindex.html|title=Writinigs of Paul Jennings Hill|author=Rev.

== In media ==
While in police custody, Hill told the media "Now is the time to defend the unborn as to defend a slave that's about to be murdered." Hill's purported ties to the Army of God movement as well as his life and crimes are explored in the feature length HBO Documentary film ''Soldiers in the Army of God'' (2000) directed by Marc Levin and Daphne Pinkerson as part of HBO's ''America Undercover'' Series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259587/ Soldiers in the Army of God (2000)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428090419/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259587/# |date=2018-04-28 }} released on DVD in 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''Peace of Augsburg''', also called the '''Augsburg Settlement''',&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Michael (1992). ''Early Modern Germany, 1477-1804'', MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. 59. {{ISBN|0-8122-1427-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a treaty between [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (the predecessor of Ferdinand I) and the [[Schmalkaldic League]], signed in September 1555 at the imperial city of [[Augsburg]]. It officially ended the religious struggle between the two groups and made the legal division of [[Christianity|Christendom]] permanent within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], allowing rulers to choose either [[Lutheranism]] or [[Roman Catholicism]] as the official confession of their state. [[Calvinism]] was not allowed until the [[Peace of Westphalia]].

==Overview==
The Peace established the principle ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose realm, his religion"), which allowed the princes of states within the Holy Roman Empire to adopt either [[Lutheranism]] or [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] within the domains they controlled, ultimately reaffirming their sovereignty over those domains. Subjects, citizens, or residents who did not wish to conform to the prince's choice were given a grace period in which they were free to emigrate to different regions in which their desired religion had been accepted.

Article 24 stated: "In case our subjects, whether belonging to the old religion or the [[Augsburg Confession]], should intend leaving their homes with their wives and children in order to settle in another, they shall be hindered neither in the sale of their estates after due payment of the local taxes nor injured in their honour."

Charles V had made an interim ruling, the [[Augsburg Interim]] of 1548, on the legitimacy of two religious creeds in the empire, and this was codified in law on 30 June 1548 upon the insistence of Charles V, who wanted to work out religious differences under the auspices of a general council of the Catholic Church. The Interim largely reflected principles of religious behavior in its 26 articles, although it allowed for marriage of the clergy, and the giving of both bread and wine to the laity. This led to resistance by the Protestant territories, who proclaimed their own Interim at Leipzig the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42767/Peace-of-Augsburg  here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim was overthrown in 1552 by the revolt of the Protestant elector [[Maurice of Saxony]] and his allies. In the negotiations at [[Passau]] in the summer of 1552, even the Catholic princes had called for a lasting peace, fearing the religious controversy would never be settled. The emperor, however, was unwilling to recognize the religious division in Western Christendom as permanent. This document was foreshadowed by the [[Peace of Passau]], which in 1552 gave Lutherans religious freedom after a victory by Protestant armies. Under the Passau document, Charles granted a peace only until the next imperial Diet, whose meeting was called in early 1555.

The treaty, negotiated on Charles' behalf by his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], effectively gave Lutheranism official status within the domains of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], according to the policy of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''. Knights and towns who had practiced Lutheranism for some time were exempted under the ''[[Declaratio Ferdinandei]]'', but the ''[[reservatum ecclesiasticum|Ecclesiastical reservation]]'' supposedly prevented the principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio'' from being applied if an ecclesiastical ruler converted to Lutheranism.

==Main principles==

The Peace of Augsburg contained three main principles:&lt;ref&gt;For a general discussion of the impact of the Reformation on the Holy Roman Empire, see Holborn, chapters 6–9 (pp. 123–248).&lt;/ref&gt;

#The principle of {{lang|la|[[cuius regio, eius religio]]}} ("Whose realm, his religion") provided for internal religious unity within a state: the religion of the prince became the religion of the state and all its inhabitants. Those inhabitants who could not conform to the prince's religion were allowed to leave: an innovative idea in the 16th century. This principle was discussed at length by the various delegates, who finally reached agreement on the specifics of its wording after examining the problem and the proposed solution from every possible angle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Ozment]], ''The Age of Reform 1250–1550'' (1980) p.259n13.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The second principle, called the {{lang|la|[[reservatum ecclesiasticum]]}} (ecclesiastical reservation), covered the special status of the ecclesiastical state. If the prelate of an ecclesiastic state changed his religion, the inhabitants of that state did not have to do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post, although this was not spelled out in the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Geoffrey. ''The Thirty Years' War'', p. 17. {{ISBN|0-415-12883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The third principle, known as {{lang|la|[[Declaratio Ferdinandei]]}} (Ferdinand's Declaration), exempted knights and some of the cities from the requirement of religious uniformity, if the reformed religion had been practiced there since the mid-1520s. This allowed for a few mixed cities and towns where Catholics and Lutherans had lived together. It also protected the authority of the princely families, the knights and some of the cities to determine what religious uniformity meant in their territories. Ferdinand inserted this at the last minute, on his own authority.&lt;ref&gt;Holborn, pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third principle exempted knights and some of the cities under the jurisdiction of an ecclesiastical prince if they had practiced [[Lutheranism]] for some time (Lutheranism was the only branch of Protestantism recognized under the Peace). The provision was not publicized as part of the treaty, and was kept secret for almost two decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Parker, Geoffrey]]. ''The Thirty Years' War'', 2nd Edition. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-415-12883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
The document itself had critical problems. While it gave legal basis for the practice of the Lutheran confession, it did not accept any of the Reformed traditions, such as [[Calvinism]], nor did it recognize [[Anabaptism]].  Although the Peace of Augsburg was moderately successful in relieving tension in the empire and increasing tolerance, it left important things undone.  Neither the Anabaptists nor the Calvinists were protected under the peace, so many Protestant groups living under the rule of a Lutheran prince still found themselves in danger of the charge of [[heresy]]. (Article 17: "However, all such as do not belong to the two above named religions shall not be included in the present peace but be totally excluded from it.") These minorities did not achieve any legal recognition until the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648.
The intolerance towards Calvinists caused them to take desperate measures that led to the [[Thirty Years' War]].  One of the more notable measures was the [[Defenestrations of Prague#Second Defenestration of Prague|Second Defenestration of Prague]] (1618) in which two representatives of the fiercely Catholic Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] were thrown out of a castle window in [[Prague]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Aftermath==

The principle of [[Reservatum ecclesiasticum|ecclesiastical reservation]] was tested in the [[Cologne War]] (1583-1588), which grew out of the scenario envisioned by Ferdinand when he wrote the proviso: the reigning [[Prince-Bishop]] converted to Protestantism; although he did not insist that the population convert, he placed ''Calvinism'' on a parity with Catholicism throughout the [[Electorate of Cologne]].  This in itself created a two-fold legal problem: first, Calvinism was considered a heresy; second, the Elector did not resign his [[Episcopal see|see]], which made him eligible, at least in theory, to cast a ballot for emperor.  Finally, his marriage posed a very real potential to convert the Electorate into a dynastic principality, shifting the balance of religious power in the Empire.

A side effect of the religious turmoil was Charles' decision to abdicate and divide Habsburg territory into two sections.  His brother Ferdinand ruled the Austrian lands, and Charles' fervently Catholic son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], became administrator of Spain, the Spanish Netherlands, parts of Italy, and other overseas holdings.

[[Image:wikikuva.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Riding-like sitting]]

'''Riding-like sitting''' or '''balanced sitting''' includes a [[sitting]] posture that approaches the [[neutral spine|natural resting position]]. 
A [[Saddle chair|forward sloping seat]] encourages this natural posture, which is the same as when lying on the side while sleeping. The lumbar curve is preserved, the joint angles are open, and muscles are well-balanced and relaxed. This position is exactly the same as when riding a horse: the rider sits upright and at the same time maintains a lumbar lordosis because of the downwards sloping thighs.

Riding-like sitting or balanced seating is the most suitable position for long periods of sitting. Forward sloping seats and higher desks can eliminate lower back strain and even prevent chronic [[back pain]]. It also relieves pressure on the lungs and stomach and provides greater mobility.  The advantages compared to conventional furniture in terms of pain, flexion and comfort are documented in several scientific studies starting with research by A C Mandal, MD, and recently reviewed, updated and discussed by T Mandal with several references to research and the revised European (CEN) standards for educational furniture that includes balanced seating options.

The phrase '''Stasi 2.0''' is the [[catchphrase]] of a civil rights campaign in [[Germany]].

The term originated in the [[blogosphere]], combining the name of [[East Germany]]'s former Ministry of State Security, commonly known as the "[[Stasi]]", with the concept of [[software versioning]] as used in the popular phrase "[[Web 2.0]]". The implication is that Stasi 2.0 is the modernized, updated and contemporary successor (or "version" in the software usage) of Stasi. The campaign focuses on the proposals of [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], at that time Secretary of the Interior of Germany. Schäuble then proposed a preemptive security strategy, which critics contend bears similarities to the practices of the Stasi, but using current technology. His most disputed ideas involve his proposals for [[telecommunications data retention]], his proposal to legalize military action of the [[Bundeswehr]] inside German borders, and his support for covert "online searches" of suspects' computer equipment. His latest proposal in particular has met stiff opposition from many prominent German [[netizen]]s, as well as the [[Chaos Computer Club]].

Though Schäuble claims his proposals serve to protect a "Right to Security"{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, no such right is recognized under the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The phrase Stasi 2.0 has been used by protestors criticising [[Barack Obama]] by likening him to a Stasi figure in [[The Lives of Others]] during the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] about the involvement of the [[National Security Agency]] in monitoring German communications, including those of chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].

==Criticism==
Some critics{{who|date=December 2017}} of the campaign dispute the contention that the presently proposed policies would or could lead to abuses similar to those perpetrated by the Stasi. They claim that the term is used out of proportion, and thus cheapens the historically known tangible suffering of Stasi victims. For this reason, several prominent civil rights groups{{who|date=December 2017}} have made it their official policy not to use the term, and disassociate with the campaign. Additionally, some critics{{who|date=December 2017}} claim that the ideologies targeted by Schäuble's initiatives might become more acceptable as part of the campaign, while legitimate state authority is vilified. They see any losses of privacy or freedom as acceptable [[collateral damage]], or deny that there are or would be any such losses.

One Leipzig-based shirt printing service refused at first to print the trademark image of the campaign, claiming the campaign to be libelous, but later did print it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spreadshirt.net/de/DE/Ueber-uns/Uebersicht-2525/newsId/164 Pressemeldungen - Übersicht - T-Shirts bedrucken und gestalten : Spreadshirt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] rejected the comparison between the [[National Security Administration]] and the Stasi, suggesting that the comparison trivialises what state security did to people in East Germany.

'''Sucralose''' is an artificial [[sweetener]] and [[sugar substitute]]. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body, so it is noncaloric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodinsight.org/Content/6/gestationaldiabetes.pdf|title=Gestational Diabetes and Low-Calorie Sweeteners: Answers to Common Questions|publisher=Food Insight|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], it is also known under the [[E number]] '''E955'''. It is produced by chlorination of [[sucrose]]. Sucralose is about 320 to 1,000 times [[Sweetness|sweeter]] than sucrose,&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Michael A. Friedman, Lead Deputy Commissioner for the FDA, [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/040398a.pdf Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption; Sucralose] Federal Register: 21 CFR Part 172, Docket No. 87F-0086, 3 April 1998&lt;/ref&gt; three times as sweet as both [[aspartame]] and  [[acesulfame potassium]], and twice as sweet as [[sodium saccharin]].

It is stable under heat and over a broad range of [[pH]] conditions. Therefore, it can be used in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. The commercial success of sucralose-based products stems from its favorable comparison to other low-calorie sweeteners in terms of taste, stability, and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffcr.or.jp/zaidan/FFCRHOME.nsf/pages/e-kousei-sucra A Report on Sucralose from the Food Sanitation Council], The Japan Food Chemical Research Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; Common brand names of sucralose-based sweeteners are [[Splenda]], Zerocal, Sukrana,  SucraPlus, Candys, Cukren, and Nevella. [[Canderel]] Yellow also contains sucralose, but the original Canderel and Green Canderel do not.

==Uses==

Sucralose is used as a replacement for, or in combination with, other artificial or natural sweeteners such as [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame potassium]] or [[high-fructose corn syrup]]. Sucralose is used in products such as [[candy]], breakfast bars and [[soft drink]]s. It is also used in canned fruits wherein water and sucralose take the place of much higher calorie [[corn syrup]]-based additives. Sucralose mixed with [[maltodextrin]] or [[dextrose]] (both made from corn) as bulking agents is sold internationally by [[McNeil Nutritionals]] under the Splenda brand name. In the United States and Canada, this blend is increasingly found in restaurants, in yellow packets, in contrast to the blue packets commonly used by aspartame and the pink packets used by those containing saccharin sweeteners; in Canada, though, yellow packets are also associated with the SugarTwin brand of [[cyclamate]] sweetener.

===Cooking===
Sucralose is a highly heat-stable noncaloric sweetener, allowing it to be used in many recipes with little or no [[sugar]]. It is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not [[hygroscopic]], which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350&amp;nbsp;°F or 180&amp;nbsp;°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119&amp;nbsp;°C or 246&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bannach|first=Gilbert|author2=Rafael R. Almeida |author3=Luis. G.

===Safety===
Sucralose has been accepted as safe by several national and international food safety regulatory bodies, including the FDA, [[The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives]], the [[European Union]]'s [[Scientific Committee on Food]], Health Protection Branch of [[Health and Welfare Canada]], and [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]. According to the [[Canadian Diabetes Association]], the amount of sucralose that can be consumed over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 9&amp;nbsp;mg per kg of body weight per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.diabetes.ca/files/cpg2008/cpg-2008.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Canadian Diabetes Association|title=Canadian Diabetes Association 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Diabetes in Canada|work=Canadian Journal of Diabetes|volume=32|issue=Supplement 1|page=S41|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = [[Food Chem.

"In determining the safety of sucralose, the FDA reviewed data from more than 110 studies in humans and animals. Many of the studies were designed to identify possible toxic effects, including carcinogenic, reproductive, and neurological effects.

==History==
Sucralose was discovered in 1976 by scientists from [[Tate &amp; Lyle]], working with researchers Leslie Hough and Shashikant Phadnis at [[Queen Elizabeth College]] (now part of [[King's College London]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sucralose.org/faqs/|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Sucralose |work=Sucralose|access-date=20 September 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While researching ways to use [[sucrose]] and its synthetic derivatives for industrial use, Phadnis was told to "test" a chlorinated sugar compound. Phadnis thought Hough asked him to "taste" it, so he did.&lt;ref name="Gratzer2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gratzer|first=Walter |title=Eurekas and Euphorias: The Oxford Book of Scientific Anecdotes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eTIxt6sN2oC&amp;pg=PT32|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=28 November 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280403-7|pages=32–|chapter=5. Light on sweetness: the discovery of aspartame}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the compound to be exceptionally sweet.

Tate &amp; Lyle patented the substance in 1976; as of 2008, the only remaining patents concern specific manufacturing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ap-foodtechnology.com/Processing/Tate-Lyle-loses-sucralose-patent-case | title = Tate &amp; Lyle loses sucralose patent case | publisher = ap-foodtechnology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sucralose was first approved for use in Canada in 1991. Subsequent approvals came in Australia in 1993, in New Zealand in 1996, in the United States in 1998, and in the European Union in 2004. By 2008, it had been approved in over 80 countries, including Mexico, Brazil, China, India, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splenda.com/faq/no-calorie-sweetener#what-research-has-been-conducted-to-confirm-the-safety-of-splenda%C2%AE |title=SPLENDA® Brand Sweetener FAQ: Safety &amp; Product Information: What research has been conducted to confirm the safety of SPLENDA&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; |publisher=McNeil Nutritionals, LLC |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] amended the regulations for foods to include sucralose as a "non-nutritive sweetener" in food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06p0158/06p-0158-cp00001-01-vol1.pdf | title = FDA amends regulations that include sucralose as a non-nutritive sweetener in food. | work = [[FDA Consumer]] | date =3 April 2006 | accessdate = 7 September 2007 | first = James | last = Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, Fusion Nutraceuticals launched a generic product to the market, using Tate &amp; Lyle patents.

In April 2015 [[PepsiCo]] announced that it would be moving from aspartame to sucralose for most of its diet drinks in the US,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32478203&lt;/ref&gt; due to sales of Diet Pepsi falling by more than 5% in the US.

==Production==
Sucralose is manufactured by the selective [[halogenation|chlorination]] of sucrose in a multistep [[organic synthesis|synthesis]], which substitutes three of the [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl groups]] of sucrose with [[chlorine]] atoms. This chlorination is achieved by selective [[protecting group|protection]] of a primary alcohol group, followed by chlorination of the partially [[acetylation|acetylated]] sugar with excess chlorinating agent, and then by removal of the acetyl groups to give the desired sucralose product.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Fraser-Reid, 2012, "From Sugar to Splenda: A Personal and Scientific Journey of a Carbohydrate Chemist and Expert Witness," Berlin:Springer, pp. 199-210, and ''passim'', see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3642227805], accessed 2 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5498709}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Packaging and storage==
Pure sucralose is sold in bulk, but not in quantities suitable for individual use, although some highly concentrated sucralose–water blends are available online. These concentrates contain one part sucralose for each two parts water. A quarter teaspoon of concentrate substitutes for one cup of sugar. Pure, dry sucralose undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. In solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable. Most products containing sucralose add fillers and additional sweetener to bring the product to the approximate volume and texture of an equivalent amount of sugar.

===Effect on caloric content===
Though sucralose contains no [[kilocalorie|calories]], products that contain fillers, such as maltodextrin and/or [[Glucose|dextrose]], add about 2–4 [[calorie]]s&lt;!-- or Cal --&gt; per teaspoon or individual packet, depending on the product, the fillers used, brand, and the intended use of the product.&lt;ref&gt;Filipic, Martha [http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~news/story.php?id=143 Chow Line: Sucralose sweet for calorie-counters (for 10/3/04)] Ohio State Human Nutrition article on sucralose&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) allows for any product containing fewer than five calories per serving to be labeled as "zero calories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.60|title=CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=2011-04-01|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study suggests that artificial sweeteners may not fully activate the brain's "food reward pathways" as sugar does, stating that, because sweetener does not provide full satisfaction, the user may search for, and then eat additional high-calorie foods leading to weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20589192|pmc=2892765|year=2010|author1=Yang|first1=Q|title=Gain weight by "going diet?" Artificial sweeteners and the neurobiology of sugar cravings: Neuroscience 2010|journal=The Yale journal of biology and medicine|volume=83|issue=2|pages=101–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental effects ==
According to one study, sucralose is digestible by a number of microorganisms and is broken down once released into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biodegradation of sucralose in samples of natural environments | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1993 | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 797–804 | doi = 10.1897/1552-8618(1993)12[797:BOSACC]2.0.CO;2 | author1 = Labare, Michael P | author2 = Alexander, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, measurements by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute have shown [[sewage treatment]] has little effect on sucralose, which is present in wastewater effluents at levels of several μg/l (ppb).&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturvardsverket.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:658036/FULLTEXT01.pdf Measurements of Sucralose in the Swedish Screening Program 2007, Part I; Sucralose in surface waters and STP samples]&lt;/ref&gt; No ecotoxicological effects are known at such levels, but the [[Swedish Environmental Protection Agency]] warns  a continuous increase in levels may occur if the compound is only slowly degraded in nature. When heated to very high temperatures (over 350&amp;nbsp;°C or 662&amp;nbsp;°F) in metal containers, sucralose can produce in the resulting smoke [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins]] and other [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dong|first1=Shujun|last2=Liu|first2=Guorui|last3=Hu|first3=Jicheng|last4=Zheng|first4=Minghui|title=Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans formed from sucralose at high temperatures|journal=Scientific Reports|date=15 October 2013 |volume=3|issue=|pages=2946|pid=|doi=10.1038/srep02946|pmid=24126490|pmc=3796739|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E2946D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sucralose has been detected in natural waters. Studies indicate that this has virtually no impact on the early life development of certain animal species,&lt;ref name="pmid25120258"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stoddard KI, Huggett DB | title=Early Life Stage (ELS) Toxicity of Sucralose to Fathead Minnows, Pimephales promelas. | journal=Bull.

'''''Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America''''' is a book by [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] of [[Kentucky]]. The book was released on May 26, 2015 by [[Center Street]], a main publishing division of [[Hachette Book Group USA]]. It happened to coincide with Paul's [[filibuster in the United States Senate]] of the [[PATRIOT Act]] provisions which were expected to expire at midnight on June 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/05/21/rand-pauls-new-book-sees-filibuster-lessons-in-2013-wear-sneakers/|title=Rand Paul’s New Book Sees Filibuster Lessons in 2013: Wear Sneakers|first=Janet|last=Hook|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul had previously engaged in a filibuster of the nomination off [[John O. Brennan]] as Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 2013, which led to his campaign team coining the phrase "Stand With Rand."&lt;ref&gt;http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/rand-paul-does-not-go-quietly-into-the-night/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Two-level game theory''' is a [[political theory|political model]] of international conflict resolution between states derived from [[game theory]] and originally introduced in 1988 by [[Robert Putnam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Putnam |1y=1988 |2a1=Williams |2a2=Covarrubias |2y=2009 |2p=275}}

Putnam had been involved in research around the [[G7]] summits between 1976 and 1979. However at the [[4th G7 summit|fourth summit]], held in [[Bonn]] in 1978, he observed a qualitative shift in how the [[negotiation]]s worked.

The model views international negotiations between states as consisting of simultaneous negotiations at both the intranational level (i.e. domestic) and the international level (i.e. between governments).{{sfn|Méndez|2017|p=8}} Over domestic negotiations, the chief negotiator absorbs the concern of societal actors and builds coalitions with them; at the international level, the chief negotiator seeks an agreement that is amongst the possible "wins" in his state's "win-set". Win-sets are the possible outcomes that are likely to be accepted by the domestic interest groups who either must ratify the agreement or provide some other form of government backing.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} International agreements occur when there is an overlap between the win-sets of the states involved in the international negotiations.{{sfn|Méndez|2017|pp=8–9}}

Other examples of this type of venture philanthropy are [[New Profit Inc.]] in [[Boston]], the [[Robin Hood Foundation]] in [[New York City]], [[Tipping Point Community]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], The Research Acceleration and Innovation Network (TRAIN) initiative from [[FasterCures]],&lt;ref&gt;Faster Cures May 7, 2015 [http://www.fastercures.org/newsroom/press-releases/view/20/ Press release: Venture philanthropy gains steam, pushes promising science through to patients]&lt;/ref&gt;  the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN), and the European Venture Philanthropy Association (EVPA).

===Cystic Fibrosis Foundation===
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based [[Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]], wanting to take more direct action toward finding treatments for [[cystic fibrosis]] beyond its traditional approach of funding [[basic research]] at universities, invested in a small California [[biotechnology]] firm to help fund the discovery and development of the drug that twenty years later was approved as [[Ivacaftor|Kalydeco]].&lt;ref name="Dennis_WP_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straight&gt;Beall R.

In 2001, Aurora was acquired by  [[Vertex Pharmaceuticals]],&lt;ref name=NYTwindfall/&gt; but CFF continued to fund development of the CF drug candidates.  That funding eventually grew to $150 million,&lt;ref name=NYTwindfall&gt;Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. Nov 19, 2014 [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/business/for-cystic-fibrosis-foundation-venture-yields-windfall-in-hope-and-cash.html Deal by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Raises Cash and Some Concern]&lt;/ref&gt; much of which was raised for the CFF by Joe O’Donnell, a Boston businessman whose son died of CF.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McGrory for the Boston Globe. Feb 09, 2012 [https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/02/09/joey-long-legacy/H9AdbKVYHOeUW5qYkQ9HWL/story.html Driven by loss, father inspires tireless pursuit of a cure]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Vertex started selling Kalydeco, it priced it at about $300,000 a year and promised to provide it free to anyone in the US who was uninsured or whose insurance wouldn't cover it.  It justified the price—one of the highest in the world for any drug—by explaining that on the one hand, that it can only treat about 4% of CF patients, or about 3,000 people worldwide; as it was only approved for adults and children six and older, there are only about 2,400 people eligible to receive it; with that few people, it needed a high price in order to pay for the research to create it as well as its other programs, which include a drug candidate that could treat many more people with CF.  It also pointed out the strong efficacy of the drug, and laid out the costs of managing CF that would be saved for people that the drug could treat; those costs include repeated hospitalizations and lung transplants.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;Barry Werth  for MIT Technology Review. October 22, 2013 [https://www.technologyreview.com/s/520441/a-tale-of-two-drugs/ A Tale of  Two Drugs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless the high price led to sharp criticism of Vertex and the CFF.&lt;ref name="Dennis_WP_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/in-hunt-for-new-treatments-nonprofits-are-acting-like-venture-capitalists/2015/07/02/c6094578-19b8-11e5-93b7-5eddc056ad8a_story.html |title=Are risks worth the rewards when nonprofits act like venture capitalists? |publisher=Washington Post |author=Brady Dennis |date=2 July 2015 |accessdate=19 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT/&gt; Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to the CEO of [[Vertex Pharmaceuticals]] to plead for lower prices.&lt;ref name="Vertex_letter_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2013/5/17/CFletter.pdf |format=PDF |date= 9 July 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2015 |author1=David M.

Milla |author5=Mark Pian |title=Letter to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFF made the investment in exchange for a promise of royalties paid on sales of any drug it funded that made it to market; in 2014 it sold the future royalty stream to Royalty Pharma, a [[royalty fund]] investment company, for $3.3 billion, and said that it would use the funds to invest yet more in research and clinical trials for cystic fibrosis treatments.&lt;ref name=Robb/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTwindfall/&gt;

In the course of working out the deal with Aurora in 2000, CFF included a clause in the agreement that allowed them to take control of the intellectual property if  Aurora stopped developing any drug that had been discovered.  CFF struck a similar agreement with the company, Altus Pharmaceuticals, to fund development of a recombinant enzyme that could treat pancreatic disease in people with cystic fibrosis.  When Altus reported to CFF that it didn't have funds to continue developing the drug, CFF seized control of the asset and eventually licensed it to Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which developed the drug further and was acquired by [[Eli Lilly]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alnara's Late-Stage Pancreatic Enzyme Drives Lilly Acquisition|url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/alnaras-late-stage-pancreatic-enzyme-drives-lilly-acquisition-0|work=BioWorld|date=July 6, 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ledford|first1=H|title=Charities seek cut of drug royalties.|journal=Nature|date=20 July 2011|volume=475|issue=7356|pages=275–6|pmid=21776052|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110720/full/475275a.html|doi=10.1038/475275a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WaterTruckCropped.JPG|thumb|Water from taps - supplied by a truck]]
'''Water supply''' is the provision of [[water]] by [[public utility|public utilities]], commercial organisations, community endeavors or by individuals, usually via a system of pumps and [[Water pipe|pipes]]. [[Irrigation]] is covered separately.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Global access to clean water ==
[[File:Shipot.jpg|thumb|Shipot, an underground water source in [[Ukraine]]]]
{{Further|WASH}}

In 2010, about 87% of the global population (5.9 billion people) had access to piped water supply through house connections or to an [[improved water source]] through other means than house, including [[Standpipe (street)|standpipe]]s, [[water kiosk]]s, [[spring supplies]] and protected [[water well|wells]]. However, about 13% (about 900 million people) did not have access to an improved water source and had to use unprotected wells or springs, canals, lakes or rivers for their water needs.&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF joint monitoring report 2010. (2010). Retrieved from http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/fast_facts/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

A clean water supply - in particular water that is not polluted with [[Faeces|fecal]] matter from lack of [[sanitation]] - is the single most important determinant of [[public health]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Destruction of water supply and/or sanitation infrastructure after major catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, war, etc.) poses the immediate threat of severe epidemics of [[waterborne diseases]], several of which can be life-threatening.

== Technical overview ==
{{Details|Water supply network}}
{{Details|Water treatment}}
Water supply systems get water from a variety of locations after appropriate treatment, including groundwater ([[aquifer]]s), surface water ([[lake]]s and [[river]]s), and the sea through [[desalination]]. The [[water treatment]] steps include, in most cases, [[Water purification|purification]], disinfection through [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and sometimes [[fluoridation]]. Treated water then either flows by gravity or is pumped to [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], which can be elevated such as [[water tower]]s or on the ground (for indicators related to the efficiency of drinking water distribution see [[non-revenue water]]). Once water is used, [[wastewater]] is typically discharged in a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] system and treated in a [[sewage treatment plant]] before being discharged into a river, lake or the sea or reused for [[landscaping]], [[irrigation]] or industrial use (see also [[sanitation]]).

=== Use ===
{{main|Water use}}
In the [[United States]], the typical [[single family home]] uses about {{convert|138|USgal|l|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water per day (2016 estimate) or {{convert|58.6|USgal|l|order=flip|abbr=on}} per capita per day. This includes several common [[residential water use in the U.S. and Canada|residential end use purposes]] (in decreasing order) like [[water closet|toilet]] use, [[shower]]s, [[Tap water|tap]] (faucet) use, [[washing machine]] use, [[leak]]s, other (unidentified), [[bathtub|baths]], and [[dishwasher]] use.&lt;ref&gt;William B.

[[File:Africa Watsan 7 (10665637964).jpg|thumb|upright|A young girl collects clean water from a communal water supply in [[Kawempe]], [[Uganda]].]]
Water supply [[service quality]] has many dimensions: continuity; [[water quality]]; pressure; and the degree of responsiveness of service providers to customer complaints. Many people in [[Developing country|developing countries]] receive a poor or very poor quality of service.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Continuity of supply ===
Continuity of water supply is taken for granted in most developed countries, but is a severe problem in many developing countries, where sometimes water is only provided for a few hours every day or a few days a week. It is estimated that about half of the population of developing countries receives water on an intermittent basis.

=== Water quality ===
Drinking [[water quality]] has a micro-biological and a physico-chemical dimension. There are thousands of parameters of water quality. In public water supply systems water should, at a minimum, be disinfected—most commonly through the use of [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] or the use of [[ultra violet]] light—or it may need to undergo treatment, especially in the case of [[surface water]]. For more details, please see the separate entries on [[water quality]], [[water treatment]] and [[drinking water]].

=== Water pressure ===
[[File:Model of pumping engine 023.jpg|thumb|left|1880s model of pumping engine, in [[Herne Bay Museum and Gallery|Herne Bay Museum]]]]
Water pressures vary in different locations of a distribution system. Water mains below the street may operate at higher pressures, with a [[Pressure regulator|pressure reducer]] located at each point where the water enters a building or a house. In poorly managed systems, water pressure can be so low as to result only in a trickle of water or so high that it leads to damage to plumbing fixtures and waste of water. Pressure in an urban water system is typically maintained either by a pressurised water tank serving an urban area, by pumping the water up into a [[water tower]] and relying on gravity to maintain a constant pressure in the system or solely by pumps at the [[water treatment]] plant and repeater pumping stations.

Typical UK pressures are 4–5 [[bar (unit)|bar]] (60-70 [[Pounds per square inch|PSI]]) for an urban supply.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, some people can get over eight bars or below one bar. A single iron main pipe may cross a deep valley, it will have the same nominal pressure, however each consumer will get a bit more or less because of the [[hydrostatic pressure]] (about 1 bar/10 m height). So people at the bottom of a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} hill will get about 3 bars more than those at the top.

The effective pressure also varies because of the pressure loss due to supply resistance even for the same static pressure. An urban consumer may have 5 metres of 15&amp;nbsp;mm pipe running from the iron main, so the kitchen tap flow will be fairly unrestricted, so high flow. A rural consumer may have a kilometre of rusted and [[limescale|limed]] 22&amp;nbsp;mm iron pipe, so their kitchen tap flow will be small.

For this reason, the UK domestic water system has traditionally (prior to 1989) employed a "cistern feed" system, where the incoming supply is connected to the kitchen sink and also a header/storage tank in the [[attic]]. Water can dribble into this tank through a 12&amp;nbsp;mm pipe, plus ball valve, and then supply the house on 22 or 28&amp;nbsp;mm pipes. Gravity water has a small pressure (say ¼ bar in the bathroom) so needs wide pipes to allow for higher flows. This is fine for baths and toilets but is frequently inadequate for showers.  A [[booster pump]] or a [[Hydrophore (system)|hydrophore]] is installed to increase and maintain pressure. For this reason urban houses are increasingly using mains pressure boilers (combies) which take a long time to fill a bath but suit the high back pressure of a shower.

== Institutional responsibility and governance ==
A great variety of [[institutions]] have responsibilities in water supply. A basic distinction is between institutions responsible for policy and regulation on the one hand; and institutions in charge of providing services on the other hand.

=== Policy and regulation ===
Water supply policies and regulation are usually defined by one or several Ministries, in consultation with the legislative branch. In the [[Water supply and sanitation in the United States|United States]] the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], whose administrator reports directly to the President, is responsible for water and sanitation policy and standard setting within the executive branch. In other countries responsibility for sector policy is entrusted to a Ministry of Environment (such as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Water supply and sanitation in Colombia|Colombia]]), to a Ministry of Health (such as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Panama|Panama]], [[Water supply and sanitation in Honduras|Honduras]] and [[Water supply and sanitation in Uruguay|Uruguay]]), a Ministry of Public Works (such as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Ecuador|Ecuador]] and [[Haiti]]), a Ministry of Economy (such as in German states) or a Ministry of Energy (such as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Iran|Iran]]). A few countries, such as [[Jordan]] and [[Water supply and sanitation in Bolivia|Bolivia]], even have a Ministry of Water. Often several Ministries share responsibilities for water supply. In the European Union, important policy functions have been entrusted to the [[supranational]] level. Policy and regulatory functions include the setting of tariff rules and the approval of tariff increases; setting, monitoring and enforcing norms for quality of service and environmental protection; [[benchmarking]] the performance of service providers; and reforms in the structure of institutions responsible for service provision. The distinction between policy functions and regulatory functions is not always clear-cut. In some countries they are both entrusted to Ministries, but in others regulatory functions are entrusted to agencies that are separate from Ministries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==== Regulatory agencies ====
Dozens of countries around the world have established regulatory agencies for infrastructure services, including often water supply and sanitation, in order to better protect consumers and to improve efficiency. Regulatory agencies can be entrusted with a variety of responsibilities, including in particular the approval of tariff increases and the management of sector information systems, including [[benchmarking]] systems. Sometimes they also have a mandate to settle complaints by consumers that have not been dealt with satisfactorily by service providers. These specialized entities are expected to be more competent and objective in regulating service providers than departments of government Ministries. Regulatory agencies are supposed to be autonomous from the executive branch of government, but in many countries have often not been able to exercise a great degree of autonomy. In the [[Water supply and sanitation in the United States|United States]] regulatory agencies for utilities have existed for almost a century at the level of states, and in [[Canada]] at the level of provinces. In both countries they cover several infrastructure sectors. In many U.S. states they are called [[Public Utility Commission]]s. For England and Wales, a regulatory agency for water ([[OFWAT]]) was created as part of the privatization of the water industry in 1989. In many developing countries, water regulatory agencies were created during the 1990s in parallel with efforts at increasing private sector participation. (for more details on regulatory agencies in Latin America, for example, please see [[Water and sanitation in Latin America]] and the regional association of water regulatory agencies ADERASA [http://www.aderasa.org])

Many countries do not have regulatory agencies for water. In these countries service providers are regulated directly by local government, or the national government. This is, for example, the case in the countries of continental Europe, in China and India.{{Dubious|date=June 2011}}

=== Service provision ===
Water supply service providers, which are often [[utilities]], differ from each other in terms of their geographical coverage relative to administrative boundaries; their sectoral coverage; their ownership structure; and their governance arrangements.

==== Geographical coverage ====
[[File:TVA water supply Wilder.gif|thumb|right|The sole water supply of this section of Wilder, Tennessee, 1942]]
Many water utilities provide services in a single city, town or [[municipality]]. However, in many countries municipalities have associated in regional or inter-municipal or multi-jurisdictional utilities to benefit from [[economies of scale]]. In the United States these can take the form of [[special-purpose district]]s which may have independent taxing authority. An example of a multi-jurisdictional water utility in the United States is [[District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority|WASA]], a utility serving [[Washington, DC]] and various localities in the state of [[Maryland]]. Multi-jurisdictional utilities are also common in Germany, where they are known as "Zweckverbaende", in France and in Italy.

In some federal countries, there are water service providers covering most or all cities and towns in an entire state, such as in all states of [[Brazil]] and some states in [[Mexico]] (see [[Water supply and sanitation in Mexico]]). In [[England]] and [[Wales]], water supply and sewerage is supplied almost entirely through ten regional companies. Some smaller countries, especially developed countries, have established service providers that cover the entire country or at least most of its cities and major towns. Such national service providers are especially prevalent in West Africa and Central America, but also exist, for example, in [[Tunisia]], [[Jordan]] and [[Uruguay]] (see also [[water supply and sanitation in Uruguay]]). In rural areas, where about half the world population lives, water services are often not provided by utilities, but by community-based organizations which usually cover one or sometimes several villages.

==== Sector coverage ====
Some water utilities provide only water supply services, while [[sewage|sewerage]] is under the responsibility of a different entity. This is for example the case in [[Tunisia]]. However, in most cases water utilities also provide [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and [[sewage treatment]] services. In some cities or countries utilities also distribute electricity. In a few cases such multi-utilities also collect solid waste and provide local telephone services. An example of such an integrated utility can be found in the Colombian city of [[Medellín]]. Utilities that provide water, sanitation and electricity can be found in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] (Mainova), in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] and in [[Gabon]] in West Africa. Multi-utilities provide certain benefits such as common billing and the option to cross-subsidize water services with revenues from electricity sales, if permitted by law.

==== Ownership and governance arrangements ====
Water supply providers can be either public, private, [[public-private partnership|mixed]] or cooperative. Most urban water supply services around the world are provided by public entities. As Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange (2002) stated, "The water crisis that is affecting so many people is mainly a crisis of governance — not of [[water scarcity]]." The introduction of cost-reflective tariffs together with [[cross-subsidization]] between richer and poorer consumers is an essential governance reform in order to reduce the high levels of [[Non-revenue water|Unaccounted-for Water (UAW)]] and to provide the finance needed to extend the network to those poorest households who remain unconnected. Partnership arrangements between the public and private sector can play an important role in order to achieve this objective.&lt;ref&gt;Nickson, Andrew &amp; Francey, Richard, Tapping the Market: The Challenge of Institutional Reform in the Urban Water Sector, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Private sector participation =====
An estimated 10 percent of urban water supply is provided by private or mixed public-private companies, usually under [[concession (contract)|concession]]s, [[lease]]s or [[management contract]]s. Under these arrangements the public entity that is legally responsible for service provision delegates certain or all aspects of service provision to the private service provider for a period typically ranging from 4 to 30 years. The public entity continues to own the assets. These arrangements are common in [[France]] and in [[Spain]]. Only in few parts of the world water supply systems have been completely sold to the private sector ([[privatization]]), such as in [[England]] and [[Wales]] as well as in [[Chile]]. The largest private water companies in the world are [[Suez (company)|Suez]] and [[Veolia Environnement]] from France; ''Aguas de Barcelona'' from Spain; and [[Thames Water]] from the UK, all of which are engaged internationally (see links to website of these companies below). In recent years, a number of cities have reverted to the public sector in a process called "remunicipalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=www.tni.org/tnibook/remunicipalisation |url=http://www.tni.org/tnibook/remunicipalisation |publisher=Transnational Institute/Municipal Services Project/Corporate European Observatory |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Public water service provision =====
90% of urban water supply and sanitation services are currently in the public sector. They are owned by the state or local authorities, or also by collectives or cooperatives. They run without an aim for profit but are based on the ethos of providing a common good considered to be of public interest. In most middle and low-income countries, these publicly owned and managed water providers can be inefficient as a result of political interference, leading to over-staffing and low labor productivity.
Ironically, the main losers from this institutional arrangement are the urban poor in these countries. Because they are not connected to the network, they end up paying far more per liter of water than do more well-off households connected to the network who benefit from the implicit subsidies that they receive from loss-making utilities.
The fact that we are still so far from achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation shows that public water authorities, in their current state, are not working well enough.
Yet some are being very successful and are modelling the best forms of public management. As [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]], former Japanese Prime Minister, notes: "Public water services currently provide more than 90 percent of water supply in the world. Modest improvement in public water operators will have immense impact on global provision of services."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tni.org/primer/reforming-public-water-services Reforming public water services, A beginner's guide] by the Water Justice Project on Transnational Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Governance arrangements =====
Governance arrangements for both public and private utilities can take many forms (Kurian and McCarney, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kurian |editor-first1=Mathew |editor-last2=McCarney |editor-first2=Patricia |title=Peri-urban Water and Sanitation Services: Policy, Planning and Method |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-9424-7 |pages=300 |url=https://www.springer.com/law/environmental/book/978-90-481-9424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governance arrangements define the relationship between the service provider, its owners, its customers and regulatory entities. They determine the financial autonomy of the service provider and thus its ability to maintain its assets, expand services, attract and retain qualified staff, and ultimately to provide high-quality services. Key aspects of governance arrangements are the extent to which the entity in charge of providing services is insulated from arbitrary political intervention; and whether there is an explicit mandate and political will to allow the service provider to recover all or at least most of its costs through tariffs and retain these revenues. If water supply is the responsibility of a department that is integrated in the administration of a city, town or municipality, there is a risk that tariff revenues are diverted for other purposes. In some cases, there is also a risk that staff are appointed mainly on political grounds rather than based on their professional credentials.

=== Standardization ===
International standards for water supply system are covered by International Classification of Standards (ICS) 91.140.60.&lt;ref name="91wss"&gt;{{cite web |last=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |title=91.140.60: Water supply systems |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_ics_browse?ICS1=91&amp;ICS2=140&amp;ICS3=60&amp;&amp;published=on |accessdate=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers ===
Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers ([[utilities]]) is needed, because the sector offers limited scope for direct competition ([[natural monopoly]]). Firms operating in competitive markets are under constant pressure to out perform each other. Water utilities are often sheltered from this pressure, and it frequently shows: some utilities are on a sustained improvement track, but many others keep falling further behind best practice. [[Benchmarking]] the performance of utilities allows the stimulation of competition, establish realistic targets for improvement and create pressure to catch up with better utilities. Information on benchmarks for water and sanitation utilities is provided by the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ib-net.org/ IBNET]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial aspects ==

=== Costs and financing ===
The [[cost]] of supplying water consists, to a very large extent, of fixed costs (capital costs and personnel costs) and only to a small extent of variable costs that depend on the amount of water consumed (mainly energy and chemicals). The full cost of supplying water in urban areas in developed countries is about US$1–2 per cubic meter depending on local costs and local water consumption levels. The cost of sanitation (sewerage and wastewater treatment) is another US$1–2 per cubic meter. These costs are somewhat lower in developing countries. Throughout the world, only part of these costs is usually billed to consumers, the remainder being financed through direct or indirect [[subsidies]] from local, regional or national governments (see section on tariffs).

Besides subsidies water supply investments are financed through internally generated revenues as well as through debt. Debt financing can take the form of credits from commercial Banks, credits from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks (in the case of developing countries), and [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s (in the case of some developed countries and some upper middle-income countries).

=== Tariffs ===
Almost all service providers in the world charge tariffs to recover part of their costs. According to estimates by the World Bank the average ([[mean]]) global water tariff is US$0.53 per cubic meter. In developed countries the average tariff is US$1.04, while it is only U$0.11 in the poorest developing countries. The lowest tariffs in developing countries are found in South Asia (mean of US$0.09/m3), while the highest are found in Latin America (US$0.41/m3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-electricity-and-poor-who-benefits-utility-subsidies |title=Water, Electricity and the Poor: Who Benefits from Utility Subsidies? |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=2011-10-30 |page=21 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data for 132 cities were assessed. The tariff is estimate for a consumption level of 15 cubic meters per month. Few utilities do recover all their costs. According to the same World Bank study only 30% of utilities globally, and only 50% of utilities in developed countries, generate sufficient revenue to cover operation, maintenance and partial capital costs.

According to another study undertaken in 2006 by NUS Consulting, the average water and sewerage tariff in 14 mainly [[OECD]] countries excluding [[VAT]] varied between US$0.66 per cubic meter in the United States and the equivalent of US$2.25 per cubic meter in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;NUS Consulting 2005-2006 International Water Report &amp; Cost Survey {{cite web |url=http://www.nusconsulting.com/downloads/2006WaterSurvey.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206184217/http://www.nusconsulting.com/downloads/2006WaterSurvey.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2006 |df=dmy-all}} The study covered Denmark, Germany, the UK, Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Australia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Canada and the US. The methodology for assessing tariffs may be different from the methodology of the World Bank study cited above. The report means by "costs" average tariffs and not the costs of the utility, which can be lower or higher than average tariffs&lt;/ref&gt; However, water consumption is much higher in the US than in Europe. Therefore, residential water bills may be very similar, even if the tariff per unit of consumption tends to be higher in Europe than in the US.

A typical family on the US East Coast paid between US$30 and US$70 per month for water and sewer services in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;quoted from a comparison of 24 utilities on the US East Coast in the 2005 Annual Report of DC WASA, p. 38 [http://www.dcwasa.com/news/publications/2005_AnnualReport.pdf] The comparison refers to a consumption level of 25 cubic feet per quarter&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, tariffs are usually much further from covering costs. Residential water bills for a typical consumption of 15 cubic meters per month vary between less than US$1 and US$12 per month.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, op.cit., calculated from Table 2.3 on p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Water and sanitation tariffs, which are almost always billed together, can take many different forms. Where meters are installed, tariffs are typically volumetric (per usage), sometimes combined with a small monthly fixed charge. In the absence of meters, flat or fixed rates — which are independent of actual consumption — are being charged. In developed countries, tariffs are usually the same for different categories of users and for different levels of consumption.

In developing countries, the situation is often characterized by cross-subsidies with the intent to make water more affordable for residential low-volume users that are assumed to be poor. For example, industrial and commercial users are often charged higher tariffs than public or residential users. Also, metered users are often charged higher tariffs for higher levels of consumption (increasing-block tariffs). However, cross-subsidies between residential users do not always reach their objective. Given the overall low level of water tariffs in developing countries even at higher levels of consumption, most consumption subsidies benefit the wealthier segments of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-electricity-and-poor-who-benefits-utility-subsidies |title=Water, Electricity and the Poor: Who Benefits from Utility Subsidies? |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, high industrial and commercial tariffs can provide an incentive for these users to supply water from other sources than the utility (own wells, water tankers) and thus actually erode the utility's revenue base.

== Metering ==
{{Main article|Water metering|Water meter}}
[[File:Water meter 2006.jpg|right|thumb|A typical residential water meter]]
Metering of water supply is usually motivated by one or several of four objectives: First, it provides an incentive to conserve water which protects water resources (environmental objective). Second, it can postpone costly system expansion and saves energy and chemical costs (economic objective). Third, it allows a utility to better locate distribution losses (technical objective). Fourth, it allows suppliers to charge for water based on use, which is perceived by many as the fairest way to allocate the costs of water supply to users. Metering is considered good practice in water supply and is widespread in developed countries, except for the [[United Kingdom]]. In developing countries it is estimated that half of all urban water supply systems are metered and the tendency is increasing.

[[Water meters]] are read by one of several methods:
* the water customer writes down the meter reading and mails in a postcard with this info to the water department;
* the water customer writes down the meter reading and uses a phone dial-in system to transfer this info to the water department;
* the water customer logs into the [[website]] of the water supply company, enters the address, meter ID and meter readings [http://www.waterbedrijfgroningen.nl/wag/Wbgr-internet.nsf/frameset?openFrameset&amp;submenu=Algemene%20Informatie%20meterstanden]
* a meter reader comes to the premises and enters the meter reading into a handheld computer;
* the meter reading is echoed on a display unit mounted to the outside of the premises, where a meter reader records them;
* a small radio is hooked up to the meter to automatically transmit readings to corresponding receivers in handheld computers, utility vehicles or distributed collectors
* a small computer is hooked up to the meter that can either dial out or receive automated phone calls that give the reading to a central computer system.

Most cities are increasingly installing [[Automatic Meter Reading]] (AMR) systems to prevent fraud, to lower ever-increasing labor and liability costs and to improve customer service and satisfaction.

== Health aspects ==

=== Outbreaks of diseases due to contaminated water supply ===
Water supply can get contaminated by [[pathogens]] which may originate from [[human waste|human excreta]], for example due to a break-down or design fault in the [[sanitation]] system, or by chemical contaminants.

Examples of contamination include:
* In 1854, a [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak in London's Soho district]] was identified by [[John Snow (physician)|Dr. John Snow]] as originating from contaminated water from the Broad Street pump.  This can be regarded as a founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].
* In 1980, a hepatitis A surge due to the consumption of water from a feces-contaminated well, in Pennsylvania&lt;ref name="hahs"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowen GS, McCarthy MA |title=Hepatitis A associated with a hardware store water fountain and a contaminated well in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, 1980 |journal=Am.

Throughout history, people have devised systems to make getting and using water more convenient. Living in semi-arid regions, ancient [[Persian people|Persians]] in the 1st millennium BC used [[qanat]] system to gain access to water in the mountains. Early [[Roman empire|Rome]] had indoor plumbing, meaning a system of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] and pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use.

Until the [[Enlightenment era]], little progress was made in water supply and sanitation and the engineering skills of the Romans were largely neglected throughout Europe. It was in the 18th century that a rapidly growing population fueled a boom in the establishment of private water supply networks in [[London water supply infrastructure|London]]. The [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] was established in 1723 "for the better supplying the [[City of Westminster|City]] and [[Liberty of Westminster|Liberties]] of [[Westminster]] and parts adjacent with water".&lt;ref name="London Encyclopaedia"&gt;''The London Encyclopaedia'', Ben Weinreb &amp; Christopher Hibbert, Macmillan, 1995, {{ISBN|0-333-57688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page44.asp Royal Charters, Privy Council website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824225331/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page44.asp |date=24 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other waterworks were established in London, including at [[West Ham]] in 1743, at [[Lea Bridge]] before 1767, [[Lambeth Waterworks Company]] in 1785, [[West Middlesex Waterworks Company]] in 1806&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/westmiddlesex_waterworks_a2.html UCLA Department of Epidemiology ''West Middlesex Waterworks history'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grand Junction Waterworks Company]] in 1811.&lt;ref name="ph.ucla.edu"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/lambeth_waterworks_a2.html UCLA Department of Epidemiology ''Lambeth Waterwork history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[trap (plumbing)|S-bend]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] was invented by [[Alexander Cummings]] in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by [[Thomas Crapper]] in 1880. The first screw-down [[Tap (valve)|water tap]] was patented in 1845 by Guest and Chrimes, a brass foundry in [[Rotherham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://plumber.whangarei.biz/a-little-about-tap-history/ |title=A Little About Tap History |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109195319/http://plumber.whangarei.biz/a-little-about-tap-history/ |archivedate=9 January 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Peru]], the [[Nazca culture|Nazca people]] employed a system of interconnected wells and an underground watercourse known as [[puquios]]. In [[Spain]] and [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish America]], a community operated watercourse known as an [[acequia]], combined with a simple sand filtration system, provided [[potable]] water. Beginning in the [[Imperial Roman|Roman era]] a [[water wheel]] device known as a [[noria]] supplied water to [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] and other water distribution systems in major cities in Europe and the Middle East. [[London water supply infrastructure]] developed over many centuries from early mediaeval conduits, through major 19th-century treatment works built in response to [[cholera]] threats, to modern, large-scale reservoirs.

[[Water tower]]s appeared around the late 19th century; as building height rose, and steam, electric and diesel-powered [[water pump]]s became available. As [[skyscraper]]s appeared, they needed [[rooftop water tower]]s.

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed in 1910 by [[U.S. Army]] [[Major]] (later [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]]) [[Carl Rogers Darnall]] (1867–1941), professor of chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]]. Shortly thereafter, Major (later [[Colonel|Col.]]) [[William J. L. Lyster]] (1869–1947) of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] used a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar [[Lyster Bag]] (also spelled Lister Bag). Darnall's work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water purification.

[[Desalination]] appeared during the late 20th century, and is still limited to a few areas.

During the beginning of the 21st Century, especially in areas of urban and suburban population centers, traditional centralized infrastructure have not been able to supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing demand. Among several options that have been managed are the extensive use of desalination technology, this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in "dry" countries like [[List of desalination plants in Australia|Australia]]. Decentralization of water infrastructure has grown extensively as a viable solution including [[Rainwater harvesting]] and [[Stormwater harvesting]] where policies are eventually tending towards a more rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as "Fit for Purpose". [[Emirian]]s have the highest per capita water consumption rate in the world, at 133 gallons.&lt;ref&gt;Ouis, Pernilla.

=== Water treatment ===
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]]]]
The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. The first treated public water supply in the world was installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html History of the Chelsea Waterworks]&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]] demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S.

Masellis] {{ISBN|0-387-72263-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+snow&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=0Kd7TLfkGMSOOIrs2a4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced regulation of the water supply companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf9241540370.pdf |title=Slow Sand Filtration of Water |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty [[slow sand filter]] and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in [[Lincoln, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html |title=A miracle for public health? |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5." In Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6:  Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London:Local Government Board.&lt;/ref&gt; The first continuous use of chlorine in the [[United States]] for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the [[Rockaway River]]), which served as the supply for [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Desalination]] appeared during the late 20th century, and is still limited to a few areas.

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the [[Indian Medical Service]], Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=V. B. Nesfield |title=A Chemical Method of Sterilizing Water Without Affecting its Potability |url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506%2802%2980142-1/abstract |journal=Public Health |year=1902 |pages=601–3 |doi=10.1016/s0033-3506(02)80142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. Army]] [[Major]] [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]], gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910. This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water ''purification''.

=== Women and water supply issues in developing countries ===
{{Main article|Water supply and women in developing countries}}
Water supply issues have specific adverse effects on women in developing nations. Women are often the primary family member responsible for providing water as well as collecting it. Inclusion of women in the design and implementation of water supply projects is an area of concern currently being addressed by multiple world organizations.
