'''32 Old Slip''', also known as '''One Financial Square''', is a skyscraper in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[New York City]].

==History==
The building site originally held the [[Assay office#US assay offices|United States Assay Office]], the last public gold refinery in the United States.&lt;ref name=nytimes_assay&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shenon|first1=Philip|title=U.S. Assay Office Site Sold Downtown for $27 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/nyregion/us-assay-office-site-sold-downtown-for-27-million.html|accessdate=August 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=July 21, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also melted damaged coins and incinerated damaged paper money. In 1983, the [[United States Mint]] put the {{convert|42,176|sqft|m2}} property up for auction. Beginning at US$3 million, the winning bid was made by HRO International Ltd., a New York realty developer, at $27 million. The sale established it as the most valuable government estate sold at public auction.&lt;ref name=nytimes_assay /&gt; The Assay office building was demolished in 1986.&lt;ref name=therealdeal2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pincus|first1=Adam|title=1983: Top prices for auctioned government-owned parcels|url=http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/this-month-in-real-estate-history-32/|website=therealdeal.com|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, HRO built the 36-floor building that stands today, naming the 23-43 Old Slip property One Financial Square.&lt;ref name=emporis /&gt;&lt;ref name=therealdeal1/&gt;&lt;ref name=therealdeal2 /&gt; The [[Paramount Group]] purchased the property for $135 million in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wellborn|first1=Mark|title=Sale of One Financial Square Closes for $751 M|url=http://observer.com/2007/09/sale-of-one-financial-square-closes-for-751-m/|website=[[New York Observer]]|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in August 2007 sold it to [[Beacon Capital Partners]] for $751 million,&lt;ref name=therealdeal1/&gt;&lt;ref name=therealdeal2/&gt; which is one of the largest sales on record of an office building in [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stoler|first1=Michael|title=All Signs Pointing Up in Downtown Manhattan|url=http://www.nysun.com/real-estate/all-signs-pointing-up-in-downtown-manhattan/65237/|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=[[The New York Sun]]|date=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many buildings in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012. In contrast to most in the region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less prone to flooding.&lt;ref name=crainsnewyork&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geiger|first1=Daniel|title=32 Old Slip lands second big tenant in month|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/data-lists/real-estate-deal-watch/details/12/2864362|website=crainsnewyork.com|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year the building's market value declined by 21.6% ($65.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pincus|first1=Adam|title=Goldman Sachs HQ Is Worth $176 Million Less Now Than It Was Last Year|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-hq-worth-176m-less-2013-6|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and piping systems to better ward against future storms.&lt;ref name=primary /&gt;

==Architecture==
The building is considered to be [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]]. Four sides of [[granite]] and silver-tinted glass make up the base, which give way to stepped transitions, eventually resulting in an [[octagonal]], entirely glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]].&lt;ref name=officespace_leader&gt;{{cite web|title=32 Old Slip, One Financial Square|url=http://www.nyc-officespace-leader.com/32-old-slip-one-financial-square-leases-office-space-manhattan|website=nyc-officespace-leader.com|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The floor sizes range from 23,404 to 38,750 [[Real estate|rentable square feet]], totaling 1,161,435 rentable square feet.&lt;ref name=primary /&gt; It consists of columnless interior on each floor and a {{height|ft=40}} lobby.&lt;ref name=officespace_leader /&gt; There are 26 elevators in service and a parking garage beneath the structure.&lt;ref name=primary /&gt; The ground level side and rear of the building feature a privately owned [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and urban plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privately Owned Public Space|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/priv/mndist1.shtml|website=nyc.gov|accessdate=August 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112105754/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/priv/mndist1.shtml|archivedate=November 12, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic''''' is a 2001 [[anti-consumerist]] book by John de Graaf, environmental scientist David Wann, and economist [[Thomas Naylor|Thomas H. Naylor]]. Viewing consumerism (with its accompanying overwork and dissatisfaction) as a deliberately spread disease, the book consists of three parts—symptoms, origins, and treatment. [[Affluenza]] is described as "a painful, contagious, socially transmitted condition of overload, debt, anxiety, and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Book Review: Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic (2nd Edition) | last=O'Neill | first=Barbara | journal=Journal of Financial Counseling &amp; Planning | year=2008 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=70–72 | url=http://6aa7f5c4a9901a3e1a1682793cd11f5a6b732d29.gripelements.com/pdf/11-br-affluenza-volume-19-issue-1.pdf | accessdate=2011-02-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711130521/http://6aa7f5c4a9901a3e1a1682793cd11f5a6b732d29.gripelements.com/pdf/11-br-affluenza-volume-19-issue-1.pdf | archive-date=2011-07-11 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was considered one of the eight best non-fiction books of the year by ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', and copies were given to every freshman by two universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=1576753573&amp;PG=1&amp;Type=RLMa&amp;PCS=BKP Affluenza, Second Edition]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ga3Oobd?url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=1576753573&amp;PG=1&amp;Type=RLMa&amp;PCS=BKP |date=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amazon.com]] lists 38 books citing it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Affluenza-All-Consuming-Epidemic-John-Graaf/dp/book-citations/1576751996/ref=sid_dp_av?ie=UTF8&amp;citeType=cited#cited Citations]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was highly recommended for academic and public libraries by M. Bay from Indiana University in ''Library Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Affluenza-All-Consuming-Epidemic-John-Graaf/dp/product-description/1576751511/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books Editorial Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; The Idaho State University has focused its Book Reading Project 2007 on the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.isu.edu/headlines/?p=718 ISU Reading Project ‘Affluenza’ events scheduled Sept. 18-21]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early Years ===
In 1991—1992  served in military.

In 1993 relocated to St. Petersburg, Russia.

=== Stroymontazh ===
{{Main| Stroymontazh}}
In 1994 Artur Kirilenko along with [[Sergei Polonsky]] founded construction company &lt;span&gt;[[Stroymontazh]] in St. Petersburg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title =Manhattan on the Moskva|author = BRETT FORREST|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/realestate/keymagazine/910moscow.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|work = The New York Times|date =2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained its owner and CEO between 1994 and 2010.

In 2000 Stroymontazh corporation opened a branch in Moscow, which had been headed by Sergei Polonsky. Artur Kirilenko remained a head of the St. Petersburg business of the group. In 2002 Polonsky and Kirilenko divided up the business and in 2004 Polonsky created [[Mirax Group]] on the basis of the Moscow branch end exited the St. Petersburg business of Stroymontazh: after dividing up the business Artur Kirilenko became a sole owner of Stroymontazh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Развод окончен|author = Бэла Ляув|url = http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2006/01/31/razvod-okonchen|work =Ведомости|date =2006-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Stroymontazh has delivered over 100,000 sq. meters of residential property and became the leader among the property developers in St. Petersburg.

By 2008 &lt;span&gt;[[Stroymontazh]]&lt;/span&gt; controlled about 10% of the construction market in St Petersburg in the residential sector. In 2008 the company delivered 286,000 square metres of residential property and its sales revenue exceeded 5.5 billion roubles (€150 million). Since inception the company built over 800,000 square metres of residential and 60,000 square metres of commercial property.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian Developer Stroimontage JSC Has Been Liquidated|author = Insolvency Administration Officer for JSC Stroimontage|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/russian-developer-stroymontazh-jsc-has-been-liquidated-518394751.html|work = PR Newswire|date =2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company suffered considerable losses as a result of the financial  crisis of 2008-2010 and a corporate conflict with one of its creditors ''Baltisky Bank'', which was subsequently bailed out by [[Alfa-Bank]]. in 2010 &lt;span&gt;[[Stroymontazh]]&lt;/span&gt; went into administration and in July 2015 the company was liquidated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hermitage ===
{{Main|Heritage Group}}
In 2003 Stroymontazh corporation established a French subsidiary named Stroimotage de Paris and subsequently renamed [[Hermitage Group|Hermitage]]. Emin Iskenderov has become the head of the French operations.

In 2006 Hermitage began construction of its first project Les Allees de l’Hermitage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/06/04/2006/LesEchos/19642-183-ECH_hermitage-immobilier-.htm|title=Hermitage Immobilier. - Les Echos|website=www.lesechos.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-immobilier/2007-01-17/un-russe-a-paris/1085/0/9654|title=Un russe à Paris|last=magazine|first=Le Point,|website=Le Point.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/seine-et-marne/les-russes-investissent-dans-la-pierre-a-montevrain-21-02-2007-2007787015.php|title=Les Russes investissent dans la pierre à Montévrain|last=|first=|date=|work=Le Parisien|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was successfully completed in 2008 and was named the best residential development in Ile-de-France.

This was followed by such projects as:

Avant-Seine for 300 apartments, completed in 2009;

Domaine du Lac for 1000 apartments, completed in 2009; 

Le Jardin des Muses for 200 apartments, completed in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.infosimmo.com/immobilier/immobilier-neuf/hermitage-devoile-ses-nouveaux-projets-en-france/|title=Hermitage dévoile ses nouveaux projets en France -|date=2007-07-18|work=Infosimmo|access-date=2018-08-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/immobilier/marche-immobilier/20100304.OBS3058/le-groupe-hermitage-cree-immovi.html|title=Le groupe Hermitage crée Immovi|work=L'Obs|access-date=2018-08-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2007 Hermitage started working on the project of mixed-use towers [[Hermitage Plaza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ladefense.fr/fr/tour/hermitage-plaza|title=Hermitage Plaza {{!}} Paris La Défense|website=www.ladefense.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For this project Hermitage partnered with the British architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessimmo.com/contents/1627/le-projet-hermitage-foster-vise-la-certification-breeam|title=Le projet Hermitage-Foster vise la certification BREEAM|last=Immo|first=Business|date=2009-03-18|work=Business Immo - Le site de l'immobilier d'entreprise|access-date=2018-08-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;, French conglomerate [[Bouygues]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tours jumelles à La Défense : Bouygues s'associe au groupe russe Hermitage|last=|first=|date=|work=Le Parisien|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as [[Knight Frank|Khight Frank]], [[KPMG]], [[Cushman &amp; Wakefield|Cushman&amp;Wakefield]] and others. The development project will see the construction of two skyscrapers of 86 stories and 320 meters tall, which by 2024 will become the tallest building in Western Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessimmo.com/contents/18763/tours-hermitage-plaza-le-permis-de-construire-est-delivre|title=Tours Hermitage Plaza : le permis de construire est délivré|last=Immo|first=Business|date=2012-03-06|work=Business Immo - Le site de l'immobilier d'entreprise|access-date=2018-08-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Disputes and litigation ==
At the height of the [[Great Recession]] in 2008, as the construction sector experienced severe liquidity shortage, ''Baltisky Bank'', one of Stroymontazh's creditors, initiated a series of court suits aimed at acquiring the debtor's assets at distressed value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = "Строймонтаж" расстроили крдиторы|author = Халиль Аминов, Яна Карпова|url = http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1104865|work = Коммерсант|date = 2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Artur Kirilenko acted as a guarantor for the loans and ''Baltisky Bank'' also sued him personally for 1.2 billion rubles (€33 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926024219/http://www.finansmag.ru/news/34014|title=«Финанс.» «Строймонтаж» пригрозил Балтийскому банку банкротством|date=2015-09-26|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Apart from this ''Baltisky Bank'' also initiated a criminal investigation, which was eventually dropped as the inquiry found no instances of criminal conduct or wrongdoing in Kirilenko’s actions. No signs of premeditated bankruptcy were found in the actions by Stroymontazh's management&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bn.ru/articles/2011/03/10/81080.html|title=Кириленко остался не у дел|author=Павел Никифоров|date=2011-03-10|work=БН-газета}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Transactions involving Stroymontazh's assets were pronounced fair and justified and all proceeds were used for completion of the project construction.

&lt;div&gt;In 2009 Stroimontage filed for bankruptcy, describing it as a “necessary measure”, in order to defend the interests of private investors - primarily buyers of the off-plan apartments - against the hostile actions of ''Baltisky Bank''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = "Строймонтаж" пригрозил Балтийскому банку банкротством|author = |url = http://www.finansmag.ru/news/34014|work = Финанс.-онлайн|date = 2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010 the court declared ZAO "Stroymontazh" insolvent and it went into bankruptcy administration; Artur Kirilenko resigned as the CEO of the company. By that time Stroymontazh has completed all of its construction projects and fulfilled all its obligations towards off-plan buyers and restructured its liabilities towards all other banks, including [[Bank Saint Petersburg|Bank Saint-Petersburg]], [[Sberbank of Russia|Sberbank]], Alfa-Bank, Baltinvestbank, [[Rosbank]], [[Credit Europe Bank]] and others&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;In February 2015 the Petrograd district court of St. Petersburg validated the settlement agreement between the subsidiaries of Baltisky Bank and Artur Kirilenko as guarantor of Stroymontazh. Later ''Baltisky Bank'' experienced a shareholder conflict, which resulted in it being bailed out by Alfa-Bank and criminal charges being pressed upon its former shareholder and chairman Oleg Shigaev, the initiator of Stroymontazh’s bankruptcy. Oleg Shigaev was subsequently put on a wanted list and charged with fraud and money laundering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Девелопер Артур Кириленко купил у Балтийского банка свой долг в 1 млрд рублей|author = |url = http://www.dp.ru/103w9k/|work = Деловой Петербург|date = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Экс-президент Балтийского банка заочно арестован по делу о хищении|author = |url = http://www.rapsinews.ru/incident_news/20150727/274279738.html|work = РАПСИ|date = 2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1283">'''Average Daily Rate''' (commonly referred to as ADR) is a [[Statistics|statistical]] unit that is often used in the [[lodging]] industry. The number represents the [[average]] rental income per paid occupied room in a given time period. ADR along with the property's [[occupancy]] are the foundations for the property's financial performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert|title=Hospitality Marketing Management, 5th Edition|year=2009|publisher=Wiley and Sons|pages=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADR is one of the commonly used financial indicators in [[hotel industry]] used to measure how well a [[hotel]] performs compared to its competitors and itself (year over year). It is common in the hotel industry for the ADR to gradually increase year over year bringing in more [[revenue]]. However, ADR itself is not enough to measure the performance of the hotel. One should combine ADR, occupancy and [[RevPAR]] ([[revenue]] per available room) to make a sound judgment on hotel performance.

==Formula==
ADR is calculated by dividing the rooms revenue earned by the number of rooms sold, with ''house use rooms'' and ''complimentary rooms'' excluded from the denominators.

'''Camille Cavallier''' (19 May 1854 – 10 June 1926) was a French industrialist who directed the [[Pont-à-Mousson]] iron works in [[Lorraine]] in the first quarter of the 20th century, specializing in making cast iron pipes. 
He came from a poor family but obtained a good technical education and joined the iron maker as an employee in 1874. 
He rose rapidly through the ranks, and started to acquire shares.
Soon after taking charge of the company he became the largest shareholder.
He quadrupled production in the years leading up to [[World War I]] (1914–18).
The company was devastated by the war, but Cavallier managed to bring production back up to prewar levels before his death.

For many years the family lived in the heart of the Bois-le-Prêtre, a forest about {{convert|5|km}} from the center of the town.
In October 1867 Camille was admitted as a day student to the Collège of Pont-à-Mousson, where he was an excellent student.
In 1870 he was accepted by the [[École Nationale des Arts et Métiers]] in [[Châlons-sur-Marne]].
His education was interrupted by the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870.
He returned to the college for a few months after it reopened in the spring of 1871, then entered the École des Arts et Métiers in Châlons-sur-Marne on 15 October 1871.
He graduated on 31 July 1874 as a medalist.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

[[File:Marbache.jpg|thumb| [[Marbache]] ]]
The Pont-à-Mousson company had been created in 1856 by a group of Lorraine businessmen to operate the [[Marbache]] iron mine and to use the ore to manufacture cast iron.
Xavier Rogé was the manager. In 1862 the enterprise was liquidated due to lack of sufficient capital to cover the high investment expenses.
Rogé managed to raise capital in the [[Saarland]] and restart the business, selling most of its production to forges in the Ardennes and Champagne.
In 1866 Rogé visited England and became aware of the new and promising market for cast-iron water pipes.
He focused the company on pipe production, and found a ready market when cities began to make large investment in water supply after 1871.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
He adopted the English method of casting pipes in vertical rather than horizontal moulds.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}

Camille Cavallier joined the Société de Pont-à-Mousson on 1 August 1874.
At this time the company consisted only of the factory at Pont-à-Mousson and the Marbache Iron Mine in the Nancy Basin.
The blast furnaces produced only 50,000 tons per year, of which only 12,000 tons were made into moulded products, mainly cast iron pipes.
Cavallier worked at the company for four months before being called up on 5 November 1874 for a year of military service, which he spent at Versailles in the 1st Regiment of Engineers.
He was discharged as a second lieutenant of the reserve on 1 November 1875.
He returned to the Société de Pont-à-Mousson on 2 November 1875, where he would work for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

==Growing responsibility (1875–99)==

Camille Cavallier was first assigned to the "flat" foundry, then in 1876 to the "standing" foundry dedicated to making iron gutters and pipes.
In 1877 Rogé gave him charge of the newly created commercial service.
The job was to establish regional agencies, monitor demand, watch competitors and draw up quotations for tenders.
He achieved excellent results in selling the cast iron pipes, and in 1883 won the tenders for the city of Paris.
Rogé decided to groom Cavallier as his successor, and in the 1880s Cavallier became in effect the director-general, although Rogé retained that title.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier did not limit himself to the commercial side, but played a large role in building up the company's mining assets.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
The company depended on the Marbache and [[Custines]] mines in the Nancy Basin, which delivered about 100,000 tons of ore annually.
After surveys of the [[Millery, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Millery]] region the company asked for a mining concession there, but was refused.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

[[File:Societe Anonyme des Hauts Fourneaux de Pont-a-Mousson c. 1905.jpg|thumb|Factory at Pont-à-Mousson]]
Xavier Rogé began to investigate land around [[Auboué]] near the part of Lorraine that had been annexed by Germany, and on 1 December 1882 found the upper layers of the iron oxide formation of the Briey Basin.
The survey then stopped, since the company undertaking it declared that the iron oxide formation had been completely crossed.
Cavallier thought there could be lower layers, and obtained permission to continue the survey.
In April 1883 a layer {{convert|4|m}} thick was found, and on 11 August 1884 the Société de Pont-à-Mousson was granted the concession.
The technicians said that it would be very difficult to pass through the [[overburden]] above the Auboué ore deposit due to the amount of water it contained.
Cavallier decided to proceed anyway, using the freezing method to pass through the {{convert|100|m}} aquifer layer, although this method had not been used for more than {{convert|60|m}} in the past. The gamble succeeded.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

The Pont-à-Mousson ironworks was transformed into a ''[[societe anonyme]]'' in 1886, with Xavier Rogé as its sole administrator.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=30}}
Rogé fell seriously ill in 1888 and depended more and more on Cavallier, then aged 34.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
On 17 August 1888 the company was granted the Vieux-Château concession, and on 25 May 1892 was granted the [[Belleville, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Belleville]] concession, both in the Nancy Basin.
The company acquired the [[Malzéville]] and Grande Goutte mines in the Nancy Basin.
In the 1890s the blast furnaces were fitted with [[Edward Alfred Cowper|Cowper]] [[regenerative heat exchanger]]s.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
Until 1889 Cavallier had no shares in the company.
In 1890 he acquired 100 shares, and in 1898 another 136.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}
When Rogé was sick Cavallier acted as the effective head of the company, and on 15 January 1895 he was named deputy director.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

About 1878 Camille Cavallier married Thérèse Julie Mangeot ({{circa|1855–1933}}).
Their children were Charles (1879–1930) and Jeanne Marguerite Françoise (b. {{circa|1882}}).
Around 1908 his daughter married Marcel Paul (1879–1946).{{sfn|Garric}}
[[File:Camille Cavallier meeting union leaders in 1908.jpg|thumb|Camille Cavallier meeting union leaders in 1908]]

==Chief executive: Pre-war period (1899–1914)==

On 31 January 1899 Camille Cavallier was made joint administrator, and became sole administrator when Rogé retired the next year.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=30}}
On 31 March 1899 Cavallier obtained the [[Mairy]] concession in the Briey Basin for the company.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
Since becoming head of the company Cavallier devoted a large part of his salary to buying shares in the company.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
In 1900, Cavallier held only 8% of the capital of Pont-à-Mousson, with 236 shares.
By the time of the meeting of 9 January 1901 he had become the largest shareholder with 816 shares, or 28%, due to acquisition of the shares of Xavier Rogé.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}
By 1912 he controlled 36.8%, including the shares of his family members.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}
By 1910 Cavallier was worth 10 million gold francs, a large but not huge amount.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
After World War I he controlled 43% of the company's capital.
His motivation seems to have been primarily to build up the enterprise through hard work rather than to make a personal fortune.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}

Cavallier built his house beside the factory on the [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]–[[Metz]] road so that he could be "in the middle of his hive."{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}
He would work long hours, from 6 in the morning until late at night.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
A general strike started at Pont-à-Mousson in September 1905, the first, triggered by dismissal of the union's treasurer but caused by long-running grievances over pay.
The strike was a shock to the management.
Cavallier founded the Fête du travail (Labour Festival) in 1906 in an attempt to reunite the community.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier s’entretient ... 1908}}
In 1910 the steelmaker [[François de Wendel]] ran for election as deputy in [[Briey]], opposed by a local physician who was supported by the Fédération républicaine. 
He lost by 3,506 votes to the doctor's 3,820.
Wendel was convinced, perhaps correctly, that Cavallier had engineered his defeat since he distrusted Wendel's dealings with union leaders and thought he had encouraged the strike .{{sfn|Gordon|1996|p=162}}
Unlike self-made men such as Cavallier and Alexandre Dreux of the [[Aciéries de Longwy]], Wendel was aristocratic, which did not endear him with the other industrialists.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|p=156}}

[[File:Sondage 01.jpg|thumb|Exploratory drilling shaft for coal built in 1905 by the Société Joseph Vogt for the Société des Fonderies de Pont-à-Mousson]]
Cavallier transformed the moderately sized cast iron pipe manufacturer into a giant, always concentrating on making pipes.
Annual cast iron production rose from 80,000 to 183,000 tons between 1900 and 1913.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier studied use of blast furnace gas for production of electrical power, built a test station, then built a large central power station.
He continued to increase the percent of pipes in the company output.
In 1903 he installed blast furnaces at Auboué.
In 1905 he built a foundry at [[Foug]], throwing up the building and furnaces in a month.
In 1905 Cavallier purchased the [[Moineville]] concession, which was later merged with the Auboué concession.
The company acquired control of the Bayard foundries in Haute-Marne.
It also took stakes in the Micheville and [[ Compagnie des forges et aciéries de la marine et d'Homécourt|Marine-Homécourt]] steel makers, and after the war would take interests in steelworks in Lorraine and the Saar.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

At the 23 January 1900 meeting Cavallier pointed out the importance of securing a supply of coke, and proposed to acquire a concession to open a new coal mine.
In January 1902 Cavallier began to discuss a joint operation with the Société de Micheville and the Société du Nord et de l'Est to exploit coal deposits in northern Belgium, leading to incorporation of the Société Campinoise on 11 April 1902.
The Beeringen-Coursel concession was granted to a group of three exploration companies on 26 November 1906, and Pont-à-Mousson participated in creation of the Société des Charbonnages de Beeringen ([[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]] Coal Company) on 23 February 1907.
The Beringen deposit was rich, but covered by a layer {{convert|550-700|m}} thick of sands containing aquifers. It was not until after [[World War I]] (1914–18) that the first pit was opened on 26 December 1921.
In Lorraine Cavallier explored for a continuation of the [[Saarbrücken]] coalfield.
A test drill of {{convert|1500|m}} near the central station of the Pont-à-Mousson plant found several layers of coal, but only at great depth.
The company took an interest in coal mines in several other parts of northern France.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

==World War I (1914–18)==
[[File:Pont-à-Mousson - France - 3 Nov 1918.jpg|thumb|Pont-à-Mousson on 3 November 1918]]
At the start of [[World War I]] the Pont-à-Mousson factory was occupied by the Germans for a few days, and remained less than {{convert|3|km}} from the front line.
Auboué was occupied.
The Foug factory remained in operation, and was converted to manufacture of munitions.
Workshops were established at Belleville in 1916 and [[Sens]] in 1917.
In 1917 Cavallier founded the Fonderie Lorraine to manufacture war materials in [[Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray]], near Rouen.
His son in law, Marcel Paul, was given responsibility for the plant, which was built on {{convert|50|ha}} between the railway and the river.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}
By the end of the war 20% of French shells were being made from cast iron in the Foug foundry.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}

At the 24 January 1917 general meeting Cavallier proposed to appoint a board of directors with representatives of capital and labour.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
Cavallier became deputy chairman in 1917, and three administrators were named.
Marcel Paul was titled ''administrateur délégué'' and the other two were titled ''administrateur directeur général''.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=38}}
Towards the end of the war study groups under [[Humbert de Wendel]] defined the demands of the Comite des Forges for the post-war settlement.
They wanted return of Alsace-Lorraine, cession of the Saar and transfer of Luxembourg from the German Customs Union to a union with Belgium.
Camille Cavallier was one of a small number of iron masters who also wanted the left bank of the Rhine.{{sfn|Maier|2015|p=71}}

==Post-war period (1918–26)==

In the post-war period the company faced a massive task of reconstruction, while training new workers to replace those lost in the war.
In 1919–20 Pont-à-Mousson took over a major pipe-making facility in the [[Saarland|Saar]].
The company also acquired interests in Lorraine companies that had been liquidated, notably Rombas, and acquired interests in coal mines in the Saar and [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]].{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
President [[Raymond Poincaré]] lit the first reconstructed blast furnace at Pont-à-Mousson 23 November 1919 in a solemn ceremony.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}
Within France, Cavallier was in favor of quota agreements between competing companies to prevent destructive price wars.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
German demand for iron from Lorraine plummeted after [[World War I]] (1914–18).
By 1922 total demand was just a tenth of the pre-war demand from the Ruhr alone.
Contributing factors were the growing use of the Siemens-Martin process of [[open hearth furnace]]s for recycling scrap steel combined with availability of war material to be recycled. 
In early 1922 [[Robert Pinot]] of the [[Comité des forges]] explained to Camille Cavallier that this had "permitted a boycotting of our ''[[Minette (ore)|minette]]'' ore these past years."{{sfn|Maier|2015|p=199}}
However, Pont-à-Mousson gradually regained its export markets.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

[[File:Haut-fourneau Pont-à-Mousson.jpg|thumb|Blast furnace at Pont-à-Mousson (2008)]]
On 7 May 1924 Cavallier said the company was self-sufficient in iron ore, and would soon be self-sufficient in coke.
It was not until 1925 that Cavallier was able to announce that production had returned to prewar levels.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
When Cavallier died in 1926 annual production had reached 237,000 tons.
His strategy as a pipe specialist led him to move into the export market early on so the company would not depend on fluctuating domestic demand.
By the time he died half of the company's output was exported, with 450 foreign cities using Pont-à-Mousson pipes, 127 of them outside of Europe.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier knew that exports forced industry to become more competitive and efficient, and reduced costs helped domestic customers.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|p=27}}

Cavallier became Vice-President of the Nancy Chamber of Commerce and a member of many committees and associations.
He died of a heart attack on 10 June 1926 at his property of Gentilly, at [[Maxéville]], near Nancy, the day after presiding over a general shareholders meeting.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
At the time of his death he was a member of the board of the [[Comité des Forges de France]], director of about twenty companies, and had received many honors and official commissions.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier had chosen his son-in-law, Marcel Paul, as his successor.
The heirs of Xavier Rogé and two other shareholders, Colonel Plassiart and the Lorraine banker Paul Lenglet, still had sizeable shareholdings.
In the early 1920s Cavallier arranged for them to form a pact within a financial company, Filor (Financière Lorraine).
This lasted until 1964, when the founding families still controlled 50% of the capital of Pont-à-Mousson.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}

'''Candler Park''' is a 55-acre (223,000 m²) [[city park]] located at 585 Candler Park Drive NE, in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  It is named after [[Coca-Cola]] [[magnate]] [[Asa Griggs Candler]], who donated this land to the city in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vahi.patch.com/listings/candler-park-2 |title=Candler Park |publisher=Patch Media |accessdate=May 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914033216/http://vahi.patch.com/listings/candler-park-2 |archivedate=September 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park features a nine-hole [[golf course]], a [[swimming pool]], a [[American football|football]]/[[soccer]] [[sports field|field]], a [[basketball court]], [[tennis court]]s, and a [[playground]].

[[File:Candler Park Atlanta.jpg|thumb|left|McLendon Ave NE in Candler Park.]]

Candler Park is also the name of the [[neighborhood]] surrounding the park.  It is on the [[Eastside (Atlanta)|east side]] of the city, bordering [[Little Five Points]], [[Lake Claire, Atlanta|Lake Claire]], [[Inman Park]], [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]], and [[Edgewood (Atlanta)|Edgewood]].
 
The '''Candler Park Historic District''' was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on September 8, 1983, with a boundary increase on March 17, 2005.  It includes portions of Lake Claire.

[[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] [[rapid transit]] rail service is available at the [[Edgewood / Candler Park (MARTA station)|Edgewood/Candler Park]] [[subway station|station]].

The '''Cellophane Paradox''' (also the '''Cellophane Trap''' or '''Cellophane Fallacy'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=271113 The Cellophane and Merger Guidelines Fallacies Again, article by Pierluigi Sabbatini]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Gingerbread Paradox''') describes a type of incorrect reasoning used in market regulation methods.

The paradox arises when a firm sells a product with few [[Substitute good|substitutes]], which in turn allows the firm to increase the price of that product. The original reason was that as the price increases, the product will reach a point where it begins to attract more and more substitutes. In technical economic terms, such a product has very low [[Cross elasticity of demand|cross-price elasticity of demand]]. The situation is linked to a [[United States Supreme Court]] case and a subsequent response in economic literature.

[[Cellophane]] was a [[DuPont]] Company plastic wrapping material that had its U.S. production restricted to du Pont by numerous patents in the early 1950s. Du Pont was sued under the [[Sherman Act]] for [[monopolization]] of the cellophane market by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]], and the case (''U.S. v. E. I. du Pont''&lt;ref&gt;Decided by the Supreme Court and reported at 351 U.S. 377, 76 S.Ct. 994, 100 L.Ed.1264&lt;/ref&gt;) was decided by the Supreme Court in 1956. The Court agreed with du Pont that when evaluated at the monopolistic price observed in the early 1950s, there were many substitutes for cellophane and, therefore, du Pont had only a small share of the market for wrapping materials (i.e., it possessed little or no [[market power]]).

This reasoning was challenged by a 1955 article in the [[American Economic Review]]. In research on the du Pont company arising from his PhD dissertation, Willard F. Mueller and co-author [[George W. Stocking, Sr.]] pointed out the error of mistaking a monopolist's inability to exercise [[market power]] by raising price above the ''current'' price for an inability to have already exercised market power by raising price significantly above the ''competitive'' price. Courts that use a monopolized product's elevated market price will typically misconstrue a completed anti-competitive act as a lack of market power. Had the Supreme Court considered the substitutability of other wrappings at cellophane's competitive price, the sales of other wrappings would have been much lower; du Pont might very well have been found guilty of monopolizing the market for flexible wrappings.

As [[Richard Posner]] wrote, 
"Reasonable interchangeability at the current price but not at a competitive price level, far from
demonstrating the absence of monopoly power, might well be a symptom of that power; this
elementary point was completely overlooked by the court"
&lt;ref name="posner1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard|title=Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective|date=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem continues to bedevil efforts by antitrust agencies to define markets.  Defining markets by cross-elasticity of demand requires a reference price:  If I raise my price by 5% from some base level, will people switch to a competing good?  The problem is that a firm that actually does have a monopoly power still faces constraints on its ability to charge whatever price it wants; those constraints are set by consumers’ willingness to pay.  If a monopolist already charges the profit-maximizing price, an increase above that price will cause consumers to stop buying the product; that’s why the lower price was already profit-maximizing.  So we can’t just use the price a company already charges as the base level, or we will conclude that even monopolists lack market power.

Antitrust can solve this problem by using some measure of average cost, not the actual market price, as the baseline for the question whether a merger would allow the merged firm to increase price.   But that means that the relevant question is not whether consumers would pay more for a can of Coke or a Harry Potter novel than they currently do; it is whether they would pay 5% more for the can of Coke than it cost to make, deliver, and sell it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Lemley &amp; Mark McKenna, Is Pepsi Really a Substitute for Coke? Market Definition in Antitrust and IP, Geo. L.J. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Koch Arena''' is a 10,506-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]], United States.  It is located on the southeast corner of 21st and Hillside on the campus of [[Wichita State University]] in northeast Wichita.  The arena is home of the [[Wichita State Shockers]] men's basketball, women's basketball, and women's volleyball teams.

==History==
The arena was originally built in 1953 as the '''University of Wichita Field House''' by what was then the Municipal University of Wichita. It was considered several years ahead of its time because of its circular design, which gave nearly every fan a clear sight line and put the seats very close to the action.  As a result, it was quickly nicknamed "The Roundhouse," a name that has stuck to this day. When Wichita joined the state university system in 1964, the arena was renamed the '''WSU Field House'''.

In 1969, the arena was officially renamed '''Levitt Arena''' after Wichita department store magnate Henry Levitt, who had recently died. Levitt's [[Henry's (clothiers)|Wichita clothing store]] sponsored basketball team won three consecutive national [[Amateur Athletic Union]] titles in the 1930s at a time when colleges and corporate-sponsored teams competed in the same tournament.

===Endowment===
 [[File:Wichita, Kansas.JPG|thumb|left|Charles Koch Arena]]Following a $6 million endowment from [[Charles Koch]]&lt;ref&gt;"Koch gives $6 million to update WSU Areana – the donation, the largest in the university's history, helps make possible a complete renovation of the Levitt Arena, which will reopen as Koch Arena in 2003" – ''Wichita Eagle'' – November 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the arena underwent a $25 million renovation in 2002–03, popularly known as the "Roundhouse Renaissance." The old arena concourse was completely demolished and a new one built around the original playing/seating area. A portion of the seating bowl was remodeled to make for more legroom. All new seating was installed as well as a video scoreboard, and virtually every surface that was not renovated was given a fresh coat of paint.  The Shocker basketball teams played at the [[Kansas Coliseum]] for the 2002–03 season while the arena was rebuilt, while the volleyball team played at the Heskett Center on the WSU campus.

===Since 2008===
[[File:Charles-Koch-Arena.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of Charles Koch Arena]]Koch Arena hosted the 2008 [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] Class 6A state wrestling tournament. The arena also hosts numerous high school basketball games involving schools from the Wichita City League. The KSHSAA Class 6A boys and girls basketball state tournaments moved to Koch Arena from [[Emporia State University]]'s [[William L. White Auditorium]] in 2011.

As Levitt Arena it hosted the 1977 and 1989 [[Missouri Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament title game. It also hosted games for the opening rounds of the [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]].

In addition to concerts, the arena has also hosted the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]], [[Disney on Ice]] and [[Champions on Ice]] as both Levitt Arena and Koch Arena. [[American Idol]]s Live! has performed annually at Koch Arena since 2003.

In December 2012, [[ESPN]] ranked Charles Koch Arena at number 10 in the nation in a poll on home-court advantages in College Basketball.  In January 2013, [[ESPN]]'s Jason King listed Koch Arena as the 7th best home court advantage in college basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8848242/nation-best-homecourt-advantages-college-basketball|title=King's Court: Home sweet home|work=[[ESPN]]|date=January 13, 2013|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{optical disc authoring}}
'''Compact Disc Digital Audio''' ('''CDDA''' or '''CD-DA'''), also known as '''Audio CD''', is the [[standardization|standard]] format for audio [[compact disc]]s. The standard is defined in the '''Red Book''', one of a series of "[[Rainbow Books]]" (named for their binding colors) that contain the [[specification (technical standard)|technical specifications]] for all CD [[content format|formats]].

== Standard ==
The ''Red Book'' specifies the physical parameters and properties of the CD, the optical "stylus" parameters, deviations and error rate, modulation system ([[eight-to-fourteen modulation]], EFM) and error correction facility ([[cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding]], CIRC), and the eight [[Compact disc subcode|subcode channels]]. These parameters are common to all [[compact discs]] and used by all logical formats, such as [[CD-ROM]]. The standard also specifies the form of [[digital audio]] encoding: 2-channel [[Signedness|signed]] 16-[[bit]] [[Linear pulse code modulation|Linear PCM]] sampled at [[44,100 Hz]]. Although rarely used, the specification allows for discs to be mastered with a form of [[Emphasis (telecommunications)|emphasis]].

The first edition of the ''Red Book'' was released in 1980 by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]];&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto45-1"/&gt; it was adopted by the Digital Audio Disc Committee and ratified by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] Technical Committee 100, as an International Standard in 1987 with the reference IEC 60908.&lt;ref name="Auto45-2"/&gt; The second edition of IEC 60908 was published in 1999&lt;ref name="Auto45-3"/&gt; and it cancels and replaces the first edition, amendment 1 (1992) and the corrigendum to amendment 1. The IEC 60908 however does not contain all the information for extensions that is available in the Red Book, such as the details for [[CD-Text]], [[CD+G]] and [[CD+EG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edocpublish.com/resources-2/specifications/cd-logos/ Approved Compact Disc Logo configurations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bchafy/cdb/info/info.html Specs for Freeware Developers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501075730/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bchafy/cdb/info/info.html |date=2012-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard is not freely available and must be licensed. It is available from [[Philips]] and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]. {{As of|2013}}, Philips outsources licensing of the standard to Adminius, which charges {{US$|100}} for the ''Red Book'', plus {{US$|50}} each for the ''Subcode Channels R-W'' and ''CD Text Mode'' annexes.&lt;ref name="philips_red_book"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lscdweb.com/ordering/cd_products.html |title=CD Products |work=lscdweb.com |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audio format ==
The audio contained in a CD-DA consists of two-channel [[Signedness|signed]] 16-[[bit]] [[Linear pulse code modulation|Linear PCM]] sampled at [[44,100 Hz]].

=== Sample rate ===
{{Details|44.1 kHz}}
The [[sampling rate]] is adapted from that attained when recording digital audio on a [[PAL]] (or [[NTSC]]) [[videotape]] with a [[PCM adaptor]], an earlier way of storing digital audio.&lt;ref name="Auto45-4"/&gt; An audio CD can represent frequencies up to 22.05&amp;nbsp;kHz, the [[Nyquist frequency]] of the 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz sample rate.

The selection of the sample rate was based primarily on the need to reproduce the audible frequency range of 20–20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (20&amp;nbsp;kHz). The [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] states that a sampling rate of more than twice the maximum frequency of the signal to be recorded is needed, resulting in a required rate of at least 40&amp;nbsp;kHz. The exact sampling rate of 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz was inherited from a method of converting digital audio into an analog video signal for storage on [[U-matic|U-matic video tape]], which was the most affordable way to transfer data from the recording studio to the CD manufacturer at the time the CD specification was being developed. The device that converts an analog audio signal into PCM audio, which in turn is changed into an analog video signal is called a [[PCM adaptor]]. This technology could store six samples (three samples per stereo channel) in a single horizontal line. 60 field/s black and white video (not 59.94 color) was required, and in [[NTSC]] countries (USA/Japan) that video signal has 245 usable lines per field, which works out to be (245 * 60 * 3) = 44,100 samples/s/stereo channel. Similarly, [[PAL]] has 294 lines and 50 fields, which gives 44,100 samples/s/stereo channel. This system could store 14-bit samples with some error correction, or 16-bit samples with almost no error correction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

There was a long debate over the use of 14-bit (Philips) or 16-bit (Sony) [[Quantization (sound processing)|quantization]], and 44,056 or 44,100 samples/s (Sony) or approximately 44,000 samples/s (Philips). When the Sony/Philips task force designed the Compact Disc, Philips had already developed a 14-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A converter]] (DAC), but Sony insisted on 16-bit. In the end, 16 bits and 44.1 kilosamples per second prevailed. Philips found a way to produce 16-bit quality using its 14-bit DAC by using four times [[oversampling]].&lt;ref name=Immink /&gt;

=== Pre-emphasis ===
{{main|Emphasis (telecommunications)}}
Some CDs are mastered with pre-emphasis, an artificial boost of high audio frequencies. The pre-emphasis improves the apparent signal-to-noise ratio by making better use of the channel's dynamic range. On playback, the player applies a de-emphasis filter to restore the frequency response curve to an overall flat one. Pre-emphasis time constants are 50µs and 15µs (9.49&amp;nbsp;dB boost at 20&amp;nbsp;kHz), and a binary flag in the disc [[subcode]] instructs the player to apply de-emphasis filtering if appropriate. Playback of such discs in a computer or 'ripping' to [[WAV|wave files]] typically does not take into account the pre-emphasis, so such files play back with a distorted frequency response.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Storage capacity and playing time ==
The creators of the CD originally aimed at a playing time of 60&amp;nbsp;minutes with a disc diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;mm (Sony) or 115&amp;nbsp;mm (Philips).&lt;ref name=Immink2/&gt; Sony vice-president [[Norio Ohga]] suggested extending the capacity to 74 minutes to accommodate the recording of [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] conducting [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] at the 1951 [[Bayreuth Festival]].&lt;ref name="PhilBeet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto45-6"/&gt; The additional 14-minute playing time subsequently required changing to a 120&amp;nbsp;mm disc. [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]], Philips' chief engineer, however, denies this, claiming that the increase was motivated by technical considerations, and that even after the increase in size, the Furtwängler recording would not have fit on one of the earliest CDs.&lt;ref name=Immink /&gt;&lt;ref name=Immink2 /&gt;

According to a ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' interview,&lt;ref name="ferguscassidy"/&gt; the story is slightly more involved. In 1979, Philips owned [[PolyGram]], one of the world's largest distributors of music. PolyGram had set up a large experimental CD plant in [[Hannover]], Germany, which could produce huge numbers of CDs having a diameter of 115&amp;nbsp;mm. Sony did not yet have such a facility. If Sony had agreed on the 115-mm disc, Philips would have had a significant competitive edge in the market. The long playing time of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony imposed by [[Norio Ohga|Ohga]] was used to push Philips to accept 120&amp;nbsp;mm, so that Philips' PolyGram lost its edge on disc fabrication.&lt;ref name="ferguscassidy"/&gt;

The 74-minute playing time of a CD, which is longer than the 22&amp;nbsp;minutes per side&lt;ref name="Auto45-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto45-8"/&gt; typical of [[LP record|long-playing]] (LP) [[vinyl album]]s, was often used to the CD's advantage during the early years when CDs and LPs vied for commercial sales. CDs would often be released with one or more bonus tracks, enticing consumers to buy the CD for the extra material. However, attempts to combine double LPs onto one CD occasionally resulted in the opposite situation in which the CD would instead offer fewer tracks than the LP.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Playing times beyond 74&amp;nbsp;minutes are achieved by decreasing track pitch (the distance separating the track as it spirals the disc) in violation of strict ''Red Book'' standards. However, most players can still accommodate the more closely spaced data if it is still within ''Red Book'' tolerances.&lt;ref name="Auto45-9"/&gt; Current manufacturing processes allow an audio CD to contain up to 80 minutes (variable from one replication plant to another) without requiring the content creator to sign a waiver releasing the plant owner from responsibility if the CD produced is marginally or entirely unreadable by some playback equipment. In current practice, maximum CD playing time has crept higher by reducing minimum engineering tolerances.

This table shows the progression in the maximum duration of released audio CDs:

== Technical specifications ==

=== Data encoding ===
Each audio sample is a [[Signedness|signed]] 16-bit [[two's complement]] [[Integer (computer science)|integer]], with sample values ranging from −32768 to +32767. The source audio data is divided into frames, containing twelve [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] each (six left and right samples, alternating), for a total of 192 bits (24 bytes) of audio data per frame.

This stream of audio frames, as a whole, is then subjected to [[Cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding|CIRC]] encoding, which segments and rearranges the data and expands it with [[parity bit]]s in a way that allows occasional read errors to be detected and corrected. CIRC encoding also interleaves the audio frames throughout the disc over several consecutive frames so that the information will be more resistant to [[burst error]]s. Therefore, a physical frame on the disc will actually contain information from multiple logical audio frames. This process adds 64 bits of [[error correction]] data to each frame. After this, 8 bits of [[subcode]] or subchannel data are added to each of these encoded frames, which is used for control and addressing when playing the CD.

CIRC encoding plus the subcode byte generate 33-bytes long frames, called "channel-data" frames. These frames are then modulated through [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), where each 8-bit word is replaced with a corresponding 14-bit word designed to reduce the number of transitions between 0 and 1. This reduces the density of [[Compact disc#Physical details|physical pits]] on the disc and provides an additional degree of error tolerance. Three "merging" bits are added before each 14-bit word for disambiguation and synchronization. In total there are 33 × (14 + 3) = 561 bits. A 27-bit word (a 24-bit pattern plus 3 merging bits) is added to the beginning of each frame to assist with synchronization, so the reading device can locate frames easily. With this, a frame ends up containing 588 bits of "channel data" (which are decoded to only 192 bits music).

The frames of channel data are finally written to disc physically in the form of [[Compact disc#Physical details|pits and lands]], with each pit or land representing a series of zeroes, and with the transition points—the edge of each pit—representing 1.
A Red Book-compatible CD-R has pit-and-land-shaped spots on a layer of organic dye instead of actual pits and lands; a laser creates the spots by altering the reflective properties of the dye.

=== Data structure ===
[[File:Basic Illustration and mesures of a CD.png|thumb|This image of a [[CD-R]] demonstrates some of the visible features of an audio CD, including the lead-in, program area, and lead-out. A microscopic spiral of digital information begins near the disc's center and progresses toward the edge. The end of the data region and the lead-out can actually be anywhere, depending on how much data is recorded. Data-free areas of the disc and silent portions of the spiral reflect light differently, sometimes allowing track boundaries to be seen]]
The audio data stream in an audio CD is continuous, but has three parts. The main portion, which is further divided into playable audio tracks, is the ''program area''. This section is preceded by a ''lead-in'' track and followed by a ''lead-out'' track. The lead-in and lead-out tracks encode only silent audio, but all three sections contain [[subcode]] data streams.

The lead-in's subcode contains repeated copies of the disc's Table Of Contents (TOC), which provides an index of the start positions of the tracks in the program area and lead-out. The track positions are referenced by absolute [[timecode]], relative to the start of the program area, in MSF format: minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds called ''frames''. Each timecode frame is one seventy-fifth of a second, and corresponds to a block of 98 channel-data frames—ultimately, a block of 588 pairs of left and right audio samples. Timecode contained in the subchannel data allows the reading device to locate the region of the disc that corresponds to the timecode in the TOC. The TOC on discs is analogous to the [[partition table]] on [[hard drive]]s. Nonstandard or corrupted TOC records are abused as a form of [[CD/DVD copy protection]], in e.g. the [[key2Audio]] scheme.

==== Tracks ====
{{main|Track (CD)#Audio tracks}}
The largest entity on a CD is called a track. A CD can contain up to 99 tracks (including a data track for [[Mixed Mode CD|mixed mode discs]]). Each track can in turn have up to 100 indexes, though players which handle this feature are rarely found outside of [[pro audio]], particularly radio broadcasting{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. The vast majority of songs are recorded under index 1, with the [[pre-gap]] being index 0. Sometimes [[hidden track]]s are placed at the end of the last track of the disc, often using index 2 or 3. This is also the case with some discs offering "101 sound effects", with 100 and 101 being indexed as two and three on track 99. The index, if used, is occasionally put on the track listing as a decimal part of the track number, such as 99.2 or 99.3. ([[Information Society (band)|Information Society]]'s ''[[Hack (album)|Hack]]'' was one of very few CD releases to do this, following a release with an equally obscure [[CD+G]] feature.) The track and index structure of the CD were carried forward to the [[DVD]] format as title and chapter, respectively.

Tracks, in turn, are divided into timecode frames (or sectors), which are further subdivided into channel-data frames.

==== Frames and timecode frames ====
{{main|Track (CD)#Sector structure}}
The smallest entity in a CD is a channel-data ''frame'', which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples: 24 bytes for the audio (two bytes × two channels × six samples = 24 bytes), eight CIRC error-correction bytes, and one [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] byte. As described in the "Data encoding" section, after the EFM modulation the number of bits in a frame totals 588.

On a ''Red Book'' audio CD, data is addressed using the ''MSF scheme'', with [[timecode]]s expressed in minutes, seconds and another type of ''frames'' (mm:ss:ff), where one frame corresponds to 1/75th of a second of audio: 588 pairs of left and right samples. This timecode frame is distinct from the 33-byte channel-data frame described above, and is used for time display and positioning the reading laser. When editing and extracting CD audio, this timecode frame is the smallest addressable time interval for an audio CD; thus, track boundaries only occur on these frame boundaries. Each of these structures contains 98 channel-data frames, totaling 98 × 24 = 2,352 bytes of music. The CD is played at a speed of 75 frames (or sectors) per second, thus 44,100 samples or 176,400 bytes per second.

In the 1990s, [[CD-ROM]] and related [[ripping|Digital Audio Extraction]] (DAE) technology introduced the term ''[[CD-ROM#CD-ROM format|sector]]'' to refer to each timecode frame, with each sector being identified by a sequential [[integer]] number starting at zero, and with tracks aligned on sector boundaries. An audio CD sector corresponds to 2,352 bytes of decoded data. The ''Red Book'' does not refer to sectors, nor does it distinguish the corresponding sections of the disc's data stream except as "frames" in the MSF addressing scheme.

The following table shows the relation between tracks, timecode frames (sectors) and channel-data frames:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Track level
| colspan = 6 | Track N
|-
! Timecode frame or sector level
| colspan = 3 | Timecode frame or sector 1 (2,352 b of data)
| Timecode frame or sector 2 (2,352 b of data)
| ... 
|-
! Channel-data frame level
| Channel-data frame 1 (24 b of data)
| ... 
| Channel-data frame 98 (24 b of data)
| ... 
| ... 
|}

=== Bit rate ===
The audio [[bit rate]] for a ''Red Book'' audio CD is 1,411,200 [[bits per second]] or 176,400 [[bytes per second]]; 2 channels × 44,100 samples per second per channel × 16 bits per sample. Audio data coming in from a CD is contained in sectors, each sector being 2,352 bytes, and with 75 sectors containing 1 second of audio. For comparison, the bit rate of a "1×" [[CD-ROM]] is defined as 2,048 bytes per sector × 75 sectors per second = 153,600 bytes per second. The remaining 304 bytes in a sector are used for additional data error correction.

=== Data access from computers ===
Unlike on a [[DVD]] or [[CD-ROM]], there are no "[[computer file|file]]s" on a ''Red Book'' audio CD; there is only one continuous stream of [[LPCM]] audio data, and a parallel, smaller set of 8 [[subcode]] data streams. Computer [[operating system]]s, however, may provide access to an audio CD as if it contains files. For example, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] represents the CD's Table of Contents as a set of [[Compact Disc Audio track]] (CDA) files, each file containing indexing information, not audio data.

In a process called [[ripping]], digital audio extraction software can be used to read CD-DA audio data and store it in files. Common [[audio file format]]s for this purpose include [[WAV]] and [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]], which simply preface the LPCM data with a short [[header (computing)|header]]; [[FLAC]], [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]], and [[Windows Media Audio#Windows Media Audio Lossless|Windows Media Audio Lossless]], which compress the LPCM data in ways that conserve space yet allow it to be restored without any changes; and various [[lossy compression|lossy]], [[perceptual audio coder|perceptual coding]] formats like [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], which modify and compress the audio data in ways that irreversibly change the audio, but that exploit features of human hearing to make the changes difficult to discern.

== Format variations ==
Recording publishers have created CDs that violate the ''Red Book'' standard. Some do so for the purpose of [[copy protection|copy prevention]], using systems like [[Copy Control]]. Some do so for extra features such as [[DualDisc]], which includes both a [[CD]] layer and a [[DVD]] layer whereby the CD layer is much thinner, 0.9&amp;nbsp;mm, than required by the ''Red Book'', which stipulates a nominal 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm, but at least 1.1&amp;nbsp;mm. Philips and many other companies have stated that including the Compact Disc Digital Audio logo on such non-conforming discs may constitute [[trademark]] infringement.

[[Super Audio CD]] was a standard published in 1999 that aimed to provide better audio quality in CDs, but it never became very popular. [[DVD Audio]], an advanced version of the audio CD, emerged in 1999.&lt;ref name="Auto45-12"/&gt; The format was designed to feature audio of higher fidelity. It applies a higher sampling rate and uses 650&amp;nbsp;nm lasers.

== Copyright issues ==
{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}
There have been moves by the [[recording industry]] to make audio CDs (Compact Disc Digital Audio) unplayable on computer [[CD-ROM]] drives, to prevent the copying of music. This is done by intentionally introducing errors onto the disc that the embedded circuits on most stand-alone audio players can automatically compensate for, but which may confuse CD-ROM drives. Consumer rights advocates as of October 2001 pushed to require warning labels on compact discs that do not conform to the official Compact Disc Digital Audio standard (often called the [[#Standard|Red Book]]) to inform consumers which discs do not permit full [[fair use]] of their content.

In 2005, [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] was criticized when a copy protection mechanism known as [[Extended Copy Protection]] (XCP) used on some of their audio CDs automatically and surreptitiously installed copy-prevention software on computers (see [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal]]). Such discs are not legally allowed to be called CDs or Compact Discs because they break the Red Book standard governing CDs, and Amazon.com for example describes them as "copy protected discs" rather than "compact discs" or "CDs".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2207">'''Cost of revenue''' is the total cost of producing and distributing of products and services of a company.

Cost of revenue can be found in [[income statement]] of a company. Generally, any costs that are directly connected with [[manufacturing]] and distribution of goods and services can be added to cost of revenue (i.e. direct costs). Indirect costs (e.g. depreciation, salaries paid to management or other fixed costs) are not included.

Cost of revenue is different from [[Cost of goods sold|Costs of Goods Sold]] (COGS) in the way that it includes additional costs such as distribution, marketing and other.

== Example ==
Definition of cost of revenue in a [[Facebook]] annual report:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NASDAQ_FB_2015.pdf|title=Facebook Annual Report 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|40}}

"'''Cost of revenue.''' Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our [[data center|data centers]], such as facility and server equipment depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. Cost of revenue also includes [[credit card]] and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of [[intangible assets]], costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of [[virtual reality]] platform device inventory sold."

A '''counterparty''' (sometimes '''contraparty''') is a [[Juristic person|legal entity]], [[unincorporated entity]], or collection of entities to which an exposure to [[financial risk]] might exist. The word became widely used in the 1980s, particularly at the time of the [[Basel I]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas J. Sargent|Sargent, T. J.]], and Velde, F. R., ''The Big Problem of Small Change'' ([[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and [[Oxford]]: [[Princeton University Press]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-drafted contracts usually attempt to spell out in explicit detail what each counterparty's rights and obligations are in every conceivable circumstance, though there are limits. There are general provisions for how counterparties are treated under the law, and (at least in [[common law]] legal systems) there are many [[legal precedent]]s that shape the common law.

==Financial services sector==
Within the [[financial services]] sector, the term '''market counterparty''' is used to refer to [[government]]s, [[national bank]]s, national monetary authorities and international monetary organisations such as the [[World Bank Group]] that act as the ultimate guarantor for loans and indemnities. The term may also be applied, in a more general sense, to companies acting in this role.

Also within financial services, counterparty can refer to brokers, [[investment bank]]s, and other securities dealers that serve as the  contracting party when completing [[Over-the-counter (finance)|"over the counter"]] securities transactions.  The term is generally used in this context in relation to "[[counterparty risk]]", which is the risk of monetary loss a firm may be exposed to if the counterparty to an over-the-counter securities trade encounters difficulty meeting its obligations under the terms of the transaction.

==Insurance sector==
Within the [[insurance]] sector, this term is extended to include companies offering or requiring high-level [[Reinsurance#Retrocession|retrocession]] of insurance risk to insurance companies in a role similar to that offered by governments. This term, over time, has become more generally applied to companies offering or requiring retrocession and other forms of [[reinsurance]].

'''''Dangerous Company: The Consulting Powerhouses and the Businesses They Save and Ruin''''' is a book written by [[James O'Shea (newspaper editor)|James O'Shea]] and [[Charles Madigan]].  It is one of several business books critical of the functioning and importance of the [[Management Consulting|management consulting]] ([[Strategy Consulting]]) industry. The book discusses a range of representative cases and their handling by the top [[Consultant|consulting]] powerhouses.

'''Design''' is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction. Design has different [[connotation]]s in different fields (see [[#Design disciplines|design disciplines]] below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in [[pottery]], [[engineering]], management, [[software development|coding]], and [[graphic design]]) is also considered to use design thinking.

Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]], economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable [[research]], [[thought]], [[Physical model|modeling]], interactive [[problem solving|adjustment]], and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including [[clothing]], [[graphical user interface]]s, products, skyscrapers, [[corporate identity|corporate identities]], [[business process]]es, and even methods or processes of designing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brinkkemper, S. |year=1996|title= Method engineering: engineering of information systems development methods and tools|journal= Information and Software Technology |volume=38|issue=4|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/0950-5849(95)01059-9|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/18012/1/Brinkkemper96method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context.

== Definitions ==
More formally design has been defined as follows:
{{Quote|(noun) a specification of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]], manifested by an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]], intended to accomplish [[goal]]s, in a particular [[Environment (systems)|environment]], using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of [[requirement]]s, subject to constraints; (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an [[Environment (systems)|environment]] (where the designer operates)&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 109 {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-540-92966-6_6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another definition for design is "a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective."&lt;ref&gt;Don Kumaragamage, Y. (2011). Design Manual Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is composed.

The person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer, web designer or interior designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process while the scientific study of design is called [[design science]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. (1964) Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eekels, J. |year=2000|title=On the Fundamentals of Engineering Design Science: The Geography of Engineering Design Science, Part 1|journal= Journal of Engineering Design |volume=11|pages=377–397|doi=10.1080/09544820010000962|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="design theory"&gt;Braha, D. and Maimon, O. (1998) A Mathematical Theory of Design, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of design is planning to manufacture an object, system, component or structure. Thus the word "design" can be used as a noun or a verb. In a broader sense, design is an applied art and engineering that integrates with technology.

While the definition of design is fairly broad, design has a myriad of specifications that professionals utilize in their fields.

Major examples of design are [[blueprint|architectural blueprints]], [[engineering drawing]]s, [[business process]]es, [[circuit diagram]]s, and [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing patterns]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary meanings in the [//dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/design Cambridge Dictionary of American English], at [//www.dictionary.com/browse/design Dictionary.com] (esp. meanings 1–5 and 7–8) and at [//en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/design AskOxford] (esp. verbs).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design as a process{{anchor|Process}}==
Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Dijkhuis 1995, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called "the rational model",&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "technical problem solving"&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"&gt;Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and "the reason-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"&gt;Ralph 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view has been called "reflection-in-action",&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt; "evolutionary design",&lt;ref name="design theory"/&gt; "co-evolution",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Cross 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and "the action-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

===The rational model===
The rational model was independently developed by [[Herb Simon|Herbert A. Simon]],&lt;ref&gt;Newell and Simon 1972; Simon 1969&lt;/ref&gt; an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl and Beitz 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that:
# designers attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] a design candidate for known [[constraint optimization|constraints]] and [[Goal|objectives]],
# the design process is plan-driven,
# the design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.

The rational model is based on a [[Rationalism|rationalist philosophy]]&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; and underlies the [[waterfall model]],&lt;ref&gt;Royce 1970&lt;/ref&gt; [[systems development life cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;Bourque and Dupuis 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the [[engineering design]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.

====Example sequence of stages====
Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following:
* Pre-production design
** [[Design brief]] or ''[[Parti pris]]''&amp;nbsp;– an early (often the beginning) statement of design goals
** [[Analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– analysis of current design goals
** [[Research]]&amp;nbsp;– investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
** [[Specification]]&amp;nbsp;– specifying requirements of a design solution for a product ([[product design specification]])&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., 2006. T211 Design and Designing: Block 2, p. 99. Milton Keynes: The Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; or service.
** [[Problem solving]]&amp;nbsp;– [[wikt:conceptualize|conceptualizing]] and [[document]]ing design solutions
** [[Presentation]]&amp;nbsp;– presenting design solutions
* Design during production
** [[Product development|Development]]&amp;nbsp;– continuation and improvement of a designed solution
** Testing&amp;nbsp;– ''[[in situ]]'' testing of a designed solution
* Post-production design feedback for future designs
** [[Implementation]]&amp;nbsp;– introducing the designed solution into the environment
** [[Evaluation]] and [[logical consequence|conclusion]]&amp;nbsp;– summary of process and results, including [[constructive criticism]] and suggestions for future improvements
* Redesign&amp;nbsp;– any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.

Each stage has many associated [[best practices]].&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, David G. (2009) The Mechanical Design Process, Mc Graw Hill, 4th edition {{ISBN|0-07-297574-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of the rational model====
The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds:

# Designers do not work this way&amp;nbsp;– extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"&gt;Cross et al. 1992; Ralph 2010; Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unrealistic assumptions&amp;nbsp;– goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 2010; McCracken and Jackson 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===The action-centric model===
The action-centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model.&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt; It posits that:

# designers use [[creativity]] and [[emotion]] to generate design candidates,
# the design process is [[Improvisation|improvised]],
# no universal sequence of stages is apparent&amp;nbsp;– analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

The action-centric perspective is based on an [[Empiricism|empiricist philosophy]] and broadly consistent with the [[Agile software development|agile approach]]&lt;ref&gt;Beck et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and amethodical development.&lt;ref&gt;Truex et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"/&gt; Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers&amp;nbsp;– by designers "thinking on their feet"&amp;nbsp;– more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model.

====Descriptions of design activities====
At least two views of design activity are consistent with the action-centric perspective. Both involve three basic activities.

In the [[Reflective practice|reflection-in-action paradigm]], designers alternate between "[[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]", "making moves", and "evaluating moves". "Framing" refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A "move" is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design.&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt;

In the sensemaking–coevolution–implementation framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. [[Sensemaking (information science)|Sensemaking]] includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is "the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph 2010, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[design cycle]] is understood as a circular time structure,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fischer: ''Design Enigma. A typographical metaphor for enigmatic processes, including designing'', in: T. Fischer, K. De Biswas, J.J. Ham, R. Naka, W.X. Huang, Beyond Codes and Pixels: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt; which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Anderson: ''Architectural Design'', Basics Architecture 03, Lausanne, AVA academia, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-940411-26-9}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies and studies of design==
There are countless philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought{{which|date=February 2018}} and among practicing designers.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most [[holistic]] influential [[utopian]] goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals.  John Heskett, a 20th-century British writer on design claimed, "Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways without precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heskett|first1=John|title=Toothpicks and Logos: Design in Everyday Life|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophies for guiding design===
Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on [[material culture]] and environmental concerns ([[sustainable design]]) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]] which was launched within the graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication&amp;nbsp;– a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref name="maxbruinsma.nl"&gt;[http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm First Things First 2000 a design manifesto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |date=2011-12-19 }}. manifesto published jointly by 33 signatories in: Adbusters, the AIGA journal, Blueprint, Emigre, Eye, Form, Items fall 1999/spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' by polymath [[Herbert A. Simon]], the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. "Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design."&lt;ref name="Herbert A. Simon 1996"&gt;Simon (1996), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches to design===
A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they don't conflict.

Some popular approaches include:
* [[Sociotechnical system]] design, a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes - for organizational purpose, quality, safety, economics and customer requirements in core work processes, the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society
* [[KISS principle]], (Keep it Simple Stupid), which strives to eliminate unnecessary complications.
* [[There is more than one way to do it]] (TIMTOWTDI), a philosophy to allow multiple methods of doing the same thing.
* [[Use-centered design]], which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with the use of the artifact, rather than focusing on the end user.
* [[User-centered design]], which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact.
* [[Critical design]] uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture.
* [[Service design]] designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a product's use.
* [[Transgenerational design]], the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living.
* Speculative design, the speculative design process doesn't necessarily define a specific problem to solve, but establishes a provocative starting point from which a design process emerges. The result is an evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects to provoke questions and stimulate discussion in academic and research settings.
* [[Participatory design|Participatory Design]] (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is the practice of collective creativity to design, attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/manila/gems/contextmapping/PreprintDraft.pdf|title=Co-creation and the new landscape of design|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of designing===
{{Main article|Design methods}}
Design methods is a broad area that focuses on:
* [[Exploring]] possibilities and constraints by focusing critical thinking skills to research and define problem spaces for existing [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]]—or the creation of new categories (see also [[Brainstorming]])
* [[Definition|Redefining]] the specifications of design solutions which can lead to better guidelines for traditional design activities (graphic, industrial, architectural, etc.);
* [[Management|Managing]] the process of exploring, defining, creating artifacts continually over time
* [[Prototyping]] possible scenarios, or solutions that incrementally or significantly improve the inherited situation
* Trendspotting; understanding the trend process.

==Terminology==
The word "design" is often considered ambiguous, as it is applied in varying contexts.
[[File:M-T4.jpg|thumb|166px|left|The new terminal at [[Barajas airport]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]

===Design and art===
Today, the term design is widely associated with the [[applied arts]] as initiated by [[Raymond Loewy]] and teachings at the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Ulm School of Design]] (HfG Ulm) in Germany during the 20th century.

The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. [[Applied arts]] has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], etc. The term '[[decorative arts]]' is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of [[applied arts]]. In [[graphic art]]s (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between [[fine art]] and [[commercial art]], based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.

To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the [[applied arts]] and [[fine art]]. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Getlein, ''Living With Art'', 8th ed. (New York: 2008) 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.

===Design and engineering===
In [[engineering]], design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing [[Product design]], [[Industrial design]] and [[Engineering]]. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] defines design as: ''"To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent,"'' and ''"To formulate a plan"'', and defines engineering as: ''"The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems."''.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108172005/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design |date=2007-01-08 }}.

The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new "human-centered" fields of design.&lt;ref&gt;Faste 2001&lt;/ref&gt; How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered "[[science]]". Along with the question of what is considered science, there is [[social science]] versus [[natural science]]. Scientists at [[Xerox PARC]] made the distinction of design versus engineering at "moving minds" versus "moving atoms" (probably in contradiction to the origin of term "engineering - engineer" from Latin "in genio" in meaning of a "genius" what assumes existence of a "mind" not of an "atom").

===Design and production===
The relationship between design and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and [[creativity]]. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary or impractical to expect a designer with a broad [[multidisciplinary]] knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed [[Division of labour|specialized]] knowledge of how to produce the product.

Design and production are intertwined in many [[creative professional]] careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a [[skyscraper]], requires separating (design) [[architect]]ure from (production) [[construction]]. A Low-budget project, such as a [[Multifunction printer|locally printed]] office party invitation [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]], can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a [[desktop publishing|desktop publisher]].

This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. [[production artist]], [[construction worker]]) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.

===Process design===
{{See also|Business process management|Method engineering}}
"Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned [[#Design as a process|above]]) refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the industrial [[Process design (chemical engineering)|designing of]] [[chemical process]]es. With the increasing complexities of the [[information age]], consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the [[Business process modeling|design of business processes]] as well as [[manufacturing|manufacturing processes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1434">'''Fixed-asset turnover''' is the ratio of sales (on the profit and loss account) to the value of [[fixed asset]]s (on the balance sheet). It indicates how well the business is using its fixed assets to generate sales.

&lt;math&gt;Fixed\ Asset\ Turnover = \frac{Net\ sales}{Average\ net\ fixed\ assets}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="isbn0-631-23100-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Powell, Gary N. |title=Understanding financial management: a practical guide |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2005 |page=59 |isbn=0-631-23100-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the higher the ratio, the better, because a high ratio indicates the business has less money tied up in fixed assets for each unit of currency of sales revenue. A declining ratio may indicate that the business is over-invested in plant, equipment, or other fixed assets.

In A.A.T. assessments this financial measure is calculated in two different ways.

1. Total Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Total Assets

2. Net Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

==Biography==

===Early life===
Harold Bell was born on October 5, 1919, in [[Union City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was one of three sons born to his parents, David and Hilda Rosenthal Belsky.  His father worked as an [[embroiderer]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Bell served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. He moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], following the end of the war.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Career===
Once in Los Angeles, Bell began working as a [[marketer]] and licensing agent for the [[Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He founded his own [[Marketing|marketing firm]] in 1957, which specialized in marketing [[cartoon]], [[television]] and [[film]] characters to the public.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Through his company, Bell helped to [[brand]] and [[license]] such iconic characters as [[Lassie]], the [[Lone Ranger]], [[Dick Tracy]] and [[Mr. Magoo]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

Bell, a licensing agent,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; also produced and created a series of [[public service announcements]] for the National Forest Service featuring [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Bell was hired as a [[technical advisor]] for the long-running, popular television show, ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The concept for Woodsy Owl was developed on the set of ''Lassie''.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Bell teamed with three other Lassie teachnical advisors -  United States Forest Service rangers, Chuck Williams and Glenn Kovar, and colleague Betty Hite - to create Woodsy Owl as the new mascot for the [[United States Forest Service]] for the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

The United States Forest Service had requested that Bell and the others develop a new message and symbol for the agency.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; A number of other animals were considered as the mascot, including a [[ladybug]], [[rainbow trout]], [[elk]] and [[raccoon]]. An [[owl]] was ultimately chosen because of the belief that owls are wise, can see polluters from treetop perches, and can live near cities and towns.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Bell and the others envisioned Woodsy Owl with a broad mission, unlike Smokey Bear, who focused almost exclusively on [[forest fire]] prevention.  The owl would be used to advocate environmental programs and urge American children to fight pollution and help the environment.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Woodsy Owl became most famous for his motto, ''Give a hoot, Don’t pollute''.  As of 2009, the character now uses the [[slogan]], ''Help Woodsy Spread the Word'', mixed with the song, ''[[The Syncopated Clock]]'', by [[Leroy Anderson]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

The '''history of accounting''' or accountancy is thousands of years old and can be traced to [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[civilizations]].&lt;ref name = "R 1992"&gt;Henio, Edrian. 1992. “Accounting Numbers as ‘inscription’: Action at a Distance and the Development of Accounting.” ''Accounting, Organizations and Society'' 17 (7): 685–708.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYSSCPA 2003"&gt;{{Citation | url =http://www.nysscpa.org/trustedprof/archive/1103/tp24.htm | title =A History of ACCOUNTANCY | publisher =New York State Society of CPAs | date =November 2003 | accessdate =December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UniSA 2013"&gt;{{Citation | url =http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/about/exhibitions/historyacc.aspx | title =The History of Accounting | publisher =University of South Australia | date =April 30, 2013 | accessdate =December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early development of [[accounting]] dates back to ancient [[Mesopotamia]], and is closely related to developments in [[writing]], [[counting]] and [[money]]&lt;ref name = "R 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "G 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "OD 2008" /&gt; and early [[auditing]] systems by the ancient [[Egyptians]] and [[Babylonians]].&lt;ref name = "NYSSCPA 2003" /&gt; By the time of the Roman Empire, the [[Ancient Rome#Government|government]] had access to detailed financial information.&lt;ref name = "O 1995" /&gt;

In India  [[Chanakya]] wrote a manuscript similar to a financial management book, during the period of the [[Mauryan Empire]]. His book "Arthashasthra" contains few detailed aspects of maintaining books of accounts for a Sovereign State.

The Italian [[Luca Pacioli]], recognized as ''The Father of accounting and bookkeeping'' was the first person to publish a work on [[double-entry bookkeeping]], and introduced the field in Italy.&lt;ref name="logica.ugent.be" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "LW 1994" /&gt;

The modern profession of the chartered accountant originated in Scotland in the nineteenth century. Accountants often belonged to the same associations as solicitors, who often offered accounting services to their clients. Early modern accounting had similarities to today's [[forensic accounting]].  Accounting began to transition into an organized profession in the nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="ICAEW 2013"&gt;{{Citation | url =https://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/timeline | title =Timeline of the History of the Accountancy Profession | publisher =Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales | year =2013 | accessdate =December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with local [[professional bodies]] in England merging to form the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="Perks16" /&gt;

=== Early development of accounting ===
{{See also|History of mathematics|History of writing|History of money}}
Accounting records dating back more than 7,000 years have been found in [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref name="Friedlob 1996"&gt;Friedlob, G. Thomas &amp; Plewa, Franklin James, ''Understanding balance sheets'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], NYC, 1996, {{ISBN|0-471-13075-3}}, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; and  documents from ancient Mesopotamia show lists of [[expenditure]]s, and [[Good (economics)|goods]] received and traded.&lt;ref name = "R 1992" /&gt; The development of accounting, along with that of money and numbers, may be related to the taxation and trading activities of [[temple]]s: &lt;blockquote&gt;"another part of the explanation as to why accounting employs the numerical metaphor is [...] that money, numbers and accounting are interrelated and, perhaps, inseparable in their origins: all emerged in the context of controlling goods, [[stock]]s and [[Financial transaction|transactions]] in the temple economy of Mesopotamia."&lt;ref name = "R 1992" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The early development of accounting was closely related to developments in [[writing]], [[counting]], and [[money]]. In particular, there is evidence that a key step in the development of counting—the transition from concrete to [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstract]] counting—was related to the early development of accounting and money and took place in Mesopotamia&lt;ref name = "R 1992" /&gt;

Other early accounting records were also found in the ruins of ancient [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]] and [[Sumer]]ia, which date back more than 7,000 years. The people of that time relied on primitive accounting methods to record the growth of crops and herds. Because there was a natural season to farming and herding, it was easy to count and determine if a [[Economic surplus|surplus]] had been gained after the crops had been harvested or the young animals weaned.&lt;ref name="Friedlob 1996" /&gt;

=== Expansion of the role of the accountant ===

Between the [[4th millennium BC]] and the 3rd millennium BC, the ruling leaders and priests in ancient [[Iran]] had people oversee financial matters. In [[Godin Tepe]] (گدین تپه) and [[Tepe Yahya]] (تپه يحيی), cylindrical tokens that were used for bookkeeping on clay scripts were found in buildings that had large rooms for storage of crops. In Godin Tepe's findings, the scripts only contained tables with figures, while in Tepe Yahya's findings, the scripts also contained graphical representations.&lt;ref name = "G 1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=کشاورزی|first=کیخسرو|title=تاریخ ایران از زمان باستان تا امروز (Translated from Russian by Grantovsky, E.A.) | year=1980 | pages=39–40 | language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of a form of [[bookkeeping]] using clay tokens represented a huge [[cognitive]] leap for mankind.&lt;ref name = "OD 2008"&gt;Oldroyd, David &amp; Dobie, Alisdair: ''Themes in the history of bookkeeping'', The Routledge Companion to Accounting History, London, July 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-415-41094-6}}, Chapter 5, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/111499sci-alphabet-origin.html|title=Discovery of Egyptian Inscriptions Indicates an Earlier Date for Origin of the Alphabet|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expansion of commerce and business expanded the role of the accountant. The [[Phoenicians]] invented a phonetic alphabet "probably for bookkeeping purposes", based on the [[Egyptian hieratic]] script, and there is evidence that an individual in [[ancient Egypt]] held the title "comptroller of the scribes". There is also evidence for an early form of accounting in the [[Old Testament]]; for example the [[Book of Exodus]] describes [[Moses]] engaging Ithamar to account for the materials that had been contributed towards the building of the [[tabernacle]].&lt;ref name = "NYSSCPA 2003" /&gt;

By about the 4th century BC, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians had auditing systems for checking movement in and out of storehouses, including oral "audit reports", resulting in the term "auditor" (from ''audire'', ''to hear'' in [[Latin]]) importance of taxation had created a need for the recording of payments, and the [[Rosetta Stone]] also includes a description of a [[tax]] revolt.&lt;ref name = "NYSSCPA 2003" /&gt;

== Roman empire ==
[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Part of the ''Res Gestae Divi Augusti'' from the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (Temple of Augustus and Rome) at [[Ancyra]], built between 25 BCE - 20 BCE.]]
By the time of Emperor [[Augustus]] (63 BC - AD 14), the [[Ancient Rome#Government|Roman government]] had access to detailed financial information as evidenced by the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' ([[Latin]]: "The Deeds of the Divine Augustus"). The inscription was an account to the Roman people of the Emperor [[Augustus]]' stewardship, and listed and quantified his public expenditure, including distributions to the people, grants of land or money to army veterans, subsidies to the ''[[aerarium]]'' (treasury), building of temples, religious offerings, and expenditures on theatrical shows and [[gladiatorial]] games, covering a period of about forty years. The scope of the accounting information at the emperor's disposal suggests that its purpose encompassed planning and decision-making.&lt;ref name = "O 1995"&gt;Oldroyd, David: ''The role of accounting in public expenditure and monetary policy in the first century AD Roman Empire'', Accounting Historians Journal, Volume 22, Number 2, [[Birmingham, Alabama]], December 1995, p.124, [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/articles/1028395.3253/1.PDF Olemiss.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman historians [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] record that in 23 BC, [[Augustus]]  prepared a ''rationarium'' (account) which listed public revenues, the amounts of cash in the ''aerarium'' (treasury), in the provincial ''fisci'' (tax officials), and in the hands of the ''[[publicani]]'' (public contractors); and that it included the names of the freedmen and slaves from whom a detailed account could be obtained.  The closeness of this information to the executive authority of the emperor is attested by [[Tacitus]]' statement that it was written out by Augustus himself.&lt;ref&gt;Oldroyd, David: ''The role of accounting in public expenditure and monetary policy in the first century AD Roman Empire'', Accounting Historians Journal, Volume 22, Number 2, Birmingham, Alabama, December 1995, p.123, [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/articles/1028395.3253/1.PDF Olemiss.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of [[cash]], [[Commodity|commodities]], and transactions were kept scrupulously by military personnel of the [[Roman army]]. An account of small cash sums received over a few days at the [[fort]] of [[Vindolanda]] circa AD 110 shows that the fort could compute [[revenue]]s in cash on a daily basis, perhaps from sales of surplus supplies or goods manufactured in the camp, items dispensed to slaves such as ''cervesa'' ([[beer]]) and ''clavi caligares'' ([[Nail (fastener)|nails]] for boots), as well as commodities bought by individual soldiers. The basic needs of the fort were met by a mixture of direct [[manufacturing|production]], [[purchase]] and [[requisition]]; in one letter, a request for money to buy 5,000 ''modii'' (measures) of ''braces'' (a cereal used in brewing) shows that the fort bought provisions for a considerable number of people.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Alan K., ''Life and letters on the Roman frontier: Vindolanda and its people'' [[Routledge]], London, January 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-415-92024-7}}, p. 40-41,45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heroninos Archive]] is the name given to a huge collection of [[papyrus]] documents, mostly letters, but also including a fair number of accounts, which come from [[Roman Egypt]] in 3rd century AD. The bulk of the documents relate to the running of a large, private [[Estate (house)|estate]]&lt;ref&gt;Farag, Shawki M., ''The accounting profession in Egypt: Its origin and development'', [[University of Illinois]], 2009, p.7 [http://www.aucegypt.edu/academics/facultyresearch/Profiles/Documents/Science%20paper,%20Shawki%20Farag.pdf Aucegypt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; is named after Heroninos because he was ''phrontistes'' ([[Koine Greek]]: [[Management|manager]]) of the estate which had a complex and standardised system of accounting which was followed by all its local farm managers.&lt;ref&gt;Rathbone, Dominic: ''Economic Rationalism and Rural Society in Third-Century AD Egypt: The Heroninos Archive and the Appianus Estate'', [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-03763-8}}, 1991, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his own little accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as pieces of papyrus [[scroll]] into one big yearly account for each particular sub-division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave the owner the opportunity to take better [[economic]] decisions because the information was purposefully selected and arranged.&lt;ref&gt;Cuomo, Serafina: ''Ancient mathematics'', [[Routledge]], London, {{ISBN|978-0-415-16495-5}}, July 2001, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval and renaissance periods==

=== Double-entry bookkeeping ===
{{Main|Luca Pacioli|Double-entry bookkeeping system}}
When medieval Europe moved towards a [[monetary economy]] in the 13th century, [[Sedentism|sedentary]] merchants depended on bookkeeping to oversee multiple simultaneous transactions financed by [[bank loan]]s. One important breakthrough took place around that time: the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping,&lt;ref name="logica.ugent.be"&gt;{{cite web |last=Heeffer |first=Albrecht |title= On the curious historical coincidence of algebra and double-entry bookkeeping |work= Foundations of the Formal Sciences |publisher=[[Ghent University]] |date=November 2009 | page= 11 |url=http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/FOTFS2008-Heeffer.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as any bookkeeping system in which there was a [[debit and credit]] entry for each transaction, or for which the majority of transactions were intended to be of this form.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Geofrey T. "Early accounting in Northern Italy: The role of commercial development and the printing press in the expansion of double-entry from Genoa, Florence and Venice" (Critical Perspectives on Accounting, Vol. 4 No. 2, June 1993, pp. 113-140)&lt;/ref&gt; The historical origin of the use of the words "debit" and "credit" in accounting goes back to the days of single-entry bookkeeping, which had as its chief objective keeping track of amounts owed by customers ([[debtor]]s) and amounts owed to [[creditor]]s. ''Debit'' in [[Latin]] means "he owes" and ''credit'' in Latin means "he trusts".&lt;ref&gt;Thiéry, Michel: ''Did you say Debit?'', [[Assumption University (Thailand)]], AU-GSB e-Journal,  Vol. 2 No. 1, June 2009, p.35, [http://gsbejournal.au.edu/2V/Journal/DID%20YOU%20SAY%20DEBIT.pdf AU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Double-entry bookkeeping was pioneered in the Jewish community of the early-medieval Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, L. M., “Medieval Traders as International Change Agents: A Comparison
With Twentieth Century International Accounting Firms,” The Accounting
Historians Journal, 16(2) (1989): 107-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jewish bankers in Old Cairo, for example, used a double-entry bookkeeping system which predated the known usage of such a form in Italy, and whose records remain from the 11th century AD, found amongst the [[Cairo Geniza]].&lt;ref name="MEDIEVAL TRADERS AS INTERNATIONAL CHANGE AGENTS 1994 pp. 137-143"&gt;''MEDIEVAL TRADERS AS INTERNATIONAL CHANGE AGENTS: A COMMENT'', Michael Scorgie, The Accounting Historians Journal, Vol. 21, No. 1 (June 1994), pp. 137-143&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized that Italian merchants likely learned the method from their interaction with medieval Jewish merchants from the Middle East, however this question remains an area for further research.&lt;ref name="MEDIEVAL TRADERS AS INTERNATIONAL CHANGE AGENTS 1994 pp. 137-143"/&gt;  The earliest extant evidence of full double-entry bookkeeping appears in the  Farolfi ledger of 1299-1300.&lt;ref name="logica.ugent.be"/&gt; Giovanno Farolfi &amp; Company, a firm of [[Florence|Florentine]] merchants headquartered in [[Nîmes]], acted as [[moneylender]]s to the [[Archbishop of Arles]], their most important customer.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Geoffrey A., ''The Coming of Age of Double Entry: The Giovanni Farolfi Ledger of 1299-1300'', Accounting Historians Journal, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1977 p.80 [http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778 University of Mississippi]&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest discovered record of a complete double-entry system is the ''Messari'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: [[Treasurer]]'s) accounts of the city of [[Genoa]] in 1340. The ''Messari'' accounts contain debits and credits journalised in a [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] form and carry forward balances from the preceding year, and therefore enjoy general recognition as a double-entry system.&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: "Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli" (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.300),  [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] economist [[Benedetto Cotrugli]]'s 1458 treatise ''[[Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto]]'' contained the earliest known manuscript of a double-entry bookkeeping system. His manuscript was first published in 1573.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Chatfield|author2=Richard Vangermeersch|title=The History of Accounting (RLE Accounting): An International Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmnMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luca Pacioli]]'s ''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità]]'' (early Italian: "Review of [[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Ratio]] and Proportion") was first printed and published in [[Venice]] in 1494. It included a 27-page treatise on bookkeeping, ''"Particularis de Computis et Scripturis"'' (Latin: "Details of Calculation and Recording"). Pacioli wrote primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the [[mathematical puzzles]] it contained, and to aid the education of their sons. His work represents the first known printed treatise on bookkeeping; and it is widely believed{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to be the forerunner of modern bookkeeping practice. In ''Summa de arithmetica'', Pacioli introduced symbols for [[plus and minus]] for the first time in a printed book, symbols which became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. ''Summa de arithmetica'' was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain [[algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sangster, Greg Stoner &amp; Patricia McCarthy: "The market for Luca Pacioli's Summa Arithmetica" (Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History Conference, Cardiff, September 2007) p.1–2, [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/carbs/conferences/abfh07/summa.pdf Cardiff.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] economist [[Benedetto Cotrugli]]'s 1458 treatise ''[[Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto]]'' contained the earliest known manuscript of a double-entry bookkeeping system, however Cotrugli's manuscript was not officially published until 1573. In fact even at the time of writing his work in 1494 Pacoili was aware of Cotrugli’s efforts and credited Cortrugli with the origination of the double entry book keeping system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/siesc2.html|title=SIESC Croatia 2|website=www.croatianhistory.net|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accountsman.com/history-double-entry-book-keeping.html|title=History of double entry book keeping, origins of book keeping records|last=DesignfishStudio|website=www.accountsman.com|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Luca Pacioli did not invent double-entry bookkeeping,&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bruce G., &amp; Espeland, Wendy Nelson, ''Accounting for Rationality: Double-Entry Bookkeeping and the Rhetoric of Economic Rationality'', American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 97, No. 1, July 1991, pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt; his 27-page [[treatise]] on bookkeeping contained the first known published work on that topic, and is said to have laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping as it is practiced today.&lt;ref&gt;vSangster, Alan: "The printing of Pacioli's Summa in 1494: how many copies were printed?" (Accounting Historians Journal, John Carroll University, Cleveland, Ohio, June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Pacioli's treatise exhibits almost no [[originality]], it is generally considered{{by whom|date=June 2014}} as an important work, mainly because of its wide circulation; it was written in the [[vernacular]] [[Italian language]], and it was a printed book.&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: "Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli" (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.292), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacioli saw accounting as an ''ad-hoc'' ordering system devised by the merchant. Its regular use provides the merchant with continued information about his business, and allows him to evaluate how things are going and to act accordingly. Pacioli recommends the Venetian method of double-entry bookkeeping above all others. Three major books of account are at the direct basis of this system:

# the ''memoriale'' (Italian: [[memorandum]])
# the ''giornale'' ([[Journal (accounting)|Journal]])
# the ''quaderno'' ([[ledger]])

The ledger classes as the central document and is accompanied by an alphabetical [[Index (publishing)|index]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: "Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli" (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.296), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacioli's treatise gave instructions on recording barter transactions and transactions in a variety of currencies – both of which were far more common than today. It also enabled merchants to audit their own books and to ensure that the entries in the accounting records made by their bookkeepers complied with the method he described. Without such a system, all merchants who did not maintain their own records were at greater risk of theft by their employees and agents: it is not by accident that the first and last items described in his treatise concern maintenance of an accurate [[inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== The Renaissance cultural context ===
Accounting as it developed in Renaissance Europe also had moral and religious connotations, recalling the judgment of souls and the audit of sin.&lt;ref&gt;

But at the time, it also had a moral implication. Keeping one’s books balanced wasn’t simply a matter of law, but an imitation of God, who kept moral accounts of humanity and tallied them in the Books of Life and Death. [...] Accounting was closely tied to the notion of human audits and spiritual reckonings.

===Financial and management accounting ===
{{Main|Financial accounting|Management accounting}}
The development of [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] (especially from about 1600) built wider audiences for accounting information, as investors without first-hand knowledge of their [[Business operations|operations]] relied on accounts to provide the requisite information.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bruce G., &amp; Espeland, Wendy Nelson, ''Accounting for Rationality: Double-Entry Bookkeeping and the Rhetoric of Economic Rationality'', [[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 97, No. 1, July 1991, pp. 40-41,44 46,&lt;/ref&gt; This development resulted in a split of accounting systems for internal (i.e. [[management accounting]]) and external (i.e. [[financial accounting]]) purposes, and subsequently also in accounting and disclosure regulations and a growing need for independent attestation of external accounts by [[auditors]].&lt;ref name = "LW 1994"&gt;
Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: "Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli" (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.302), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern professional accounting ==
Modern Accounting is a product of centuries of thought, custom, habit, action and convention. Two concepts have formed the current state of the accountancy profession. Firstly, the development of the double-entry book-keeping system in the fourteenth and fifteenth century and secondly, accountancy professionalization which was created in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Thomas A|date=2013-05-01|title=Reflections on the origins of modern accounting|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1032373212470548|journal=Accounting History|volume=18|issue=2|pages=141–161|doi=10.1177/1032373212470548|issn=1032-3732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern profession of the chartered accountant originated in [[Scotland]] in the nineteenth century. During this time, accountants often belonged to the same associations as [[solicitor]]s, and the latter solicitors sometimes offered accounting services to their clients. Early modern accounting had similarities to today's [[forensic accounting]]:&lt;ref name = "CA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2002/june-july/features/camagazine23900.aspx|title=Silent sleuths|author=Donna Bailey Nurse|publisher=AICPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Like forensic accountants today, accountants then incorporated the duties of expert financial witnesses into their general services rendered. An 1824 circular announcing the accounting practice of one James McClelland of Glasgow promises he will make “statements for laying before arbiters, courts or council.”&lt;ref name = "CA" /&gt;

In July 1854 The Institute of Accountants in Glasgow petitioned [[Queen Victoria]] for a [[Royal Charter]]. The Petition, signed by 49 Glasgow accountants, argued that the profession of accountancy had long existed in Scotland as a distinct profession of great respectability, and that although the number of practitioners had been originally few, the number had been rapidly increasing. The petition also pointed out that accountancy required a varied group of skills; as well as mathematical skills for calculation, the accountant had to have an acquaintance with the general principles of the [[legal system]] as they were frequently employed by the courts to give evidence on financial matters. The Edinburgh Society of accountants adopted the name "Chartered Accountant" for members.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, John R., "History of Accounting" (ClubExpress, 2002) Ch.12; From "A History of Accounting and Accountants" by Richard Brown, 1905,&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 19th century, Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]] was in full swing, and [[London]] was the financial centre of the world. With the growth of the [[limited liability company]] and large scale manufacturing and logistics, demand surged for more technically proficient accountants capable of handling the increasingly complex world of high speed global transactions, able to calculate figures like asset depreciation and inventory valuation and cognizant of the latest changes in legislation such as [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844|the new Company law]], then being introduced. As companies proliferated, the demand for reliable accountancy shot up, and the profession rapidly became an integral part of the business and financial system.

To improve their status and combat criticism of low standards, local [[professional bodies]] in England amalgamated to form the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]], established by [[royal charter]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="Perks16"&gt;{{cite book |author=Perks, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Accounting and Society |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |ISBN= 0-412-47330-5 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially with just under 600 members, the newly formed institute expanded rapidly; it soon drew up standards of conduct and [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s for admission and members were authorised to use the professional designations "FCA" (Fellow Chartered Accountant), for a firm partner and "ACA" (Associate Chartered Accountant) for a qualified member of an accountant's staff. In the [[United States]] the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] was established in 1887.

The '''Institute of Business Ethics''' or '''IBE''' is a [[non-profit]] [[professional body|professional organisation]] based in [[London]], which encourages high standards of business behaviour based on [[ethical values]]. They raise public awareness of the importance of doing business ethically, and collaborate with other UK and international organisations with interests and expertise in business ethics.

==Overview==
The IBE helps organisations to strengthen their ethics culture to encourage high standards of business behaviour based on ethical values.  The IBE assists in the development, implementation and embedding of effective and relevant ethics and [[corporate responsibility]] policies and programmes.  In addition, the IBE helps organisations to provide guidance to [[employees]] and build relationships of trust with their principal [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

The Institute's main aim is to raise public awareness of the importance of doing business ethically, and collaborate with other UK and international organisations with interests and expertise in business ethics.

==History==
The Institute of Business Ethics was founded in 1986 by businesses concerned that, following the [[deregulation]] of the [[City of London]], ‘one’s word would no longer be one’s bond’. [[Big Bang (financial markets)#Consequences|The Big Bang]] radically changed the way the [[London Stock Exchange]] operated, doing away with much of what was seen by critics as ‘the old boys’ network’ and internationalising London’s [[financial markets]].

Originally, it operated as a fund within the Christian Association of Business Executives (CABE), a registered [[charitable organization|charity]] established to promote the study and application of [[Christian ethics|Christian moral principles]] in the conduct of business.

In 2000, the Institute obtained separate [http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/search-for-a-charity/?txt=institute+of+business+ethics charitable status]; its charitable article being ''"to advance public education in business ethics and related subjects with particular reference to the study and application of ethical standards in the management and conduct of industry and business generally in the United Kingdom and elsewhere"''.

Since its founding, the IBE has published more than 20 books on business ethics topics; conducted [[Survey methodology|surveys]] on the use of codes of ethics within companies; developed [[training]] programmes in business ethics, from induction programmes to the [[board room]]; worked with [[academics]] and [[business schools]] to promote the study of business ethics within [[MBA]] and business studies courses; and offered advice and support to business ethics practitioners and their companies.

The IBE celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2011 by publishing a booklet with [http://www.ibe.org.uk/userassets/otherpdfs/25on25.pdf analysis from 25 thought leaders] on what was in store for the business ethics world in the next 25 years.

[[File:0 Quincaillerie Michel - Soignies (2).JPG|thumb|Inside a typical ironmonger's in [[Soignies]] (Belgium).]]
[[File:Quincaillerie.jpg|thumb|An ironmonger's shop in [[France]], with iron goods and other consumer goods.]]
'''Ironmongery''' originally referred, first, to the manufacture of [[iron]] goods and, second, to the place of sale of such items for domestic rather than industrial use. In both contexts, the term has expanded to include items made of [[steel]], [[aluminium]], [[brass]], or other [[metal]]s, as well as [[plastic]]s.

The term '''ironmonger''' as a supplier of [[consumer goods]] is still widely used in [[Great Britain]], the US equivalent being "[[hardware store]]". Many [[architectural ironmongery]] items (for example, door handles, locks, hinges, etc.) are also manufactured for [[wholesale]] and commercial use in offices and other buildings.

==History==
Dealing in ironware has a long tradition, dating back to the first recorded use of the metal to fashion useful objects as long ago as 1200 BC, and studying the movement of such goods around the world, often over long distances, has provided valuable insight into early societies and trading patterns.

By [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], skilled metalworkers were highly prized for their ability to create a wide range of things, from weaponry, tools and implements to more humble domestic items, and the local [[blacksmith]] remained the principal source of ironmongery until [[Industrial Revolution|the Industrial Revolution]] saw the introduction of [[mass production]] from the late 18th century. In the areas where [[wrought iron|ironware]] and [[Nail (engineering)|nails]] were manufactured, particularly the [[Black Country]], an ironmonger was a manufacturer operating under the [[domestic system]], who put out iron to [[blacksmith|smiths]], nailers, or other metal workers, and then organised the distribution of the finished products to [[retailers]].

In the second half of the 19th century, Victorian ironmongery offered a treasurehouse of appealing metalwork, with elaborate manufacturers’ catalogues offering literally thousands of objects to meet each and every need, almost all of which sought to combine practicality with pleasing design.
[[File:Moir Token.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Obverse and reverse|Obverse]] of a penny [[Token coin|token]] of [[Joseph Moir]], advertising "wholesale and retail ironmongery," 1850.]]

The second half of the 20th century saw the steady decline of ironmongers’ shops. Although every small town in Britain used to have at least one, their fate has mirrored that of many traditional emporia. The number of ironmongers has fallen dramatically with the advent of DIY superstores that offer a complete range of ironmongery and associated products under one roof, and more recently the arrival of comprehensive [[mail order]] catalogues and internet suppliers.

However, there has been a simultaneous revival in the fortunes of old-style hand-forged ironmongery, with strong interest in the authentic restoration of period homes leading to demand for items such as traditional iron door handles, [[Doorknob|door knobs]], [[door knockers]], letter plates, locks, hinges, hooks, cabinet fittings and window furniture. There has even been renewed use of  “blacksmith nails” – four-sided hand-made rosehead nails. This is typical of a trend that has seen greater appreciation of designs that have stood the test of time, that has allowed hand-forged ironmongery to find a much wider application than use in property restoration – although the practice of incorporating traditional ironmongery into contemporary housing has been helped by thoroughly modern techniques like galvanising and [[powder coating]] to inhibit [[rust]].

==Other uses of the term 'ironmonger'==

In some areas, "ironmonger" is also slang for an [[arms dealer]], giving rise to numerous fictional characters by the name.

The '''J. Erik Jonsson Central Library''' is the Main Library Branch of the [[Dallas Public Library]] system.  It is located at 1515 Young Street in the [[Government District, Dallas, Texas|Government District]] of [[downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]], directly across from [[Dallas City Hall]].

== About ==
The structure was built to replace the [[Old Dallas Central Library]]. The new structure consists of ten stories, eight stories above ground floor and two below ground floor, designed in the [[modern architecture|modernist]] architectural style.  The design of the nearby [[Dallas City Hall]] inspired the design of the library &amp;ndash; the library's upper floors are oriented ''away from'' Young Street while (symmetrically) the upper floors of City Hall are oriented ''toward'' Marilla Street (an open area between Young and Marilla Streets separates the buildings).

It was named for [[J. Erik Jonsson]], a founder of [[Texas Instruments]] and mayor of Dallas, and long-time sympathetic supporter and patron of the library system. He also led the ten-year drive to raise private funds that allowed the construction of a state-of-the-art main library.

During the 2000s the library embarked on a long-range renovation program which will reorganize each floor's layout, update interior finishes, repair maintenance issues and overall create a more inviting experience.

'''Louis Jacques Balsan''' (September 16, 1868 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1956) was a French aviator and industrialist, born at [[Châteauroux]] (Indre) in 1868, who was the second husband of society beauty [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]], Duchess of Marlborough. He married her immediately after her divorce from the [[9th Duke of Marlborough]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt; 

==Early life==
Balsan was born on September 16, 1868 in [[Châteauroux]], [[France]].  He was the son of [[Auguste Balsan]] and Marie ([[née]] Dupuytren).  Among his siblings was brother was [[Étienne Balsan]], the first patron of [[Coco Chanel]],&lt;ref name="D'Hauterive"&gt;{{cite book |last1=D'Hauterive |first1=M. Borel |title=Annuaire De La Noblesse De France et Des Maisons Souveraines De L'Europe, Volume 44 |date=1888 |publisher=Typographie De E. Plon, Nourrit |location=[[Paris]] |page=245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sister, Viscountess Villeneuve de Bargemont of [[Davenescourt]], France.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;

Through his mother, he was descended from [[Guillaume Dupuytren]], the [[anatomist]] and [[surgery|surgeon]] who treated [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and, today, is best known today for his description of [[Dupuytren's contracture]], which is named after him and which he first operated on in 1831 and published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dupuytren|first=Guillaume|date=May 10, 1834|journal=The Lancet|title=Clinical Lectures on Surgery|volume=22|issue=558|pages=222–5|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)77708-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Balsan came from a manufacturing family who created and run [[Balsan (Company)]] which supplied the French Army with uniforms from the time of [[Napoleon]] onwards which were the origin of the famous cloth "the blue horizon". The family's textile factories were situated at [[Châteauroux]].&lt;ref name="1921Engagement"/&gt; 
 
==Career==
At the age of 24, Jacques Balsan entered the family business and traveled the world, buying wool. 

Passionate about ballooning, in September 1900, while in the balloon ''St. Louis'' that was inflated with [[illuminating gas]], he remained aloft for 39 hours and nine minutes.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;  Later that same month, he earned the record for the highest altitude flight at the "[[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]", by rising to a height of 8,558 meters;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation.maisons-champagne.com/dir.php?centre=04-bio-balsan&amp;menu=11 Champagne|Berceau De L'Aviation Du Monde, Jacques Balsan]&lt;/ref&gt; the following month traveling over 1,345 kilometers (roughly 850 miles) from [[Vincennes]] to [[Opoczno|Opoezno]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;

A pioneer of flying, he bought his first aircraft in 1905, a [[Octave_Chanute|Chanute]]-type glider, and an airplane in 1909 and obtained a Number 22 licence to pilot aircraft.  He also took part in aviation experiments with the [[Wright brothers]] in [[Biarritz]] and in 1910, constructed his own small plane.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;  In February 1910, in his [[Blériot Aéronautique|Blériot]] [[monoplane]], he won the "[[The meeting of Heliopolis|Le Prix d'Héliopolis]]" (in [[Egypt]]).

===Military service===
During [[World War I]], he helped organize the [[Lafayette Escadrille]] along with [[William K. Vanderbilt]] and Dr. Edmund Gros, also a founder of the [[American Hospital of Paris]] and organizer of the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|American Ambulance Field Service]].&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;  Later, [[Michel-Joseph Maunoury|General Maunoury]] gave him charge of the aerial [[reconnaissance]] of the site of the [[First Battle of the Marne]]. In 1918, he went to London as chief of the [[French Air Force]] mission.  By the end of the War, he was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="1921Engagement"/&gt; 

During [[World War II]], he joined the [[Free French]] forces in London, taking part in the operations that liberated southern France.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:JB-125-1930-Jacques &amp; Consuelo-St Georges Motel.jpg|thumb|right|Jacques and Consuelo at [[Saint-Georges-Motel|St-Georges-Motel]], between 1930 and 1935.]]
Balsan first saw and immediately fell in love with wealthy American, [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]], when she was 17, before her marriage to the 9th [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Duke of Marlborough]].&lt;ref name="1921Engagement"&gt;{{cite news |title=VANDERBILT TROTH REPORT IS REVIVED Marlborough Duchess's Rumored Engagement to Jacques Balsan No Surprise.HE IS FRENCH SPORTSMAN Duchess Recently Bought an Estate Near Monte Carlo—Both Are Now Among Colonists on Riviera. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/02/13/112670889.pdf |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 13, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was considered the most eligible woman of the late [[Victorian Age]].  A memorable portrait of her by [[Carolus Duran]] hangs at [[Blenheim Palace]].  Balsan married her on 4 July 1921 (when he was 52 and she was 44), after which she was styled 'Mme Jacques Balsan',&lt;ref name="1921OffEngage"&gt;{{cite news |title=Give Notice of Coming Marriage of Col.

Known for his attentions to her, it was a very happy marriage.  Consuelo wrote to her close friend [[Winston Churchill]], during [[World War II]], while Jacques worked with the [[Free French]] in [[London]], to request his special protection and safe return. Winston obligingly facilitated his safe return to America.

The Balsans were hosting Winston and Clementine Churchill in September 1939, just before the outbreak of war at their chateau [[Saint-Georges-Motel]], near [[Dreux]] north of [[Paris]]. They also owned a property in [[Èze]] (Alpes-Maritimes) where they received a number of celebrities such as the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught|Duke of Connaught]], son of Queen Victoria, The Maharajah de Kapurthala and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balsan|first1=Consuelo Vanderbilt|title=The glitter and the gold|date=2011|publisher=Hodder|location=London|isbn=1444730983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balsan supported his wife's work with French children. They lived in their ''[[hotel particulier]]'' in Paris, 9 avenue [[Avenue_Charles-Floquet|Charles-Floquet]].

[[Consuelo Vanderbilt]]'s ghosted autobiography ''The Glitter and The Gold'' refers to her time with Balsan as "gold", as opposed to the "glitter" of her earlier, aristocratic marriage.  In it, she tells the story of the Balsans' daring escape from the Nazis through Spain to Portugal and eventually to America, where they lived for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Amanda Mackenzie.

==Challenges==
Crain's accounting background appeared well matched to the challenges he soon faced as president, in that Louisiana's public institutions of higher education confronted unprecedented budget cuts and looming budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Don Ellzey, Leaner university: Crain expects more budget cuts will be "very unpopular" in ''Daily Star'' (Hammond, Louisiana), 2010 January 15, pp. 1A, 5A (web version = [http://www.hammondstar.com/articles/2010/01/15/top_stories/education/5933.txt Budget cuts won't be popular, says Crain], accessed 2010 January 16).&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the student newspaper, Crain announced mid-academic year eliminations of 35 positions''';''' expecting "even deeper cuts in the future," Crain said:

:These changes would almost certainly involve the elimination of programs, including academic programs, and the termination of some tenured faculty. Despite the challenges we have dealt with and may still face, we remain absolutely committed to the success of our students and the ongoing viabillity of the university, albeit in what may be a smaller scope and scale.&lt;ref&gt;Budget Cuts Take Toll on Campus Jobs" in [[Southeastern Louisiana University#Lion's Roar|''Lion's Roar'']] (Southeastern Louisiana University), Volume 81 Issue 17 (2010 January 17), p. 1 (not online).

He was the youngest son of Mendel Landsberg, a tradesman in Warsaw, and Laia Lewin. His elder brethren [[Hilary Landsberg]] (1834–1898) and [[Alexander Landsberg]] (1859–1928) were clothing manufacturers in [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]].  

In 1885, Leopold Landsberg settled in Łódź and opened his factory (at Lonkowa Street), producing female clothing. By World War I, goods were selling to Russian markets. In 1905, as many as 70 workers employed in his factory. 
He was a treasurer of the Union of the Łódź Manufacturers. He belonged to the owners of the Joint-Stock Company of Cloth Factories in Tomaszów Mazowiecki.

After World War I, Leopold Landsberg's factory called “the Mechanical Weaving Mill of Wool Products” (in Polish “Tkalnia Mechaniczna Wyrobów Wełnianych”) was situated at Srodmiejska Street. Many wool goods were selling in local (Polish) market.
  
He was a president of the Jewish Association for Caring of the Sicks “Bykur Cholim”. 

He died in Łódź and was buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Łódź at Bracka Street (Left side, Section D, tomb No. 107). His wife Sara (Sura) Salomea Hirschberg (1861–1944), daughter of Yehuda and Rayzla née Birnbaum, was buried in the neighbouring grave (No. 106).

==Development==

While A&amp;L Goodbody and Arthur Cox still lead Irish corporate law,&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Matheson has grown with the rise in the [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] to become one of Ireland's "big four" corporate law firms (with McCannFitzgerald).&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;  Matheson focuses on the two legal areas most associated with the [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]], namely tax structuring for U.S. multinationals (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Pepsi, all Matheson clients),&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; and creating [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]]–domiciled corporate tax structures and tax efficient vehicles for various asset management and asset financing activities (particularly [[securitisation]] special purpose vehicles, which the [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] leads in the EU–28).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-is-top-eurozone-jurisdiction-for-secretive-spvs-36047198.html|title=Ireland is top Eurozone jurisdiction for SPVs|publisher=Irish Independent|date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IDSA_Securitisation-Industry-in-Ireland.pdf|title=Ireland: The Leading European Jurisdiction for SPVs, Structured Finance and Securitised Structures|publisher=Irish Debt Securities Association|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Matheson founded the '''Irish Debt Securities Association''' (or IDSA), which acts as the industry lobby group for the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)]] (the [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]]'s main [[securitisation]] structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.matheson.com/news-and-insights/article/matheson-welcomes-irish-debt-securities-association| title = Matheson welcomes Irish Debt Securities Association| publisher=Matheson|date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/lobby-group-says-tax-loophole-closure-may-dampen-nama-sales-1.2783286| title = Lobby group says tax loophole closure may dampen Nama sales| publisher=Irish Times|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[Feargal O'Rourke]] in [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] (Ireland [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]]), Matheson has been an active lobbyist for expanding various Irish legal structures and amending taxation controls to help grow the [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]], which can lead to conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/vulture-funds-using-shadow-lobbying-system-burton-says-1.2961441| title = Vulture funds using ‘shadow’ lobbying system, Burton says| publisher=Irish Times|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Matheson's leadership in [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] tax structures (or [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS tools]], and [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS tools]]), makes makes them a noted industry commentator.&lt;ref&gt;Also discussed was the need for Ireland to continually review and update the legal framework to reflect the speed of change and to cater for tangible assets so they are ‘fit for purpose’.{{cite web|url=https://businessandfinance.com/news/matheson-increasing-ip-onshoring-ireland-brexit-benefit/| title = Matheson identifies increasing onshoring of Intellectual Property tax structures to Ireland as Brexit benefit| publisher=Business &amp; Finance|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. multinational tax schemes===

{{See also|Double Irish arrangement|Corporate tax haven}}

Matheson's leadership in the Irish tax strategies of U.S. multinationals, (or [[BEPS]] tools), has attracted attention from U.S. media over the years.  In 2005, the Wall Street Journal ran a story on how Microsoft used an Irish subsidiary called "Round Ireland One" to avoid billions in U.S. taxes which was structured and registered in Matheson's offices (was then Matheson Ormsby Prentice, or MOPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113132761685289706| title=Irish Subsidiary Lets Microsoft Slash Taxes in U.S. and Europe| publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=7 November 2005|quote=Round Island's legal address is in the headquarters of a Dublin law firm, Matheson Ormsby Prentice, that advertises its expertise in helping multinational companies use Ireland to shelter income from taxes.|author=Glenn R.

Like other tax law firms in the [[International Financial Services Centre]], Matheson has openly marketed [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS tools]] with [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]] of under 3%.&lt;ref name="matheson1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matheson.com/images/uploads/documents/China_Article_-_March_2013.pdf|title=Ireland as a European gateway jurisdiction for China – outbound and inbound investments | quote= The tax deduction can be used to achieve an effective tax rate of 2.5% on profits from the exploitation of the IP purchased.

Mainstream U.S. media channels have singled out Matheson in Dublin, as a significant centre for U.S. multinational tax strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/americansfortaxfairness/nine-little-places-that-are-home-for-one-million-c-gsk9| title=Nine Little Places That Are Home For One Million Corporations| publisher=Buzzfeed|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, Matheson is akin to the situation of Irish PwC Managing Partner [[Feargal O'Rourke]], whose development of the [[double Irish]] [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS tool]], has also made him the subject of investigative pieces by the U.S. financial media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-28/man-making-ireland-tax-avoidance-hub-globally-proves-local-hero| title=Man Making Ireland Tax Avoidance Hub Proves Local Hero | publisher=Bloomberg News|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloomberg recognise that O'Rourke, while being at the vanguard of legitimate but aggressive U.S. multinational tax planning, is considered a "hero" in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/controversial-tax-strategies-brainchild-of-orourkes-son-29721835.html| title=Controversial tax strategies brainchild of O'Rourke's son| publisher=Irish Independent|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Matheson was criticised in the Irish media when it was revealed that U.S. [[distressed debt]] funds (known pejoratively as "vulture funds" in the Irish media),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/how-to-get-vulture-funds-to-pay-tax-1.2740830|title=How to get vulture funds to pay tax|publisher=Irish Times|date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitzvah Day International''' is an annual day of faith-based social action that takes place in November each year, primarily in the [[United Kingdom]]. On Mitzvah Day each year, community groups and individuals undertake a range of [[Volunteering|volunteer]] projects for those in need in their local community. Organizations register with Mitzvah Day, which in turn helps match volunteers with local projects. The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 2013, close to 30,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2013-11-19 |title=In Pictures: Mitzvah Day 2013 |url=http://jewishnews.co.uk/in-pictures-mitzvah-day-2013/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though based within the [[British Jews|UK's Jewish Community]], Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithweek.org/index.php/events/events/extended-list-test?viewid=16&amp;vmode=d&amp;date=2013-11-17 |title=UK Inter Faith Week: Events for Sunday, November 17, 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2013-11-17 |website=Inter Faith Week |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Anna |date=2013-11-15 |title=Interfaith Mitzvah Day project in Whetstone |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/10812704.Interfaith_Mitzvah_Day_project/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halkon |first=Ruth |date=2013-11-06 |title=Mitzvah Day and National Interfaith Week events in Aldenham and Radlett |url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/10790049.Gathering_together_to_make_the_community_better/ |newspaper=Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'[[Mitzvah]]' is the Hebrew biblical term for 'deed' or '[[613 mitzvot|commandment]]', which has come to mean 'good deed' or 'charitable act' in contemporary [[English Language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mitzvah |title=Mitzvah: definition |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Miriam Webster Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 date is November 19.&lt;ref&gt;http://mitzvahday.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Mitzvah Day International was founded by Laura Marks in 2005, who, upon returning to her native UK from a period spent in [[Los Angeles]], decided to bring the 'Mitzvah Day' concept she became familiar with through the [[Temple Israel of Hollywood]] [[synagogue]] back to the UK. Though the Mitzvah Day she was familiar with (and most Mitzvah Days in the US) was based around a single community or [[Synagogue|congregation]], her concept for Mitzvah Day in the UK was to unite Jewish community and other groups around a single coordinated day of social action across the country. Mitzvah Day was originally associated with the [[Jewish Community Centre for London]], and became registered as an independent charity in the United Kingdom in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/about-us.html |title=About Us |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Mitzvah Day |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Endorsements ==
Mitzvah Day has been publicly endorsed by many public figures in the United Kingdom, including [[UK Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]],&lt;ref name=threeleaders&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharma |first=Suruchi |date=2011-11-11 |title=Three main party leaders back Mitzvah Day |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/mitzvah/9359755.Three_main_party_leaders_back_Mitzvah_Day/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats|Leader]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]],&lt;ref name=threeleaders /&gt; [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Ed Miliband]]&lt;ref name=threeleaders /&gt; Former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolfisz |first=Francine |date=2010-11-19 |title=Tony Blair praises Mitzvah Day for "building bridges" between faiths |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/mitzvah/8676992.Tony_Blair_praises_Mitzvah_Day_for__building_bridges__between_faiths/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Tony |date=2010-11-18 |title=Faiths come together in joint action |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/nov/18/tony-blair-mitzvah-day |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London Mayor]] [[Boris Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2011-11-21 |title=Boris Johnson's Mitzvah Day message |url=http://www.thejc.com/videos/news-videos/boris-johnsons-mitzvah-day-message |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom]] [[Jonathan Sacks]], and [[The Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Welby |first=Justin |date=2013-11-15 |title=As Archbishop of Canterbury, I'm a Mitzvah Day fan |url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/113231/as-archbishop-canterbury-im-a-mitzvah-day-fan |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |location=London |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/awards-and-endorsements.html |title=Awards and Endorsements |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Mitzvah Day International |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won a Prime Minister's [[Big Society]] Award in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsocietyawards.org/award-winners/mitzvah-day/ |title=Big Society Award Winners: 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Big Society Awards |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mitzvah-day-wins-prime-ministers-big-society-award |title=Mitzvah Day wins Prime Minister's Big Society Award |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2011-11-30 |website=Big Society Awards, Press Release |publisher=Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International expansion ==
Headquartered in [[London]], UK, the event has since spread to include participation from many international partners, primarily in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], and [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitzvahday.org.uk/around-the-world.html |title=Mitzvah Day Around The World |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2011-11-30 |website=Mitzvah Day International |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the name of the organization officially changed from 'Mitzvah Day' to 'Mitzvah Day International' to reflect the growing participation of community groups outside the UK.

'''Mohammed Hussein Ali Al-'Amoudi''' ({{lang-am|ሞሐመድ አልዐሙዲ}}, {{lang-ar|محمد حسين علي العمودي}}) is an Ethiopian and Saudi Arabian [[billionaire]] businessman. He was born in Ethiopia in 1946 to a Yemeni father and an Ethiopian mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/mohammed-al-amoudi/|title=Mohammed Al Amoudi|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, his net worth was estimated by ''[[Forbes]]'' at approximately $10.9 billion and a relative fall in net value was linked to the global fall in oil and gold prices at the time of estimation.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; He was also listed as Ethiopia's richest man, the second richest Saudi Arabian citizen in the world and the second richest black person in the world.&lt;ref name="mfonobong2013-03"&gt;{{cite web | first=Mfonobong | last=Nsehe | title=The Black Billionaires 2013 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2013/03/05/the-black-billionaires-2013/ | work=[[Forbes]] | date=5 March 2013 | accessdate=24 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Amoudi made his fortune in construction and [[real estate]] before branching out to buy [[oil refineries]] in Sweden and Morocco. He is the largest individual foreign investor in Ethiopia and a major investor in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Business activities==
Al Amoudi owns a broad portfolio of businesses in construction, energy, agriculture, mining, hotels, healthcare and manufacturing amongst others. His businesses are largely to be found within two [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[holding company|holding]] and operating companies, [[Corral Petroleum Holdings]] and [[MIDROC]], both which he owns and manages. He employs over 70,000 people through these companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info |title=Home - Sheikh Al Amoudi &amp;#124; Authorized &amp; Official |publisher=Sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi's construction company consortium, ''Mohammed International Development Research and Organization Companies'', also known as MIDROC, won a contract to build Saudi Arabia's estimated $30 billion nationwide [[underground oil storage]] complex in 1988. MIDROC acquired Yanbu Steel in Saudi Arabia in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bus-ex.com/article/yanbu-steel-company |title=Yanbu Steel Company &amp;#124; Business Excellence Magazine |publisher=Bus-ex.com |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his business interests in Ethiopia, he also owns oil refineries in [[Morocco]] and [[Sweden]] ([[Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB]]) and is engaged in [[energy exploration]] and production off West Africa and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr-inside.com/new-market-report-svenska-petroleum-exploration-r2542679.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614091935/http://www.pr-inside.com/new-market-report-svenska-petroleum-exploration-r2542679.htm|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Addis Ababa]] [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] is said to be among the finest hotels in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/mohammed-al-amoudi |title=Mohammed Al Amoudi |publisher=Forbes |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has recently pledged US$275 million alongside other Saudi and South Korean investors through MIDROC to finance a factory to build Saudi Arabia's first car, to be called [[KSU Gazal-1|Gazal-1]], in a project initiated by [[King Saud University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4774278|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230233319/http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4774278|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-30|title=KSU mobilizes $500 million for new car company|date=2010-12-30|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-29/midroc-to-get-55-of-saudi-car-plant-for-275-million-spa-says.html |title=Midroc to Get 55% of Saudi Car Plant for $275 Million, SPA Says - Bloomberg Business |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in September 2011, it was announced that he planned to invest around US$1.07bn (4bn Saudi Riyals) in two major Saudi industrial projects (phosphate derivatives and sulfur) in [[Ras Al Khair]] [Eastern Region] and [[Jubail Industrial City]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZW20110929000084]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopian investments===
Al Amoudi has invested in Ethiopia since the mid-1980s. He now has business interests there, largely operated through MIDROC Ethiopia which was created in 1994. In 2011 it made 1.4bn birr (US$70m) of profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2merkato.com/20111014451/midroc-ethiopia-announces-13-billion-birr-profit |title=Ethiopia Earns $71.1 Million From Leather Exports |publisher=2merkato.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Al Amoudi acquired 69% of Ethiopia’s sole tyre manufacturer [[Addis Tyre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://addisfortune.com/Al-Amoudi%E2%80%99s%20Horizon%20Acquires%20Matador-ATC%E2%80%99s%2069pc%20for%20$18m.htm |accessdate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211104613/http://www.addisfortune.com/Al-Amoudi%E2%80%99s%20Horizon%20Acquires%20Matador-ATC%E2%80%99s%2069pc%20for%20%2418m.htm |archivedate=11 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has a substantial investment in cement production through [[Durba]] Midroc which was founded in 2008.&lt;ref name="addisfortune1"&gt;[http://addisfortune.com/EEPCo%20Grants%20Cement%20Factory%20Own%20Power%20Station.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major cement plant near Chancho was backed in part by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-20/ethiopian-cement-plants-to-double-capacity-amid-construction-industry-boom.html |title=Ethiopian Cement Plants to Double Capacity Amid Building Boom - Bloomberg Business |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.addisfortune.com/Derba%20Midroc%20Wants%2050MW%20for%20Factory.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521045939/http://www.addisfortune.com/Derba%20Midroc%20Wants%2050MW%20for%20Factory.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-05-21|title=Derba Midroc Wants 50MW for Factory|date=2011-05-21|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, it was announced that the Ethiopian Electric Power Company [EEPco] would provide the Derba cement plant with 50MW of electricity.&lt;ref name="addisfortune1"/&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
The Al Amoudi-owned ''Saudi Star Agricultural Development'' Plc plans to [[Land development|develop]] up to {{convert|500000|ha|acre}} of Ethiopian land for sugar, [[edible oil]], and grain production.&lt;ref name="sheikhmohammedalamoudi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info/backgrounders/saudi-star-agribusiness|title=Official Web Site: Saudi Star Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Saudi Star announced a further investment of $2.5 billion in Ethiopian rice projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011032496586 |title=Al-Amoudi to invest $2.5b in Ethiopia farm &amp;#124; Business |publisher=Saudi Gazette |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003183339/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011032496586 |archivedate=3 October 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 10,000 hectares have been taken up in 60-year leases and the company plans to rent an additional 290,000 hectares.&lt;ref name="sheikhmohammedalamoudi2"/&gt; The company had reportedly purchased $80 million in equipment from [[Caterpillar Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLure |first=Jason |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aIFZN6VBgYR4 |title=Saudi Billionaire Invests in Ethiopian Farms, Fortune Reports |publisher=Bloomberg |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, President [[Girma Wolde-Giorgis]] of Ethiopia stated that “a substantial investment in agricultural development was key to improving the quality of life across Africa” and that Saudi Star’s investment programme would benefit both Ethiopia and its important trading partner, Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article481429.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802000556/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article481429.ece|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-02|title=Ethiopia pledges to work closely with the Kingdom in manpower sector - Arab News|date=2011-08-02|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi also owns [[coffee plantation|land used to produce coffee]]. Of the {{convert|2295|ha|acre}} of land acquired by Ethio Agri-CEFT (which he owns) in the [[Sheka Zone]] of Ethiopia, it has only covered 1,010 hectares with coffee and shade trees, with the rest remaining as natural vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newbusinessethiopia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=536:ethiopias-challenge-balancing-agriculture-with-environmental-protection-&amp;catid=28:enviroment&amp;Itemid=51|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016051551/http://newbusinessethiopia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=536:ethiopias-challenge-balancing-agriculture-with-environmental-protection-&amp;catid=28:enviroment&amp;Itemid=51|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-10-16|title=Ethiopia’s Challenge: Balancing Agriculture with Environmental Protection {{!}} NewBusinessEthiopia|date=2011-10-16|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he donated 10 million birr (US$500k) to the proposed Ethiopian National Coffee Museum in Ethiopia’s Kaffa Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waltainfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25334&amp;Itemid=134|title=Walta Information Center|website=www.waltainfo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, in response to an appeal from Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] for popular support for the financing of the [[Renaissance Dam]] in North West Ethiopia which will triple the country’s hydro-electric power, Al Amoudi pledged a donation of 1.5bn birr (around US$88m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsdire.com/news/2124-ethiopia-al-amoudi-pledges-15-billion-br-for-renaissance-dam.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927231547/http://www.newsdire.com/news/2124-ethiopia-al-amoudi-pledges-15-billion-br-for-renaissance-dam.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-27|title=Ethiopia: Al-Amoudi pledges 1.5 Billion Br. for Renaissance dam » Ethiopian News - Everything that Happens!|date=2011-09-27|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Amoudi has not been seen since his abduction and detention, and it is feared that he is being tortured to force him to transfer his wealth to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. It is also possible that he could have been murdered. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had tried to secure his release, but was unsuccessful.

==Philanthropy==
Al Amoudi has committed funds to support healthcare and sport in Saudi Arabia, the US, Europe and Africa.&lt;ref name="sheikhmohammedalamoudi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info/ |title=Official Web Site - Sheikh Al Amoudi &amp;#124; Authorized &amp; Official |publisher=Sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/speaker/3145|title=Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi|publisher=Economist Insights |date= |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He funded a [[breast cancer]] research centre at [[King Abdulaziz University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616061137/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-06-16|title=Arab News Newspaper|date=2012-06-16|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi was named as one of the [[William J. Clinton Foundation]] Donors, according to information released as part of an obligation placed on former [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] when he supported [[Hillary Clinton]]'s nomination as Secretary of State.

==Defamation actions==
In December 2010 Al Amoudi initiated a claim in the English [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] against [[Elias Kifle]] of the Washington, D.C.-based ''[[Ethiopian Review]]'' claiming damages for [[libel]]. In July 2011 Kifle was ordered to pay £175,000 in damages for publishing false information.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14345007 | work=BBC News | title=Ethiopian billionaire wins libel action in UK | date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ethiopian Review'' had also repeated unwarranted material relating to his family and to matters previously dealt with in the ''Al Amoudi v. Brisard'' case of 2005. M. Brisard had made serious and unwarranted allegations concerning engagement in the funding of terrorism in the wake of 9/11 but had subsequently apologised for the accusation. The judge found the statements to be untrue and stated that Al Amoudi "is implacably opposed to terrorism in all its forms”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-7002 |title=Count the readers before suing for internet libel |publisher=Out-law.com |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi was honoured for his achievements in economics and philanthropy at the 19th Arab Economic Forum Summit in 2011, with special reference to his commitment to sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midroc-ceo.com/?q=Saudi%20Investor%20Honored |title=Saudi Investor Honored At Economic Forum &amp;#124; MIDROC Ethiopia Technology Group |publisher=Midroc-ceo.com |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association of State Boards of Accountancy''' ('''NASBA''') is an association dedicated to serving the 55 state boards of accountancy. These are the boards that regulate the accountancy profession in the [[United States of America]].

There is one board for each of the 50 states, plus the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].

==Structure of the U.S. accounting profession==
In the United States, the designation of [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) is granted at state level. Individual CPAs are not required to belong to the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA), although many do.

NASBA acts primarily as a forum for the state boards themselves, as opposed to AICPA which represents CPAs as individuals.

==Role of NASBA==
NASBA's primary role is to:

* Act as a forum for state boards to discuss issues of common concern
* Encourage reciprocal recognition of the CPA qualification between states
* Enable state boards to speak with one voice in dealing with [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants|AICPA]], the Federal Government, and other stakeholders

NASBA is a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

==Uniform CPA Examination==
Responsibility for the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]] is shared between state boards of accountancy, the AICPA and NASBA:

* State boards of accountancy are responsible for assessing eligibility of candidates to sit for the CPA examination. Boards are also the final authority on communicating exam results received from NASBA to candidates.
* The AICPA is responsible for setting and scoring the examination, and transmitting scores to NASBA.
* NASBA maintains the National Candidate Database and matches score data received from the AICPA with candidate details. Most states offer online score reporting on NASBA's website at www.nasba.org. NASBA also maintains records for those who have passed the exam.

The AICPA and NASBA also coordinate and maintain ''mutual recognition agreements'' with foreign accountancy institutes. The only countries with such agreements include[[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Ireland]], [[Mexico]], Scotland&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005424/en/Professional-Accounting-Organizations-UK-U.S.-Sign-Mutual|title=Professional Accounting Organizations in UK and US Sign Mutual Recognition Agreement|last=|first=|date=|work=Business Wire|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/aicpa-and-nasba-sign-pact-with-scottish-accountants|title=AICPA and NASBA sign pact with Scottish Accountants|last=Cohn|first=Michael|date=Feb 28, 2018|work=Accounting Today|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[New Zealand]]. Accountants from these countries who meet the specified criteria may be able to sit for the [[International Qualification Examination]] (IQEX) as an alternative to the Uniform CPA Exam. IQEX is also jointly administered by the AICPA and NASBA; however, state boards are not involved at the examination stage (only at licensure).

'''''Radio''''' magazine, a [[radio broadcasting]] [[trade publication]], covers the technology side of [[radio]] broadcasting. The publication's focus is to deliver in-depth technical expertise while observing high standards of editorial content. ''Radio'' magazine is targeted at radio broadcast engineers, technology  managers and owners of radio stations, networks, and recording studios. It is owned by [[Future plc|Future]].

==History==
''Radio'' magazine was first published in 1994 under the title ''BE Radio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio magazine Cover Gallery|url=http://www.radiomagonline.com/10years/|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, essentially, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Broadcast Engineering]' magazine, which began publication in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio magazine Cover Gallery|url=http://www.radiomagonline.com/10years/|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Prior to 1994, ''Broadcast Engineering'' (often known as "''BE''") covered [[radio]], [[television]], and [[cable television|cable broadcasting]].  In 1993, the editors of ''BE'', recognizing a growing divergence in the technical issues faced by radio and television broadcasting, chose to split the scope of the original magazine.  This resulted in the creation of ''BE Radio'', to cover only the [[radio]] broadcasting industry, and narrowed the scope of ''Broadcast Engineering'' to [[television]] and cable [[broadcasting]] only.  

As the readerships of the two magazines diverged, the "BE" [[initialism]] ceased to have relevance for ''BE Radio'', and in 2001 the decision was made to drop the initials from the title, leading to the title of ''Radio''.  

In February 2011, ''Radio'' was transferred from struggling [[Penton Media]] to media and communications publisher [[NewBay Media]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NewBay Media Acquires Titles From Penton|url=http://www.pubexec.com/article/newbay-media-acquires-magazine-titles-from-penton-including-mix/|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=Publishing Executive|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penton Media, Inc., Five Magazines|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=126753526|work=Businessweek|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; separating ownership of ''Radio'' from its parent ''Broadcast Engineering'' for the first time. [[Future plc|Future]] acquired NewBay Media in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = PennWell Corp. and NewBay Media Acquired By UK Firms| work = Folio:| accessdate = 2018-09-01| date = 2018-04-04| url = https://www.foliomag.com/pennwell-corp-newbay-media-acquired-uk-firms/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier use of the name==

Between November 1921 and February 1947 a ''Radio'' magazine was published on the west coast in either San Francisco or Los Angeles.  Before 1921 it was known as ''Pacific Radio News'' and in 1947 it became ''Audio Engineering''.  The publication was highly regarded at the time, carrying articles from many of the top men in the craft.  Pacific Radio Publishing also printed a series of yearly handbooks. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Radio_Magazine_Guide.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1959, [[William I. Orr]] became editor of the handbook and it achieved national distribution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Handbooks/Radio-Handbook-15-1959.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Ross Mason''' also, spelled '''Meason''' (November 8, 1739 – 1803) was a [[Virginia]] [[Militia (United States)|militia]] [[Captain (United States)|captain]], on the [[American frontier|American western frontier]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. After the war, he became the leader of the [[Mason Gang]], a criminal gang of [[river pirate]]s and [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] on the lower [[Ohio River]] and the [[Mississippi River]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was associated with outlaws around [[Henderson, Kentucky|Red Banks]], [[Cave-in-Rock, Illinois|Cave-in-Rock]], [[Stack Island (Mississippi River)|Stack Island]], and the [[Natchez Trace]].

==Early life==
Mason was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and raised in what is now [[Charles Town, West Virginia]], formerly a part of Virginia. According to [[Lyman Draper]], in the 1750s Mason got his earliest start in crime as a teenager, by stealing the horses of [[John Hite House|Colonel John L. Hite]], in [[Frederick County, Virginia]], being wounded and caught by his pursuers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qbe8qRR4OoEC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=colonel+john+hite+samuel+mason&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yXoTU-zVLOOz0AHx3ILYCg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=colonel%20hite&amp;f=false. Rothert's 1924 "The Outlaws of Cave-In-Rock...".p. 164 1924]&lt;/ref&gt; He moved from Charles Town to what is now [[Ohio County, West Virginia]], also at that time a part of Virginia, in 1773.

==American Revolutionary War service==

During the [[American Revolution]], Samuel Mason was a captain, of the Ohio County Militia, [[Virginia militia|Virginia State Forces]]. According to Ohio County court minutes, dated January 7, 1777, Mason was recommended to [[Patrick Henry]], the [[List of Governors of Virginia|Governor of Virginia]], to serve as captain of the militia.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Crumrine, ''Virginia Court Records in Southwestern Pennsylvania, Records of the District of West Augusta and Ohio and Yahogania Counties, Virginia, 1775–1780, Consolidated Edition'', p. 366, dated 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, he was present and cited as a captain from Ohio county at a "council of war" held at Catfish Camp.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Upper Ohio Valley, Vol. 1.'', Brant &amp; Fuller, p. 73, dated 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;  Catfish Camp was located at or near present-day [[Washington, Pennsylvania]]. On  June 8, 1777, Mason wrote a letter from [[Fort Henry (West Virginia)|Fort Henry, Virginia]], now present-day [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], to [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] [[Edward Hand]], at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], now present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The letter he wrote was signed Samuel Meason.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Hazard, ''Pennsylvania Archives, Selected and Arranged from Original Documents in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Conformably to Acts of the General Assembly, February 15, 1851, &amp; March 7, 1852, Vol. V.'', p. 445, dated 1853.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 1777, Captain Mason was wounded but survived an ambush by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], near Fort Henry. Most of the men in his Virginia Militia company perished during the attack.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Upper Ohio Valley, Vol. 1.'', Brant &amp; Fuller, pps. 80–82, dated 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; From August 11-September 14, 1779 Samuel Mason while at Fort Henry accompanied Colonel [[Daniel Brodhead IV|Daniel Brodhead]] and his [[8th Pennsylvania Regiment]] of the [[Continental Army]] combined with militia troops from [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] to destroy ten tribal villages of the pro-British [[Seneca people|Seneca]] tribe in northeastern [[Pennsylvania]] during the [[Sullivan Expedition]] in retaliation for the devastating [[Iroquois]] attacks in the [[Battle of Cobleskill|Cobleskill]], [[Battle of Wyoming|Wyoming Valley]] and [[Cherry Valley massacre|Cherry Valley]] [[massacres]] of 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWqW4be2kw8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=George+Washington%27s+War+on+Native+America&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib3eOTzuPZAhWLTd8KHYxRCbYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20Washington's%20War%20on%20Native%20America&amp;f=false|last1=Mann|first1=Barbara Alice |title=George Washington's War on Native America|location=Reno, NV|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=2008|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=reQZDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=outlaws+of+cave-in-rock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju7ZavzOPZAhXMhOAKHXThBhoQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=outlaws%20of%20cave-in-rock&amp;f=false|last1=Rothert|first1=Otto A.|title=The Outlaws of Cave-in-Rock|location=Carbondale, IL|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=1996|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=|last1=Boatner|first1=Mark Mayo|title=Encyclopedia of the American Revolution|location=Jefferson, NC|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=1966|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[court martial|court martial records]] in Ohio County, Virginia, Captain Mason was still on duty as an officer in the Ohio County, Virginia Militia at Fort Henry until 1781. He appeared at the court martials and was present as a witness for military proceedings against other soldiers. Samuel Mason appeared twice at the Ohio County courthouse in Wheeling on November 7, 1780 and May 7, 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Retreat_on_the_Upper_Ohio_1779.html?id=CBrVAAAAMAAJ|last1=Kellogg|first1=Louise Phelps|title=Frontier Retreat on the Upper Ohio, 1779-1781, Collections, vol. XXIV, Draper series., vol. V|location=Madison, WI|publisher=State Historical Society of Wisconsin|year=1917|pages=427–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honest pursuits==
In his book, ''The Outlaws of Cave-In-Rock'', Otto A. Rothert stated that Samuel Mason moved again, in 1779, to a part of Virginia, east of Wheeling that is now in present-day [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], where he was elected [[justice of the peace]] and later selected as an associate judge, leaving for an area that was then a part of Virginia and now the present-day State of [[Kentucky]], in 1784. Mason's surname was spelled interchangeably as Meason in many of the early frontier records. This is explained in two family histories of the Mason/Meason family, ''Pioneer Period and Pioneer People of Fairfield County, Ohio'' by C. M. L. Wiseman, dated 1901, and ''Torrence and Allied Families'' by Robert M. Torrence, dated 1938.

==Criminal career==
In the early 1790s, Samuel Mason moved his family to the Red Banks on the [[Ohio River]], now [[Henderson, Kentucky]], where he began his full-time criminal activities. He later settled downriver on [[Diamond Island (Kentucky)|Diamond Island]] and engaged in river piracy. By 1797, Mason moved the base of his operations further downriver to [[Cave-in-Rock State Park|Cave-in-Rock]] on the [[Illinois]] side of the river in the [[Northwest Territory]].  The Mason Gang of river pirates openly based themselves at the prominent Ohio River landmark known as Cave-in-Rock, a huge shelter cave. Samuel Mason had a brief association with the first known serial killers in America, [[Harpe brothers|Micajah and Wiley Harpe]], as well as [[Peter Alston]], and possibly [[John Duff (counterfeiter)|John Duff]], the [[coin counterfeiting|counterfeiter]].  Mason and his gang stayed at Cave-In-Rock until the summer of 1799, when they were expelled by the "Exterminators", a group of [[vigilante|regulators]] under the leadership of Captain Young of [[Mercer County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofhenders00star
|last1=Starling|first1=Edmund Lyne|title=History of Henderson County, Kentucky|location=Henderson, KY|publisher=|year=1887|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Mason moved his operations down the [[Mississippi River]] and settled his family in the territory of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]], now the present-day state of [[Missouri]], and became a highwayman along the [[Natchez Trace]] in [[Mississippi Territory]], now the present-day state of [[Mississippi]].  It was on the Natchez Trace that Mason received his most infamous nickname.  He would leave a message after each crime (often in the blood of his murdered victims) proudly stating, "Done by Mason of the Woods".   In April 1802, Mississippi Territorial Governor [[William C. C. Claiborne]] was informed that Mason and Wiley Harpe had attempted to board the boat of a Colonel Joshua Baker between Yazoo, now [[Yazoo, Mississippi]], and Walnut Hills, now [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=REwTAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mississippi,+comprising+Sketches+of+Towns,+Events D. Roland's 1907 "Mississippi, comprising Sketchs of Towns, Events...".p. 176 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
According to a man named Swaney, who saw Samuel Mason often, described his appearance:  "He weighed about two hundred pounds, and was a fine looking man. He was rather modest and unassuming, and had nothing of the raw-head-and-bloody-bones appearance which his character would indicate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/outlawsofcaveinr00roth|last1=Rothert|first1=Otto A.|title=The outlaws of Cave-in-Rock : historical accounts of the famous highwaymen and river pirates who operated in pioneer days upon the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and over the old Natchez trace|location=Cleveland, OH|publisher=Arthur H. Clark|year=1924|pages=244–245.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another man, Henry Howe described Mason as:  "...a man of gigantic stature and of more than ordinary talents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/outlawsofcaveinr00roth|last1=Rothert|first1=Otto A.|title=The outlaws of Cave-in-Rock : historical accounts of the famous highwaymen and river pirates who operated in pioneer days upon the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and over the old Natchez trace|location=Cleveland, OH|publisher=Arthur H. Clark|year=1924|pages=244–245.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A William Darby also described him as follows:  "Mason at any time of his life or in any situation, had something extremely ferocious in his look, which arose particularly from a tooth which projected forwards, and could only be covered with his lip by effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/outlawsofcaveinr00roth|last1=Rothert|first1=Otto A.|title=The outlaws of Cave-in-Rock : historical accounts of the famous highwaymen and river pirates who operated in pioneer days upon the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and over the old Natchez trace|location=Cleveland, OH|publisher=Arthur H. Clark|year=1924|pages=244–245.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest, escape, and death==
According to [[New Spain|Spanish colonial]] court records, Spanish government officials arrested Samuel Mason and his men, early in 1803, at the Little Prairie settlement, now [[Caruthersville, Missouri|Caruthersville]], in southeastern Missouri.  Mason and his gang, including his family members, were taken to the Spanish colonial government in [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory, along the Mississippi River, where a three-day hearing was held to determine whether Mason was truly involved in river piracy, as he had been formally accused of this crime.  Although he claimed he was simply a farmer, who had been maligned by his enemies, the peculiar presence of $7,000 in currency and twenty human [[scalping|scalps]] found in his baggage was the damning evidence that convinced the Spanish he indeed was a river pirate. Mason and his family were taken, under armed guard, to [[New Orleans]], the capital of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Lower Louisiana Territory]], where the Spanish colonial governor ordered them handed over to the American authorities in the [[Mississippi Territory]], as all crimes they had been convicted of appeared to have taken place in American territory or against American river boats.

While being transported up the Mississippi River, Samuel Mason and gang members John Sutton or Setton, one of the many aliases used by [[Harpe brothers|Wiley Harpe]], and James May, alias of [[Peter Alston]], overpowered their guards and escaped, with Mason being shot in the head during the escape. One of the 1803 accounts {Rothert. p.&amp;nbsp;247} claimed Captain Robert McCoy, the commandant of New Madrid, was killed by Mason during their escape. McCoy actually died in 1840, and was neither crippled or killed, by Mason.&lt;ref&gt;Houck's [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZB5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 "History of Missouri from the Earliest explorations..." 1908 Volume 2. p. 140]. According to Conrad's [https://books.google.com/books?id=6BPVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA557 "Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri" 1901. p. 557] a Creek named Tewanaye who killed a David Trotter in New Madrid in 1802 had been found guilty of murder in New Orleans and in a return trip near Natchez in a galley Tewanaye had tried to escape and crippled McCoy; Tewanaye was executed in New Madrid January 3, 1803.&lt;/ref&gt;  American territorial governor William C. C. Claiborne, immediately issued a reward for their recapture, prompting Wiley Harpe and Peter Alston to bring Mason's head, in an attempt to claim the reward money. Whether they killed Mason or whether he died from his wound suffered in the escape attempt has never been established. Setton and May were recognized and identified as wanted criminals, Wiley Harpe and [[Peter Alston]], were arrested, tried in [[United States district court|U.S. federal court]], found guilty of piracy, and hanged in [[Greenville, Mississippi|Old Greenville]], [[Jefferson County, Mississippi|Jefferson County]], [[Mississippi Territory]] in early 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Mark and Mary R.

From 1863-1864, [[Henry Plummer]] was the elected sheriff of the gold rush town, [[Bannack, Montana]], in the [[Idaho Territory]]. He was later, accused of being the leader of an outlaw gang, the [[Innocents (gang)|Innocents]], who stole gold shipments from Bannick, and was hanged by Bannick [[Montana Vigilantes|vigilantes]].

In the 1956 [[Walt Disney Productions|Walt Disney]] television series, ''[[Davy Crockett and the River Pirates]]'', a [[Hollywood]]ized version of Samuel Mason is portrayed by American actor, [[Mort Mills]] who appears alongside the Harpe brothers.

In the 1962 [[John Ford]] Western epic film, ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'', a Samuel Mason-like frontier outlaw leader, of a gang of [[river pirates]], is portrayed by [[Walter Brennan]], as the fictional character of Colonel Jeb Hawkins, which alludes to the historical Cave-In-Rock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8688">'''San Jacinto Plaza''' is a historic park located on the corner of Oregon and Mills in the heart of Downtown [[El Paso, Texas]].

==History==
[[Image:ELPSAnjacin3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Earliest known photo of '''San Jacinto Plaza'''.]]
When the US government leased land from Smith's ranch, for the first Post opposite El Paso (meaning El Paso del Norte, later renamed Ciudad Juarez), U.S. Army troops would drill in the plaza. The city of El Paso acquired the property on which the Plaza is located in 1881 from William T. Smith. Smith had bought the land from the heirs of its early owner, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a prominent El Paso figure, who had owned the spot since 1827. The square had since been the location of the corrals for de León’s ranch. 
The city cleared and cleaned the dry, sandy, mesquite-filled property and in 1903 the City Council officially named the park in honor of the famous [[Battle of San Jacinto|battle]] [[Texas]] fought for its independence.

[[J. Fisher Satterwaite]], El Paso Parks and Streets Commissioner, contracted with [[Fisher Satterthwaite]] to create beauty out of this desert patch. By 1883, the park was surrounded by a fence, a walled pond was created, a gazebo was erected and 75 [[Chinese Elm]] trees were planted. Satterthwaite then introduced three [[alligators]] into the pond.

===Alligators===
[[Image:ELPSAnjacin4.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Postcard (c.1920) depicting a caretaker inside of the protective fence of Alligator Pond. Note the number of Spectators gathered around the perimeter fence.]]
The alligators were the central attraction and thrived. At one time the pond contained as many as seven of the reptiles. Most visitors to the park would rest on the wall surrounding the pond and watch the alligators. The reptiles quickly became a staple of the El Paso Culture. In 1952, an alligator named Oscar was hauled to [[UTEP|Texas Western College]] and, as a prank, placed inside geology Professor [[Howard Quinn|Howard Quinn's]] office. On another occasion an alligator was found in the swimming pool at the college right before an intramural swim meet. Sally, one of the first alligators placed in the pond, was the object of a weight-guessing contest. The closest guess won $100 and a trip to [[Mexico]]. In 1952, Minnie, a 54-year-old female alligator, laid an egg in the pond and spectators were delighted when they saw a protective Minnie spring to life and rush towards her egg as park employees cleaned the pond.

In March 1953, Oscar was found dead at the bottom of the pond, the result of internal injuries after vandals removed him and threw him back into the pond when police arrived. Seven months later, El Pasoan [[Myrtle Price]] donated two alligators named Jack and Jill to the Plaza in place of Oscar.

The alligators were finally moved to the [[El Paso Zoo]] in 1965 after two were stoned to death and another had a spike driven through its left eye. The alligators were briefly returned to the plaza in 1972 only to be removed once again in 1974  at a cause of vandals. The pond was permanently removed shortly after.

Many people still fondly refer to the plaza as “La Plaza de los Lagartos,” or Alligator Plaza. Today, a fiberglass sculpture by nationally acclaimed local artist [[Luis Jiménez (sculptor)|Luis Jiménez]] honors the original alligators.

==Distinctive features==
Another distinctive feature of the Plaza in the 1950s was a statue known as “[[The Boy with the Leaking Boot]].” This statue stood in City Hall Park for 50 years before it was moved to San Jacinto Plaza. There it was surrounded by a moat and guarded by alligators. The statue currently stands on the first floor of El Paso's Museum of History.

Preachers trying to spread the [[word of the gospel]] have always culminated at the plaza. In August 1952, a delegation of [[Baptist]] ministers held [[revivalism|revivals]] in the park. The ceremonies attracting hundreds at a time. The [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] said they picked San Jacinto Plaza as a revival site because of the need to cut down on evil, drunkenness and [[communism]].

Since 1954, the traditional lighting of the city [[christmas tree]] in the Plaza has officially begun the [[Christmas]] season in El Paso. Mayor [[Fred Hervey]] was the first to officially light the thousands of multi-colored lights that covered the tree, fountains and nativity scenes. Thousands of El Pasoans watched this 20 minute ceremony which included music from the 62nd Army Band and featured [[Ted Bender]] as the Master of Ceremony.

San Jacinto Plaza has always served as a transportation terminal in El Paso. In 1907, horse-drawn carriages lined up around the Plaza. Before buses existed, [[Tram|trolleys]] made their daily stops at the Plaza. In the 1950s, the Plaza became a [[Sun Metro Mass Transit System|major boarding site for city buses]] as well as a pick-up point for private transportation such as [[taxicab]]s.

==Today==
[[Image:ELPSAnjacin.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Postcard (c.1914) depicting San Jacinto Plaza at the time.]]
San Jacinto Plaza continues to be the heart of downtown El Paso, but like most public places, it has its share of problems. The plaza has experienced several remodelings since its origination. The plaza is still a transportation center, and volumes of people remain seated on benches almost daily. Friends still gather to eat and socialize.

Concerns over beggars aggressively approaching park goers, as well as pickpockets have arisen. In recent years, the park has begun to attract transients, peddlers, the poor, and the homeless. Fountains are dry, furnishings are warped. Recently, the city has responded positively to the refurbishment of the park. In 2003, the entire park was once again cleared, cleaned, and rebuilt.

==Renovation==
[[File:An entrance to San Jacinto Plaza.jpg|thumb|San Jacinto Plaza, El Paso, TX]]
As of February 2016 the park is undergoing a $5.3 million renovation. The money for the renovation is from a quality of life bonds that was approved by the citizens of El Paso in November 2012.  Funding is also from the Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone Fund which are special zones created by City Council to attract  new investment in certain areas. For the past several months contractors have been working on excavation for irrigation and to add 10 feet of park on all sides, along with new sidewalks and gutters drains.  All these improvements will be done in Phase 1 of the renovation. The second phase of the renovation started in February 2014. Which will include different amenities such as a full service café, a huacha court, reflecting pool, and splash pad. Crews will also be installing benches around the new modern park, along with landscaping and irrigation.

== Final product ==
San Jacinto Plaza faced many delays throughout renovations which ranged from design changes to shipment delays. These delays pushed the completion date back more than a year. The original completion date was set for February 2015, but due to these delays the project was not complete until April 2016.

Due to these delays mayor Oscar Leeser has stated that the city will bill the contracting company, Basic IDIQ, for these delays.

The official reopening date was April 16, 2016, at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., where a ceremony was held at the Plaza in downtown El Paso. Followed by a celebration from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2016/04/06/san-jacinto-plaza-expected-reopen-next-week/82714252/|title=San Jacinto Plaza grand reopening is April 16|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*During the [[Mexican Revolution]], cannons decoratively placed in the park were stolen for use in the conflict.

===Falcon Gravity Concentrators===

The Falcon Concentrator is a type of [[Mineral processing#Gravity concentration|gravity separation]] device for the recovery of valuable metals and minerals. There are three types of Falcon Concentrators: Falcon Semi-Batch (SB), Falcon Continuous (C) and Falcon Ultra-Fine (UF).&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, K.C., &amp; McAlister, S.M. (1998), 'Development of the Falcon Concentrator' in Proceedings from the 1998 SME Annual Meeting, Orlando, Florida, 9–11 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deveau, C (2006). "Improving fine particle gravity recovery through equipment behaviour modification." Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Paper 31, 501-517&lt;/ref&gt; All models of Falcon Concentrator rely on the creation of [[centrifugal force]]s by way of a rapidly rotating, vertical bowl in order to stratify and separate particles based on weight. The amount of gravitational force generated and the method of collecting these heavier particles differs for each model.&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:The Semi-Batch Model Falcon Gravity Concentrator.JPG|thumbnail|A Semi-Batch Model Falcon Gravity Concentrator]] --&gt;

====Falcon Semi-Batch====

The Falcon semi batch centrifugal concentrator is primarily used for the recovery of free (liberated) precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum. The machine generates forces up to 200 times the force of gravity (200 G's) and makes use of a two-stage rotating bowl for mineral separation. The smooth-walled lower portion is for particle stratification and then a fluidized upper portion is used for the collection of the heavier particles. The machine is stopped periodically to rinse and collect the valuable concentrate from the bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, K.C., &amp; McAlister, S.M. (1998), 'Development of the Falcon Concentrator' in Proceedings from the 1998 SME Annual Meeting, Orlando, Florida, 9–11 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcon SB concentrator is used for gold recovery at many mines around the world, including [[Quadra FNX Mining|Quadra Mining's]] Robinson mine in the United States, [[Newcrest Mining|Newcrest Mining's]] [[Telfer Mine|Telfer Gold Mine]] in Australia and the [[Sadiola Gold Mine]] (owned principally by [[AngloGold Ashanti]] and [[IAMGOLD]]) in Mali.&lt;ref&gt;Naude, C. (2009), 'Effect of gravity recovery on overall plant recovery. Sadiola - a case study' in Proceedings from the 40th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Canada, 23–25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
°°°

====Falcon Continuous====

The Falcon Continuous (C) centrifugal concentrator is primarily used for the separation of heavy minerals which occur in ore concentrations above 0.1% by weight, such as [[cassiterite]], [[tantalum]] and [[scheelite]].&lt;ref&gt;Deveau, C. (2000). 'The evolution of falcon continuous concentrators at Tantalum Mining Corporation of Canada.' Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Canadian Mineral Processors Conference, Ottawa, Canada, Jan 2000, pp.1-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deveau, C. and Young, S.R., (2005). "Pushing the limits of gravity separation," SME Annual Meeting, Preprint 05-84&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for coal cleaning&lt;ref&gt;Honaker, R.Q. (1998). 'High capacity fine coal cleaning using an enhanced gravity concentrator.' Minerals Engineering, Volume 11, Issue 12, 1191-1199&lt;/ref&gt; and pre-concentration of gold bearing ores.&lt;ref&gt;Naude, C. 2009, 'Effect of gravity recovery on overall plant recovery. Sadiola - a case study' in Proceedings from the 40th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Canada, 23–25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, K.C., &amp; McAlister, S.M. (1998), 'Development of the Falcon Concentrator' in Proceedings from the 1998 SME Annual Meeting, Orlando, Florida, 9–11 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine generates forces up to 300 times the force of gravity (300 G's) and operates by using a smooth-walled, rotating bowl to stratify the material into heavier and lighter fractions then uses pneumatic valves to control the amount of heavy material that reports to the concentrate collection stream. It does not use any fluidization water and relies entirely on centrifugal force for separation.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, K.C., &amp; McAlister, S.M. (1998), 'Development of the Falcon Concentrator' in Proceedings from the 1998 SME Annual Meeting, Orlando, Florida, 9–11 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcon C concentrator is used in various process plants around the world, such as the [[Tanco Mine|Tanco mine]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Deveau, C. (2000). 'The evolution of falcon continuous concentrators at Tantalum Mining Corporation of Canada.' Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Canadian Mineral Processors Conference, Ottawa, Canada, Jan 2000, pp.1-18&lt;/ref&gt; the Sekisovskoye mine in Kazakhstan&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, D. (2010). 'Advances in gold process recovery from complex ores' [Powerpoint Slides].

====Falcon Ultra-Fine====

The Falcon Ultra-Fine (UF) centrifugal concentrator is primarily used for the separation of heavy minerals which occur in ore concentrations above 0.1% by weight, such as [[cassiterite]], [[tantalum]] and [[scheelite]] when the majority of the particles are smaller than 75&amp;nbsp;[[µm]]. The machine generates forces up to 600 times the force of gravity (600 G's) and uses a smooth-walled bowl for particle stratification with a pneumatically controlled rubber lip for heavy material collection. The machine is stopped periodically to rinse and collect the valuable concentrate from the bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Deveau, C (2006). "Improving fine particle gravity recovery through equipment behaviour modification." Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Paper 31, 501-517&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that the deposition of heavy material within the bowl can be predicted by a hindered settling model.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll-Rabotin, J.S., Bourgeois, F., Climent, E., (2011). "Benefication of concentrated ultrafine suspensions with a Falcon UF concentrator." Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Paper 26, 413-431.&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcon UF concentrator is used in a number of process plants around the world such as the [[Tanco Mine|Tanco mine]] in Canada&lt;ref&gt;Deveau, C (2006). "Improving fine particle gravity recovery through equipment behaviour modification." Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Paper 31, 501-517&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bluestone tin mine in Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Bluestone Tin Limited | url=http://www.metalsx.com.au/announcements/46/1163568317.pdf | title=Circular to Shareholders | date=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sepro Tyre Drive Scrubbers===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Brocal (2).jpg|thumbnail|Sepro employees in Peru commissioning a 3.6x12m Scrubber]] --&gt;
Scrubbers are material washers used to break down and disperse clays in order to prepare mineral ores or construction aggregates for further processing. Sepro Tyre Drive Scrubbers are manufactured up to 3.6m in diameter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Tyre Drive Scrubber Specifications|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/sepro-tyre-drive-scrubbers-specifications|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are capable of processing up to 1500 tonnes per hour of material. Shell supported Scrubbers such as the Sepro PTD Scrubber minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the washing drum.  These scrubbers operate in many applications on feeds with high clay content, and are commonly used for difficult ore and stone washing duties. A few specified applications of Sepro Scrubbers include removal of gold “robbing” carboniferous material and other contaminants from [[gold|gold ores]], the processing of bauxite ores for [[aluminum]] production, the washing of [[laterite]]s (gold, nickel, cobalt) to liberate fine metals for gravity recovery, and the washing of crushed [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]], gravel and sand to remove clay contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Tyre Drive Scrubber Applications|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/sepro-tyre-drive-scrubbers-applications|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Mineral Systems delivers a 2.4m X 4.2m-110 kW Sepro Scrubber to Lehigh Materials|url=http://www.mining.com/sepro-mineral-systems-delivers-a-24m-x-42m-110-kw-sepro-scrubber-to-lehigh-materials/|website=www.mining.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sepro Tyre Drive Agglomeration Drums===

Sepro Agglomeration Drums are specifically designed to prepare feeds with high fines content on Gold and Base Metal heap loading operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commissioning Complete for Agnico Eagle’s Sepro Agglomeration Drum|url=http://suppliersandequipment.mining.com/2014/09/15/commissioning-complete-for-agnico-eagles-sepro-agglomeration-drum/|website=www.mining.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes where a Sepro Agglomeration Drum can be utilized include [[gold]], [[copper]], [[uranium]] and nickel [[laterite]]. The action in the agglomeration drum, combined with small additions of cement or lime, binds the fines into a "pelletised" product, which can be heaped and leached out without "pooling" and "channelling" caused by loss of heap permeability due to blinding by fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Mineral Systems|url=http://www.mining-technology.com/contractors/screening/sepro/|website=www.mining-technology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The machine uses flexible rubber liners to prevent build up without the use of lifter bars and is adjustable on a pivotable base frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Tyre Drive Agglomeration Drums Specifications|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/sepro-tyre-drive-agglomeration-drums-specifications|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shell supported agglomerators such as the Sepro PTD Agglomeration Drum minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the unit.

===Sepro Tyre Drive Grinding Mills===

Sepro Tyre Driven Grinding Mills are designed for small and medium capacity grinding applications, specifically small tonnage plants, regrinding mills, reagent prep and lime slaking. Sepro Pneumatic Tyre Driven (PTD) mills provide an alternative to standard trunnion drive systems. The drive consists of multiple gears boxes and electric motors directly connected and controlled through an AC variable frequency drive. Shell supported mills such as the Sepro PTD mills minimize stress on the mill shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the mill.  Sepro Mills are suitable for Ball, Rod and Pebble charges and are available with overflow or grate discharge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies milling and gravity circuit to Hemco Nicaragua SA|url=http://www.mining.com/sepro-mineral-systems-corp-supplies-milling-and-gravity-circuit-to-hemco-nicaragua-sa-16132/|website=www.mining.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to suit the application. Shell supported Mills such as the Sepro PTD Grinding Mills minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Tyre Drive Grinding Mills|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/grinding-sepro-tyre-drive-grinding-mills|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condor Dense Medium Separators===

The Condor Dense Medium Separator (DMS) is a multi-stage, high efficiency media separation machine for [[mineral processing]] operations at the rougher and scavenger stage. It is typically used in a pre-concentration duty prior to processing or milling to reject barren material. The unit is manufactured with either two or three stages of separation depending on the media with one or two valuable [[density|densities]] resulting, while the unit can produce up to four products from one dense medium vessel altogether. The Condor DMS can take a larger feed particle size compared to a DMS cyclone of the same diameter and capacity, and is capable of handling higher sinks or floats loading without affecting performance. The valuable dense material (or 'sinks') can be combined or separated at the final stage and is then pumped onto the next process in the circuit.
Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies customizable DMS Plants for a wide variety of application requirements. Sepro’s standard two product (concentrate, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a two-stage Condor Separator and single density medium circuit, while the three product (concentrate, middlings, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a three-stage Condor Separator and two medium circuits at high and low density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Condor Dense Medium Separators|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/dense-medium-separation-sepro-condor-separators|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sepro Leach Reactors===

The Sepro Leach Reactor is a high concentration [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leach]] reactor developed to treat the [[gold]] concentrate produced by the [[#Falcon Gravity Concentrators|Falcon Concentrator]]. The unit consists of a [[concentrate]] holding tank and a leach tank and impeller which are linked by a Sepro vertical bowl pump. The SLR uses either [[peroxide]] or [[oxygen|oxygen gas]] to achieve elevated levels of dissolved oxygen required to accelerate the leaching process with no [[reagent]]s required.  The pregnant leach solution produced can be directly [[electrowinning|electrowon]]. With the addition of an electrowinning unit the final product becomes a gold plated carbon that can be directly refined to produce gold bullion. 
Extensive test work of the SLR on site has shown over 99% of the target mineral is recovered through a simple, fully automated process that is easily incorporated into recovery operations. Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies SLR units with capacities ranging from 1000–50,000&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Leach Reactors|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/leaching-sepro-leach-reactors|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sepro Pumps===

Sepro supplies horizontal [[slurry pump]]s, vertical [[sump pump]]s, vertical [[froth pump]]s, vertical tank pumps and horizontal fluid process pump models which are metal lined or rubber lined, one option being SH46® material for advanced wear resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SH46 Abrasion Resistant Material|url=http://www.sepropumps.com/pumps-abrasion-resistant-material-sh46|website=www.sepropumps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to operate in the mining, aggregate, chemical and industrial sectors. Applications suitable for Sepro Pumps include mill discharge, mineral concentrate, dense media, coarse / fine tailings, process water and aggregates. Sepro engineers mobile, modular and fixed [[mineral processing]] plant designs which incorporate the complete line of slurry, sump, froth, tank and fluid Sepro Pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Pumps|url=http://www.sepropumps.com|website=www.sepropumps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sepro Blackhawk 100 Cone Crushers===

The Sepro Blackhawk 100 Cone [[Crusher]]  is a modern, hydraulically operated cone crusher designed to be simple, rugged and effective for heavy duty mining and aggregate applications. The combination of the speed and eccentric throw of the crusher provides fine crushing capability and high capacity in a very compact design. The Blackhawk is capable of being applied as a secondary or tertiary crusher as well as a pebble crusher.The Blackhawk 100 is driven directly via a flexible coupling to the 
electric drive motor.  This arrangement eliminates the need for sheaves and v-belts, allowing for simplified operation and maintenance. A variable speed drive package is included to optimize the speed of the machine to the given liner profile, feed and production conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sepro Blackhawk 100 Cone Crushers|url = http://www.seprosystems.com/crushing-sepro-blackhawk-100-cone-crushers|website = www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sepro-Sizetec Screens===

Sepro-Sizetec Screens are used for a variety of particle size separation and [[dewatering]] duties in mineral processing and aggregate applications. In mineral processing applications, particle size separation is of utmost importance in order to optimize crushing, grinding and gravity separation as well as many other processes. In aggregate applications, proper size separation and dewatering is essential to generate a saleable product. 
High capacity capable and featuring interchangeable screen decks, Sepro-Sizetec Screens are used for [[gold|gold ore processing]], fine [[construction aggregate|aggregates]], industrial minerals, [[environmental remediation|soil remediation]] and [[coal]] processing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro-Sizetec Screen Applications|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/sepro-sizetec-screens-applications|website=wwww.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants and Process Design==

Utilizing an experienced team of engineering professionals, Sepro designs and builds modular and mobile processing plants for a wide range of mineral applications. Complete plants are assembled utilizing Sepro manufactured equipment, but are optionally designed to accommodate innovative solutions and equipment from a wide variety of vendors and sub-contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Modular Process Solutions|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/sepro-modular-process-solutions|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Sepro Mobile Mill Plant and Sepro Mobile Flotation Plant.tif|thumbnail|Sepro Mobile Plants]] --&gt;

Sepro Mobile Plants are designed to be easily re-locatable as they are mounted on road transportable custom built trailer assemblies. These include the Sepro Mobile Mill Plant and Sepro Mobile Flotation Plant, both of which were installed by Banks Island Gold Ltd at the company's Yellow Giant Gold Property on the coast of British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mossman|first1=Benjamin|title=Banks Island Gold Ltd. Provides Update on Commissioning of Grinding and Flotation Circuits|url=http://www.banksislandgold.com/s/NewsReleases.asp?ReportID=674974&amp;_Type=News-Releases&amp;_Title=Banks-Island-Gold-Ltd.-Provides-Update-on-Commissioning-of-Grinding-and-Flo|accessdate=18 September 2014|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be designed to encompass a wide variety of process options from crushing through to the final concentrate collection. 
 
Sepro Modular and Skid Mounted Plants are engineered around structural elements that are simple and easy to erect on site. These plants can be designed with larger equipment for higher tonnage applications than that of the Sepro Mobile Plants. One example is a 360 TPD Gold Processing Plant Sepro supplied to ProEurasia LCC for the Vladimirskaya Project in Russia. This included milling, gravity and smelting circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vladimirskaya|url=http://www.proeurasia.at/en/our-projects/project/news/detail/News/vladimirskaya/|website=www.proeurasia.at|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sepro also offers standard process modules which are designed around a single recovery or procession option. Dense Media Separation and Gravity Concentration are two examples of standard Sepro process modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepro Condor DMS|url=http://www.seprosystems.com/sepro-condor-dense-medium-separators-applications|website=www.seprosystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shane Alan McEntee''' (19 December 1956 – 21 December 2012) was an Irish [[Fine Gael]] politician who served as [[Minister of State for Food, Horticulture and Food Safety]] from 2011 to 2012. He served as a [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) from 2005 to 2012.&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=30&amp;MemberID=2137&amp;ConstID=218|title=Mr. Shane McEntee|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
McEntee was born in the village of [[Nobber]] in [[County Meath]]. He had seven siblings. His father Tony died in March 2011 at the age of 86 while his mother Madge outlived him.&lt;ref name=world_is_rocked/&gt;

He became an active member of [[Fine Gael]] when he joined the party at the age of 15. Before being elected, he worked as a farmer and agricultural sales representative. He ran the "Dee Local Bar".

McEntee was also very involved in the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], both as a player (until an injury ended his promising career) and training numerous teams. He was a brother of [[Gerry McEntee]], the All-Ireland winning [[Meath GAA|Meath]] [[Gaelic football|footballer]] and surgeon.

He was married with three daughters and a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1221/shane-mcentee-td.html|title=Death announced of Minister of State Shane McEntee|date=21 December 2012|work=[[RTÉ News]]|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter [[Helen McEntee]] succeeded him as TD for Meath East after his death.

==Politics==
A close friend of [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Fionnan|last1=Sheahan|first2=Lyndsey|last2=Telford|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/taoiseach-in-shock-as-junior-minister-shane-mcentee-dies-suddenly-3333654.html|title=Taoiseach in shock as Junior Minister Shane McEntee dies suddenly|date=21 December 2012|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McEntee's election candidacy began in 2004 when he was selected as the Fine Gael candidate in the [[Meath by-election, 2005|Meath by-election]], which was triggered by the resignation from [[Dáil Éireann]] of Fine Gael's former leader, [[John Bruton]]. Polling was on 11 March 2005, and McEntee narrowly beat the [[Fianna Fáil]] candidate [[Shane Cassells]], and was elected to the [[29th Dáil]].

McEntee was re-elected at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007]] and [[Irish general election, 2011|2011]] general elections.&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=6731|title=Shane McEntee|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Fine Gael deputy spokesperson on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for Food and Fisheries from 2007 to 2011. On 10 March 2011, he was appointed as the [[Minister of State for Food, Horticulture and Food Safety]].

McEntee was also a successful campaigner on behalf of families in counties Dublin, Meath and Kildare whose homes had been damaged by [[pyrite]] in stone used in the foundations.

During the 2010 Fine Gael leadership heave McEntee gave an impassioned speech in defence of party leader Enda Kenny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Fionnan|last1=Sheahan|first2=Fiach|last2=Kelly|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-rousing-speech-that-helped-to-save-kennys-leadership-3334028.html|title=A rousing speech that helped to save Kenny's leadership|date=22 December 2012|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

[[File:The Ivy Hotel, Baltimore.jpg|thumb]]
'''The Ivy''' is a hotel located at 205 E. Biddle Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202.  The Ivy Hotel is situated in the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon Baltimore City Historic District]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

The Ivy Hotel was developed through the [[adaptive reuse]] of an historic building.  The property encompasses an historic home built in 1889, along with two adjoining Federal style townhouses.  The property was acquired by the City of Baltimore in 1939 and was subsequently known as "Government House".  The City used the property as the offices of the Baltimore City Department of Public Recreation from 1939 to 1983.  Under the direction of then-Mayor of Baltimore, [[William Donald Schaefer]], the property was subsequently redeveloped as "The Inn at Government House".  The Inn served as the Official Guesthouse of the City of Baltimore from 1985 to 2010.  In 2011, the City of Baltimore sold the property to a local private development consortium, Mount Vernon Mansion LLC, whose company planned to redevelop the site as a boutique hotel.

The Ivy Hotel opened on June 1, 2015, following an extensive historical restoration and renovation of the property.

== History ==

=== Private ownership (1889–1939) ===
In 1889, John Gilman, prosperous banker and industrialist, commissioned a mansion in Mount Vernon, Baltimore’s most prestigious neighborhood. He chose architect Charles Carson for the job, a master of design who had recently completed Baltimore’s Grand Masonic Venue and the opulent Methodist Church. Gilman asked Carson to build him a house to speak of wealth, power and taste, from its inlaid floors to its turreted slate roof. But Gilman also wanted a home. Its rooms should be intimate, its fireplaces welcoming, and its tall windows should frame the charming streetscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theivybaltimore.com/about-the-ivy/history-of-the-ivy/ The History of the Ivy Hotel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mansion was raised on the leafy corner of Biddle and North Calvert Streets, neighbored on all sides by handsome brick and stone residences. But as fate would have it, Gilman did not live to enjoy his new home, dying suddenly just before the house was complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theivybaltimore.com/about-the-ivy/history-of-the-ivy/ The History of the Ivy Hotel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Gilman lived at the Biddle Street mansion for several years, then sold it to a man named William Painter, and his amiable wife, Harriet. William was a wildly successful inventor, a holder of more than 100 patents, and the president of the Crown Cork and Seal Co., manufacturer of bottle caps, corks and closures of all kinds. The Painters were very sociable and philanthropic, hosting luncheons and bridge parties, dedicating parks and statues. The Painters and their three children divided their time between the house on Biddle Street and an opulent summer home in Guilford. Father and son were great fans of the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and made sure to send birthday flowers to his grave every year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theivybaltimore.com/about-the-ivy/history-of-the-ivy/ The History of the Ivy Hotel&lt;/ref&gt;

When William passed on, Harriet built a children’s hospital in his name in the city. Soon afterwards, she sold the mansion to the Futcher family. Dr. Futcher was a Canadian physician, a noted diagnostician recruited to join Johns Hopkins, and he set up office and family in the Biddle Street house. The Futchers' lived and worked in the house into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theivybaltimore.com/about-the-ivy/history-of-the-ivy/ The History of the Ivy Hotel]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== City of Baltimore ownership: Department of Public Recreation (1939–1983) ===
During the 1930s, the mansion was acquired by the Garrett family.  [[Robert Garrett]] was an Olympic Athlete and Chairperson of an organization known as the Playground Athletic League (P.A.L.), serving the children of Baltimore.  In 1939, Mr. Garrett and the P.A.L. donated the Mansion to the City of Baltimore, to be used as the Baltimore City Department of Public Recreation.  Following its acquisition by the City of Baltimore, the property was known as "Government House".  In 1969, the City purchased the two adjoining Federal style townhouses and expanded the office space.  The Baltimore City Department of Public Recreation relocated to new facilities in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visitors.baltimorecity.gov/HistoricalAttractions/TheInnatGovernmentHouse.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== City of Baltimore ownership: The Inn at Government House (1983–2010) ===
Following the relocation of the Department of Public Recreation in 1983, then-Mayor of Baltimore, [[William Donald Schaefer]], began a project to restore "Government House", as part of his initiative to preserve the rich architectural history of the City.  Mayor Schaeffer's was a far-sighted and visionary concept, as many of the City's Victorian Mansions had by then been subdivided into apartments or offices, with the subsequent compromise of their architectural integrity.  The restoration was carried out from 1983 to 1985, returning the Mansion to its original 19th-century appearance.  The "Inn at Government House" was opened to the public in 1985.  The Inn was renovated again in 1998.  The Inn served as the Official Guesthouse of the City of Baltimore until 2010, at which time the City decided that the property was no longer needed and should be sold as surplus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visitors.baltimorecity.gov/HistoricalAttractions/TheInnatGovernmentHouse.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoring and renovating The Ivy Hotel (2010–2015) ==
In 2010, the property was declared surplus by the City of Baltimore’s Space Utilization Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2010/01/25/daily31.html Daniel J. Sernovitz, "Baltimore Development Corp. recommends sale of city-owned bed-and-breakfast", ''Baltimore Business Journal'', Jan. 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The Baltimore Development Corp. (BDC) solicited proposals for redeveloping the site.  Mount Vernon Mansion LLC, a local private development consortium, was the only group which submitted a proposal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2011/10/18/inn-at-government-house-moves-closer.html Scott Graham, "Inn at Government House moves closer to redevelopment", ''Baltimore Business Journal'', October 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 11, 2011, the Baltimore Development Corp. (BDC) reported that it had sold the property encompassing the former Inn at Government House for $725,000, to Mount Vernon Mansion LLC, whose company planned to redevelop the site as a boutique hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore Development Corp.

The developers and architect paid close attention to all aspects of the property's historic restoration and preservation.  They employed a number of local craftspersons.  The Ivy Hotel retains many of the property's original historic features, including, the green marble mined from local quarries, the parquet floors, pocket doors, the three-story Grand Staircase capped off with original skylights, carved wood wainscoting, 23 individual fireplaces, and the numerous leaded glass (stained glass) windows.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theivybaltimore.com/about-the-ivy/history-of-the-ivy/ The History of the Ivy Hotel&lt;/ref&gt;

During the restoration and renovation, the developers hosted a special behind the scenes tour, in conjunction with [[Baltimore Heritage]], on December 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;The Ivy Hotel: A Gilded Age Tour and Celebration organized by Baltimore Heritage, December 3, 2014 (Facebook) https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154939569530650.1073741835.237046885649&amp;type=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ivy Hotel: A Gilded Age Tour and Celebration organized by Baltimore Heritage, December 3, 2014 (Baltimore Heritage Blog) http://baltimoreheritage.org/support/thank-memorable-evening-ivy-hotel/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Rundown''''' was a Singaporean pre-market business news television program broadcast from the [[Singapore Exchange]] Monday through Friday on [[CNBC Asia]]. The program aired daily across the Asia Pacific from 06:00 AM to 07:00 AM in Singapore and Hong Kong. It debuted on March 31, 2014, and aired through October 26, 2018.

It was also broadcast internationally Sunday through Thursday in the United States [[CNBC World]] but only the Monday edition of the programme was seen on [[CNBC Europe]]. The program was available in more than 385 million homes worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/about-cnbc-international/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

''The Rundown'' launched on March 31, 2014. It was one of the two programs that replaced ''[[Cash Flow (CNBC Asia)|Cash Flow]]'', with ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' being the other.

The program provided real-time financial market coverage and business information for the start of the Asia trading day. The program features a range of guests from top financial institutions around the world, as well as guests from CNBC's global headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and reports from CNBC and NBC News bureaus worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbcumv.com/programming/cnbc/about?network=33135&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Show presenters==

On December 24, 2015, Adam Bakhtiar left CNBC Asia, leaving Pauline Chiou as the sole presenter of ''The Rundown''. On October 3, 2016, Correspondent Akiko Fujita replaced Chiou as anchor.&lt;ref&gt;http://talkingbiznews.com/1/chiou-has-left-cnbc-asia-and-moved-to-new-york/&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of February 2018, correspondent Dan Murphy replaced Fujita as anchor, after the latter was appointed co-host of ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'', which is based in [[Hong Kong]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mumbrella.asia/2018/02/cnbc-expands-hong-kong-newsroom-after-seeing-90-per-cent-traffic-rise&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
''The Rundown'' was cancelled on October 26, 2018.  As a result, ''Asia Squawk Box'' was moved back to the 6-9am SIN/HK time slot and the Asia version of ''Street Signs'' was expanded to three hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">'''Workforce Nationalization''' is a government initiative that can be described as the recruitment and employee development to encourage or often require the employment of native-born population in certain jobs or industry sectors, thus reducing a country‘s dependency on expatriate workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bryancave.com/images/content/8/1/v2/814/MiddleEastArticle2-04.pdf|title=Legal Issues Related To Doing Business In The United Arab Emirates|last=Cave|first=Bryan|date=2004|website=Bryan Cave LLP|publisher=Bryan Cave LLP|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have been defined as a multi-level process through which reliance on the expatriate workforce is reduced and native-born population is prepared to take up jobs performed by expatriates. Such preparation enables native-born employees to perform their jobs equally as well as, if not better than, expatriates in the shortest possible period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/uae-labour-market-and-problems-of-employment-of-nationals-an-overview-and-policy-agenda/oclc/241439603|title=UAE labour market and problems of employment of nationals : an overview and policy agenda|last=Abdelkarim|first=Abbas|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing a skilled native-born workforce is one of the most critical challenges facing countries of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)]] from an economic security and a social inclusion perspective. Integration of skilled native-born workforce and reduction of dependence on the expatriate workers has been on the top of agendas of the GCC states. Furthermore, continued economic growth and industrial diversification demand qualified and competent local workforce. With growing population of young nationals graduating every year, there is an urgent need to integrate them into the job market especially in the private sector to strike the right balance in representing local talent in the workforce. To meet those challenges, governments adopted human resources development strategies (also known as Bahrainization, [[Emiratisation]], Kuwaitization, Omanization, [[Qatarization]], and [[Saudization]]) that target the employment of native-born workforce through various incentives, regulations, policies, educational reforms and economic diversification plans.

Some forward-thinking organizations realized the benefit of workforce nationalization early on. Since 1960, [[Schlumberger]] has operated by a “recruit where we work” philosophy that is driven by the revenue size of a particular region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drillingcontractor.org/workforce-nationalization-companies-take-pride-in-strong-recruiting-retention-practices-19794|title=Workforce nationalization: Companies take pride in strong recruiting, retention practices - Drilling Contractor|website=Drilling Contractor|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCC states mandated their respective ministries of labor to establish employment quotas for different sectors to employ native-born workers. Failing to achieve these quotas can result in penalties and not being able to win government projects for example. There are different local bodies that are in place and are being set up to provide career advice, coaching, training and development mostly for recent graduates in order to accelerate their careers in the private sector. Each country has set its own nationalization quota focusing predominantly on banks, insurance firms, and commercial companies. Enforcing workforce nationalization in the GCC led to most of the business contracts or agreements with major companies outlining legal requirements for “Workforce Nationalization”, “Local Content”, “Localization” or “Technology and [[Knowledge transfer|Knowledge Transfer]]”.

Most of the efforts to enforce workforce nationalization have had mixed success thus far in their sustained implementation for a variety of reasons. According to Ms Randa Bahsoun, Partner – People &amp; Organization Practice, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] Middle East four main challenges in the workforce nationalization, “Balancing workforce nationalization efforts while leveraging experienced expatriate talent; public pressure to reduce local unemployment especially in the backdrop of low oil prices; skill shortages and increased global competition; and integration of women and millennials into the workforce at middle senior management levels.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gulfnews247.com/2015/10/19/staying-relevant-innovative-hr-policies-to-attract-millennials/|title=Staying Relevant: Innovative HR Policies to Attract Millennials|website=Gulf News 24/7|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from Kasim Randeree, a senior research at the [[University of Oxford]], notes that the GCC states have all “become reliant on migrant workers” in recent decades, with Qatar and the UAE “at the extremity of the situation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/804215/Workforce_Nationalization_in_the_Gulf_Cooperation_Council_States|title=Workforce Nationalization in the Gulf Cooperation Council States|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;”. In [https://www.academia.edu/804215/Workforce_Nationalization_in_the_Gulf_Cooperation_Council_States ‘Workforce Nationalization in the Gulf Cooperation Council States’], he also notes that while much has been written and said on the reasons why these states are looking to nationalize their workforce, “only a limited body of knowledge exists to guide and shape the success of such schemes”. The need for a reliable workforce nationalization framework based on the proven business practices is critical now more than ever.
