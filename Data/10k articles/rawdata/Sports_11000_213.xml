In 2011, the foremost [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] event was the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Daegu]]. The other major global level competition held in 2011 was the [[2011 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|World Cross Country Championships]].

The 2011 season marked the re-establishment of the [[African Cross Country Championships]], an event created in response to the change of the World Cross Championships from an annual to a biennial format. It was also the first year since 1992 that the [[IAAF World Half Marathon Championships]] was not held, as that competition also switched to a two-year schedule.

'''Acrobatic gymnastics''' (previously called '''sport acrobatics''') is a competitive gymnastic discipline where partnerships of gymnasts work together and perform figures consisting of acrobatic moves, dance and tumbling, set to music. There are three types of routines; a 'balance' routine where the focus is on strength, poise and flexibility; a 'dynamic' routine which includes throws, somersaults and catches, and (at FIG level 6 and above) a 'combined' routine which includes elements from both balance and dynamic.

The sport is governed by the [[International Federation of Gymnastics]] (FIG). At international level, there are four FIG categories of competition defined by age; 11-16, 12-18, 13-19, and 15+ (Senior).

Acrobatic gymnasts perform in pairs or groups and enter into and are judged at a specific level or age group category. In each partnership, the gymnasts' different sizes and abilities will be balanced to complement each other in order to carry out the complex moves. Some will mainly carry out supporting and pitching roles, and are known as bases. They are then balanced with smaller gymnasts who become the 'tops'. The different partnerships seen in competition are:
* women's pair (two females)
* men's pair (two males)
* mixed pair (a male base and a female top)
* women's group (three females)
* men's group (four males)

In competition, partnerships perform a routine to music, that has usually been choreographed specifically for them. The gymnasts carry out their acrobatic moves and combine them with dance, all in time to and in keeping with the style of the music. Partnerships are judged on artistry, difficulty of skill and the execution of skills.

The rules for the sport, known as the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]], are governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]]. These rules are subject to change every four years in line with the Olympic cycle, as in other disciplines of gymnastics.

== Competitions ==
Acrobatic Gymnastics is part of the [[World Games]], and are also included in the inaugural [[European Games]] as well as having a dedicated [[Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships]] held in even numbered years (known as [[World Sports Acrobatics Championships]] prior to 2006), and continental or region championships in odd numbered years. For example, the European Acrobatic Championships were held in Lisbon, Portugal in October 2013.

There are also numerous national, state, and regional competitions that are held in each country. Local and regional competitions often form the qualification stages required to compete at national championships. There is no requirement from the FIG for gymnasts to have qualified through their own national championships to compete internationally, but local governing bodies will often make their national team selections based on performance at national competition.

Acrobatic gymnastics events often attract sizeable audiences, because they are highly entertaining, exhilarating, and suspenseful due to what look to be risky or daring moves. At the London 2012 Olympics, acrobatic partnerships were seen performing before the Olympic gymnastic events, and during the opening and closing ceremonies. It has been said that its appearance, despite not being an Olympic discipline is testament to its ability to entertain.

Gold, silver, and bronze medals are generally awarded in the usual fashion; although in some competitions, a minimum score is required to qualify for medals.

== Routines ==
Routines are required at a competition depends on the level at which the gymnasts are competing. At the junior and senior levels, all three routines are required, whereas at lower age levels, a single simpler routine is required. Each of the routine types has a different emphasis, but all include tumbling and dance as elements. The different routine types are as follows:

# Balance (formerly known as Static) - A balance routine requires that certain poses or 'balances' and must be held static for a specific duration. These moves require strength, poise, elegance and flexibility. Gymnasts will combine into towers, or pyramids with the tops holding a particular position balanced on their bases. Traditionally, balance routines were often performed to slower music, but not exclusively so.
# Dynamic (formerly known as Tempo) -  These routines demonstrate power, strength and grace through the performance of acrobatic moves that involve the phases of spring, flight, rotation, and landing. This often involves the base, or bases in the partnership propelling the top through the air and through a series of somersaults or twists. The top is generally caught, or supported in the landing by their base(s). 
# Combined - At the more senior levels of competition, a third routine must be performed that combines both balance and dynamic moves, along with the usual tumbling and dance.

== Scoring ==

The acrobatic gymnastics competitions are judged on a score out of 30.00, with 10.00 assigned for each of the following:
* an artistic component which evaluates the acrobats performance in terms of choreography, diversity, and ability to perform to the music;
* an execution component which evaluates the deductions incurred by the acrobats whilst performing the partner and individual skills of the routine (for example, bent legs or unpointed toes); and
* a difficulty component which is the overall equivalent score based on the [[degree of difficulty]] and number of skills (the difficulty score is determined by the value allocated to skills according to the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]).

In the senior age group, routines can carry a difficulty tariff of greater than 10, meaning that scores of over 30 are not uncommon.

== Judging ==

The judging panels of acrobatic gymnastics are similar to other disciplines of gymnastics where different panels of judges are overseen by a head judge, and each panel has a 'Chair of the Judging Panel' (CJP) who oversees that panel's activities. In acrobatic gymnastics, there are then difficulty judges (DJ) who only assess the difficulty of the elements in the routines; artistic judges (AJ) who only assess the performance and artistic merits of the routine; and execution judges (EJ) who only judge what points should be deducted based on imperfect execution of individual elements in the routine. The numbers of each type of judge on an acrobatic panel depends on the level of the competition and can vary from one to many (with the exception of the Chair, as there is only one CJP per panel).

== History ==
The first use of acrobatics as a specific sport was in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s, and the first world championships were in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usagym.org/pages/post.html?PostID=713&amp;prog=a|title=History of acrobatic gymnastics|author=|date=|website=USA Gymnastics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the current five categories, two additional categories for tumbling (men's and women's) were included until the 1999 World Championships, though some groups still involve tumbling events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~irishacro/irishsportsacro.htm|title=Irish Sports Acrobatics Homepage|author=|date=|website=homepage.eircom.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first national sports acrobatics organization was called the United States Sports Acrobatics Federation (USSAF). Founded in 1975, its name was changed to the United States Sports Acrobatics (USSA) in the 1990s. The USSA then merged with USA Gymnastics in 2002, and Acrobatic Gymnastics is now a discipline therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usagym.org/pages/gymnastics101/acro/|title=USA Gymnastics - Gymnastics 101 - Acrobatic Gymnastics|author=|date=|website=usagym.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arto Tolsa Areena''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Kotka]], [[Finland]].  It is the home stadium of [[Kotkan Työväen Palloilijat]] (KTP).  The stadium holds 4,780 and was inaugurated in 1952 for the [[Helsinki Olympics]]. The stadium's record attendance was made during the Olympic Games in the [[Association football|football]] match between the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]], the score having been 2–1 [[extra time|a.e.t.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf 1952 Summer Olympics official report.] p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the source, the record is 10,000,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197058/matches/match=32377/report.html FIFA Match Report ''Soviet Union – Bulgaria'' 16 July 1952.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022083858/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament%3D512/edition%3D197058/matches/match%3D32377/report.html |date=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 10,637 or 10,950.&lt;ref&gt;Harri Levänen: "Kyllä Urheilukeskukseen mahtui", ''Kymen Sanomat'', July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arto Tolsa Areena used to be known as "Urheilukeskus" ("Sports Center" in Finnish). It got its current name after it was renovated around the turn of millennium. The current name comes from [[Arto Tolsa]], who was a legendary [[Finland|Finnish]] player of Kotkan Työväen Palloilijat, the predecessor of KTP.

The covered main stand holds 2,500 spectators. The size of the pitch is 105 by 65 metres. The power of the lighting system is 1200 [[lux]].

At the beginning of the 2015 season, the pitch was converted to an artificial playing surface.

[[File:Ekaterina Gamova 4.jpg |thumb|200px|Athletic taping]]
'''Athletic taping''' is the process of applying tape directly to the skin in order to maintain a stable position of bones and muscles during athletic activity. It is a procedure that uses [[adhesive tape|tape]], attached to the [[skin]], to physically keep in place [[muscles]] or [[bone]]s at a certain position. This reduces pain and aids recovery. Taping is usually used to help recover from overuse and other injuries.

The general goals of athletic taping are to restrict the motion of an injured joint, compress soft tissues to reduce swelling, support anatomical structures involved in the injury, serve as a splint or secure a splint, secure dressing or bandages, protect the injured joint from re-injury, and protect the injured part while the injured part is in the healing process.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Birrer RB, Poole B. "General principles, specifics for the ankle, taping of sports injuries: Review of a basic skill." ''J Musculoskel Med''. 2004; 21:197–211&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of taping ==
Taping has many roles such as to support the ligaments and capsules of unstable joints by limiting excessive or abnormal anatomical movement. Taping also enhances proprioceptive feedback from the limb or joint. Finally, taping can support injuries at the muscle-tendon units by compressing and limiting movement and secure protective pads, dressings and splints.

== Advantages ==

'''Injury Prevention''': Athletic taping is recognized as one of the top preventative measures for reduction of injuries in collision sports.&lt;ref&gt;Engstrom BK, Renstrom PA. How can injuries be prevented in the World Cup soccer athlete? Clin Sports Med. 1998; 17:755-768&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Gissane C, White J, Kerr K, Jennings D. An operational model to investigate contact sports injuries. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2001; 3:1999-2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall SW, Waller AE, Loomis DP, Feehan M, Chalmers DJ, Bird YN, et al. Use of protective equipment in a cohort of rugby players. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2001; 33:2131-2138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkarri J, Kujala UM, Kannus P. Is it possible to prevent sports Injuries? Review of controlled clinical trials and recommendations for future work. Sports Med. 2002; 31:985-995&lt;/ref&gt; These injuries often occur as a result of extrinsic factors such as collision with other players or equipment.  Athletic taping has also been shown to reduce the severity in injuries, as well as the occurrence of injury in most sports.&lt;ref&gt;Bahr R, Karlsen R, Lian O, Ovrebo RB. Incidence and mechanisms of acute ankle inversion injuries in volleyball. Am J Sports Med. 1994; 22:595-600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Butterwick DJ, Nelson DS, LaFavre MR, Meeuwisse WH. Epidemiological analysis of injury in one year of Canadian professional rodeo. Clin J Sports Med. 2004; 6:171-177&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Injury Management''': Tape is often applied to manage symptoms of chronic injuries such as medial tibial stress syndrome (or [[shin splints]]), patella-femoral syndrome, and [[Turf toe|turf-toe]].&lt;ref&gt;McConnell J. A novel approach to pain relief: pre-therapeutic exercise. J Sci Med Sport. 2000; 3:325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specchiulli F, Cofano RE. A comparison of surgical and conservative treatment in ankle ligament tears. Orthoped. 2001; 24:686-688&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ugalde V, Batt ME. Shin splints: current theories and treatment. Crit Rev Phys Rehabil Med. 2001; 13:217-253&lt;/ref&gt; Athletic tape can be applied to ease pain symptoms as well.  Taping along the nerve tract of irritated or inflamed tissue can shorten the inflamed region and reduce pain.&lt;ref&gt;Heidt RS, Dormer SG, Cawley PW, Scranton PE, Losse EG, Howard M. Differences in friction and torsional resistance in athletic shoe-surface interfaces. Am J Sports Med. 1996; 24:834-842&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McConnell J. Racalcitrant chronic low back and leg pain--a new theory and different approach to management. Man Ther. 2002; 7:183-192&lt;/ref&gt;

Other post-injury benefits include: 1) stabilizing and supporting joints after injuries to the muscle or ligament; 2) assisting and allowing the athlete to return to activity after minor injuries; 3) preventing and reducing further harm to injured area; 4) maintaining proper biomechanics during activity; 5) preventing neuromuscular damage; and 6) reducing force on the area during activity.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandyopadhyay|first1=Amit|last2=Mahapatra|first2=Dakshayani|title=Taping in Sports: a brief update|journal=Journal of Human Sport and Exercise|date=2012|volume=7|issue=2|pages=544–552|doi=10.4100/jhse.2012.72.17|url=http://www.jhse.ua.es/jhse/article/view/191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

*Incorrect athletic taping may lead to [[Blisters|blistering]] or future injuries.&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt;
*After activity and motion begins, the stiffness of the tape reduces.&lt;ref&gt;Wojyts EM, Huston LJ. “Customer-fit” versus “off-the-shelf” ACL functional braces. Am J Knee Surg. 2001; 14:157-162&lt;/ref&gt;
*Physiological dependency on using tape 
*Expensive, especially when it is needed frequently

== Techniques ==

There are set regulations and rules that govern the athletic taping techniques used by trainers and health professionals. There are a few aspects of athletic taping that are standardized.&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett WE, Kirkendall DT, Squire DL. Principles and practice of primary care sports medicine. Philadelphia (PA): Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nineteen"/&gt;
#'''Skin preparation''': Removal of hair, cleaning of skin, addressing of any lesions with necessary consultation, using adherents and lubricants, underpads, etc.&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;Zetaruk, MN. The young gymnast. Clin Sports Med. 2000; 19:757-780&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Functional position of the body to be taped''': The athlete’s position depends on the area getting taped.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
#'''Body mechanics of the trainer/taper''': The athlete must be at a comfortable height in order to reduce fatigue over long periods of taping time.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
#'''Athletic tape application''': Athletic tape must be adhered to a dry and clean area of the body at body temperature to bare skin or pre-wrap in order to prevent slippage and to maintain the effectiveness and rigidity of the wrap. The type and width of the athletic tape must be appropriate (able to strap the given body part suitable) for the area being taped. Areas subject to high friction should be reinforced with protective padding or under-wrap. Athletic tape should be applied: film and wrinkle free; without impairment of circulation, nerves, or muscle movement; and without pressure on body prominences.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
#'''Removal''': Removal of the athletic tape post athletic activity should be done with tape cutters (sometimes known as ‘Sharks’) or special tape scissors. The skin must be free of tape residue.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

== List of applications ==

== Alternatives ==
Wraps and [[Brace (orthopaedic)|brace]]s can be used instead or with taping to stabilize the affected area. Braces might alter muscular activity, where tape might not.

== Types of tape==

Standard athletic tape is classified by the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;
*Number of vertical (warp) and horizontal (woof) threads per square inch. These threads vary from 120 to 150 per square inch. A higher thread count is synonymous with a higher quality including higher tensile strength, better adhesive, easier removal, longer lasting, and more expensive.
*Tensile strength
*Composition: bleached versus unbleached cotton; cotton versus synthetic fibers versus a blend of both.
*Rigid tape: provides a firm support, holds and reduces movement of a joint with a strong and sticky material, examples include Strappal or Endura Fix, etc.
*Under tape: has a different type of fabric that allows more movement and air, examples include Hyperfix or Endura Fix, etc.
*Elastic tape: flexible tape when is applied that lets your skin breath and transmit moisture through the type of material used, examples include Tensoplast and Elastikon, etc.
*Felt tape: this type of tape does not have any glue in the material and is used a barrier to the skin Example: Mueller
*Bandages: does not have glue in the material which allows them to stick to each other. Example: Coban
*Kinesio: adjusts to skin and glides as you move, commonly used by athletes &lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Jonathon."How, When, And Why To Use Athletic Tape." BodyBuiding.com. TRAINmagazine, 20 May 2015. Web. 18 Oct. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carrom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A Carrom Board]]

'''Carrom''' (also spelled '''carom''') is a [[cue sports|cue sport]]-based [[tabletop game]] of [[South Asia]]n origin. The game is very popular in [[Afghanistan]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], and surrounding areas, and is known by various names in different languages. In South Asia, many clubs and [[café]]s hold regular tournaments. Carrom is very commonly played by families, including children, and at social functions. Different standards and rules exist in different areas .

==Origins==
The game of carrom is believed to have originated from Afghanistan. One carrom board with its surface made of glass is still available in one of the palaces in [[Patiala, India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancarrom.com/brief-of-the-game.htm |title=All India Carrom Federation |accessdate=2 February 2015

|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216055759/http://indiancarrom.com/brief-of-the-game.htm |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became very popular among the masses after [[World War I]]. State-level competitions were being held in different States of India during early part of the nineteenth century. Serious carrom tournaments may have begun in [[Sri Lanka]] in 1935 but by 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations of carrom clubs, sponsoring tournaments and awarding prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carrom.org/game/?subcat=10/ |title=Carrom.org |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Carrom Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carrom.org/icf/ |title=International Carrom Federation |date=December 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icf-media.beepworld.de/ |title=International Carrom Federation - Media Commission |accessdate=26 March 2014 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ICF) was formed in the year 1988 in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The formal rules for the Indian version of the game were published in 1988. In the same year the ICF officially codified the rules. The game has been very popular throughout [[South Asia]], mainly in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]]. It has gained some popularity in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] where it has been introduced by the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]]. The United States Carrom Association reports on competitions in the US and Canada and has a player ranking list as of the last tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscarrom.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020610025606/http://www.uscarrom.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 June 2002 |title=United States Carrom Association |year=2013 |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board and pieces can be bought in Europe or the US and are usually imported from India. The most expensive boards are made to a high standard with high quality wood and decorations though cheaper boards are available. Some of the largest exporters of carrom boards are in India, e.g. Precise, Surco, Syndicate Sports and Paul Traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.precisesports.com/ |title=Precise Sports |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surisports.com/ |title=SuriSports.com |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syndicatesports.in/carrom.html |title=Syndicate Sports |accessdate=21 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922190122/http://www.syndicatesports.in/carrom.html |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiamart.com/paul-traders-jalandhar/ |title=Paul Traders carrom  boards |publisher=IndiaMart.com |accessdate=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922181931/http://www.indiamart.com/paul-traders-jalandhar/ |archive-date=22 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carromshop.com/carrom-manufacturer-list/ |title=Carrom Board Manufacturer List |publisher=Carrom Shop |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar games==
Aside from [[cue sports]], carrom also have similarities to [[table shuffleboard]], and [[shove ha'penny]]; though smaller. It may be ancestral (via [[British India]] and [[French Indochina]]) to several similar Western games including [[novuss]], [[crokinole]], [[pichenotte]], and [[pitchnut]].

==Objective of play==

The objective of play is to use a ''striker'' disk with a flick of the finger to make contact with and move lighter object disks called ''carrom men'', which are thus propelled into one of four corner {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pockets}}. The striker and carrom men are analogous to the {{cuegloss|cue ball}} and {{cuegloss|object ball}} in cue sports, respectively.

The aim of the game is to {{cuegloss|pot}} ({{cuegloss|pocket}}) one's nine carrom men and the queen before the one's opponent does. The carrom queen is analogous to the {{cuegloss|8 ball}} ({{cuegloss|black ball}}) in the game of [[eight-ball]] [[pool (cue sports)|pool]].

==Equipment==
The game is usually played on a board made of plywood. The dimensions of the standardised game is a {{convert|29|inch|cm}} square playing surface on a board of lacquered plywood. The edges of the playing surface are bounded by bumpers of wood, and the underside of each pocket is covered by a net which is 10&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or larger.&lt;ref name="Nets"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nets | url=http://www.carrom.org/icf/?subcat=20#g  | publisher=International Carrom Federation | accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carrom men===

{{Anchor|Carrom-men|reason=Old name, may be linked.}}[[File:Carromboard.JPG|thumb|Carrom men and one striker, arranged at the start of a game]]
Carrom is played using small disks of wood or plastic known as ''carrom men'' (sometimes abbreviated CM, c.m. c/m, etc.). These pieces, aside from the special ''[[#The Queen|queen]]'', may also be known as ''seeds'', ''coins'', ''pawns'' (as in [[chess]]), or ''[[Puck (sports)|pucks]]''. Carrom men are designed to slide when struck and are made with a smooth surface that slides easily when laid flat on the board. They are struck by a ''Striker'' of standard specification which is larger and heavier. Carrom follows similar "strike and pocket" games, like pool, with its use of rebounds, angles and obstruction of opponent's carrom pieces.

A carrom set contains 19 pieces (striker not included) in three distinct colours. Two colours to represent the players' pieces and one colour for the queen. The usual colours are white (or unstained) and black for the players and red for the queen.

ICF-approved pieces must have a diameter of no more than 3.18&amp;nbsp;cm and no less than 3.02&amp;nbsp;cm. The pieces must be between 7 and 9&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The pieces have a plain, rounded edge. The mass of the pieces must be between 5.0 and 5.5g.

===Strikers===

Striker pieces are used to push the carrom men and the queen across the board to the pockets. The carrom striker normally weighs 15 grams.

===The queen===
[[Image:Redcarromens.jpg|thumb|right|75px|The queen]]
The red disk is called the queen; it is the most valuable piece. During board setup, it is placed at the centre of the circle. In accordance with the ICF rules, pocketing the queen adds 3 points to the player's total score. The dimensions of the queen must be the same as those of other carrom men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The queen | url=http://pscamohali.googlepages.com/queen  | publisher=Punjabi State Carrom Association | accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The player must pocket the queen and subsequently pocket a carrom man of the player's own colour. This is termed ''covering the queen''. If, by mistake, a player puts a carrom man of the opposite team in the pocket after "pocketing" the queen, then the queen has to be placed in the centre of the board again. 
* If the player fails to pocket a subsequent carrom man, the queen is replaced at the centre of the board.
* If the player pockets his or her opponent's last carrom man before pocketing the queen, then its the foul.
* If a player puts the queen and a carrom man of the player's own colour in the pocket with one use of the striker, the queen is automatically covered, no matter which went first.

===Powder===
Fine-grained powder is used on the board to enable the pieces to slide easily. [[Boric acid]] powder is the most commonly used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Düzcükoğlu, H. |author2=Acaroğlu, M. |title=Lubrication Properties of Vegetable Oils Combined with Boric Acid and Determination of Their Effects on Wear |journal=Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pages=275–285 |doi=10.1080/15567030802606053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Why is boric powder used in carrom boards?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is boric powder used in carrom boards? |url=http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/why-is-boric-powder-used-in-carrom-boards.htm |publisher=Tata Chemicals: Let's Talk Chemistry |accessdate=2012-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718035007/http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/why-is-boric-powder-used-in-carrom-boards.htm |archivedate=2012-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has classified Boric acid as a "Serious Health Hazard" and states that "this substance may damage fertility or the unborn child"&lt;ref name="EHCA Substance Information card for Boric acid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boric acid - Substance Information - ECHA|url=https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.030.114|publisher=European Chemicals Agency|accessdate=2018-10-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, many players use a version of [[anti-set-off spray powder]] from the printing industry{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} which has specific electrostatic properties with particles of 50 micrometres in diameter. The powder is made from pure, food-grade vegetable starch.

==Standardised rules and regulations==
{{main article|International Carrom Federation}}
The ICF promulgates International Rules of Carrom (also termed "The Laws of Carrom"). ICF acts as the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] of carrom. The organisation also ranks players, sanctions tournaments and presents awards. ICF has many national affiliates such as the [[All-India Carrom Federation]], Australian Carrom Federation, and United States Carrom Association.

===The toss===
Order of play is determined by the process of "calling the carrom men" or "the toss". Before commencing each match, an [[Referee|umpire]] hides one black carrom in one hand and one white carrom man in the other hand. The players guess which colour carrom man is being held in each hand. The player who guesses correctly wins the toss.

The winner of the toss strikes first, which is called the opening break. The winner of the toss has the option to change sides from white to black and give up the opening break. The winner of the toss may not pass this decision to the other player. If the winner of the toss chooses to change sides then the loser must strike first.

The player taking the first shot (or break) plays white carrom men. The opponent plays black.
If that player cannot score any points then that player loses the turn and their opponent can choose to play any carrom man, Black or White in favour.

===Shooting===
A successful pot entitles the player to shoot again. This means that, as in pool and snooker, it is possible for a player to pot all his/her pieces and cover the queen from the start of the game without the opponent being given the chance to shoot.

Any player pocketing the queen is required to ''cover it''  immediately by pocketing one of their carrom man on the entitlement shot. If after potting the queen the player fails to ''cover it'', then the queen is returned to the centre of the table. It is illegal to pot the Queen after the last piece since the queen must always be ''covered''.

Thumbing is allowed by International Carrom Federation which allows the player to shoot with any finger including the thumb (known as "thumbing", "thumb shot", or "thumb hit").

Crossing the diagonal lines on the board by coming in touch with it, or pocketing the striker is a foul. A player needs to ensure that his striking hand does not infringe/cross the diagonal lines aerially/physically. A player committing a foul must return one carrom man that was already pocketed.

If a player pockets his striker, he has to pay a penalty. This penalty is usually 10 points.

==Variants==

===Professional carrom===
* Each team or player is assigned a colour and can only pocket that colour of carrom men.
* Pocketing the queen must be followed by pocketing another coin on the same strike.
* The queen can only be pocketed if the player has already pocketed a carrom man but has not yet pocketed the last carrom man of the player's colour as a carrom man must be pocketed to cover it.
* Once the queen is covered, whoever clears all their carrom men first wins the board.
* Queen and cover can be pocketed in the same turn, irrespective of the order they enter the pocket.
* The winner of a board collects one point for each of the opponent's carrom men left at the finish and three points for the queen if covered by the winner (if covered by the loser, no-one gets those points). No more points are collected for the queen after your score reaches 21.
* A game consists of 25 points .
* When placing the striker on the board to shoot, it must touch both base lines, either covering the end circle completely, or not touching it at all. The striker may not touch the diagonal arrow line.
* Shooting styles can vary between players, but all shots must involve flicking the striker and not pushing it. While players may orient their bodies for aiming, they must  remain seated for the shot.
* Carrom men can be struck directly only if they are not touching the player’s baseline or situated behind the base line. According to new rule if the carrom man is behind the baseline, the player can directly hit the carrom man by the carrom striker unlike before we have to strike the carrom men off any side of the carrom board or any other carrom piece on the board but not directly.
* Sinking the striker incurs a penalty of one piece and a loss of turn. If a piece is pocketed in the same shot as the striker that piece is also removed. These pieces are returned to the board in the center circle. If the striker is sunk before any of a player's carrom men, that player must later return a carrom man after sinking to make up for the deficit.
* If while the queen and a carrom man are sunk on the same shot, the queen is considered covered regardless of the order that the pieces entered the pocket. 
* If a piece jumps off the board, it is placed on the center spot. If pieces land on end or are overlapping, they are left that way.
* If the center spot is partially covered when replacing the queen or a jumped piece, the piece should cover as much red as possible. If totally covered, the piece is placed opposite the next player behind the red spot.
* One can touche any coin, player can touch their last piece directly before the queen, No penalty is imposed.
* If a player sinks an opponent's piece, that player loses a turn. If a player sinks an opponent's last carrom man, they lose the board and three points.
* If a player sinks their last piece before the queen, they lose the board, three points and one point for each of their opponent's pieces left.&lt;ref name="carrom.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carrom.org/game/?subcat=11 |title=The Game: How to Play |publisher=International Carrom Federation |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the striker does not leave both lines, the player has another chance. After three tries without leaving the lines the player loses their turn.&lt;ref name="carrom.org"/&gt;
* These rules are mostly played in the UK, Sri Lanka, and India.

===Point carrom===
Point carrom is a variant that is popular with children or an odd number of players.  Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.

* Carrom men of either colour are assigned 1 point each.
* The queen is assigned 3 points.
* To get queen points, one needs to put a carrom man of any colour in the same pocket after the queen on the same or a subsequent strike in the same turn. If the player fails to "cover" the queen in this fashion, the queen is put back in the center of the board.
* The first player to reach 21 points is declared the winner.
* If no player reaches 21 points, the player with the highest points is declared the winner. If the scores are tied, a tie-breaker must be played. Players who are tied select a colour and are only allowed to pocket carrom men of the other colour on rebound.
* This style of play is common in some areas of East Asia.

===Family-point carrom===
Family-point carrom (also known as simple-point carrom) is an informal variant suitable for an odd number of players.  Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.

* Typically, a black carrom man scores 5 points, and a white scores 10 points
* The queen scores 25 points.
* As in point carrom, the queen must be "covered" pocketing another carrom man in the same pocket on the same or subsequent strike in one's turn.
* With the points system, if one team/player gets queen points early in the game, the opponent still has a good chance to win by earning more points.
* This style of play is widely accepted in many areas of South Asia.

===Total-point carrom===
* The black carrom men are worth 5 points and the white ones are worth 10 points.
* The queen is assigned 50 points. As in the above two variants, it must have a carrom man pocketed after it.
* To win, a player must receive all the carrom men on the board.{{clarify|date=January 2018|reason=That doesn't make sense. I supposes that only one player can ever score, so this game could take years to conclude; it would be impossible to win if any opponent ever scored a single point.}}
* After the first round the player or team with the lowest score puts all their carrom men in the center.
* The others must match this score in the center and the players play for the carrom men in the center.
* They repeat this until one team or player has all the carrom men.
* This style of play is widely accepted in many areas of India and Pakistan.

==Board variations==
Carrom boards are available in various board sizes and corner-pocket sizes. There are smaller boards and boards with larger pockets. Boards with larger pockets are used by beginners for easier game play. On traditional carrom boards, the corner pockets are only slightly larger than the carrom men, but smaller than the striker. On boards with larger pockets, it is possible to pocket the striker, resulting in a "{{Cuegloss|Scratch|scratch shot}}" as in [[Pocket billiards|pool]]. This results in a "due". On a due, the player has to return one previously pocketed carrom man to the board. The standardised association and federation size is a 74&amp;nbsp;× 74&amp;nbsp;cm (29&amp;nbsp;× 29&amp;nbsp;inch) square playing surface with 5–10&amp;nbsp;cm (2–4&amp;nbsp;in) borders. Other play-area sizes are not used in tournaments and competitions.

===Pakistani ''duboo''===
A popular variant of the game called ''duboo'' is played mostly in Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan. In duboo, the size of the board is larger and the striker is slid instead of flicked.

===American carrom===
{{main|Carrom Company}}
American carrom is a variant developed around 1890 in the United States by [[Christian missionaries]] to Asia, who brought the game back with them. Concerned with young boys loitering around [[pool hall]]s (where gambling was common), a [[Sunday school]] teacher named [[Henry L. Haskell]] altered the game for Western tastes. Much of the game is the same, but the striker's weight is reduced and the carrom men are smaller. Generally, instead of disks, carrom men (including the striker) are rings, originally of wood but today commercially made of light plastic. In addition, as an alternative to using the fingers to flick the striker, some of the American carrom boards use miniature [[cue stick]]s. American carrom boards also have {{cuegloss|pockets}} built into the corners, rather than circular holes in the board, to make pocketing easier. While traditionally made boards vary widely, current commercially produced American carrom boards, by the [[Carrom Company]] of Michigan, are squares measuring 28&amp;nbsp;inches (71&amp;nbsp;cm) to a side, are printed with checkerboard and backgammon patterns, among others, and are sold with dice, skittles, etc. to allow other games to be played on the same board. These boards may also be printed with the circular pattern for playing [[crokinole]].

A relatively rare type among Western carrom boards has on the reverse a variant referred to colloquially as a "carrom maze", for an entirely different game.  This side of the board, perhaps inspired by [[miniature golf]], features a maze in the form of small plywood walls that restrict the carrom man to defined paths; the objective is to traverse the maze with a single carrom man and reach the end of the maze the fewest number of strokes, or to be the first to finish the maze among competitors.  Various parts of the maze include difficult-to-navigate corners and traps in the form of visually distinguished areas in which the player's carrom piece must not be caught when coming to rest (or suffer a penalty of extra strokes or forced relocation of the player's carrom to an earlier position).  Positive or bonus regions, usually small and hard to target, may offer shortcuts, allowing the player to relocate the carrom piece to a spot nearer the goal and continue, or providing a stroke count reduction, depending on the rules selected.

===Japanese carrom===
Carrom was introduced to Japan in the early 20th century. Carrom became popular as {{Nihongo3|[[Japanese language|Japanese]] for 'pounding board', 'fight ball board' or "throw ball board'|闘球盤|{{transl|ja|'''''tōkyūban'''''}}}}, but fell in popularity in the [[Shōwa period]]. However, carrom is still popular in [[Hikone, Shiga]] under the name Hikone Karomu (Hikone carrom). The Hikone carrom board has larger pockets (not unlike those of [[pichenotte]]), the discs are arranged in a ring (also like in pichenotte), each player is given twelve discs instead of nine, and the queen (known as the "jack") is pocketed last (similar to [[Eight-ball]] or [[Blackball (pool)|Black ball]]).

===South African fingerboard===
A variant of carrom is played in South Africa under the name '''fingerboard''' ({{lang-af|vingerbord}}). The board has larger pockets, the discs are arranged in a ring, each player has ten discs instead of nine, and the queen (known as the "donkey") is pocketed last.{{citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Likely true, but we still need a source.}}

==In popular culture==
*A [[Hindi language|Hindi]] "[[Bollywood]]" film titled ''[[Striker (2010 film)|Striker]]'' was released in 2010. The movie focuses on carrom [[Hustling|hustlers]] in [[Mumbai]] in the 1980s. The whole film was released on for Free on YouTube as soon as it was ready. Showing the love of Carrom by the Director. His first Bollywood film for Ten Years! 
*The Hindi film ''[[Ankush]]'' showed the ability of carrom to help four unemployed youths escape the painful realities of life.
*A Tamil film called ''Vilayaada Vaa'' released in 2012 was also focussed on carrom board.
*The Hindi film ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'' – and its Telugu remake ''[[Shankar Dada MBBS]]'', Tamil remake ''[[Vasool Raja MBBS]]'', and Kannada remake ''[[Uppi Dada M.B.B.S.]]'' – also features a scene with the main character playing carrom with an elderly friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shabana |last=Ansari |agency=TNN |title=Munnabhai flicks a strike for carrom |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-06-14/india/27168032_1_maharashtra-carrom-association-carrom-board-board-games |work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The English Film 'Slumdog Millionaire' was released by Director Danny Boyle also has many scenes in which Carrom gets played.

==Copies and reproductions==
There were several companies that made copies of Haskell's carroms game board. The Transogram Company made a version of Haskell's game board in the 1950s and called it ''Skooker''.{{r|varients}} [[Coleco]] in the 1980s made reproductions with names like "Carom-playing Games Board" with up to 202 derived replication games.{{r|varients}} Some variants in the 1970s were called "101 Games Board" and "Carom-playing 166 Games Board".{{r|varients}} An ice-box manufacturer made "Combinola" and "Crokinola" boards as variants of the game.&lt;ref name=varients&gt;{{cite web |url=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1186">'''Cherry pit spitting''' is the act of [[spitting]], or ejecting, the pit (the seed) of a cherry from one's mouth with great speed so as to send the pit a great distance. Spitting cherry pits is an amateur sport; there are no known professional leagues of cherry spitters, though this may change if enough people begin participating in this sport.  

A [[cherry pit]], the [[Endocarp|pit]] of a [[cherry]], is very small, about the size of a front tooth, and is very slippery when first removed from the cherry, making it easy to spit. According to the [[Guinness Book of Records]], the record distance is 95 feet and 6.5 inches (29.12 m).

The '''coach's box''' is a term used in numerous sports.  In [[baseball]], it is the space where the [[first base coach]] and [[third base coach]] stands.  
It is also common practice for a coach who has a play at his base to leave the coach’s box to signal the player to slide, advance or return to a base. This may be allowed by the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] if the coach does not interfere with the play in any manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/start_end_4.jsp The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Official info: Official Rules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[basketball]], it's a line that represents how far a coach may come towards centercourt.  In [[soccer]], the coach's box is simply a term for the typical area that the coach or manager is standing.

'''Drake Field''' was an [[American football]], [[baseball]], and [[track and field|track]] stadium on the campus of [[Auburn University]], in [[Auburn, Alabama]], United States.  From 1911 to 1939, Drake field was the home field of the [[Auburn Tigers|Auburn University Tigers]] [[Auburn Tigers football|football team]].  The stadium was also home to the [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn University Tigers baseball]] team from 1911 through 1949, and the [[Auburn High School Tigers]] football team from 1911 through 1920 and 1935 through 1939.  It had a capacity of 7,550 in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Turbyville, ''The Blue Book of College Athletics'' (Baltimore: F. Turbyville, 1939), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Drake Field was named for John Hodges Drake III, who served as the college physician from 1873 until 1926 and who donated the land for the field.&lt;ref&gt;"Auburn Men Glory in Athletic Field", ''Montgomery Advertiser'', October 13, 1911; Mickey Logue and Jack Simms, ''Auburn: A Pictorial History of the Loveliest Village''(Auburn: s.n., 1996), 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The field was inaugurated on October 7, 1911 with the college football team's 29-0 win over [[Mercer University|Mercer]]. Two months later on the field, [[Auburn High School (Alabama)|Auburn High School]] played the program's first football game, against [[Sidney Lanier High School]], on November 25, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;"Auburn Men Glory in Athletic Field", ''Montgomery Advertiser'', October 13, 1911; AHSFHS.org, "[http://www.ahsfhs.org/Teams2/gamesbyyear.asp?year=1911&amp;Team=Auburn Auburn - 1911]", retrieved August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Auburn High School continued to play football at the stadium until moving to their on-campus stadium [[Ross Field (Athletic)|Ross Field]] in 1921; they returned to Drake Field in 1935 after outgrowing that facility.&lt;ref&gt;''Opelika Daily News'', September 21, 1921''Opelika Daily News'', November 2, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the high school and the college football teams moved to adjacent Auburn Stadium, today [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], in 1939.  The college baseball team continued playing at Drake Field until 1949, when they moved to [[Plainsman Park]].  The field remained until the construction of the Haley Center in the late 1960s.  Drake Field today sits on the site of the Auburn University student union.

'''ERC Ingolstadt''' (''Eishockey-und-Rollschuh club'') ({{IPA-de|  aɪshɔkeː   ʊnt  ʁɔlʃuː  klʊp}}) is a [[Germany|German]] professional [[ice hockey]] club that plays in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]] (DEL). Commonly known as the '''Panthers''', the team plays its home games at the [[Saturn Arena]] in [[Ingolstadt]].

==History==
ERC Ingolstadt was promoted to the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]] in [[2002–03 Deutsche Eishockey Liga season|2002]] after three consecutive years of playing in the championship finals of Germany's second-tier hockey league, the [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2.Bundesliga]].

During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Ingolstadt signed [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) players [[Marco Sturm]], [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]], [[Jamie Langenbrunner]] and [[Aaron Ward (ice hockey)|Aaron Ward]]. Other well-known NHL alumni include goaltender [[Jimmy Waite]], [[Yves Sarault]], [[Patric Hörnqvist]] and [[Jason Holland]].

In the 2008–09 season, the team took part in the famous [[Spengler Cup]].

ERC Ingolstadt won its first and only DEL championship in [[2013–14 DEL season|2014]] as an overwhelming underdog entering the playoffs. After finishing in ninth place in the regular season, the Panthers knocked out the three-time defending league champions [[Eisbären Berlin]] in overtime of the final game of the playoff qualification round. In the first round of the playoffs, the team of head coach [[Niklas Sundblad]] then shocked second-seeded [[Krefeld Pinguine]] in five games and then eliminated [[Hamburg Freezers]], who had finished the regular season in first place, in six games. In the championship final, Ingolstadt defeated [[Kölner Haie]] in seven games, with goaltender [[Timo Pielmeier]] recording a 27-save shutout in Game 7.

By virtue of winning the DEL championship, ERC Ingolstadt was invited to play in the [[2014–15 Champions Hockey League]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6263">In professional [[basketball]], the most commonly used statistical benchmark for comparing the overall value of players is called '''efficiency'''. It is a composite [[Basketball statistics|basketball statistic]] that is derived from basic individual statistics: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers and shot attempts. The efficiency stat, in theory, accounts for both a player's offensive contributions (points, assists) and their defensive contributions (steals, blocks), but it is generally thought that efficiency ratings favor offense-oriented players over those who specialize in defense, as defense is difficult to quantify with currently tabulated statistics.

==NBA==
{{anchor|Martin Manley|Manley}}
===EFF===
The NBA publishes online all the basic [[basketball statistics|statistics]] recorded officially by the league. Individual player efficiency is expressed there by a stat referred to as 'efficiency' and abbreviated EFF. It is derived by a simple formula:
:&lt;tt&gt;[[Basketball statistics|(PTS + REB + AST + STL + BLK − Missed FG − Missed FT - TO)]] / GP&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nba.com/statistics/efficiency.html | title= Efficiency: The Daily Recap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula was created by Kansas City sports reporter and [[APBRmetrics#History|statistician]] [[Martin Manley (sportswriter)|Martin Manley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/23/tech/web/martin-manley-suicide-website/ | title= The sportswriter who blogged his suicide | first=Doug |last= Gross | publisher= CNN | date= August 23, 2013 | accessdate= 2013-08-24 |quote= Manley loved statistics; his "efficiency index" is still used by the NBA to rate players... }}&lt;/ref&gt;


===DPR===
DPR short for Defensive Player Rating is a stat that shows the Defensive prowess of a player showing their in game ability and defensive impact to their team by using a per game formula that equates for the amount of time spent on the court and taking into account psoition competition pace and era as well as other factors. This is the formula

( Player spg+ Player bpg/team minutes played)-(times blown by*Pace of Players Era)* Total Average of Possesions+( Players DRTG*Team Pace)/Total number of years played
===PER===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
The most commonly used alternative to the EFF is the [[player efficiency rating]] developed by [[ESPN]] basketball statistician [[John Hollinger]]. It is denoted as PER, and is derived by a very complex calculation designed to compensate for different teams' varying style of play, among other factors. PER scores do not differ markedly from EFF scores, but player rankings will not be the same in both systems. 

A PER of 15 is considered average across the entire league (not true of EFF), and serves as a simple benchmark against which any player may be quickly compared to indicate his approximate net worth to an NBA franchise. Teams intending to compete for the championship typically seek to enlist at least two star players with high efficiency ratings above the low twenties.

A PER of 30 over a span of more than a few games is considered exceptionally high. According to the modified PER formula used at Basketball-Reference.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html| title=Calculating PER| publisher=Basketball-Reference.com| accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest PER ever achieved over an entire single season in the [[NBA]] was 31.84 by [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in 1962/63. No other player surpassed 30 until [[Michael Jordan]] in 1987/88 with a PER of 31.71. Since then, Jordan repeated the accomplishment three more times, and the milestone has also since been eclipsed by [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], [[Stephen Curry]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]] (three times), [[Tracy McGrady]], [[Dwyane Wade]], [[LeBron James]] (four times) and [[Anthony Davis (basketball)|Anthony Davis]]. No PER statistics are available pre-1951/52 as the 'minutes played' statistic was first recorded during that season.

Some currently active NBA players known for consistently high efficiency ratings include, [[LeBron James]], [[Chris Paul]], [[Russell Westbrook]], [[Dwyane Wade]], [[Kevin Durant]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and [[Dwight Howard]].

* Highest career player efficiency rating: Michael Jordan (27.91)
* Highest single-season player efficiency rating: Wilt Chamberlain (31.82 in 1962–63)
* Highest career playoff player efficiency rating: Michael Jordan (28.59)
* Highest single-season playoff player efficiency rating: [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] (38.96 in 1988)

{{Main|Performance Index Rating}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
The [[EuroLeague]], its [[European professional club basketball system|second-tier level]] competition, the [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]], and several European national domestic leagues, use a different type of formula to determine the ratings and efficiency of players, called the [[Performance Index Rating|performance index rating]] (PIR):

*&lt;tt&gt;([[point (basketball)|Points]] + [[rebound (basketball)|Rebounds]] + [[assist (basketball)|Assists]] + [[steals (basketball)|Steals]] + [[block (basketball)|Blocks]] + [[personal foul (basketball)|Fouls Drawn]]) - (Missed [[field goal (basketball)|Field Goals]] + Missed [[free throw|Free Throws]] + [[turnover (basketball)|Turnovers]] + [[block (basketball)|Shots Rejected]] + [[personal foul (basketball)|Fouls Committed]]).&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Felton Little Park''' (originally '''Auburn City Park''') is a municipal park in [[Auburn, Alabama]], United States.  Felton Little Park is the oldest park in Auburn.  From 1949 until 1968, the park was the home stadium of the [[Auburn High School (Alabama)|Auburn High School]] [[Auburn High School Tigers|Tigers]] [[American football|football]] team, and from 1949 through 1967, the Auburn High School baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;''Lee County Bulletin'', September 28, 1949; ''Lee County Bulletin'', October 2, 1968; ''Minutes of City Board of Education, Auburn, Alabama'', February 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, Felton Little Park has three [[softball]] fields for youth leagues.  The park is named for Felton Little, an Auburn city councilman who donated the land for the park.&lt;ref&gt;Alabama Department of Archives and History, ''Alabama Official and Statistical Register'', (Montgomery, Ala.: State of Alabama, 1931), 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1940s the city of Auburn decided that the town needed a centrally-located park and football and baseball facilities for Auburn High School, which had previously been playing home matches at nearby [[Auburn University]].  The nearest property suitable for such a park to downtown was owned by Felton Little, who donated the land to the city in September 1947.&lt;ref&gt;"Eight Acres Is Given City For Park By Little Heirs", ''Lee County Bulletin'', September 4, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 30, 1949, the park was dedicated as Auburn City Park as the Auburn High football team played Tuskegee High School.  As the football field was equipped with outdoor lights, this was the first night football game to be played in Auburn.&lt;ref&gt;''Lee County Bulletin'', September 28, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the park was renamed "Felton Little Park" after its benefactor.  In 1967, the Auburn High baseball team moved from the park to a new facility on the high school campus (today Sam Welborn Field), and on October 4, 1968, the football team played its final game at Felton Little before inaugurating its new stadium, [[Duck Samford Stadium]].  In the early 1970s, the park was converted to house three youth-league baseball fields, and in 2003 the park underwent a major renovation which converted the three fields to softball fields.&lt;ref&gt;Auburn and Opelika Tourism Bureau, ''Auburn-Opelika Sporting Facilities Guide'' (2006), 2; ''Lee County Bulletin'', October 2, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
Auburn High School's football team played 20 seasons at Felton Little, compiling a 42–42–8 record.&lt;ref&gt;AHSFHS.org, ''[http://www.ahsfhs.org/Teams2/yearlytotals.asp?Team=Auburn Auburn Yearly Record]'', retrieved August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">'''Groundhopping''' is a hobby that involves attending matches at as many different stadiums or grounds as possible. Participants are known as groundhoppers, hoppers or travellers. Largely a [[association football|football]]-related pastime, groundhopping probably found its origin in football in the 1970s in [[England]]. From the late 1980s fans in [[Germany]] started groundhopping as well. Currently it is especially popular in the [[United Kingdom]], Germany, the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and Norway.

There is no universal set of rules for counting ‘hopped grounds’, although a generally accepted one is that a match must have been seen at the ground. 

There are some formal organisations for groundhoppers, including [[The 92 Club]] in England, which consists of groundhoppers who have visited matches in all stadiums of the [[Premier League|Premier]] and [[the Football League|Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ninety-Two Club.

'''John Thorn''' (born April 17, 1947) is a sports historian, author, publisher, and [[cultural commentator]]. Since March 1, 2011, he has been the Official Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name=MLB/&gt;&lt;ref name=shannon/&gt;&lt;ref name=TJW/&gt;

==Personal profile==
Thorn was born in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]],&lt;ref name=TJW/&gt; where his Polish Jewish parents had come as refugees.&lt;ref name=shannon/&gt; Less than two years after Thorn was born, his family emigrated to the United States, and settled in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]].  “I fell in love with [[baseball card|[baseball] cards]] before I loved the game, when I discovered that baseball was something that all the kids on my street corner cared about," Thorn said in a 2013 profile. "I was an immigrant kid and was looking for a way into America. With my background I saw myself as an underdog, and so [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn]] had to be my team. I began watching the game seriously when I was eight, in 1955, on my [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|Admiral]] television, but I had already begun to follow their exploits in the daily newspapers my father brought home with him each night.”&lt;ref&gt;Kahrl, Christina, [http://sabr.org/research/henry-chadwick-award-john-thorn Henry Chadwick Award: John Thorn], Society of American Baseball Research's ''Baseball Research Journal'', Fall 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teen he played baseball and basketball. However, at age 19 he suffered a stroke. "It was severe," he said, "knocking out my left-side function for months as well as patches of personal memory—though not the powerful visual memory I retain for images and facts and statistics." The stroke left him with a limp and precluded his further participation in athletic activities.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;[http://www.hardballtimes.com/interview-john-thorn/ Jaffe, Chris, "Interview: John Thorn,"] ''The Hardball Times'', December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorn graduated from [[Beloit College]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=shannon/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; He is married to Erica Freudenberger, former director of the [[Red Hook, New York]], Public Library, who is currently affiliated with the [[Southern Adirondack Library System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://salsblog.sals.edu/2017/01/03/welcome-erica-freudenberger/ Announcement of Freudenberger's new position], SALS blog, November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife live in [[Catskill, New York]],&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;Post, Paul, [http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/October-2011/John-Thorn-An-Interview-with-Major-League-Baseball-Historian-Hudson-Valley-Catskill-NY-Resident-and-Author-of-Treasures-of-the-Baseball-Hall-of-Fame/ "John Thorn: An Interview with Major League Baseball Historian, Hudson Valley (Catskill, NY) Resident, and Author of Treasures of the Baseball Hall of Fame"], ''Hudson Valley Magazine'', October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; where they moved in 2010. He claims to have been drawn to the town because of its "slow pace," which suits him because, Thorn asserts, "I pride myself on being the world’s most boring man."&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

Thorn has three sons from two previous marriages.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"/&gt;

==Writings==
Thorn is the author and editor of numerous books, including ''[[Total Baseball|Total Baseball: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball]]'',&lt;ref name=shannon/&gt; ''Total Football: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Football'', ''Treasures of the Baseball Hall of Fame'', ''The Hidden Game of Baseball'',&lt;ref name=shannon/&gt; ''The Glory Days: New York Baseball 1947–1957'', and ''The Armchair Book of Baseball''.&lt;ref name=shannon/&gt;  His 2011 book, ''Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the Early Game'', published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], was an in-depth chronicle of the seminal development and pioneers of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://baseballeden.com Baseball in the Garden of Eden homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; A ''New York Times'' review of the latter book referred to Thorn as "a researcher of colossal diligence."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/books/review/book-review-baseball-in-the-garden-of-eden-by-john-thorn.html?_r=0 Weber, Bruce, "The Prehistory of Baseball,"] ''New York Times Sunday Book Review'', April 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorn is also the co-author with [[Pete Palmer]] and [[Bob Carroll (author)|Bob Carroll]] of ''[[The Hidden Game of Football]]'' and with them co-editors of ''[[Total Football]]''. His book ''[[New York 400]]'', a graphic history of the city timed for its [[quadricentennial]], created with the [[Museum of the City of New York]] and [[Running Press]], was published in September 2009. Thorn is a columnist for ''Voices'', the publication of the [[New York Folklore Society]].

He founded [[Total Sports Publishing]] and served as its publisher from 1998–2002.

==Role as historian==

Thorn served as the senior creative consultant for the 1994 [[Ken Burns]] documentary ''[[Baseball (documentary)|Baseball]]''.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

In 2004, Thorn discovered documentation that traced the [[origins of baseball]] in America to 1791 in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Litsky"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/sports/baseball-now-pittsfield-stakes-claim-to-baseball-s-origins.html Litsky, Frank, "Now Pittsfield Stakes Claim to Baseball's Origins,"] ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He has also attempted to shed light on the contributions of 19th century pioneers of the game, while debunking common misconceptions. "I don't want anyone to think of me as a crusader on behalf of causes," he wrote. "I'm only interested in setting the story straight, and in recognizing other stories for what they are, some of which are legend."&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.mlb.com/news/article/16934236/ Singer, Tom, "MLB historian sheds new light on game's origin,"], MLB.com, March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the claims of various localities to being the "birthplace of baseball," Thorn simply follows facts. "[[Abner Doubleday]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]," he notes, "are equally mythic figures."&lt;ref name="Litsky"/&gt;

In June 2006, the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR) bestowed on Thorn its highest accolade, the [[Bob Davids]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Davids Award – John Thorn |url=http://sabr.org/node/499 |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR) |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award honors those whose contributions to SABR and baseball reflect the ingenuity, integrity, and self-sacrifice of the founder and past president of SABR, L. Robert "Bob" Davids.

On March 1, 2011, he was named Official Baseball Historian for [[Major League Baseball]].,&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; succeeding the late ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' baseball writer [[Jerome Holtzman]], who served from 1999 until his death in 2008.&lt;ref name=MLB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10785">This article describes the rules of [[judo]]. The main sections of the article describe the rules that apply to any situation in which judo is practiced, and those rules which apply only in judo competitions. Separate sections describe the history of the rules of judo, provide links to other sources of information on '''judo rules''', and list the references for this article.

== In practice and competition ==

=== Safety ===

* Intentionally injuring an opponent is not permitted.
* Punching, kicking, and other strikes are not allowed.
* Touching the opponent's face is not allowed.
* Attacking joints other than the elbow is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;IJF Rules, Section 27.b.25&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Head dives'' are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;IJF Rules, Section 27.b.32&lt;/ref&gt;
* The technique known as [[kawazu gake]] is not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;IJF Rules, Section 27.b.24&lt;/ref&gt;
* The technique known as [[Kani Basami|kani basami]] is not permitted.
* Wearing any hard or metallic object during competition is not permitted.  The penalty for violating this rule is ''hansoku make'' (see '''Penalties''', below).&lt;ref&gt;IJF Rules, Section 27.b.34)&lt;/ref&gt; This includes wedding rings, earrings, hard-plastic protective gear, hair-ties with metal parts, wristwatches, and even press-studs on underpants.

=== Etiquette ===

* Contestants must bow before stepping onto the mat.
* Contestants must bow to each other before and after practice or competition.
* Inappropriate behaviour, such as foul language and bodily gestures, is not tolerated.

==In competition only==

* Stalling is not permitted.
* Using a defensive posture is not permitted.
* It is required to bow to the competition area.
* False attacks are not permitted. They are considered attempts to circumvent the prohibition against noncombativity.
* Disregarding the orders of the judge is prohibited.

=== Scoring ===
&lt;!-- need to elaborate on the following items --&gt;
The scoring rules in use starting in 2017 are as follows:
* Awarding of [[ippon]] (一本) 'One full point'. Award of ippon decides the winner and ends the match. Ippon is awarded for a successful throw performed with control and power, or for a pin lasting 20 seconds. Submission by strangulation or application of an arm lock at the elbow joint also results in ippon. 
* Awarding of [[waza-ari]] (技あり). 'One half point'.  Awarded for a successful throw lacking one of the above elements, or for a pin lasting 10 seconds.
The following rules are no longer in use:
* Until 2017, when two waza-ari are awarded in the same match, they were considered to be same as ippon and the match ended (the judge exclaimed 'Waza-ari, awasete ippon', or "Waza-ari to make ippon")
* Awarding of [[Yuko (judo)#Competition scoring|yuko]] (有効). One score of waza-ari was considered greater than any number of yuko scores. From 2008 to 2016, yuko was the smallest score that can be awarded. Yuko was removed from IJF competition in 2017.
* Awarding of koka &lt;!-- The article [[Koka]] is about the Koka Era in Japanese history 1844-1848 and doesn't mention Judo. --&gt; (効果). Was introduced in 1975 and removed from IJF competition at the end of 2008. Any number of koka scores does not add up to a yuko score.&lt;ref&gt;http://judoinfo.com/pdf/Contest%20Rules-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://judoinfo.com/rules2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Penalties ===
Two types of penalties may be awarded.  A ''shido'' (指導; literally "guidance" or "instruction") is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make, and does not result in expulsion from the tournament. The penalty of ''hansoku make'' (反則負け; literally "foul-play loss") is awarded for major rule infringements, or for accumulating three ''shidos''.  If ''hansoku make'' is awarded for a major rule infringement, it results not just in loss of the match, but in expulsion from the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;See Angus (2006) pp. 15-18 for a detailed explanation of judo penalties.&lt;/ref&gt; Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku make.

=== Competition area ===
The competition area must be padded with [[tatami]].  The minimum allowable size is 14 x 14 meters.  The match takes place in an 8 x 8 meter to 10 x 10 meter zone within this larger area.  The surrounding space acts as a safety zone.  When two competition areas are side by side, there must be at least a 3-meter safety zone between them.&lt;ref&gt;IJF Referee Rules, Section 1, ''Competition Area''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grips ===
Rules related to grips are primarily motivated by the desire to avoid stalling, to avoid providing undue advantage, or to reduce the chance of injury.

* Deliberately avoiding gripping is not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;IJF rules, Section 27.a.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a standing position, it is not permitted to take any grip other than a "normal" grip for more than three to five seconds without attacking. A "normal" grip is one where the right hand grips some part of the left/right hand side of the opponent's jacket (and the left hand grips some part of the right hand side of the opponent's jacket, vice versa.)  A non-normal grip may involve grabbing the belt, or the trousers, or the wrong side of the jacket.&lt;ref&gt;IJF rules, Section 27.a.10&lt;/ref&gt; (A non-"standard" grip is one that does not involve the traditional sleeve/collar grip. There are no time-limits related to non-"standard" grips as long as they are not non-"normal".)
* A "pistol grip" on the opponent's sleeve is permitted if immediate attack is launched.&lt;ref&gt;IJF rules 2018-2020, slide [http://99e89a50309ad79ff91d-082b8fd5551e97bc65e327988b444396.r14.cf3.rackcdn.com/up/2018/03/Explanatory_guide_of_the_judo_-1520605350.pdf 44]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not permitted to insert the fingers inside the opponent's sleeve opening or trousers opening at any time. You are permitted to insert your fingers inside your own gi openings.
* Biting the opponent's gi is prohibited, as it grants another gripping point.
*Since 2010, it is not permitted to grab the legs or trousers, initially, during tachi-waza (standing techniques).  As of 9 February 2013 it is no longer permissible to touch the legs of the opponent whatsoever during tachi-waza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.intjudo.eu/editor_up/up/IJF%20REF%20RULES_Final%20print%20vers_2011-12_ENG_Final_amended.pdf|title = International Judo Federation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is no longer permissible to break an opponent's grip with two hands.

=== Age ===

Judo competitions typically have some safety-related rules related to age: chokes are prohibited under a certain age (typically 13&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judoinfo.com/chokes.htm] Principles of Judo Choking Techniques&lt;/ref&gt;), and arm bars are prohibited under a certain age (typically 16).

The duration of matches is also dependent on the age of the competitors. Match length is typically three minutes for children, five minutes for teenagers and young adults, and three minutes for 'masters' (adults thirty years of age or older).

=== Gi ===

Rules related to the [[Judogi|gi]] are primarily related either to safety or to preventing contestants from wearing gis that prevent their opponent from being able to get a grip on them.

* The sleeves of the jacket are not allowed to be too short: cut the leg
 they must extend down to no more than 5&amp;nbsp;cm above the wrists with the arms extended in front of the body.&lt;ref&gt;IJF Rules, Section 3.d&lt;/ref&gt;
* The legs of the trousers are not allowed to be too short: they must extend down to no more than 5&amp;nbsp;cm above the ankle.&lt;ref&gt;IJF Rules, Section 3.e&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excessive advertising on the gi must be avoided, and may result in a forced loss if an appropriate gi can't be found.

=== Medical treatment, illness, and injury ===

The official [[International Judo Federation]] (IJF) rules related to the provision of medical treatment and to the proper handling of situations involving illness or injury are relatively long and involved, since the exact nature and cause of an injury may themselves affect the awarding of the match, and since receiving some types of medical treatment, but not others, automatically ends the match. The latter fact makes it necessary for medical attendants at judo matches to have some understanding of this rather complex aspect of the rules of judo.
The medical team is not allowed to enter the fighting area without permission from the mat judge, and if a contestant receives medical treatment he automatically forfeits the match. Nosebleeds, for example cannot be treated by the medical team, the contestant must fix it himself with materials provided by the medical team, proper procedure is stuffing cotton balls up the nostrils, while applying tape around the head.
If a contestant is rendered unconscious without a choking technique, and is unable to wake up, the medical team has to take immediate action and they can't wait for the contestant's consent, he forfeits the match automatically.
A contestant can ignore any injuries he has, and keep fighting. This requires that it is not of any discomfort to the opponent, e.g. bleeding over an opponent can cause penalties. If the bleeding is tried to be stopped three times, with no effect, the match is forfeited.

== History ==

* Effect of Russian gripping strategies on the grip-related rules.&lt;ref&gt;see Angus, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* The technique known as [[Kani Basami|kani basami]] was banned in 1980 after [[Yasuhiro Yamashita]] suffered a broken leg while being thrown with it.
* Motivation for banning of head-dives.

}}
A '''layup''' in [[basketball]] is a two-point shot attempt made by leaping from below, laying the ball up near the basket, and using one hand to bounce it off the backboard and into the basket. The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]]. The layup is considered the most basic shot in basketball. When doing a layup, the player lifts the outside foot, or the foot away from the basket. It is a foul if, during your layup, you hold the other person's hand or push it away to avoid him or her from defending. On the other hand, it is considered a foul if the defender jumps in front of you in the middle of nowhere and you both crash, in this case the defender causes a foul. A layup is very handy and to defend it, you just basically need to stand in front of the opponent with your arms stretched out.

An undefended layup is usually a high percentage shot. The main obstacle is getting near the rim and avoiding [[block (basketball)|blocks]] by taller defenders who usually stand near the basket. Common layup strategies are to create spaces, release the ball from a different spot, or use alternate hands.  A player able to reach over the rim might choose to perform a more spectacular and higher percentage [[slam dunk]] (dropping or throwing the ball from above the rim) instead.

==Versions==
[[File:20140402 MCDAAG Emmanuel Mudiay reverse layup.JPG|thumb|[[Emmanuel Mudiay]] does a reverse layup in the [[2014 McDonald's All-American Boys Game]]]]
As the game has evolved through the years, so has the layup. Several different versions of the layup are around today.
Layups can be broadly categorized into two types: the underarm and the overarm. The underarm layup involves using most of the wrist and the fingers to 'lay' the ball into the net or off the board. This layup is more commonly known as the [[finger roll]]. [[George Gervin]] was one of the early practitioners of a showy finger roll layup. Notable past NBA players who rely heavily on the underarm finger roll are [[Mike Bibby]] and [[Allen Iverson]].

Finger rolls today have many forms, including the "Around the World" which involves a complete circle around the player before the layup and a variety of faking in the approach to the rim. A classic example is a play by [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]] during his time with [[Sacramento Kings|Sacramento]], in which Williams brought the ball behind his back with his right hand, in a fake of a back pass, and then brought it front again with the same hand for the finish (reminiscent of [[Bob Cousy]], who pioneered the move).

The other layup is the overhand shot, similar to a jump shot but from a considerably close range. Overhand layups nearly always involve the action of the backboard. Players like [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Karl Malone]] have used this move to great effect.

The Reverse Layup is a more stylish method of making the ball from close. Generally you fake the defender into defending a regular layup on the near side and then jump to the far side of the basket before shooting.

It is common for players to create room for a layup by making use of the allotted two steps before the layup attempt. Variations and improvisations exist, yet the most common form is the 'Euro-Step'. So called as it was introduced to the NBA by European players, it has been adopted mainly by guards and forwardsas it relies heavily on agility and footwork to avoid larger defenders, although bigger players such as Joel Embiid have been seen making use of the move. The Euro-Step itself involves picking up one's dribble while dribbling, taking one step in one direction, then quickly taking a step in the other direction to avoid the defender to create room for a layup attempt. To make use of the move efficiently, it is best to dribble in aggressively then take two broad steps in different directions while simultaneously bringing the ball over one's head in the direction one is stepping for maximum evasion and protection while potentially drawing a foul.

Michael Carter-Williams has not made a layup in an actual NBA Game. He is the only player that has attempted over 100 and made none.

'''''Mr. 3000''''' is a 2004 American [[List of sports films|sports]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Bernie Mac]] and [[Angela Bassett]]. The film's plot surrounds a retired [[Major League Baseball]] player who makes a comeback at age 47 in order to attain [[3,000 hit club|3,000 hits]].

==Plot==
Stan Ross is the franchise player of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[baseball]] team. After recording his 3,000th [[hit (baseball)|hit]], the selfish, narcissistic Ross immediately retires, leaving the team without one of its star players in the middle of the [[1995 Milwaukee Brewers season|1995]] [[Playoffs#Major League Baseball|playoff]] race, showing every bit of disregard for his teammates' feelings. During the next nine years, Ross uses his nickname as a business tool, owning several profitable properties under the name "Mr. 3000" that make him increasingly wealthy.

In 2004, the Brewers [[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers|retire Ross' number]] so they can get rid of Ross for good, and also draw a large crowd. Although many fans come to the ceremony, other players, including teammates and fellow stars [[Robin Yount]], [[Cecil Cooper]], and [[Paul Molitor]], stay away. Only his best friend Anthony (Boca) Carter and a [[middle relief pitcher]] from his early days in the majors named Bill (Big Horse) Berelli attend, and the ex-pitcher chastises Ross for his arrogant attitude.

Ross learns that, due to a [[clerical error]], he retired with 2,997 hits instead of 3,000. The error also partially contributes to Ross not being voted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref name="hof"&gt;Voters have elected all eligible ([[Pete Rose]] is ineligible) players with 3,000 or more hits to the Hall of Fame, except for controversial player [[Rafael Palmeiro]].&lt;/ref&gt; and makes his "Mr. 3000" marketing gimmick inaccurate. Ross seeks to return to the game at the age of 47 to get three more hits, secure his place in the record books, and keep his local post-career marketing gimmick intact.

A top Brewers executive, citing the large attendance at Ross' number retirement ceremony and the fact that the Brewers are out of playoff contention, agrees to bring Ross back during the [[Major League Baseball rosters|September roster expansion]]. The team's younger players only know of Ross as a self-centered player, and team superstar Rex "T-Rex" Pennebaker, who is pompous and arrogant like Ross, sees him as unneeded and too old to play. Manager Gus Panas refuses to speak to Ross because of his abrupt retirement, and the [[sportswriting|sportswriters]] continually criticize him.

Despite his predictions to the contrary Ross struggles to regain his baseball form. He goes hitless in his first 27 at-bats. His comeback is reported by television sportscaster Maureen "Mo" Simmons, who resumes a former romantic relationship with Ross. He gets two hits, including a home run, to increase his career total to 2,999.

Ross becomes a mentor to the younger players and urges Pennebaker to learn from his own mistakes as a baseball star and to be a team player, so that Pennebaker will not end up like him – all alone. This inspires the Brewers to a late-season comeback and a respectable finish. Ross attempts to become serious with Simmons and make her a permanent part of his life, but she is reluctant to believe he is a changed man, particularly after he skips a team practice to go on national television with [[Jay Leno]] and begin boasting again.

In his last at-bat of the season, with a chance to be a hero, Ross has a vision of his earlier years, when he was considered always dependable for the team. It inspires him to sacrifice his last chance with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] instead so the team can win a game and finish third in [[National League Central|its division]]. Although Ross never reaches the "3,000" milestone, his newfound generosity and attitude gets him inducted into the Hall of Fame. He renames his businesses "Mr. 2,999."

The '''Olympic Oval''' in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada, is a covered [[speed skating]] oval; it was built for the [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics]] and opened {{Years or months ago|1987}} in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1988/orw1988pt1.pdf 1988 Winter Olympics official report.] Part 1. pp. 144-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on the [[University of Calgary]] campus, it is the official designated training center for Speed Skate Canada and the Canadian National Speed Skating team.

In 2012, it commemorated its 25th year of public service with a number of exciting activities and celebrations.

==History==
The Olympic Oval was designed as the first covered speed skating oval in [[North America]], and was the first at a [[Speed skating at the Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]]. The indoor facility offered the ability to control climate conditions to produce the highest quality ice.

Construction of The Oval began in 1985, nearly four years after Calgary had been designated host of the [[1988 Winter Olympics|XV Olympic Winter Games]]. Like the [[Olympic Saddledome]], most of the Oval's structure was built using precast, prestressed concrete. Twenty eight beams were laid along the outside of the perimeter of the building to support 84 additional beams used to construct a lattice frame for the arched roof. The interior scaffolding used to hoist these 84 beams had to be lowered a centimetre at a time in a predetermined sequence in order to distribute the load of the roof equally to each of the 28 exterior support beams. Construction was completed by the end of the summer of 1987, officially opening in September 1987, five months before the Olympics.

[[Image:Olympic Oval Aerial 1.jpg|left|thumb|Olympic Oval in 2007]]
It was during the [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|speed skating events]] of the Olympic Winter Games in 1988 that The Oval became known as ''"the fastest ice on Earth,"'' as world records were set in seven events ([[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Men's 500 metres|Men's 500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Men's 1500 metres|1500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 m]], and [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Women's 500 metres|Women's 500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Women's 1000 metres|1000 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Women's 3000 metres|3000 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Women's 5000 metres|5000 m]]), and Olympic records were set in the other three events ([[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Men's 1500 metres|Men's 1500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Men's 5000 metres|5000 m]], and [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Women's 1500 metres|Women's 1500 m]]).

The combination of the climate-controlled facility and the effects of high altitude have been credited for the fast ice surface. Seven world and three Olympic records were broken during the Games, resulting in the facility earning praise as "the fastest ice on Earth".&lt;ref name="CalgaryHerald_20130209_Legacy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Building on the Olympic Legacy |newspaper=Calgary Herald  |date=February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|A15–A16}} Throughout the following 14 years the vast majority of speed skating world records were set at The Oval. By 2013, at celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the 1988 Winter Games, the former CEO of the Winter Games said that the Olympic Oval had produced over "150 world record skating times".&lt;ref name="CalgaryHerald_Ferguson_20130218"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Calgary Herald |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Calgary+celebrates+legacy+1988+Winter+Olympics/7961936/story.html |title=Calgary celebrates legacy of 1988 Winter Olympics |first=Eva |last=Ferguson |date=February 18, 2013 |access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Training facility==
[[Image:Olympic Oval Panorama1.jpg|thumb|750px|left|A panorama taken from the northeast corner of the facility.]]Along with the 400 m long-track speed skating oval, the Olympic Oval also includes two international-sized ice rinks for short-track speed skating and ice hockey, a 450 m running track surrounding the main oval, and an eight-lane 110 m sprint track for year-round athletics training. By 2013, hundred of Canadian athletes were training in the Oval year round.&lt;ref name="CalgaryHerald_Ferguson_20130218"/&gt; [[Saskatoon]]-native [[Catriona Le May Doan]], who won the gold medal in speedskating at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] and in the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] began training at the Oval soon after its construction.&lt;ref name="CalgaryHerald_Ferguson_20130218"/&gt; 

The Oval continues to be regarded as a premier speed skating venue, and a preferred training facility for speed skating teams across the globe. 

==Other activities==
When not hosting hockey games and speed skating competitions, The Oval is open to public skating, family day events, and the Calgary Science Fair.

'''Rampla Juniors Fútbol Club''', commonly known as '''Rampla Juniors''', is a Uruguayan [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Montevideo]].

==Origin and colours==
Rampla Juniors were founded in the Aduana area, (also the birthplace of River Plate FC), then moved first to the Aguada neighbourhood, and finally, around 1920, to the Cerro neighborhood. Their colours are taken from Fortaleza, a club that existed in the early years of Rampla's stint in the Cerro area. Another story of how they chose their colours, is similar to how Boca Juniors supposedly got the idea for their kit colors from a Swedish flag on a ship. It is rumored that Rampla's founders took the red and green from an Italian flag on a ship that arrived in Montevideo Bay. It is also said that the basketball team CA Aguada (founded in 1922) took their colours from Rampla Juniors.

==Derby==
Rampla Juniors's archrivals are [[C.A. Cerro|Cerro]], and as such, the second biggest rivalry in the country.

==Trivia==
Rampla in 1927 won the [[Primera División Uruguaya|Uruguayan Primera División]], the 1927 Squad was: [[Pedro Arispe]] (Captain), Pedro Aguirre, Enrique Ballestrero, Pedro Cabrera, Julio Nieto, José Magallanes, Juan Miguel Fermín "Ruso" Labraga, Luis Gaitán, Conrado Haeberli, Vital Ruffatti and Conrado Bidegain.

Rampla was once called the third "big" (meaning popular or best) of Uruguay's clubs, [[Peñarol]] and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] being first and second, due to the huge number of followers and positive results.
In 2007, Rampla finished tied in 2nd place with [[Danubio F.C.|Danubio]] in the Uruguayan 1st division. Their team record was (9 wins, 4 draws, and 2 losses, in 15 games).

The '''Salomon Group''' (also just known as "'''Salomon'''") is a sports equipment manufacturing company that originated in [[Annecy]], [[France]].  The company was started in 1947 by François Salomon, his wife, and son Georges (1925-2010).  In 1997, it was acquired by  [[Adidas]] in a $1Bn deal.&lt;ref name=shggahvt&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDrY3hPDp48C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |magazine=Skiing Heritage |title=Georges Salomon |last=Hogen |first=Jackson |date=December 2010 |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oaffskgm&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IepPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OwgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6843%2C300242 |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |last=Sirak |first=Ron |title=Organizers announce field for Skins Game |date=September 17, 1997 |page=6D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Adidas-Salomon announced on May 2 that it had agreed to sell the Salomon Group for [[Euro|€]]485 million to [[Amer Sports]] of [[Finland]]; the transaction was completed on October 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salomonsports.com/docs/Press-release_02%2005%2005-e.pdf adidas-Salomon agrees to sell Salomon to Amer Sports Corporation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103131228/http://www.salomonsports.com/docs/Press-release_02%2005%2005-e.pdf |date=2007-01-03 }} from adidas-salomon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Salomon currently does not have a global CEO, as the business is separated between Winter Sports, Footwear and Apparel. 
Heikki Takala is the CEO of its mother group, Amer Sports, headquartered in Helsinki (Finland).
The US operations of Salomon are located in Ogden, Utah.

===Market===
[[File:Skis Salomon 01.jpg|thumb|Landmark Salomon skis: the 1080 and the Axecleaver]]
Salomon produces products for various sports markets, including [[trail running]], [[hiking]], [[climbing]], [[adventure racing]], [[ski]]ing, and [[snowboard]]ing in over 40 countries on five continents. They used to manufacture [[inline skates]], transferring technologies from their ski boot range, but have not released any in recent years (possibly due to an  infringement judgement).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Judgement+Forces+Salomon+to+Cease+All+Sales+of+Alleged...-a054268448 Judgement Forces Salomon to Cease All Sales of Alleged Patent-Infringing Skates] from thefreelibrary.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Many in-line skaters consider these to be some of the highest quality skates for street and vert skating.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Design===
[[File:Salomon Divine RS CF.JPG|thumb|A Salomon alpine boot (2010).]]
After a five-year research project, the SX series of ski boots was introduced in the beginning of the 1980s.  The boot was the result of collaboration with the French designer [[Roger Tallon]].

The SX91 ski boot was launched in 1984, the result of collaboration with the young French designer [[Roger Pitiot]].  The boot contained a number of innovations such as the sliding forward-flex control.

Salomon's dedicated design center is in Annecy, France.

'''Snowflex''' is a snow sports surfacing product, invented and manufactured by Briton Engineering Developments Ltd of [[Holmfirth, West Yorkshire]] in the UK.

[[File:Piste de ski de Noeux-les-Mines.JPG|thumb|250px|right|''Stade de glisse'' of [[Noeux-les-Mines]], [[France]] with the Snowflex snowsports system]]

==Definition==
Snowflex is an artificial snow surface. The surface system is made of a polymer composite, comprising a monofilament fibre and impregnated carrier layer. This sits on top of a shock absorption layer in an attempt to give an authentic responsive and reactive feel. Other components in Snowflex include an integrated misting system, known as BritonMist, for friction reduction and an impervious membrane for recycling of water. The base is a woven controlling layer which prevents earth movement. The surface layer is manufactured in tile form and as such Snowflex forms a [[wiktionary:Homogenous|homogenous]] system which can be cut and formed into features and shapes such as those found in alpine environments.

==Qualities==

* Slip and grip: Maximum forward speed; extra edge control for turning; realism is lost without speed and edge control
* Safety: Ultra cushioning for falls; no holes in surface layer to get caught in; no sharp edges/surface metal to cause abrasions or cuts.
* Form-ability: Ability to create adventurous and interesting terrain and stunt formations

Due to the complex nature of Snowflex, it is not possible to self-install. Instead the company which designed and manufactures it operates as installers as well. This is a first for snowsports surfaces as previous materials were able to be installed by slope operators at their own cost.

==Skiing Centers Using Snowflex==

Following its launch in 1996 Snowflex has been installed at over fifty full scale slope operations, including: [[Bearsden]], near Glasgow; Noeux les Mines in northern France (pictured above); [[Valladolid]] in Spain. There are many minor training installations around the world including Olympic training centres in the USA, Switzerland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Germany, Finland etc. 

Many other full scale installations can be seen around the world, including France as mentioned previously, Turkey (where the worlds largest synthetic slope is currently installedin Ankara), South Africa, and the USA. Installations in the United States can be seen at the Liberty Mountain Snowflex Centre near [[Liberty University]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], the YMCA of the Rockies in Colorado and at Wolfe Mountain Snowflex slope in Branson, Missouri. 

Liberty Mountain Snowflex Centre in Lynchburg, Virginia, was the first Snowflex facility in the United States to open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Doble, Mike (2009) [http://www.skisoutheast.com/Liberty-Mountain-Snowflex-Centre-Grand-Opening/ “Liberty Mountain Snowflex Centre Grand Opening”] SkiSoutheast.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzOBnSG6OxU Liberty University's Snowflex Centre] video at YouTube.com&lt;/ref&gt; The year round outdoor ski and snowboard slope includes both a beginner slope and an intermediate slope, as well as three big air kickers with a ninety foot long landing ramp, an 11' tall quarter pipe and wall ride. It also has multiple boxes and rail features for all levels of riders. Two carpet lifts take skiers to the top; a surface cable lift also tows skiers upward.

Historically, '''[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' has been famous for its [[physical education]]; it is known that the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were fascinated with Georgians' physical qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Romans erected the statue of the Iberian King Pharsman after he demonstrated Georgian training methods during his visit to Rome; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'', LXIX, 15.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most popular sports in Georgia are [[Association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[rugby union]], [[wrestling]], [[judo]] and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]]. Other famous sports in 19th-century Georgia were horse [[polo]] and [[Lelo burti|lelo]], a traditional Georgian game later replaced by rugby union.

[[Rugby union]] is a popular team sport played in Georgia.

==Wrestling==
[[Wrestling]] remains a historically important sport of Georgia and some historians think that the [[Greco-Roman]] style of wrestling incorporates many Georgian elements.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Douglas. ''Georgia in my Heart'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Georgia, one of the most popularized styles of wrestling is the [[Kakhetian]] style. However, there have been a number of other styles that are not as widely used today. For example, the [[Khevsureti]] region of Georgia has three different styles of wrestling.

==Basketball==
Despite the country's small size, it has produced several world elite basketball players including [[Tornike Shengelia]], [[Vladimir Stepania]], [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]] and most notably [[Zaza Pachulia]]. 
The people of Georgia have shown great support for their national team. [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], former president of the country traveled to [[Lithuania]], to support his team at the [[2011 EuroBasket]], as another 1,500 fans from Georgia did.

==Motorsport==
The first and only race circuit in the Caucasian region is located in Georgia. [[Rustavi International Motorpark]] originally built in 1978 was re-opened in 2012 after total reconstruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rustavi2.com/news/news_text.php?id_news=45318&amp;pg=1&amp;im=main&amp;ct=0&amp;wth=0 | title=Rustavi 2 Broadcasting Company |date=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; costing $20 million. The track satisfies the [[FIA]] Grade 2 requirements and currently hosts the [[Legends car racing]] series and [[Formula Alfa]] competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.1tv.ge/news-view/37425/en |title= Georgian National Broadcaster |date= 2012-04-30 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nodar Kumaritashvili]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ნოდარ ქუმარიტაშვილი; November 25, 1988 – February 12, 2010) suffered a fatal crash during a training run prior to the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] competition in Vancouver, Canada. He was the fourth athlete to die during Winter Olympics preparations in history, and the first in 18 years. The opening ceremonies of the Games, led by [[IOC]] President [[Jacques Rogge]], which took place later on the fateful day, were dedicated to the 21-year-old.

'''Sør Arena''' ("South Arena") is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] located at Torsvika in [[Kristiansand]], [[Norway]]. The [[all-seater stadium|all-seater]] has a capacity of 14,563 people, and serves as the home ground of [[Tippeligaen]] side [[IK Start]]. It was designed by [[Kjell Kosberg]], and is architecturally similar to [[Aker Stadion]]. The venue has seen concerts by [[Elton John]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[A-ha]], among others.. [[UEFA]] refers to the stadium as '''Kristiansand Arena'''.

Construction started in 2006, and the stadium opened on 15 April 2007, replacing [[Kristiansand Stadion]] as Start's home ground. The venue cost 400 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK), of which the stadium itself cost NOK&amp;nbsp;250 million, after significant [[cost overrun]]s. While originally planned with [[artificial turf]], the venue was ultimately built with a natural grass pitch. The venue and the holding company Start Stadion were taken over by Sparebanken Sør, the main [[creditor]], in 2008. They subsequently also took over Start Toppfotball, the company running the club. Both companies were sold to [[Ernst Ravnaas]] in 2009. Following decreased attendance, ahead of the 2011 season the seating on the corners was sold as advertisement space and the maximum capacity has artificially been reduced to 11,700.

==History==
[[File:Sor-arena-aerial-view-2006-10-19.jpg|left|thumb|Sør Arena during construction]]

Traditionally, Start has played their home games at Kristiansand Stadion, a municipal [[multi-purpose stadium]]. In May 2005, the municipal council approved the plans for a new stadium for Start. At the time, the structure was estimated to cost NOK&amp;nbsp;177 million, of which NOK&amp;nbsp;120 million would be for the stadium itself, while the remaining would be for commercial properties.&lt;ref name=kjempegjeld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/04/11/532222.html |title=Ny stadion har gitt Start kjempegjeld |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=11 April 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y2uhg49X?url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/04/11/532222.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=space&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/sport_nrk_sorlandet/1.3618042 |title=Sør Arena tre ganger dyrere |last=Pedersen |first=Kjell |last2=Rasch |first2=Lars Helge |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=30 September 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y2vpjTjW?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/sport_nrk_sorlandet/1.3618042 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club held an [[architecture competition]], and received six bids. On 28 September 2005, Start Toppfotball announced that they had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from Kosbergs Arkitektkontor, who had previously designed [[Aker Stadion]] and [[Briskeby Arena]]. The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he wanted to build a larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from [[Kristiansand Municipality]], a NOK&amp;nbsp;40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK&amp;nbsp;20 million grant from [[Cultiva]], a municipal culture fund, NOK&amp;nbsp;20 in [[value added tax]] refund, NOK&amp;nbsp;10 to 20 million in [[naming rights]], the sale of commercial property, NOK&amp;nbsp;30 to 40 million in a bank loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article310949.ece |title=Slik blir Starts stadion i Marvika |last=Enersen |first=Svein |last2=Sandvik |first2=Arild |last3=Svardal |first3=Asgeir |last4=Svela |first4=Elling |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=28 September 2005 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1JAm3q8?url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article310949.ece |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SoerArena.JPG|thumb|During construction]]
In October, the club stated that they hoped to finance a further expansion of the stadium to 14,000 seats by selling part of the lot to a private developer, which would use it to build a 17-story building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article315151.ece?redir=true |title=Stadion - slik Start ønsker |last=Sandvik |first=Arild |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=17 October 2005 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1S5gboA?url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article315151.ece?redir=true |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 December, Rasmussengruppen signed a contract where they bought shares worth NOK&amp;nbsp;45 million in Start Toppfotball. In addition, they paid NOK&amp;nbsp;15 million for the right to build {{convert|11000|m2|sp=us}} of commercial property in conjunction with the stadium, and an [[option contract|option]] to purchase the high-rise lot for NOK&amp;nbsp;25 million. The high-rise lot was again bought from the municipality for NOK&amp;nbsp;15 million. Combined with the free lot for the stadium, Start Toppfotball received municipal [[subsidies]] of NOK&amp;nbsp;25 million for constructing the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvn.no/nyheter/article448553.ece?redir=true |title=Budt 30 mill. - selger for 25 |last=Reinertsen |first=Rune Øidne |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=28 February 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1S5gboA?url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article315151.ece?redir=true |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy arose regarding whether to lay natural or artificial turf. [[Kristofer Hæstad]], one of Start's star players, stated that he would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/01/20/455318.html |title=Doffen vil stikke fra Start |last=Andresen |first=Gorm |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=20 January 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1S5gboA?url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article315151.ece?redir=true |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with [[artificial turf]]. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another artificial turf venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvn.no/nyheter/article448553.ece?redir=true |title=Budt 30 mill. - selger for 25 |last=Reinertsen |first=Rune Øidne |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=28 February 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1S5gboA?url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article315151.ece?redir=true |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK&amp;nbsp;35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ba.no/sport/fotball/brann/article2485181.ece?service=print |title=Vil ikke selge Brann-sjelen |last=Pamer |first=Anders |work=[[Bergensavisen]] |date=22 December 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1WkBYn5?url=http://www.ba.no/sport/fotball/brann/article2485181.ece?service=print |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/10/21/480462.html |title=Starts nye stadion skal hete Sør Arena |last=Strand |first=Sigbjørn |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=21 October 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1WvcSlh?url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/10/21/480462.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.&lt;ref name=bankrupt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/sport/fotball/article3627650.ece |title=Start Stadion AS begjærer oppbud |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |work=[[Nettavisen]] |date=23 May 2013 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 November 2013 |archivedate=17 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LCnIddSR?url=http://www.nettavisen.no/sport/fotball/article3627650.ece |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sør Arena 060720085937.jpg|thumb|left|The pitch]]
Construction of the stadium was subject to significant cost overruns. These were mostly caused by the increased size of both spectator and commercial area, increased standard to VIP facilities, a general increase in construction costs, and the deadline to finish the venue in time for the league to start. Total investments exceeded NOK&amp;nbsp;400 million, of which 250&amp;nbsp;million was paid for by Start. This resulted in the stadium company having a debt of NOK&amp;nbsp;173 million, in addition to NOK&amp;nbsp;60 million in share equity.&lt;ref name=kjempegjeld /&gt;&lt;ref name=space /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.3246327 |title=Må låne mer penger |last=Jakobsen |first=Marianne |last2=Nilsen |first2=Anne Torhild |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=20 August 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y2u3hKRd?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.3970684 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, Start sold {{convert|2500|m2|sp=us}} of commercial space at the stadium for NOK&amp;nbsp;25 million to finance part of the cost overrun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.3970684 |title=Selger deler av Sør Arena |last=Pedersen |first=Kjell |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=7 November 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y2u3hKRd?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.3970684 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the stadium took place on 15 April 2007, in the season's first league game, against [[Viking FK|Viking]]. The game attracted 14,448 spectators, a record attendance and the only time the venue has been sold out.&lt;ref name=svikter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.fvn.no/eliteserien/article83338.ece |title=Svikter Sør Arena |last=Brenne |first=Øyvind |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=13 June 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article464399.ece |title=Sør Arena er offisielt åpnet |last=Arnli |first=Ann Magritt |last2=Flaa |first2=Jørund |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=15 April 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1S5gboA?url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/article315151.ece?redir=true |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the opening, the pitch was the worst in the league, and by May the grass within the [[penalty area]]s and along the one side had been replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2007/05/10/500292.html |title=Været kan gjøre Start-matta enda dårligere |last=Haraldsen |first=Stian |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=10 May 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=17 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y1WvcSlh?url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/10/21/480462.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, the pitch quality had improved and was regarded as "world class" by the Start players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.fvn.no/eliteserien/article171307.ece |title=Mener Sør Arena holder verdensklasse |last=Jørgensen |first=Pål |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=6 June 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of preparing the pitch, including snow removal, ahead of the season is about NOK&amp;nbsp;500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.7033103 |title=Svindyrt gress |last=Raustøl |first=Håvard |last2=Nilsen |first2=Anne Torhild |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=11 March 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archivedate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y2LWOlqn?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.7033103 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of the 2008 season, the 1,400 [[club seating|club seats]] had to be replaced for a cost of NOK&amp;nbsp;1.5 million, because the wood in the chairs were rotting.

The stadium had a book value of NOK&amp;nbsp;230 million, way over the real value, causing Start Toppfotball to have to write down the investment.

Following a fall in game attendance in [[2009 Norwegian Premier League|2009]] and [[2010 Norwegian Premier League|2010]], Start decided ahead of the [[2011 Norwegian Premier League|2011 season]] to reduce the stadium's capacity. Advertisement banners were sold to cover the corners, thus reducing the capacity to 11,700 tickets. The club stated that the intention was to move spectators closer together to increase the atmosphere, and at the same time making it easier to sell out the stadium.&lt;ref name=reduserer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.fvn.no/eliteserien/article184136.ece |title=Start reduserer publikumskapasiteten |last=Karlsen |first=Håvard |work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]] |date=28 October 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, [[Kristiansand District Court]] sentenced Start to pay NOK&amp;nbsp;6.4 million in value added tax on the naming rights. The club stated that they believed the naming rights were exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.7997401 |title=Start må betale 6.4 millioner etter nederlag i retten |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Larsen |first=Lars Erik |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012 |archivedate=15 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65TSqsBzx?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/sorlandet/1.7997401 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2011 Norwegian Premier League|2011 season]], Start was again relegated to the First Division. In an attempt to better the club's financial situation, Start agreed to lay artificial turf on Sparebanken Sør Arena, in exchange for NOK&amp;nbsp;250,000 in municipal funding to use the stadium for recreational sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/02/13/sport/fotball/start/sor_arena/20220617/ |title=Sør Arena blir kunstgressbane |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archivedate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/681by9af4?url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/02/13/sport/fotball/start/sor_arena/20220617/ |language=Norwegian |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of the natural pitch started on 28 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fotball.aftenposten.no/forstediv/article238372.ece&lt;!--|title=Her fjernes Norges fineste gressmatte--&gt;|title=Sør Arena blir kunstgressbane |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=28 May 2012 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company lost the case both in [[Agder Court of Appeal]] and the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]], resulting in the company having to pay NOK&amp;nbsp;9 million in taxes. As the company did not have such values, it was forced to filed for bankruptcy on 23 May 2013.

'''Variable density goggles''' were used by U.S. [[aerial gunners and anti-aircraft gunners]]s in [[World War II]]. They were equipped with a turning dial on the front allowing the pilot to alter the [[tint]] of the lens enabling them to see [[tracer rounds]] and not be easily blinded. They failed to gain popularity in the military, however, and were phased out soon after the Second World War.  They were more accepted by AAA gunners than aircrew, as it was one more piece of equipment that the aircrews would have to carry onto an airplane.

'''Williams Arena''', located on the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] campus of the [[University of Minnesota]] is the home of the University of Minnesota [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Golden Gophers men's]] and women's basketball teams.  It also housed the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|men's hockey]] team until 1993, when it moved into its own building, [[Mariucci Arena]]. The building is known affectionately as "'''The Barn'''", and its student section is known as "The Barnyard".

Williams Arena is located on the southwest corner of the intersection of [[University Avenue (Minneapolis–Saint Paul)|University Avenue]] and 19th Ave. SE in [[Minneapolis]] on the U of M's East Bank campus.  It is in a neighborhood called  [[Stadium Village]], named for the old [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]] that stood there until its demolition in 1992. The arena is adjacent to [[TCF Bank Stadium]], [[Mariucci Arena]], and [[Ridder Arena]], where the football and hockey teams respectively play.

==History==
[[File:Williams arena ent.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The entrance]]
Initially known as the '''Minnesota Field House''' (another building has that name today), Williams Arena was constructed in the 1920s and opened in 1928. The original construction of Williams Arena cost $650,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Williams Arena Tickets|url=http://www.perfecttix.com/Page.aspx?PageID=2651|publisher=PerfectTix|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena was remodeled in 1950, and renamed Williams Arena after Dr. [[Henry L. Williams]], the football coach from 1900 to 1921.

As part of the 1950 renovation, it was divided into two separate arenas within one building—a larger one for basketball and a smaller one for hockey.  Both arenas were called Williams Arena until March 2, 1985, when the hockey section was renamed '''Mariucci Arena''' after longtime Gopher hockey coach [[John Mariucci]]. The hockey team moved into a new building across the street from Williams in 1993, also named [[Mariucci Arena]]. The old Mariucci Arena within Williams was remodeled into the '''Sports Pavilion''' and now houses the volleyball, wrestling, and gymnastic teams.

The venue hosted the [[1951 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] championship game and the [[1964 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] Mideast Regional. Williams Arena has hosted the 1st and 2nd rounds of the NCAA women's basketball tournament in 2005, 2007, and 2010. The hockey portion of Williams hosted the [[Frozen Four]] in 1958 and 1966. The [[Minnesota Lynx]] played all of their 2017 postseason home games at Williams Arena, ultimately winning the franchise's fourth [[WNBA]] championship in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lynx to play postseason home games at Williams Arena|author=Frederick, Jace|date=July 27, 2017|accessdate=August 27, 2017|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/07/27/lynx-to-play-postseason-home-games-at-williams-arena/|newspaper=Pioneer Press|publisher=Digital First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams Arena was used for the filming of scenes in [[Columbia Pictures]]' 1978 motion picture release, ''[[Ice Castles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ice Castles (1978) Filming Locations|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077716/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Aggreko williams arena.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Temporary air conditioning was required for the [[2017 WNBA Finals]] so the arena would meet WNBA temperature standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now cooled, Williams Arena ready to host Lynx’s playoff run|author=Frederick, Jace|date=September 12, 2017|accessdate=October 5, 2017|publisher=Pioneer Press|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/09/11/now-cooled-williams-arena-ready-to-host-lynxs-playoff-run/}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The building has an arched roof, in the same manner as an airplane [[hangar]]. The double arch steel beams allows an open space for the bleachers and floor. There are some seats with partially obscured views due to the upper deck extending past the trusses. Over the summer of 2012, a new Daktronics videoboard and fascia displays were installed as part of a sporting facility update, replacing the older board. The new board is 11'7"x13'8" with LED rings above and below the main display. The fascia extends 360° around the arena.

[[File: Williams Arena scoreboard.jpg|thumb|left|300px|New videoboard installed prior to the 2012-13 season]]

===Raised floor===
Williams Arena features an unusual raised floor design. The court surface is raised above the ground approximately two feet so that players' benches, officials tables, etc., are actually below the court. The same goes for fans with the first row looking at players at about knee-level. Normally, other than the officials and those players actively playing, only head coaches are allowed to be on the court itself. The raised floor is one of only a few remaining examples left and contributes significantly to the historic aura of the 80-year-old arena. This served as the inspiration for the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] to host stadiums for their Final Four as of [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]] to have the floor about three feet off the stadium floor as part of an increased capacity to a minimum of 70,000. The floor in Williams Arena recently underwent a replacement. PCL Construction began work on {{Date|2009-05-11|mdy}}, replacing the original playing surface from 1928 with a new floor along with new basketball goals. This was the first major upgrade to the facility since a renovation occurred in the early 1990s. [[Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University)|Memorial Gymnasium]] at [[Vanderbilt University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/Admissions/visitSelfGuided.php Vanderbilt University Admissions: Self-Guided Tours]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] at [[Butler University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=History's Home Court|first=Phil|last=Richards|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070308/SPORTS/703080413|newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2007|quote=What makes a basketball building a cathedral? The tradition? The ghosts of great players and great games past? The raised floor with its singular springiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two other existing arenas with a raised floor. [[Robertson Memorial Field House]] at [[Bradley University]], since demolished, also used a raised floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering Robertson: Origins of a Mecca|first=Ryan|last=Ori|url=http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?/fieldhouse/article/origins_of_a_mecca/|newspaper=[[Journal Star (Peoria)]]|date=March 25, 2008|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 until the opening of [[Marriott Center]] at [[Brigham Young University]] in 1971, it had the largest capacity of any collegiate basketball arena in the country. [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] at [[Butler University]] also was constructed in 1928, and held the honor of being the highest capacity arena until the remodeling of Williams Arena in 1950.

==Before Williams Arena==
When the Gophers basketball team first organized, they played games in the on-campus [[YMCA]]. In 1896, the team moved into the campus [[University of Minnesota Armory|Armory]], a large building with gymnasium space for the team to use, even if basketball was not its primary purpose.&lt;ref name="Hugunin"&gt;Hugunin, Marc and [[Stew Thornley]]. ''Minnesota Hoops: Basketball in the North Star State.'' St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}  The Gophers remained in the Armory for almost thirty years.  Halfway through the 1924–25 season, coach [[Harold Taylor (basketball coach)|Harold Taylor]] moved the team from the University Armory to the [[Kenwood Armory]] in [[downtown Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="Hugunin"/&gt;{{rp|50}} This significantly increased the attendance: capacity at the University Armory was 2,000, but it was 6,500 at Kenwood.  The team only played at Kenwood for a few seasons, however, as the University of Minnesota Field House (later known as Williams Arena) opened partway through the 1927–1928 season. The team moved in on January 31, 1928.&lt;ref name="Hugunin"/&gt;{{rp|50}}
