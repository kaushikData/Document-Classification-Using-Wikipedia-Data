      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12471">'''Accelerants''' are substances that can bond, mix or disturb another substance and cause an increase in the speed of a natural, or artificial chemical process. Accelerants play a major role in chemistry—most chemical reactions can be hastened with an accelerant. Accelerants alter a chemical bond, speed up a chemical process, or bring organisms back to [[homeostasis]]. Accelerants are not necessarily [[catalyst]]s as they may be consumed by the process.

==Fire==
{{Main|Fire accelerant}}
In [[fire protection]], the term '''accelerant''' is used very broadly to include any substance or mixture that "accelerates" the development of [[fire]] to commit [[arson]].  Chemists would distinguish an accelerant from a fuel; the terms are not, in the truest sense of chemical science, interchangeable. Some fire investigators use the term "accelerant" to mean any substance that initiates and promotes a fire without differentiating between an accelerant and a fuel.  To a chemical engineer, "gasoline" is not at all considered an "accelerant;" it is more accurately considered a "fuel."

A fire is a self-sustaining, [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] oxidation reaction that emits heat and light. When a fire is accelerated with a true accelerant like oxygen bearing liquids and gases (like [[nitrogen dioxide|{{chem|NO|2}}]]) it can produce more heat, consume the actual fuels more quickly, and increase the spread of the fire.  Fires involving liquid accelerants, like gasoline, burn more quickly, but at the same temperature as fires involving ordinary fuels.

===Fire investigation===
Indicators of an incendiary fire or arson can lead fire investigators to look for the presence of fuel traces in fire debris. Burning compounds and liquids can leave behind evidence of their presence and use. Fuels present in areas they aren't typically found in can indicate an incendiary fire or arson. Investigators often use special [[police dog|dogs]] known as "accelerant detection canines" trained to smell ignitable liquids. Well-trained dogs can pinpoint areas for the investigator to collect samples. Fire debris submitted to [[forensic]] [[laboratories]] employ sensitive analytical instruments with [[Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] capabilities for [[forensic chemistry|forensic chemical analysis]].

===Types===
Many so-called accelerants are [[hydrocarbon]]-based [[fuel]]s, sometimes more realistically referred to as [[petroleum]] [[Distillation|distillates]]: [[gasoline]], [[diesel fuel]], [[kerosene]], [[turpentine]], [[butane]], and various other [[flammable]] [[solvent]]s. These accelerants are also known as ignitable liquids. Ignitable liquids can leave behind irregular patterns on the surface of a floor.  These irregular burn patterns can indicate the presence of an ignitable liquid in a fire and can indicate the point of origin of the fire. Note, however, that irregular patterns may be found in fires involving no accelerant.  This is particularly true in cases of full room involvement.

The properties of some ignitable liquids make them dangerous fuels. Many ignitable liquids have high [[vapor pressure]]s, low [[flash point]]s and a relatively wide range between their upper and lower [[explosive limit]]. This allows ignitable liquids to [[Making fire|ignite]] easily, and when mixed in a proper [[air-fuel ratio]], readily explode. Many arsonists who use generous amounts of gasoline have been seriously burned or killed igniting their fire.

===Available combustibles===
Common household items and objects can accelerate a fire. Wicker and foam have high surface to mass ratios and favorable chemical compositions and thus burn easily and readily. Arsonists sometimes use large amounts of available [[combustible]] material rather than ignitable liquids in attempts to try to avoid detection. Using large fuel loads can increase the rate of fire growth as well as spread the fire over a larger area, thus increasing the amount of fire damage. Inappropriate amounts and types of fuel in a particular area can indicate [[arson]]. Whether available combustible materials constitute an accelerant depends on the intent of the person responsible for their use.

==Rubber vulcanization==
{{see also|Sulfur_vulcanization#Accelerators}}
The use of accelerators and activators lowers the activation energy of [[vulcanization]] reaction to 80-125kJ/mole from 210kJ/mole which is necessary if we use sulfur alone. Accelerators and activators break sulfur chains.  Accelerated sulfur vulcanization systems require only 5-15 sulfur atoms per cross-link as compared to 40-45 S atoms/crosslink for a non-accelerated sulfur vulcanization.
There are many accelerators available for the [[vulcanization]] of rubber. That is because there is a wide range of rubber articles on the market with a wide variety of properties. For instance in a car tire alone there can be already up to eight different rubber compounds, each with specific properties. For instance the tread in a typical passenger car tire consists of a mixture of SBR ([[styrene-butadiene]] rubber) and BR ([[Polybutadiene|butadiene rubber]]). This rubber should have high abrasion resistance and high grip on both dry and wet roads. The side wall of the tire should have a high flexibility, meaning that it should resist many flexings during the running of the tire without cracking. It consists normally of a mixture of natural rubber and [[butadiene]] rubber. Inside the tire there is a rubber compound with as major function the adhesion between rubber and the steel cord of the belt. It typically consists of natural rubber with a very high [[sulfur]] level (up to 8 phr), to get a relatively stiff rubber, with sulfur promoting the adhesion with the steel cord. The basis of the tire is formed by the carcass, normally a mixture of NR ([[natural rubber]]), SBR and BR. It should have a very good [[adhesion]] to the polyester cord, used as reinforcement.
And the inner side of the tire is formed by the inner liner, normally consisting of [[halogenated]] [[butyl rubber]] (IIR)
For all these compounds with their different properties different accelerators and mixtures of accelerators have to be used to obtain the required properties.
A vulcanization accelerator is typically used in combination with sulfur as the [[cross-linker]], and with [[zinc oxide]] and [[stearic acid]] as activators. Other additives can be added too, but for the cross-linking reaction, those mentioned above are the most important.
The various types of rubber used in the various tire compounds all have different [[vulcanization]] characteristics, like speed of cure (cure is the crosslinking reaction) and extent of cure (the number of cross-links). A typical passenger car tire is vulcanized for 10 minutes at 170 degrees C. Many accelerators and various mixtures thereof are typically used to ensure the vulcanization of all the component compounds have completed during the 10 minute process.

===Classification===
There are two major classes of vulcanization accelerators, primary accelerators and secondary accelerators or ultra accelerators.

====Primary====

Of the primary accelerators the major group used in tire manufacture is formed by [[sulfenamide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1070/RC1996v065n05ABEH000218 | title = Synthesis and application of sulfenamides | year = 1996 | last1 = Koval' | first1 = I V | journal = Russian Chemical Reviews | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 421|bibcode = 1996RuCRv..65..421K }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are produced by an [[oxidative]] coupling reaction of mercapto-benzthiazole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/dt/dt2213.html|title=Conservation OnLine - CoOL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (otherwise called mercaptobenzothiazole) (MBT) with a primary [[amine]] like [[cyclohexylamine]] or [[tert-Butylamine]].
Secondary amines like [[dicyclohexylamine]] can be used also but result in much slower accelerators. Such a slow accelerator is required in the steel cord adhesion compound mentioned above, because for optimal adhesion a slow cure is required.
Another important group of primary accelerators is formed by the [[thiazoles]]. The two main products are mercaptobenzthiazole (MBT) and mercaptobenzthiazole disulfide (MBTS), a product formed by oxidative coupling of two MBT molecules. The thiazoles are used for the vulcanization of thick articles, and as basic accelerator in [[EPDM]] compounds ([[EPDM rubber|ethylene-propylene-diene rubbers]]), in combination with mixtures of ultra-accelerators.

In the vulcanization of [[neoprene]] or [[polychloroprene]] rubber (CR rubber) the choice of accelerator is governed by different rules to other diene rubbers. Most conventionally used accelerators are problematic when CR rubbers are cured and the most important accelerator has been found to be [[ethylene thiourea]] (ETU) which, although being an excellent and proven accelerator for polychloroprene, has been classified as [[reprotoxic]]. The European rubber industry has started a research project SafeRubber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saferubber.eu|title=SafeRubber, an alternative for accelerators in the production of rubber — saferubber|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to develop a safer alternative to the use of ETU.

====Secondary====

Of the secondary or ultra-accelerators the main categories are the [[Thiuram disulfide|thiurams]] and the [[dithiocarbamate]]s. In vulcanization of tire compounds they are used as small addition to sulfenamides to boost the speed and state of cure.&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;{{Ullmann|first=Hans-Wilhelm |last=Engels |displayauthors=etal |title=Rubber, 4. Chemicals and Additives|doi=10.1002/14356007.a23_365.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They have a very fast vulcanization speed and therefore, next to boosters in tire compounds they are used as main accelerator in EPDM compounds and in latex compounds. EPDM compounds have much less cure sites than natural rubber or SBR, and therefore need a rapid vulcanization system to have sufficient cure speed. Latex is cured at relatively low temperature (100- 120&amp;nbsp;°C)and therefore need an inherently rapid accelerator.
The major thiurams used are TMTD ([[tetramethylthiuram disulfide]]) and TETD([[Disulfiram|tetraethylthiuram disulfide]]), They are produced by the reaction between [[dimethylamine]] or [[diethylamine]] and [[carbon disulfide]]. The major dithiocarbamates are the zinc salts ZDEC (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate) and ZDBC (zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate).

==Cement and concrete accelerants==
{{main|Cement accelerator}}

[[Cement accelerator]]s are available as [[Admixture (concrete)|admixture]]s for the use in [[concrete]], [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], rendering and screeds.  The addition of an accelerator speeds the setting time and thus [[Curing (chemistry)|cure time]] starts earlier.&lt;ref name=JUSTNES &gt;Justnes, H. (2000): Accelerator Blends for Portland Cement. Proceedings of Cement and Concrete Technology in the 2000s, September 6–10, 2000, Istanbul, Turkey, Vol. 1, pp. 433-442&lt;/ref&gt; This allows concrete to be placed in winter with reduced risk of frost damage.&lt;ref name=ACI&gt;ACI 306R-88: Cold Weather Concreting. {{cite web|url=http://www.ccagc.org/pdfs/ACI_306R-88_Cold_Weather_Concreting.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725150450/http://www.ccagc.org/pdfs/ACI_306R-88_Cold_Weather_Concreting.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete is damaged if it does not reach a strength of {{convert|500|psi|MPa}} before freezing.&lt;ref name=KORHONEN&gt;{{Citation |last=Korhonen |first=Charles J. |last2=Cortez |first2=Edel R. |last3=Durning |first3=Timothy A. |institution=[[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] |year=1997 |title=Antifreeze Admixtures for Concrete |work=Special Report 97-26 |isbn=9781428913158}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}  Typical chemicals used for acceleration today are [[calcium nitrate]] (Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[calcium formate]] (Ca(HCOO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium nitrate]] (NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[File:Beech-whc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Location of massifs]]
'''Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe''' is a transnational composite nature [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]], encompassing forests in 12 European countries.

The Primeval Beech Forests of the [[Carpathians]] include ten separate massifs located along the {{convert|185|km|mi|abbr=on}} long axis from the [[Rakhiv]] mountains and [[Chornohora]] ridge in [[Ukraine]] over the Poloniny Ridge (Slovakia) to the [[Vihorlat Mountains]] in [[Slovakia]]. The Ancient Beech Forests of Germany include five locations, cover 4,391 hectares and were added in 2011.

The Carpathian site covers a total area of {{convert|77971.6|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, out of which only {{convert|29278.9|ha|acre|abbr=on}} are part of the actual preserved area, while the rest is considered a "buffer zone". Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians cover areas of [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]] and [[Prešov Region]]s. Over 70% of the site is located in [[Ukraine]]. The area includes two [[national park]]s, and some habitat controlled areas, mostly in Slovakia. Both national parks, along with a neighboring area in Poland, compose a separate [[biosphere reserve]], the [[East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve]]. Besides Havešová, Rožok, and [[Stužica]] (all of them located in Bukovské vrchy), there is a fourth component situated in Slovakia, named Kyjovský prales of Vihorlat. Ukrainian locations include [[Chornohora]], Kuziy-Trybushany, Maramarosh, Stuzhytsia–Uzhok, Svydovets, and Uholka–Shyrikyi Luh. Only a few of the ten components are accessible to visitors. Stužica is the only one of three locations in Bukovské vrchy (Slovakia) with available hiking trails. In 2017, UNESCO extended the site, adding forests in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1133|title=Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite | title = Unesco approves the extension of the Carpathian Primary Beech forests | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last intact virgin forest in the temperate latitudes of Europe is to be found in the Carpathians. Trees can live to a hundred years old in these forests, providing an important habitat for organisms such as mushrooms, moss, lichen, insects, rare birds (e.g. [[capercaillie]] and [[black grouse]]) and [[mammals]] (e.g. bats, brown bear, wolf and lynx). Large parts of the forest in the Romanian part of the Carpathians have been lost due to deforestation. The pressure on timber as a resource may increase due to international demand and European companies may start large-scale felling in neighbouring Ukraine. Currently unprotected areas of virgin forest can be permanently preserved in the Ukrainian Carpathians by expanding and reinforcing conservation areas. In the Ukrainian Carpathians there are nine national parks and two biosphere reserves. There is a general ban on tree felling in coniferous forest areas above 1,100 metres. If park administrations are shown to work, management of larger, previously unprotected areas of virgin forest to preserve them on a permanent basis, may occur. There are roughly 100,000 additional hectares of forest which could be integrated into the existing conservation areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fzs.org/en/projects/ukraine/|title=Protecting virgin forest in the Ukrainian Carpathians|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=6}}

'''Atra-Hasis''' ("exceedingly wise") is the protagonist of an 18th-century BC&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bottéro, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qm-Zx9_h_UC Ancestor of the West: Writing, Reasoning, and Religion in Mesopotamia, Elam, and Greece]'', p. 40. University of Chicago Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0226067155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] recorded in various versions on [[clay tablet]]s. The ''Atra-Hasis'' tablets include both a [[creation myth]] and a [[Flood myth|flood account]], which is one of three surviving [[Babylonia]]n deluge stories. The name "Atra-Hasis" also appears on one of the [[Sumerian king list]]s as king of [[Shuruppak]] in the times before a flood.

The oldest known copy of the epic tradition concerning Atrahasis&lt;ref&gt;The variant versions are not direct translations of a single original.&lt;/ref&gt; can be dated by [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] (scribal identification) to the reign of [[Hammurabi]]’s great-grandson, [[Ammi-Saduqa]] (1646–1626 BC), but various [[Akkadian language|Old Babylonian]] fragments exist; it continued to be copied into the first millennium BC. The Atrahasis story also exists in a later fragmentary Assyrian version, having been first rediscovered in the [[library of Ashurbanipal]], but, because of the fragmentary condition of the tablets and ambiguous words, translations had been uncertain. Its fragments were assembled and translated first by [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''The Chaldean Account of Genesis''; the name of its hero was corrected to ''Atra-Hasis'' by [[Heinrich Zimmern]] in 1899.

In 1965 [[Wilfred G. Lambert]] and [[Alan Millard|A. R. Millard]]&lt;ref&gt;Lambert and Millard, ''Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, London'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; published many additional texts belonging to the epic, including an Old Babylonian copy (written around 1650 BC) which is our most complete surviving recension of the tale. These new texts greatly increased knowledge of the epic and were the basis for Lambert and Millard’s first English translation of the Atrahasis epic in something approaching entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert and Millard, ''Atrahasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood'', Oxford, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; A further fragment has been recovered in [[Ugarit]]. [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age'' (Harvard) 1992, pp 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; traces the model drawn from Atrahasis to a corresponding passage, the division by lots of the air, underworld and sea among Zeus, Hades and Poseidon in the ''[[Iliad]]'', in which “a resetting through which the foreign framework still shows”.

In its most complete surviving version, the Atrahasis epic is written on three tablets in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the language of ancient Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert and Millard, pages 8–15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
[[Image:bm-epic-g.jpg|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] tablet with the ''Atra-Hasis'' epic in the [[British Museum]]]]

Tablet I contains a creation myth about the Sumerian gods [[Anu]], [[Enlil]], and [[Enki]],  gods of sky, wind, and water, “when gods were in the ways of men” according to its ''[[incipit]]''. Following the [[Cleromancy]] (casting of lots), sky is ruled by Anu, earth by Enlil, and the freshwater sea by Enki. Enlil assigned junior divines&lt;ref&gt;The Akkadian determinative ''[[dingir]]'', which is usually translated as “god” or “goddess” can also mean “priest” or “priestess” (Margaret Whitney Green, ''Eridu in Sumerian Literature'', PhD dissertation, University of Chicago [1975], p. 224) although there are other Akkadian words (e.g. ''ēnu'' and ''ēntu'') that are also translated priest and priestess. The noun “divine” would preserve the ambiguity in ''dingir''.&lt;/ref&gt; to do farm labor and maintain the rivers and canals, but after forty years the lesser gods or dingirs rebelled and refused to do strenuous labor. Instead of punishing the rebels, Enki, who is also the kind, wise counselor of the gods, suggested that humans be created to do the work. The mother goddess [[Mami (goddess)|Mami]] is assigned the task of creating humans by shaping clay figurines mixed with the flesh and blood of the slain god [[Geshtu-E]], “a god who had intelligence” (his name means “ear” or “wisdom”).&lt;ref&gt;On some tablets the under-god [[Weila]] or [[Aw-ilu]], was slain for this purpose.&lt;/ref&gt; All the gods in turn spit upon the clay. After 10 months, a specially-made womb breaks open and humans are born. Tablet I continues with legends about overpopulation and plagues. Atrahasis is mentioned at the end of Tablet I.

Tablet II begins with more overpopulation of humans and the god Enlil sending first famine and drought at formulaic intervals of 1200 years to reduce the population. In this epic Enlil is depicted as a cruel, capricious god while Enki is depicted as a kind, helpful god, perhaps because priests of Enki were writing and copying the story. Tablet II is mostly damaged, but ends with Enlil's decision to destroy humankind with a flood and Enki bound by an oath to keep the plan secret.

Tablet III of the Atrahasis Epic contains the [[flood story]]. This is the part that was adapted in tablet XI of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. Tablet III of Atrahasis tells how the god Enki warns the hero Atrahasis (“Extremely Wise”) of [[Shuruppak]], speaking through a reed wall (suggestive of an oracle) to dismantle his house (perhaps to provide a construction site) and build a boat to escape the flood planned by the god Enlil to destroy humankind. The boat is to have a roof “like Apsu” (a subterranean, fresh water realm presided over by the god Enki), upper and lower decks, and to be sealed with bitumen. Atrahasis boards the boat with his family and animals and seals the door. The storm and flood begin. Even the gods are afraid. In tablet III iv, lines 7-9 the words "river" and "riverbank" are used, which probably mean the Euphrates River, because Atrahasis is listed in WB-62 as a ruler of Shuruppak which was on the Euphrates River.

After seven days the flood ends and Atrahasis offers sacrifices to the gods. Enlil is furious with Enki for violating his oath. But Enki denies violating his oath and argues: “I made sure life was preserved.” Enki and Enlil agree on other means for controlling the human population.

==Atrahasis in History==
A few general histories can be attributed to the Mesopotamian Atrahasis by ancient sources; these should generally be considered mythology but they do give an insight into the possible origins of the character. [[Epic of Gilgamesh|The Epic of Gilgamesh]] labels Atrahasis as the son of [[Ubara-Tutu]], king of [[Shuruppak]], on tablet XI, ‘Gilgamesh spoke to Utnapishtim (Atrahasis), the Faraway… O man of Shuruppak, son of Ubara-Tutu’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instructions of Shuruppak|The Instructions of Shuruppak]] instead label Atrahasis (under the name [[Ziusudra]]) as the son of the eponymous Shuruppak, who himself is labelled as the son of Ubara-Tutu.&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.6.1#&lt;/ref&gt; At this point we are left with two possible fathers: Ubara-Tutu or Shuruppak. Many available tablets comprising [[Sumerian King List|The Sumerian King Lists]] support The Epic of Gilgamesh by omitting Shuruppak as a ruler of Shuruppak. These lists imply an immediate flood after or during the rule of Ubara-Tutu. These lists also make no mention of Atrahasis under any name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162233/http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However WB-62 lists a different and rather interesting chronology&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;here Atrahasis is listed as a ruler of Shuruppak and gudug priest, preceded by his father Shuruppak who is in turn preceded by his father Ubara-Tutu. WB-62 would therefore lend support to The Instructions of Shuruppak and is peculiar in that it mentions both Shuruppak and Atrahasis. In any event it seems that Atrahasis was of royal blood; whether he himself ruled and in what way this would affect the chronology is debatable.

==Literary inheritance==
The Epic of Atrahasis provides additional information on the flood and flood hero that is omitted in Gilgamesh XI and other versions of the Ancient Near East flood story. According to Atrahasis III ii.40–47 the flood hero was at a banquet when the storm and flood began: “He invited his people…to a banquet… He sent his family on board. They ate and they drank. But he (Atrahasis) was in and out. He could not sit, could not crouch, for his heart was broken and he was vomiting gall.”

The flood story in the standard edition of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], [[Gilgamesh flood myth|Chapter XI]] may have been paraphrased or copied verbatim from a non-extant, intermediate version of the Epic of Atrahasis.&lt;ref&gt;Tigay, pages 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; But editorial changes were made, some of which had long-term consequences. The sentence quoted above from Atrahasis III iv, lines 6–7: “Like dragonflies they have filled the river.” was changed in Gilgamesh XI line 123 to: “Like the spawn of fishes, they fill the sea.” However, see comments above.

Other editorial changes were made to the Atrahasis text. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, anthropomorphic descriptions of the gods are weakened. For example, Atrahasis OB III, 30–31 “The [[Anunnaki]] (the senior gods) [were sitt]ing in thirst and hunger.” was changed in Gilgamesh XI, 113 to “The gods feared the deluge.” Sentences in Atrahasis III iv were omitted in Gilgamesh, e.g. “She was surfeited with grief and thirsted for beer” and “From hunger they were suffering cramp.”&lt;ref&gt;Of these and other editorial changes to the Atrahasis text in Gilgamesh, Dr. Tigay comments, “The dropping of individual lines between others which are preserved, but are not synonymous with them, appears to be a more deliberate editorial act. These lines share a common theme, the hunger and thirst of the gods during the flood.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Birds of Western Australia''''' is a book first published in 1948 by Patersons Press Ltd in [[Perth, Western Australia]].  Its full title originally was '''''A Handbook of the Birds of Western Australia (with the exception of the Kimberley Division)''''', though with the publication of the 5th edition only the shorter form was used.  It was authored by [[Dominic Serventy]] and [[Hubert Whittell]].  It was issued in [[octavo]] format (228 x 148&amp;nbsp;mm) and contains 372 pages bound in blue [[buckram]] with a dustjacket illustrated with a painting of [[Australian pelican]]s by [[Harley Webster (illustrator)|Harley Webster]].  It contains a coloured frontispiece of paintings of the heads of ''[[Meliphaga]]'' [[honeyeater]]s, with numerous [[black-and-white]] drawings and maps scattered through the text. The second edition (1951) contained colour plates by  [[Olive Seymour]].

The book covered birds recorded within the Australian state of [[Western Australia]] except, as the full title of the first edition indicates, the tropical [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of its north.  It was the first Australian regional ornithological [[handbook]].  In the Introduction the authors state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;”The need for some such Handbook as this one was impressed on the authors by their own early experiences in Western Australian ornithology.  Perhaps, however, they flatter themselves unduly for presenting to the bird-loving public a book which they like to feel is one of the type they wished had been available to them when beginning the study of local birds.”&lt;ref&gt;Serventy &amp; Whittell (1948), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
With regard to the layout of the book, they say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;”The first two sections deal with the history of Western Australian ornithology and a discussion of the bird geography of the State.  Though complete in themselves both are supplementary to the third section, the detailed treatment of the species of birds occurring in our area.”&lt;ref&gt;Serventy &amp; Whittell (1948), pp.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The success of the book was such that, for many years, it was the principal source of information on the birds of the state.  Further editions appeared in 1951, 1962, 1967 and 1976, the fifth and final one being published by the [[UWA Publishing|University of Western Australia Press]], with the length having increased by then to some 490 pages.  It was described later in the preface to the state’s next ornithological handbook as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;”…a landmark in Australian ornithology.  Its high standard and concise presentation provided a stimulus for a great deal of ornithological research in this State.”&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone &amp; Storr (1998), p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Borda''' is a [[legendary creature]] that belongs to the culture of the [[Emilia-Romagna]] and other areas of the [[Po Valley]] in [[Italy]].

It is a sort of witch that appears, blindfolded and horrible, both at night and on foggy days and kills anyone who has the misfortune to meet her. It is a [[personification]] of the fear related to [[swamps]] and [[marshlands]], and to ponds and canals, invoked by adults to scare children and keep them away from such potentially dangerous places.

==Name==
The Borda, known by this name especially in [[Modena|Modenese]], is also known as 'Bourda' in [[Bologna|Bolognese]], 'Bùrda'in [[Ferrara|Ferrarese]], 'Bûrda' or 'Burdâna' in [[Reggio Emilia|Emelian]]. The masculine form takes the name of 'Bordón' in [[Parma]], 'Bordö' or 'Bordoeu' in [[Milan]] (meaning [[Ogre]]), 'Bordò' in [[Bormio|Bormiese]] (with a generally derogatory connotation). In Milanese, as well as in the dialects [[cremasco]] and bormiese, the word 'borda' means fog. In [[Bergamo|bergamese]] the name has the meaning fog as well as that of paper mask &lt;ref&gt; From the essay "La Borda" by Anselmo Calvetti published in the magazine La Ludla (number 1, Year XIV {{broken link | 1 = [http://www.racine.ra.it/argaza/bollettini/01.Gen-Feb.10.pdf] | date = February 2018 | bot = InternetArchiveBot}}, pag.12), Magazine of the Association "Instituto Friedrich Schürr" for the enhancement of the dialectal heritage of Romagna, published by the Publishing Company Il Ponte Vecchio in January 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Some scholars of local folklore &lt;ref&gt; Calvetti, '' Ancient myths of Romagna '' &lt;/ref&gt; trace the etymology of the term Borda to the root "''bor-''" which can be traced back to [[Dian Cecht|Borvo]], of [[celtic mythology]], who presided over thermal and spring waters, and would be found, in a vast area united by an ancient celtic presence, in toponyms and terms related to the water element. Examples being: [[Bormida (river)|the river Bormida]], spa resorts such as Bormio, [[Bourbon-Lancy]], [[Bourbon-l'Archambault]], words in [[French language|French]] such as ''brouillard'' and ''brume'' (meaning fog) or ''bourbe'' (slime).

Some [[Lullaby|lullabies]] in Romagnole are dedicated to the Borda, which kills children who are not good and do not want to sleep by strangling them with a lasso or a rope. Some scholars point out that this peculiar way of killing can be traced back to the human sacrifices practiced in ancient Germanic cults and would be known by the discovery, in some Danish and British [[peat bogs]], of bodies of people suffocated with a rope tied around their neck and then drowned, such as the [[Tollund Man]] &lt;ref&gt; Green, '' Dictionary of Celtic mythology '', p.272 &lt;/ref&gt;.

The legend of Borda is central to the novel ''Mal'aria'' by Eraldo Baldini, from which the ''[[Mal'aria]] ([[:it:Mal'aria|it]])'' [[TV miniseries]] was created.

'''Earth Prime''' (or '''Earth-Prime''') is a term sometimes used in works of [[speculative fiction]], most notably in [[DC Comics]], involving [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] or a [[multiverse]], and refers either to the universe containing "our" Earth, or to a parallel world with a bare minimum of [[divergence point]]s from Earth as we know it — often the absence or near-absence of [[metahumans]], or with their existence confined to fictional narratives like [[comics]]. The "Earth Prime" of a given fictional setting may or may not have an intrinsic value to or vital connection to the other Earths it exists alongside (although it appears to be the case that such Prime Earths — and sometimes the 'central universes' in which those Prime Earths exist as well — are portrayed in fiction to be vital to the existence of the other Earths).

In the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]], Earth-Prime is the true Earth from which all the other worlds within the multiverse originate, the actual reality where the readers live, DC Comics operates as a publisher, and all superheroes are fictional. However, Earth Prime became an alternate reality in its first appearance in ''The Flash'' #179 (May, 1968), when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] accidentally travels there from Earth-One by being pushed by a creature called ''The Nok''. The Flash, stranded, contacts DC Comics editor [[Julius Schwartz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 130 |quote = Trapped on 'Earth-Prime', the Flash knew only one man could possibly help him: DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who helps him construct a [[cosmic treadmill]] to return to Earth-One. Eventually it was stated that the writers of DC Comics of Earth Prime subconsciously base their stories on the adventures of the heroes on Earth-One and Earth-Two.

In ''The Flash'' #228 (July/Aug 1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]]| penciller= [[Irv Novick|Novick, Irv]]| inker= [[Tex Blaisdell|Blaisdell, Tex]]| story= The Day I Saved the Life of the Flash| title= The Flash| volume= 1| issue= 228| date= July–August 1974| publisher= DC Comics| page= | panel= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth Prime's [[Cary Bates]] travels to Earth-One, where he discovers that the stories he writes are not only based on events on Earth-One, but can actually influence these events as well.

The interdimensional trip temporarily turns Bates into a supervillain, and he quickly kills the [[Justice Society of America]]. Luckily fellow DC writer [[Elliot S. Maggin]], with the help of the Justice League and the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], is able to restore matters on both Earths in ''Justice League of America'' #124 (November 1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Bates, Cary; Maggin, Elliot S.| penciller= Dillin, Dick| inker= McLaughlin, Frank| story= Avenging Ghosts of the Justice Society!| title= Justice League of America| volume= | issue= 124| date= November 1975| publisher= DC Comics| page= | panel= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultraa===
{{main|Ultraa}}

The first superhero is Ultraa, introduced in ''Justice League of America'' #153. Like Superman, Ultraa was the sole survivor of a destroyed alien world, rocketed to Earth-Prime as a baby. After his first encounter with the Justice League, Ultraa decided Earth-Prime was not ready for superheroes and relocated to Earth-One. Post-Crisis, when there was no longer an Earth-Prime or greater multiverse, Ultraa was retconned into being from the planet Almerac, homeworld of [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]].

===Superboy-Prime===
{{main|Superboy-Prime}}
The second superhero (later villain) is Superboy-Prime, the true Superman from which all the other Supermen originate. He first appeared in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #87 (Nov. 1985). This Superboy's powers first manifested around the time of the passage of Halley's Comet in 1985. Just after manifesting his powers, Superboy-Prime met Earth-One's Superman. Very soon thereafter Earth-Prime was destroyed in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] #10. Superboy-Prime escaped his universe's destruction, and later joined Earth-Two's Superman, Earth-Two's Lois Lane-Kent, and Earth-Three's Alexander Luthor in a "paradise dimension".

Superboy Prime possesses powers far exceeding those of the modern "New-Earth" Superman (Kal-El).

In issue #6 of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series, a now anti-heroic Superboy-Prime convinced [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] that Earth-Prime was the ideal world and urged him to draw his inspiration for making a new Earth from Earth-Prime. Luthor began searching through the myriad Earths for Earth-Prime and, in a metatextual nod to Earth Prime's original status as the keystone Earth, looks directly at the readers and reaches out towards them to grab our reality.

In [[2004 in comics|2004]], DC revisited the Earth-Prime concept in the [[miniseries]] ''[[Superman: Secret Identity]]''. Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] states in the introduction to the collected volume of the series that the original appearance of Superboy-Prime was the inspiration for his graphic novel.

===Legion of Super-Heroes===
{{main|Legion of Super-Heroes (2004 team)}}
In 2008 the Final Crisis tie in series ''[[Legion of Three Worlds]]'', makes various references to Earth-Prime, while Superboy-Prime is still looking to make his "Perfect Earth". He starts by rebuilding the [[Legion of Super-Villains]] to fight Superman and the three versions of the Legion of Super-Heroes. During the battle, the 2004 team's [[Element Lad]] created [[Kryptonite]] that unexpectedly affected Superboy-Prime. The Kryptonite of New Earth had no effect on [[Superman (Kal-L)]] and Prime during ''Infinite Crisis.''

At the end of the mini series, it's revealed that [[52 (comics)|Earth-Prime has been reborn]] and Superboy-Prime was returned there. It was also revealed that the Threeboot Legion are from Earth-Prime's future. The current status of Superboy-Prime after the events of [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] remains unclear, but he has not reappeared since 2011. The character may have been obliterated by the continuity change and shifts within the multiverse that occurred after that core DC event.

===The Multiversity: ''Ultra Comics'' and Earth-33===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Earth-33 is introduced in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[The Multiversity]]'' series, as the additional designation for Earth-Prime. This Earth continues the tradition of having minimal superhero activity &amp;ndash; in this case, the minds of Earth-33's comic book readers have empowered a superhero named [[Ultraa|Ultra Comics]]. Ultra is the only metahuman on that world, fighting the encroachment of the "Gentry" (the series' lead villains) by confining their presence on 'our' world to the pages of an 'entrapment' comic book built around the title character.

==Marvel Comics==
In the fictional Marvel Universe, the 'Earth Prime' of that setting is designated by extradimensional cartographers as Earth-1218,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where real-life readers buy Marvel Comics. On some occasions, various characters of the Marvel Universe, looking for their version of God, encounter 'real world' figures such as [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]]. Yet other characters (such as [[She-Hulk]] and [[Deadpool]]) are capable of breaking the [[fourth wall]], addressing the readers directly. Still others, such as the Earth's [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], [[Uatu]], is possessed of the ability to see ''all'' alternate Earths in the Marvel Universe setting at will, including the real one in which he and all other beings are nothing more than fictional characters (in some early issues of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'', the Watcher actually addressed the reader by showing him which issues of which ''comics'' the past exploits of a given character could be found in). Having a similar name, "Prime Earth" is the new designation of "Earth-616".&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Sliders''==
{{Main|Earth Prime (Sliders)}}
Earth Prime, as used in the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', is the name of the alternate Earth where the four original sliders (Quinn Mallory, Wade Welles, Rembrandt Brown, and Maximillian Arturo) started their journey. This Earth was the same as ours until 1997 or 1998, when the Kromaggs slid onto Earth Prime and conquered it.

==''The Dark Tower''==
Much of the action in the last few books of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series takes place in "the keystone world", essentially the Earth Prime concept under a different name, complete with appearances by King himself as a character.

==''The Chronicles of Amber''==
Though not using the term "Earth Prime", [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'' [[fantasy series]] features a similar concept. In the Amber stories, Amber is the only true world; all others, including our [[Earth]], are but "shadows" of the tension between it and Chaos.

== Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ==
{{Main|Turtles Forever}}

In the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] [[made-for-TV film]], ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', [[Ch'rell]] (or [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 series]]'s version of [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder]]), took the [[technodrome]] from his [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 series]] counterpart and [[Krang]] and upgraded it with [[Utrom]] technology. He later decided to destroy [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Turtle-Prime]] to destroy the [[multiverse]]. He was stopped by the three teams of turtles from the Prime, 1987, and 2003 universes. Although the true "Earth Prime" of the movie would be that inhabited by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in the closing shot, shown putting the finishing touches on the first issue of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book.

==In other media==
*In the DC animated feature ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', the villainous [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]'s ultimate goal is to locate a universe that he designates as Earth Prime, the so-called "original" universe that all other universes stem from, and destroy it, thus leading to the destruction of all reality as well, due to believing that the existence of a multiverse meant [[Nihilism|nothing truly matters]]. Earth Prime is shown to be a desolate barren wasteland of a planet which has been ripped out of orbit, with ruins as far as the eye can see. It is unknown what exactly caused its desolation, though Owlman reasons that [[Human extinction#Omnicide|mankind was destroyed by itself]].
*In the final episode of ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', after saving the multiverse from [[Spider-Carnage]], an evil version of himself from an alternate Earth, [[Spider-Man]] briefly visits Earth Prime and meets his own creator, [[Stan Lee]].

[[File:cyclone Deaths.svg|thumb|right|250px|Pie graph of American tropical cyclone casualties by cause from 1970–1999]]

The main effects of [[tropical cyclone]]s include heavy [[rain]], strong [[wind]], large [[storm surge]]s near [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], and [[tornado]]es. The destruction from a tropical cyclone, such as a [[hurricane]] or tropical storm, depends mainly on its [[tropical cyclone scales|intensity]], its size, and its location. Tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy as well as change the landscape near coastal areas, by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast. Even well inland, heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas. Their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the Oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones' paths.

After the [[cyclone]] has passed, devastation often continues. Fallen trees can block roads and delay rescues, with medical supplies, or slow the repairs to electrical lines, telephone towers or water pipes, which could put other lives at risk for days or months. [[Standing water]] can cause the spread of disease, and transportation or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships take advantage of their known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.

PST hazards. PST is an acronym standing for Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. A primary hazard involves destructive winds, debris and storm surge. Secondary hazards include flooding and fires. Tertiary hazards include spikes in prices of food and other necessities, as well as long term hazards like water-borne diseases.

== At sea  ==
A mature tropical cyclone can release heat at a rate upwards of 6x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s.&lt;ref name="NOAA Question of the Month"&gt;{{cite web |author= [[National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) |url= http://www.noaa.gov/questions/question_082900.html |title= NOAA Question of the Month: How much energy does a hurricane release? |date= August 2000 |accessdate= 2006-03-31 |publisher = [[NOAA]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060221063725/http://www.noaa.gov/questions/question_082900.html |archivedate= 2006-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves, heavy rain, and high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing [[shipwreck]]s.&lt;ref name="18cva"&gt;{{cite web |author= David Roth and Hugh Cobb |year=2001 |title=Eighteenth Century Virginia Hurricanes |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=2007-02-24 |url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/va18hur.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, after its passage, a tropical cyclone stirs up ocean water, lowering [[sea surface temperature]]s behind it.&lt;ref name="NASA Cooling"&gt;{{cite web |author= Earth Observatory |url= http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17164 |title=Passing of Hurricanes Cools Entire Gulf |year=2005 |accessdate= 2006-04-26 |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060930235454/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17164 |archivedate=2006-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cool wake can cause the region to be less favorable for a subsequent tropical cyclone.

=== North American colonization ===
Shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones. Such shipwrecks can change the course of history,&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Rappaport and Jose Fernandez-Partagas.

=== Shipping ===
[[File:Typhoons and Wind Speeds.gif|thumb|The '''dangerous semicircle''' is the upper-right corner, with the arrow marking the direction of motion of a Northern Hemisphere storm. Note that typhoons, etc. are asymmetrical, and ''semicircle'' is a convenient misnomer.]]
Mariners have a way to safely navigate around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left segment in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the '''dangerous semicircle''' since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the '''navigable semicircle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dangerous-semicircle1 |title=AMS Glossary |last=[[American Meteorological Society]] |work= Glossary of Meteorology |publisher=Allen Press |accessdate= 27 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723195128/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dangerous-semicircle1 |archivedate= 23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the [[starboard]] bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Pennsylvania State University]].

== Upon landfall ==
The most significant effects of a tropical cyclone occur when they cross coastlines, making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] then it destroys ships and lives.

=== Strong winds ===
{{see also|Tropical cyclone windspeed climatology}}
Strong [[wind]]s can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, trees, personal property and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. In the [[United States]], [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricanes]] comprise just 21% of all land-falling tropical cyclones, but account for 83% of all damage.&lt;ref name="faqd5"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Land sea |year=1998 |title=How does the damage that hurricanes cause increase as a function of wind speed? |publisher=Hurricane Research Division |accessdate=2007-02-24 |url= http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D5.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070309223502/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D5.html |archivedate= 2007-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people, preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts.&lt;ref name="Power failures"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Writer |date=2005-08-30 |title= Hurricane Katrina Situation Report #11 |publisher= Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) [[United States Department of Energy]] |accessdate= 2007-02-24 |url= http://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/docs/katrina/katrina_083005_1600.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges, overpasses, and roads, complicating efforts to transport food, clean water, and medicine to the areas that need it. Furthermore, the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region, and to a [[diaspora]] of the population of the region.&lt;ref name="oxfo"/&gt;

=== Storm surge ===
[[File:Hurricane katrina damage gulfport mississippi.jpg|thumb|180px|right |The aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[Gulfport, Mississippi]]. Katrina was the second-costliest tropical cyclone in [[United States]] history.]]
{{See also|Storm surge}}
The [[storm surge]], or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.&lt;ref name="oxfo"&gt;{{cite web |author=James M. Shultz, Jill Russell and Zelde Espinel |year=2005 |title= Epidemiology of Tropical Cyclones: The Dynamics of Disaster, Disease, and Development |publisher=Oxford Journal |accessdate=2007-02-24|url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/27/1/21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles/kilometers inland, flooding homes and cutting off escape routes. The storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures, but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish-breeding locales.

=== Heavy rainfall ===
{{See also|Tropical cyclone rainfall climatology}}
The [[thunderstorm]] activity in a tropical cyclone produces intense [[rain]]fall, potentially resulting in flooding, mudslides, and landslides. Inland areas are particularly vulnerable to freshwater [[flooding]], due to residents not preparing adequately.&lt;ref name=NHCFlooding&gt;{{cite web |author= Rappaport, Ed |url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/inland_flood.shtml |work= National Hurricane Preparedness Week |publisher= [[National Hurricane Center]] |title= Inland Flooding |date= May 2006 |accessdate= 2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavy inland rainfall eventually flows into coastal estuaries, damaging marine life in coastal estuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= South Florida Water Management District |url= https://my.sfwmd.gov/portal/page?_pageid=2814,19613298,2814_19613515&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517125537/http://my.sfwmd.gov/portal/page?_pageid=2814%2C19613298%2C2814_19613515&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-17 |title= Editorial Perspectives |date= 2005-10-11 |accessdate= 2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wet environment in the aftermath of a tropical cyclone, combined with the destruction of sanitation facilities and a warm tropical climate, can induce epidemics of disease which claim lives long after the storm passes.&lt;ref name="oxfo"/&gt;  Infections of cuts and bruises can be greatly amplified by wading in sewage-[[polluted]] water. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding also contribute to mosquito-borne illnesses. Furthermore, crowded evacuees in [[Emergency shelter|shelters]] increase the risk of disease propagation.&lt;ref name="oxfo"/&gt;
[[File:Support during Hurricane Harvey (TX) (50).jpg|left|thumb|350px|Flooding in [[Port Arthur, Texas]] caused by [[Hurricane Harvey]]. Harvey was both the wettest and costliest tropical cyclone in [[United States]] history.]]

Although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Hurricanes in the eastern north Pacific often supply moisture to the [[Southwestern United States]] and parts of Mexico.&lt;ref name="2005 EPac outlook"&gt;[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] [http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/Epac_hurricane.html 2005 Tropical Eastern North Pacific Hurricane Outlook] accessed May 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]] receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons.&lt;ref name="Whipple 54"&gt;{{cite book |author= Whipple, Addison |year= 1982 |title= Storm |pages=  54 |location= Alexandria, VA |publisher= [[Time Life|Time Life Books]] |isbn= 0-8094-4312-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Camille]] (1969) averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path,&lt;ref name="Christopherson"&gt;{{cite book |author= Christopherson, Robert W. |year= 1992 |title=  Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography |pages= 222–224 |publisher= Macmillan Publishing Company |location= [[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 0-02-322443-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it also killed 259&amp;nbsp;people and caused $9.14&amp;nbsp;billion (2005 [[USD]]) in damage.

On the other hand, the occurrence of tropical cyclones can cause tremendous variability in rainfall over the areas they affect: indeed cyclones are the primary cause of the most extreme rainfall variability in the world, as observed in places such as [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]] and [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] in subtropical [[Australia]] where the annual rainfall can range from practically nothing with no cyclones to over {{convert|1,000|mm|in}} if cyclones are abundant.

=== Tornadoes ===
{{Main article|List of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes}}
The broad rotation of a land-falling tropical cyclone often spawns [[List of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes|tornadoes]], particularly in their right front quadrant. While these tornadoes are normally not as strong as their non-tropical counterparts, heavy damage or loss of life can still occur. Tornadoes can also be spawned
as a result of [[Eye (cyclone)#eyewall |eyewall mesovortices]], which persist until landfall.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ L6"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division |title= Frequently Asked Questions: Are TC tornadoes weaker than midlatitude tornadoes? |publisher=[[NOAA]] |date=2006-10-04 |accessdate= 2006-07-25 |url= http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/L6.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090914103006/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/L6.html |archivedate= 2009-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last two centuries, tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1.9&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide. It is estimated that 10,000&amp;nbsp;people per year perish due to tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="ADLER"/&gt; The deadliest tropical cyclone was the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], which had a death toll of anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 lives.

=== United States ===
Before [[Hurricane Katrina]], which combined storm-tide flooding with levee-breach (dam) flooding from [[Lake Ponchartrain]], the average death rate for tropical cyclones in the United States had been decreasing. The main cause of storm-related fatalities had been shifting away from storm surge and towards freshwater (rain) flooding.&lt;ref&gt;National Weather Service Southern Region Headquarters. [http://www.srh.weather.gov/floods/images/flood.PDF Did you know?] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070508223853/http://www.srh.weather.gov/floods/images/flood.PDF |date=2007-05-08 }} Retrieved on 2007-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[median]] death rate per storm had increased through 1979, with a lull during the 1980–1995 period. This was due to greater numbers of people moving to the coastal margins and into harm's way. Despite advances in warning strategies and reduction in track forecast error, this increase in fatalities is expected to continue for as long as people migrate towards the shore.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Arguez and James B.

== Reconstruction and repopulation ==
[[File:Aerial view of Tacloban after Typhoon Haiyan.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Aerial image of destroyed houses in [[Tacloban]], following [[Typhoon Haiyan]]]]
While tropical cyclones may well seriously damage settlement, total destruction encourages rebuilding. For example, the destruction wrought by [[Hurricane Camille]] on the Gulf coast spurred redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values.&lt;ref name="Christopherson"/&gt; Research indicates that the typical hurricane strike raises real house prices by a few percent for a number of years, with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2010/wp1009.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, ''The Impact of Hurricanes on Housing Prices: Evidence from US Coastal Cities'', October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; However, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. [[Hurricane Katrina]] is the most obvious example, as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well.

In isolated areas with small populations, tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties to contribute to the [[founder's effect]] as survivors repopulate their place. For example, around 1775, a typhoon hit [[Pingelap Atoll]], and in combination with a subsequent famine, reduced the island's population to a low level. Several generations after the disaster, as many as 10% of Pingelapese have a [[genetic disorder|genetic]] form of [[color-blindness]] called [[achromatopsia]].&lt;ref name="Pingelap in Nature"&gt;{{cite web |title=The vision of Typhoon Lengkieki |author=Val C.

== Effects on natural resources ==

=== Geomorphology ===
Tropical cyclones reshape the [[geology]] near the coast by eroding sand from the [[beach]] as well as offshore, rearranging coral, and changing dune configuration onshore. Their rain water gets absorbed into [[stalagmite]]s within caves, creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts.

==== Coastal ridges ====
Waves and storm surges accompanying tropical cyclones erode undersea sands, erode shell deposits, break off corals from near shore [[reefs]] in their paths, and carry all this detritus landwards in a rolling wave of material that is deposited onshore, above highest astronomical [[tide]] as a ridge of sand, shell and coral.&lt;ref name="Nott01"&gt;Nott, J.F. (2003). "[http://www.tesag.jcu.edu.au/staff/jnott/abstracts/JGR_paper.pdf  Intensity of Prehistoric Tropical Cyclones]" (pdf). ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', 108(D7). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830142042/http://www.tesag.jcu.edu.au/staff/jnott/abstracts/JGR_paper.pdf |date=2007-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, each severe tropical cyclone (i.e. Category&amp;nbsp;4–5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale) crossing northeast [[Australia]]'s tropical coastline since the last significant change in sea levels (about 5,000&amp;nbsp;years ago) has 'emplaced' such ridges within the coastal landscape forming, in some places, series of ridges and a geomorphological record of highest magnitude cyclones hitting the coast over 3,000–5,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Nott"&gt;Nott, J.F: "Global Climate change and the tropical cyclone palaeo-record in Australia", ''Paper Delivered to Cyclone Science Seminar, James Cook University, 27 September 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyewitness accounts verify ridges of this kind are formed by severe tropical cyclones and two clear examples cited are the {{convert|18|km|mi}} long, {{convert|35|m|ft}} wide, {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} high coral shingle ridge deposited on Funafuti Atoll (Central South Pacific) by [[Cyclone Bebe]] in October 1972, and the large coral shingle ridge deposited on Jaluit Atoll ([[Marshall Islands]]) by [[1958 Pacific typhoon season#Super Typhoon Ophelia|Typhoon Ophelia]] in January 1958. In tropical northeast Australia, an intense tropical cyclone hit in March 1918 (crossing over the town of [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]]), at which time there were eyewitness accounts of a {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} to {{convert|5.1|m|ft}} high ridge of pumice being deposited by that cyclone's surge as it crossed the coast.).&lt;ref name="Nott01"/&gt;

==== Limestone cave stalagmites ====
When tropical cyclones cross land, thin layers of [[calcium carbonate]] of 'light' composition (i.e. unusual [[isotope|isotopic]] ratio of [[Oxygen 18|Oxygen-18]] and [[Oxygen|Oxygen-16]]) are deposited onto [[stalagmite]]s in [[limestone]] caves up to {{convert|300|km|mi}} from the cyclone's path.&lt;ref name="Nott"/&gt;

As the cloud tops of tropical cyclones are high and cold, and their air is humid – their rainwater is 'lighter'. In other words, the rainfall contains significantly higher quantities of unevaporated Oxygen-18 than other tropical rainfall. The isotopically lighter rainwater soaks into the ground, percolates down into caves, and, within a couple of weeks, Oxygen-18 transfers from the water into calcium carbonate, before being deposited in thin layers or 'rings' within stalagmites. A succession of such events created within stalagmites maintain a record of cyclones tracking within a {{convert|300|km|mi}} radius of caves going back centuries, millennia, or even millions of years.&lt;ref name="Frappier"&gt;Frappier, A.B. et al. (2007) "Stalagmite stable isotope record of recent tropical cyclone events", ' 'Geology' ', 35(2): 111–114]&lt;/ref&gt;

At Actun Tunichil Muknal cave in central [[Belize]], researchers drilling stalagmites with a computer- controlled dental drill accurately identified and verified evidence of isotopically light rainfall for 11 tropical cyclones occurring over a 23-year period (1978–2001).&lt;ref name="Frappier"/&gt;

At the [[Chillagoe]] limestone caves in northeast Australia ({{convert|130|km|mi}} inland from [[Cairns]]) researchers identified and matched evidence of isotopically light rainfall with 100&amp;nbsp;years of cyclone records, and from this have created a record of tropical cyclones from 2004 back to 1200 A.D. (an 800-year record).&lt;ref name="Nott"/&gt;

=== Landscapes ===
Severe tropical cyclones defoliate tropical [[forest canopy]] trees, remove [[vine]]s and [[epiphytes]] from the trees, break tree crown stems, and cause tree falls. The degree of damage they do along their paths, at a landscape level (i.e. &gt; {{convert|10|km|mi}}), can be catastrophic yet variable and patchy.&lt;ref&gt;Turton, S.M. and A. Dale (2007) [http://www.wettropics.gov.au/res/downloads/cyclone/TurtonDaleReport2007.pdf A preliminary assessment of the environmental impacts of Cyclone Larry on the forest landscapes of northeast Queensland, with reference to responses to natural resource management issues in the aftermath, ''Journal Report Submitted to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology'': 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129132950/http://www.wettropics.gov.au/res/downloads/cyclone/TurtonDaleReport2007.pdf |date=2007-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees will break at {{cvt|42|m/s|km/h mph}}, regardless of size and type.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.023001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.023001&lt;/ref&gt; Stripping trees and scattering forest debris also provides fuel for [[wildfire]]s, such as a blaze that lasted three months in 1989 and burned {{convert|460|sqmi|km2}} of forest that had been stripped by [[Hurricane Gilbert]].&lt;ref name="Natural Hazards Map"&gt;{{cite book |title= Natural Hazards of North America |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |date=July 1998 |type=map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Degree of exposure ([[windward]] exposure, [[leeward]] acceleration, or local topographic sheltering/shading); and
* [[Ecosystem]] species composition and forest structure

Assessments of cyclone damage done to tropical rainforest landscapes in northeast [[Australia]], have produced the following [[wiktionary:typology|typology]] for describing and 'mapping' the variable impacts they have along their paths, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Unwin, G. L., Applegate G. B., Stocker G. C. &amp; Nicholson D. I. (1988) "Initial effects of tropical cyclone Winifred on forests in north Queensland", ''Proceedings ofEcological Society of Australia''. 15: 283–296&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Severe and extensive''' closest to the centre of cyclone: impact appears to be multidirectional and is evidenced by crowns of most trees having been broken, smashed or windthrown
# '''Severe and localised''' closer to the cyclone centre than its edge: direction of the destructive winds is clearly identifiable, and severe canopy disruption is limited to the windward aspect of these forested areas
# '''Moderate canopy disturbance''' closer to cyclone edge than its centre: most of the tree stems are still standing, with only some treefalls, and most of the damage is the defoliation of the canopy and branch breakage;
# '''Slight canopy disturbance''' closest to cyclone edge: occasional stem fall or branch breakage, with most of the damage consisting of loss of foliage on the forest edges only, subsequently followed by leaf damage and heavy leaf litter falls.

'''''Eisengarn''''', meaning "iron yarn" in English, is a light-reflecting, strong, waxed-cotton thread. It was invented and manufactured in Germany in the mid-19th century, but is now most well known for its use in cloth woven for the tubular-steel chairs designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] while he was a teacher at the [[Bauhaus]] design school.

The yarn is also known as '''''Glanzgarn''''' ('gloss' or 'glazed' yarn). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitlos-berlin.de/aktuelles/eisengarn-eine-material-geschichte zeitlos-berlin.de], ''Eisengarn – Eine Material Geschichte''. Retrieved 27 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Manufacture ==
Despite the name, there is no iron in ''eisengarn''. The name refers to its strength and metallic shine. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and [[paraffin wax]] solution. The threads are dried and then stretched and polished by steel rollers and brushes. The end result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant yarn which is extremely hardwearing.&lt;ref name=history&gt; [http://www.wuppertal.ihk24.de/servicemarken/branchen_neu/industrie/industrie_im_bs/902782/Textilstandort_Wuppertal.html ''Industriegeschichte aus dem Bergischen land''].

== History ==
[[File:Barmen (1870).jpg|thumb|Barmen (1870)]]
[[File:Netz.jpg|thumb|150px|Eisengarn string bag]]
The ''eisengarn'' manufacturing process was invented in the mid-19th century in a factory in [[Barmen]], now part of the city of [[Wuppertal]], east of the river [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

It was used as a sewing thread and for making lace, shoe laces, hat strings, ribbons, lining materials and in the cable industry.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The manufacture of the yarn gave a considerable boost to the textile industry of Barmen and the surrounding region. By 1875, the Wuppertal company Barthels &amp; Feldhoff employed more than 300 people in eisengarn production.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 1927 the weaver and textile designer [[Margaretha Reichardt]] (1907–1984), then a student at the Bauhaus design school, experimented and improved the quality of the thread and developed cloth and strapping material made from ''eisengarn'' for use on Marcel Breuer's tubular steel chairs, such as the [[Wassily Chair]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/people/students/margaretha-reichardt/ Bauhaus100.

[Kreis Weimarer Land/Angermuseum Erfurt]:[Erfurt], p19&lt;/ref&gt; 

Light-weight tubular steel seating was also used in aircraft seating in the 1930s and Reichardt's improved version of ''eisengarn'' was used as a covering for the seats.&lt;ref&gt;Stutterheim, Kerstin; Bolbrinker, Niels.

A more prosaic use for the strong eisengarn thread was, and still is, for making colourful [[String bag|string shopping bags]], which were popular in the former [[East Germany]], and are now an [[Ostalgie]] item.&lt;ref name=Tagesspiegel&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/geschichte/aus-der-mode-aus-dem-sinn/1501512.html Wiebrecht V., Skuppin, R.

'''Energy in Gabon''' is an [[industry]] with plenty of potential.

==Oil==
[[Gabon]], a former OPEC member (1975–1994) that rejoined in 2016, is the sixth-largest&lt;ref&gt;Gabon Country field, accessed online on 20/05/2014 on http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=GB&lt;/ref&gt; [[oil]] producer in sub-Saharan Africa, and has the region's fifth-largest oil reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Gabon Country File, accessed online on 30/05/2014 on http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=GB&lt;/ref&gt; Oil prospecting began in 1931. Deposits were found on the coast or off shore in the vicinity of [[Libreville]], northwestern Gabon and [[Port-Gentil]], along the coast and in the southwestern part of the country. Larger deposits were found in the south. Oil from the northwest is channeled by pipeline to Cape Lopez, where there are loading facilities for export. 
Additional deposits were found on [[Mandji Island]] in 1962. The Rabi Kounga oil field, operated by Shell Gabon, is Gabon's largest oil field. In 1997, it produced a peak of {{convert|217000|oilbbl/d}}. As of November 2004, it was producing {{convert|55000|oilbbl/d}}.

The first national oil company was the [[Société Nationale Petrolière Gabonaise]] but it was disbanded in 1987.  The government of Gabon controls all petroleum and mineral rights within the state. In 2011 a presidential decree created the Gabon Oil Company (GOC).&lt;ref name="gabonoil.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabonoil.com/index.php/en/|title=Web Page Under Construction|author=|date=|website=www.gabonoil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new entity works in partnership with international companies operating in Gabon and operates two fields: Obangue and Remboue.&lt;ref name="gabonoil.com"/&gt;

==Petroleum==
Although Gabon's proven [[petroleum]] reserves rose from {{convert|1300|Moilbbl}} in 1996 to {{convert|2500|Moilbbl}} in 2004, the government is concerned about long-term depletion of resources. Total production of crude oil fell from a peak of {{convert|371000|oilbbl/d}} day to an estimated {{convert|289700|oilbbl/d}} in 2003. Gabon's production goes primarily to [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], the [[United States]], and, more recently, [[Taiwan]]. Net oil exports in 2003 are estimated at 289,680 barrels per day.

As of January 2004, reserves of natural gas reserves estimated at {{convert|1.2|Tcuft}}, by the [[Oil &amp; Gas Journal]]. Production and consumption of natural gas in 2002 were estimated at {{convert|3|Gcuft}}, each. Gross output stood at {{convert|81.22|Gcuft}} in 2002, of which {{convert|55.09|Gcuft}} was flared or vented off, and {{convert|19.42|Gcuft}} was reinjected.

==Hydropower==
{{see also|Grand Poubara Dam}}
In 2002 there were hydroelectric stations at the [[Kinguélé]] and [[Tchimbélé]] dams on the [[Mbei River]] and at the [[Petite Poubara Dam]], near [[Makokou]] on the [[Ogooué]]. Production and distribution of electricity are maintained by the [[Energy and Water Company of Gabon]] (SEEG), which was formed in 1963 and incorporates a number of smaller private and quasi-public entities. In 2002, electric power output totalled an estimated 1.16&amp;nbsp;TWh, with capacity estimated as of January 2002 at 406&amp;nbsp;MW. Consumption of [[electricity]] was 1.275&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2002. [[Natural gas]] is the principal fuel for the thermal plants. Hydropower accounts for 11% of Gabon's electric power consumption in 2013.

'''EXPOCODE''', or the "expedition code", is a unique alphanumeric identifier defined by the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] (NODC) of the US. The code defines a standard nomenclature for cruise labels of research vessels and intends to avoid confusion in oceanographic data management.

The code was used by international projects ([[World Ocean Circulation Experiment|WOCE]], [[CarboOcean]]) and is considered a de facto standard in the international hydrographic community beginning with the Climate Variability Program (CLIVAR) and the EU-Project [[Eurofleets]].

The format of an expocode for an oceanographic cruise is defined in the format NODCYYYYMMDD where:
* ''NODC'' is [[NOAA]]'s National Oceanographic Data Center's 4-character research vessel identifier, consisting of country and ship code
* ''YYYYMMDD'' is the [[GMT]] date when the cruise left port.

Example for a cruise of the US research vessel ''Nathaniel B. Palmer'', starting on 2011-02-19: '''320620110219''' (Code of US = 32, code of Palmer = 06, date when cruise starts 2011-02-19)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">A '''facultative parasite''' is an  [[organism]] that may resort to [[Parasite|parasitic]] activity, but does not absolutely rely on any [[host (biology)|host]] for completion of its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].

Examples of facultative parasitism occur among many species of [[Fungus|fungi]], such as family members of the [[genus]] ''[[Armillaria]]''. ''Armillaria'' species do parasitise living trees, but if the tree dies, whether as a consequence of the fungal infection or not, the fungus continues to eat the wood without further need for parasitic activity; some species even can ingest dead wood without any parasitic activity at all. As such, although they also are important [[Ecology|ecological]] agents in the process of [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] by microbial decomposition, the fungi become pests in their role as destructive agents of [[Wood-decay fungus|wood rot]].&lt;ref&gt;Agrios, George N. Plant Pathology. Publisher: Academic Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0120445653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, green plants in [[Genus|genera]] such as ''[[Rhinanthus]]'' and [[Colpoon]] can grow independently of any host, but they also act [[Opportunism#Biological opportunism|opportunistically]] as facultative root parasites of neighboring green plants.

Among animals, facultatively [[Kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasitic]] species generally can survive by hunting or [[Scavenger|scavenging]] for themselves, but it often is more profitable for them to rob food from other animals kleptoparasitically, whether their hosts are of the same species or not. Such behavior occurs in lions and hyaenas for example, and also among insects such as "Jackal flies" in the family [[Milichiidae]].

More intimately, normally free-living microbes may opportunistically live as facultative parasites in other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds Bruce D. "Colpoda steini, a Facultative Parasite of the Land Slug, Agriolimax agrestis" The Journal of Parasitology Vol. 22, No. 1 (Feb., 1936), pp. 48-53. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3271896&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this in humans is [[Naegleria fowleri]]. As a rule this [[amoeboid]] species is a free-living predator on microbes, but occasionally it successfully infects humans as a facultative internal parasite.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html&lt;/ref&gt;

High intensity crown fire is the typical fire regime in boreal forest regions

[[File:Global Warming Map.jpg|thumb|
Northern regions are warming at a higher rate than elsewhere
]]
[[Terrestrial ecosystem|Terrestrial ecosystems]] found in the boreal (or [[taiga]]) regions of North America and Eurasia cover less than 17% of the earth's land surface, yet contain more than 30% of all carbon present in the terrestrial biome&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasischke|first=Eric S.|date=2000|title=Boreal Ecosystems in the Global Carbon Cycle|url=|journal=Ecological Studes|volume=138|pages=19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In terms of carbon storage, the boreal region consists of three ecosystems: [[boreal forest]], [[peatland]], and [[tundra]]. Vast areas of the globe and are contributing greatly to atmospheric carbon release due to increased temperature and fire hazard.  High northern latitudes will experience the most significant increase in warming on the planet as a result of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases thus placing in jeopardy the carbon sink in these areas. In addition to the release of carbon through the melting of permafrost, high intensity wildfires will become more common and thus contribute to the release of stored carbon. This means that the boreal forest and its fire regime is becoming an increasingly more significant factor in determining the global carbon budget.  

Boreal forests are also important economic factors in Russia and Canada specifically, and the uncertainty of fire patterns in the future as a result of climate change is a major consideration in forest management plans. A decrease in allowed timber harvest could be a solution to long term uncertainty of fire cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniel|first=Colin J.|last2=Ter-Mikaelian|first2=Michael T.|last3=Wotton|first3=Mike B.|last4=Rayfield|first4=Bronwyn|last5=Fortin|first5=Marie-Josée|date=|title=Incorporating uncertainty into forest management planning: Timber harvest, wildfire and climate change in the boreal forest|url=|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|volume=400|pages=542-554|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Carbon cycling in boreal forests ==
Although temperate and tropical forests in total cover twice as much land as boreal forest, boreal forest contains 20% more carbon than the other two combined&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Boreal forests are susceptible to global warming because the [[Ice-albedo feedback|ice/snow albedo feedback]] is significantly influenced by surface temperature, so fire induced changes in surface albedo and infrared emissivity are more significant than in the tropics &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levine|first=Joel S.|last2=Cofer III|first2=Wesley R.|date=2000|title=Boreal Forest Fire Emissions and the Chemistry of the Atmosphere|url=|journal=Ecological Studies|volume=138|pages=44-45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Boreal forest fires contribute greatly to greenhouse gas presence in the atmosphere. Large boreal fires produce enough energy to produce convective smoke columns that can break into the troposphere and occasionally penetrate across the tropopause. In addition, the cold temperature in boreal regions result in low levels of water vapor. This low level of water vapor combined with low solar radiation results in very low photochemical production of the [[Hydroxyl radical|OH radical]], which is a chemical that controls the atmospheric lifetime of most tropospheric gases. Therefore, the greenhouse gas emission in boreal forest fires will have prolonged lifetimes over the forest&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

=== Fire regime ===
The [[Fire regime|fire regimes]] of boreal forest in Canada and in Russia are distinct. In Russia, the climate is drier and the majority of fires are human caused. This means that there are more frequent fires of lower intensity than in Canada and that most carbon output as a result of fire is in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Forestry practices in Russia involve the use of heavy machinery and large-scale clear-cuts, leading to the alteration of fuel complexes. This practice is reportedly causing areas to degrade into grass steppes, rather that regenerate as new forest. This may result in the shorting of fire return intervals. Industrial practices in Russia also create additional fire hazards (severe damages in the Russian Federation affect about 9 million ha). Radioactive contamination on an area of about 7 million ha creates a fire hazard because fire can redistribute radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldammer|first=Johann G.|last2=Stocks|first2=Brian J.|date=2000|title=Eurasian Perspective of Fire: Dimension, Management, Policies, and Scientific Requirements|url=|journal=Ecological Studies|volume=138|pages=53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of boreal forest fires in Canada are started by lighting. Subsequently, there are fewer fires on average in Canada but a much higher frequency of high intensity crown fire than Russia with a crown fire rate of 57% in Canada as opposed to 6% in Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Groot|first=William J.|last2=Cantin|first2=Alan S.|last3=Flannigan|first3=Michael D.|last4=Soja|first4=Amber J.|last5=Gowman|first5=Lynn M.|last6=Newbery|first6=Alison|date=2013-04-15|title=A comparison of Canadian and Russian boreal forest fire regimes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112712004392|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|series=The Mega-fire reality|volume=294|issue=Supplement C|pages=23–34|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2012.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Natural [[Fire history|fire rotation]] across Canadian and Alaskan boreal forests is one to several centuries. 

=== Peatland and tundra ===
Fire indirectly plays a role in the exchange of carbon between terrestrial surface and the atmosphere by regulating soil and moisture regimes, including plant succession, photosynthesis, and soil microbial processes.  Soil in boreal regions is a significant global carbon sink; boreal forest soil holds 200 Gt of carbon while boreal peatlands hold 400 Gt of carbon.  Northernmost permafrost regions contain 10,355 ± 150 Pg of [[soil organic carbon]] (SOC) in the top 0-3 m and 21% of this carbon is in the soil organic layer (SOL) pool found in the top 30 cm of the ground layer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoy|first=Elizabeth E.|last2=Turetsky|first2=Merritt R.|last3=Kasischke|first3=Eric S.|date=2016|title=More frequent burning increases vulnerability of Alaskan boreal black spruce forests|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/11/i=9/a=095001|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=9|pages=095001|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/095001|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The depth of the organic soil layer is one of the controls on permafrost, leading to a generalization of two domains in boreal forest: thick soil layer and thin soil layer. Thick organic soil insulates the subsoil from warmer summer temperatures and allows for permafrost to develop. Although permafrost keeps ground moist during winter, during summer months upper organic soil horizons will become dessicated. As average temperatures increase, Permafrost is melting at a faster rate and, correspondingly, the length of the fire season is increasing. When the fire-free interval (FFI) is decreased, the loss of the SOL may result in a domain change to a thin soil layer, leading to less carbon storage in the soil, greater fire vulnerability, and decreased permafrost. In black spruce forests, decreased FFI can ruin successional trajectories by opening the door for deciduous trees and shrubs to invade, which also further increases fire vulnerability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Data regarding carbon storage in the [[permafrost]] region as well as fire activity in boreal forests is sparse, which is a significant barrier in determining an accurate carbon budget. An expert assessment indicates that the permafrost region will become a net carbon source by 2100&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Benjamin W.|last2=Jones|first2=Jeremy B.|last3=Schuur|first3=Edward A. G.|last4=III|first4=F. Stuart Chapin|last5=Bowden|first5=William B.|last6=Bret-Harte|first6=M. Syndonia|last7=Epstein|first7=Howard E.|last8=Flannigan|first8=Michael D.|last9=Harms|first9=Tamara K.|date=2016|title=Biomass offsets little or none of permafrost carbon release from soils, streams, and wildfire: an expert assessment|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/11/i=3/a=034014|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=034014|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034014|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A 5 - 10 degree C rise in forest floor temperature after a fire will significantly increase the rate of decomposition for years after the fire occurs, which temporarily turns the soil into a net carbon source (not sink) locally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Fire enhances the biogenic emissions of NO and N20 from soil&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4256">A '''homoclinal ridge''' or '''strike ridge''' is a [[hill]] or [[ridge]] with a moderate, generally between 10° to 30°, sloping backslope. Its backslope is a ''[[dip slope]],'' that conforms with the [[Strike and dip|dip]] of a resistant [[stratum]] or [[strata]], called ''[[caprock]].'' On the other side of the other slope, which is its frontslope, of a homoclinal ridge is a steeper or even cliff-like frontslope ([[escarpment]]) that is formed by the outcrop of the caprock. The escarpment cuts through the [[Strike and dip|dipping strata]] that comprises the homoclinal ridge.&lt;ref name="Cotton1952a"&gt;[[Charles Cotton (geologist)|Cotton, C.A.]] (1952) ''Geomorphology An Introduction to the Study of Landforms.''

Homoclinal ridges are the expression of regional outcrops of moderately dipping [[strata]], typically [[sedimentary]] strata, that consist of alternating beds of hard, well-lithified strata, i.e. [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] and weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. [[shale]], [[mudstone]], and [[marl]]. The surface of hard, erosion-resistant rock strata forms the caprock of the backslope (dip-slope) of the homoclinal ridges from which erosion has preferentially stripped any weaker strata. The opposite slope, its frontslope, that forms the front of a homoclinal ridge consists of an escarpment that cuts across the [[Bed (geology)|bedding]] of the strata comprising it. Because of the moderately dipping nature of the strata that forms a homoclinal ridge, a significant shift in horizontal location will take place the landscape is lowered by [[erosion]].&lt;ref name="Cotton1952a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonett1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twidale1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"&gt;Thornbury, W. D., 1954, "Principles of Geomorphology'' New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 618 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the slope of a homoclinal ridge dips in the same direction as the sedimentary strata underlying it, the dip angle of this bedding (Ө) can be calculated by v/h= tan(Ө) where v is equal to the vertical distance and h is equal to the horizontal distance perpendicular to the strike of the beds.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook1999a"&gt;Easterbrook, DJ (1999) ''Surface Processes and Landforms'', 2nd ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cuesta]]s, homoclinal ridges, and [[Hogback (geology)|hogbacks]] comprise a sequence of landforms that form a gradational continuum. These landform differ only on the steepness of their backslopes and relative differences in the inclination of their backslopes and frontslopes. These differences depends upon whether the dip of the strata from which they have been eroded are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. In general, homoclinal ridges, or strike ridges, are associated with strata that dip between 10° and 30°. The symmetrical ridges that characterize hogbacks develop where the strata dip very steeply at 40° or more. Because they are gradational in nature, the exact angle of the backslope used to define these landforms is arbitrary and can vary in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Simonett1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huggett2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twidale1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"&gt;Fairbridge, RW (1968) ''Hogback and Flatiron.''

==Properties and behavior of hyperons==
[[Image:Baryon decuplet.svg|230px|thumb|A combination of three u, d or s-quarks with a total spin of 3/2 form the so-called '''baryon decuplet'''. The lower six are hyperons.]]
Being baryons, all hyperons are [[fermion]]s. That is, they have [[half-integer]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] and obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Hyperons all interact via the [[strong nuclear force]], making them types of [[hadron]]. They are composed of three light [[quark]]s, at least one of which is a [[strange quark]], which makes them strange baryons. Hyperons decay [[weak interaction|weakly]] with non-conserved [[parity (physics)|parity]].

Notes:
* Since [[strangeness]] is conserved by the [[strong interaction]]s, the ground-state hyperons cannot decay strongly. However, they do participate in strong interactions.
*{{SubatomicParticle|Lambda0}} may also decay on rare occurrences via these processes:
::{{SubatomicParticle|Lambda0}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}
::{{SubatomicParticle|Lambda0}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Muon}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}
* {{SubatomicParticle|Xi0}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Xi-}} are also known as "cascade" hyperons, since they go through a two-step cascading decay into a nucleon.
* The {{SubatomicParticle|Omega-}} has a [[baryon number]] of +1 and [[hypercharge]] of −2, giving it strangeness of −3.
It takes multiple flavor-changing [[weak interaction|weak decays]] for it to decay into a proton or neutron. [[Murray Gell-Mann]]'s and [[Yuval Ne'eman]]'s [[Special unitary group|SU(3)]] model (sometimes called the [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]) predicted this hyperon's existence, mass and that it will only undergo weak decay processes. Experimental evidence for its existence was discovered in 1964 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. Further examples of its formation and observation using [[particle accelerator]]s confirmed the SU(3) model.

==Hyperon research==
The first research into hyperons happened in the 1950s, and spurred physicists on to the creation of an organized classification of particles. Today, research in this area is carried out on data taken at many facilities around the world, including [[CERN]], [[Fermilab]], [[SLAC]], [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|JLAB]], [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], [[KEK]], and others. Physics topics include searches for [[CP violation]], measurements of [[spin (physics)|spin]], studies of [[excited state]]s (commonly referred to as ''spectroscopy''), and hunts for exotic states such as [[pentaquark]]s and [[dibaryon]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18773">'''ISO 50001''' ''Energy management systems – Requirements with guidance for use'' is a specification created by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) for an [[energy management system]]. The standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and improving an energy management system, whose purpose is to enable an organization to follow a systematic approach in achieving continual improvement of energy performance, including [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[energy security]], energy use and consumption.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Eccleston Charles, March F., Cohen T., [https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Energy-Developing-Managing-Management/dp/1439876703/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486950850&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston+iso+50000 Inside Energy: Developing and Managing an ISO 50001 Energy Management System], CRC Press Inc. 300 pages (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The standard aims to help organizations continually reduce their energy use, and therefore their energy costs and their [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

ISO 50001 was originally released by ISO in June 2011 and is suitable for any organization, whatever its size, sector or geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51297 | title=Energy Management system | publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] | date=2011-06-09 | accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition, ISO 50001:2018 was released in August of 2018.

The system is modelled after the [[ISO 9001]] [[Quality Management System]] and the [[ISO 14001]] [[Environmental Management System]] (EMS). Eccleston describes the procedural details of the ISO Energy Management System (EnMS) and compares its procedures with those of the ISO 14001 EMS.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A significant feature in ISO 50001 is the requirement to "... improve the EnMS and the resulting energy performance" (clause 4.2.1 c). The other standards mentioned here (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001) both require improvement to the effectiveness of the Management System but not to the quality of the product/service (ISO 9001) or to environmental performance (ISO 14001). It is anticipated that by implementing ISO 9001 and 14001 together an organization would improve quality and environmental performance, but the standards do not currently specify this as a requirement.

ISO 50001, therefore, has made a major leap forward in 'raising the bar' by requiring an organization to demonstrate that they have improved their energy performance. There are no quantitative targets specified &amp;ndash; an organization chooses its own then creates an action plan to reach the targets. With this structured approach, an organization is more likely to see some tangible financial benefits.

== Reasons for use ==
The main objective of the standard is to improve energy-related performance and energy efficiency continuously and to identify energy reduction opportunities. This systematic approach will help organizations to establish systems and processes.

Consistent energy management helps organizations to realize untapped energy efficiency potential. They will benefit from cost savings and make a significant contribution to environmental and climate protection, for example by the permanent reduction of CO2 emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/en/Assessment-and-Certification-services/Management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/ISO-50001-Energy-Management-Systems/|title=ISO 50001 Energy Management {{!}} BSI Group|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bsigroup.co.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The standard should alert employees and in particular the management level to the immediate and long-term energy management gains that can be made. The organization can discover potential savings and competitive advantages. Furthermore, a huge image boost for the organization can be created.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Zertifizierung von Managementsystemen (DQS): ISO 50001 Energiekosten sparen – Klima schützen – Verantwortlich handeln (Produktblatt), Frankfurt 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Organizations of all types and sizes increasingly want to reduce the amount of energy they consume. This is driven by the need or desire to:
* reduce costs, 
* reduce the impact of rising costs,
* meet legislative or self-imposed carbon targets, 
* reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and 
* enhance the entity’s reputation as a socially responsible organization.

In tandem, governments increasingly want to reduce the Greenhouse Gas Emissions of their citizens and industries, and are imposing legislative mechanisms to compel carbon reduction more and more frequently.

In response, a range of energy management standards, specifications and regulations were developed in Australia, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Republic of Korea, Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, New Zealand and the USA.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Win the energy challenge with ISO 50001|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_50001_energy.pdf|work=June 2011|publisher=[[ISO]]|accessdate=30 Oct 2012|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) developed EN 16001:2009 ''Energy management systems. Requirements with guidance for use'' as a first international energy management standard. This was published in July 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New standard to increase energy efficiency: EN 16001:2009|url=http://pr.euractiv.com/press-release/new-standard-increase-energy-efficiency-en-160012009-10399|publisher=Euractiv.com|accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and withdrawn in April 2012 as it had been superseded by ISO 50001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS EN 16001:2009|url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030172146|publisher=BSI|accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) recognized that industry around the world needed to mount an effective response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Win the energy challenge with ISO 50001|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_50001_energy.pdf|publisher=ISO|accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also noted a proliferation of national energy management standards that were emerging as a response to market demand for help with energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierre|first=Inge|title=EN 16001: a powerful tool for Energy Management|url=http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/UtilitiesAndEnergy/Energy/Documents/2pierre.pdf|publisher=CEN/CENELEC|accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In April 2007, a UNIDO stakeholders meeting decided to ask ISO to develop an international energy management standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fossa|first=Alberto J.|title=ISO 50001 Energy Management System the path, the birth story, the people involved, difficulties, challenges, relevant discussions…|url=http://www.iso.org/sites/iso50001launch/assets/docs/03-Alberto_Fossa-ISO%2050001-the_path.pdf|publisher=ABNT|accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO for its part had identified energy management as one of its top five areas for the development of International Standards and, in 2008, created a project committee, ISO/PC 242, ''Energy management'', to carry out the work.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

ISO/PC 242 was led by ISO members for the United States ([[ANSI]]) and Brazil ([[ABNT]]). In addition, its leadership included the ISO members for China (SAC) and the United Kingdom ([[BSI Group]]) to ensure that developed and developing economies participated together in the project committee.

Experts from the national standards bodies of 44 ISO member countries participated and another 14 countries sent observers. Development organizations including UNIDO and the [[World Energy Council]] (WEC) were also involved.

ISO 50001 also drew on existing national and regional energy management codes and standards, including ones developed in China, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Republic of Korea, Netherlands, Sweden, Thailand, the USA and the European Union.

ISO 50001:2011 ''Energy management systems – Requirements with guidance for use'' was published on June 17, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 50001 energy management launch event|url=http://www.iso.org/sites/iso50001launch/index.html|publisher=ISO|accessdate=30 Oct 2012|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO published a revised version of ISO 50001 in 2018. The revision reflects a desire to promote adoption of the standard among [[small and medium sized enterprises]]. It also incorporates ISO's [[Annex SL|"high level structure"]] for use where organizations wish to integrate a number of management system standards together.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, B., [https://www.iso.org/news/ref2248.html New draft of ISO 50000 energy management standard], accessed 1 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The structure of ISO 50001 is designed according to other ISO management system standards, in particular ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems). Since all three management systems standards are based on the PDCA cycle, and now share the same high level structure, ISO 50001 can be integrated easily to these systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso50001.htm|title=ISO 50001 Energy management|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iso.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ten major components to ISO 50001:2018:

*''1.'': Scope 
*''2.'': Normative references
*''3.'': Terms and definitions
*''4.'': Context of the organization
*''5.'': Leadership
*''6.'': Planning
*''7.'': Support
*''8.'': Operation
*''9.'': Performance Evaluation
*''10.'': Improvement

== Method ==
ISO 50001 provides a framework of requirements that help organizations to:

* develop a policy for more efficient use of energy 
* fix targets and objectives to meet the policy 
* use data to better understand and make decisions concerning energy use and consumption 
* measure the results 
* review the effectiveness of the policy and  
* continually improve energy management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Win the energy challenge with ISO 50001|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_50001_energy.pdf|work=June 2011|publisher=ISO|accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 50001 focuses on a continual improvement process to achieve the objectives related to the environmental performance of an organization (enterprise, service provider, administration, etc.). The process follows a plan – do – check – act approach (Plan-Do-Check-Act, PDCA):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paeger-consulting.de/html/iso_50001.html|title=Energiemanagementsysteme nach ISO 50001 (paeger consulting)|last=Paeger|first=Jürgen|date=|website=www.paeger-consulting.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PDCA ZIRKEL ENGL.png|thumb|450px|right|The 4 phases of the PDCA circle]]

*''Plan'':

The overall responsibility for the installed energy management system must be located with the top management. An energy officer and an energy team should be appointed. Furthermore, the organization has to formulate the energy policy in form of a written statement which contains the intent and direction of energy policy. Energy policy must be communicated within the organization. The energy team is the connection between management and employees. In this phase the organization has to identify the significant energy uses and prioritize the opportunities for energy performance improvement.

*''Do'':

The stated objectives and processes are now introduced and implemented. Resources are made available and responsibilities determined. Make sure that employees and other participants are aware of and capable of carrying out their energy management responsibilities. The realization of the energy management system starts.

*''Check'':

An energy management system requires a process for compliance and valuation of energy-related regulations. Internal audit can help to verify that the energy management system is functioning properly and generating the planned results. The processes are monitored with regard to legal and other requirements (customer requirements, internal policies) as well as to the objectives of the energy management of the organization. The results are documented and reported to top management.&lt;ref&gt;https://de.dqs-ul.com/en/certifications/environmental-management/iso-50001.html?aoe_damfe%5Bmvcinstance%5D=43036&amp;aoe_damfe%5Bdamrecord%5D=6717&amp;aoe_damfe%5Baction%5D=download&amp;cHash=f6ad403e33f4c9543c27cdca35d7c69d viewed 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Act'':

The top management prepares a written valuation based on the internal audit. This document is called the management review. The results will be evaluated on their performance level. If necessary, corrective or preventive actions can be initiated. Energy-relevant processes are optimized and new strategic goals are derived.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;https://save-energy-now.org/EM/SPM/Documents/PDCA%20Components%20of%20ISO%2050001.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} viewed 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification ==
Certification proves that the energy management system meets the requirements of ISO 50001. This gives customers, stakeholders, employees and management more confidence that the organization is saving energy. It also helps to ensure that the energy management system is working throughout the organization.

Another advantage of a certification is its emphasis on continual improvement. The organization will continue to get better at managing its energy. Additional cost savings can be generated over several years. Furthermore, certifying an organization shows your public commitment to energy management.

[[UKAS]], the certification bodies' accreditation scheme in UK, accredits certification bodies to carry out certification of business energy management systems to ISO 50001. In July 2018 there were 15 UK bodies with the necessary accreditation to carry out independent audits and issue Energy Management Systems Certification to ISO 50001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukas.com/sectors/energy/|title=Energy Management |access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
ISO reported that the standard was warmly received by the market when it was first published. To the end of January 2012, around 100 organizations in 26 countries had already achieved certification to ISO 50001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ian|title=ISO 50001 "on fire" - Energy management standard goes global|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/news_index/news_archive/news.htm?Refid=Ref1537|publisher=ISO|accessdate=30 Oct 2012|date=14 March 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO also listed several users who had reported significant early cost savings and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Gary|title=Energy management - Early ISO 50001 adopters report major gains|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/news_index/news_archive/news.htm?refid=Ref1618|publisher=ISO|accessdate=30 Oct 2012|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, Delta Electronics, a provider of power and thermal management solutions, reported reducing power consumption by 10.51 million kWh as compared to the same period in 2010. This is equivalent to a reduction of 10.2 thousand tons of carbon emissions and a saving of CNY 8 million ($1.2m).

In India, the [[Dahanu Thermal Power Station]] in [[Maharashtra]] expected to accrue annual savings of about INR 96.4 million ($1.7m) from raised energy efficiency and management.

In Austria, the municipality of [[Bad Eisenkappel]], with 2,400 inhabitants, expected its consumption of energy to be reduced by nearly 25 per cent, with the main savings achieved by updating the waste water plant and reducing energy consumption by 86 000 kWh, equivalent to €16,000 ($20.7k).

[[BSI Group]] published a case study showing that [[Sheffield Hallam University]] in the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 11 per cent once it was certified to ISO 50001. This yielded annual savings of over £100,000 ($160.7k).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University reduces carbon emissions  by 11 percent and total energy savings by £10,000 per month|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/Documents/case-studies/certification/BSI-ISO50001-Sheffield-Hallam-University-Case-Study-UK-EN.pdf|publisher=BSI|accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In December 2013, the UK [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] became the first Central Government department to achieve certification against the requirements of ISO 50001, leading by example with the belief that structured energy management will lead to substantial energy reductions and thus mitigate the effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the UK flagship office for protecting the UK's energy resources show its commitment to managing the use  of energy efficiently and effectively within its own buildings? |url=http://www.digitalenergy.org.uk/downloads/casestudy(new)deccwhitehall-104127.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO has stated that it believes in due course the standard could influence up to 60 per cent of the world’s energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Win the energy challenge with ISO 50001|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_50001_energy.pdf|publisher=ISO|accessdate=30 Oct 2012|page=1|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ISO 50001 and ISO 14001 ==
ISO 50001 is data driven and focuses on energy performance improvement, while ISO 14001 provides a more qualitative look at all significant environmental impacts of an organization. Both standards can be implemented individually or they can be integrated with each other, or with any other ISO management system standards, such as ISO 9001. 
 
If energy is an organization’s most significant environmental impact, ISO 50001 might be more appropriate than ISO 14001. Many organizations will manage energy successfully via ISO 14001, but especially in organizations where energy is a significant cost, ISO 50001 provides a more specific framework that enables organizations to apply a sharper focus to energy efficiency.

[[File:Ignacio María de Álava y Sáenz de Navarrete, capitán general de la Armada Española.jpg|Ignacio María de Álava|thumb|An 1818 portrait of Admiral Álava by [[Vicente Escobar]], [[Museo Naval de Madrid]]]]
'''Ignacio María de Álava y Sáenz de Navarrete''' (24 October 1750 – 26 May 1817) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] naval officer, present at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

==Naval career==
Álava joined the Spanish navy in 1766. In his early years, he was involved in fighting the pirates of the North African coast (whom the Spanish navy had been fighting for a long time). In 1781, he commanded the corvette ''San Luis'', which took part in the Spanish [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|blockade of Gibraltar]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He took part in an attack on the floating batteries of Gibraltar, and was involved in the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]] on 20 October 1782. Shortly after, he was promoted to ''capitán de navío'' ([[captain (naval)|naval captain]]), and was transferred to the frigate ''Sabina''.

From 1787 to 1790, he was [[flag captain]] in the fleet of Admiral [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Juan de Lángara]]. In 1790, commanding the ''San Francisco de Paula'', he brought relief to the city of [[Oran]], which was besieged by [[Algeria]]n pirates. In 1792 he was promoted to ''brigadier'' ([[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]), and given command of a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] in Lángara's fleet. In 1793 and 1794, Álava took part in the campaigns in the [[Golfe du Lion]], part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. In 1795, Álava, who had been promoted to ''jefe de esquadra'' ([[rear admiral]]) the previous year, was given command of a naval squadron that sailed [[circumnavigation|around the world]] in order to undertake several missions in the Spanish colonies, for example reorganizing the naval forces in the [[Philippines]]. While in the East Indies, he witnessed the British [[Raid on Manila (1798)|raid on Manila]] of 1798 and led the combined squadron at the inconclusive [[Macau Incident (1799)|Macau Incident]] of 1799. He would not return to [[Cadiz]] until 1803. By then he was a ''teniente general'' ([[vice admiral]]).

On 15 February 1805, Álava was appointed second-in-command of the Spanish fleet in Cadiz, under Admiral [[Don Federico Carlos|Gravina]]. When Gravina joined the French Mediterranean fleet under [[Pierre Charles Silvestre de Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] for its voyage to the Caribbean, Álava remained as commander of the ships in Cadiz. On 20 August 1805 Gravina and Villeneuve returned, and Cadiz was blockaded by a [[United Kingdom|British]] fleet under Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]. On 19 October, the combined French and Spanish fleet left Cadiz, with Álava on board of his flagship, the 112-gun ''[[Santa Ana (Spanish ship)|Santa Ana]]''. On 21 October, they met the British fleet and the Battle of Trafalgar ensued.

Alava was severely wounded in the battle, and the ''Santa Ana'' was captured by the British. However, two days later, a squadron jointly under the command of Commodore [[Julien Cosmao|Cosmao-Kerjulien]] and Spanish Commodore [[Enrique MacDonell]] succeeded in recapturing her and getting her back to Cadiz.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ie/books?id=X1xbTYBdw7EC&amp;pg=PT297&amp;lpg=PT297&amp;dq=enrique+macdonnell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kHRwUdK9bE&amp;sig=8yUn7iVHlTCWjbdrkBDh0xBkfAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiskavSsqHSAhULIsAKHYOyBLwQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=enrique%20macdonnell&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; After Gravina died of the wounds he had received in the battle, Álava became the commander of the remaining ships in Cadiz. In May 1808, Álava defected to [[Sevilla]], where a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|junta]] had formed to oppose the French. After Cadiz had been recaptured by the Spanish, Álava once again became commander of the naval squadron based there. In 1810, Álava became Commander-in-Chief in the Caribbean, based in [[Havana]]. He returned to Cadiz in 1813, as its governor. In 1814 he became a member of the Supreme Council of the Spanish Admiralty, and on 24 February 1817 he became [[Admiral]] of the Spanish Fleet. He died after only three months in this position.

'''In vitro fertilisation''' ('''IVF''') is a process of [[fertilisation]] where an [[ovum|egg]] is combined with [[spermatozoon|sperm]] outside the body, [[in vitro]] ("in glass"). The process involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's ovulatory process, removing an [[ovum]] or ova (egg or eggs) from the woman's [[ovary|ovaries]] and letting sperm fertilise them in a liquid in a laboratory. After the fertilised egg ([[zygote]]) undergoes [[embryo culture]] for 2–6 days, it is implanted in the same or another woman's [[uterus]], with the intention of establishing a successful [[pregnancy]].

IVF is a type of [[assisted reproductive technology]] used for [[infertility]] treatment and [[gestational surrogacy]]. A fertilised egg may be implanted into a surrogate's uterus, and the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate. Some countries banned or otherwise regulate the availability of IVF treatment, giving rise to [[fertility tourism]]. Restrictions on the availability of IVF include costs and age, in order for a woman to carry a healthy pregnancy to term. IVF is generally not used until less invasive or expensive options have failed or been determined unlikely to work.

In 1978 [[Louise Brown]] was the first child successfully born after her mother received IVF treatment. Brown was born as a result of natural-cycle IVF, where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in [[Royton]], Oldham, England. [[Robert G. Edwards]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2010. The physiologist co-developed the treatment together with [[Patrick Steptoe]] and embryologist [[Jean Purdy]] but the latter two were not eligible for consideration as they had died and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.&lt;ref name="Moreton"&gt;{{cite news | title = World's first test-tube baby Louise Brown has a child of her own | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/worlds-first-testtube-baby-louise-brown-has-a-child-of-her-own-432080.html | publisher = ''Independent'' | accessdate = 21 May 2010 | quote = The 28-year-old, whose pioneering conception by in-vitro fertilisation made her famous around the world.

With [[egg donation]] and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have reached [[menopause]], can still become pregnant. [[Adriana Iliescu]] held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006. After the IVF treatment, some couples get pregnant without any fertility treatments.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{Cite news|title = After IVF, some couples get pregnant without help|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/us-after-ivf-pregnant-idUSBRE84212L20120503|newspaper = Reuters|date = 3 May 2012|access-date = 5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was estimated that five million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques.&lt;ref name="Adamson S42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamson|first=G.D.|last2=Tabangin|first2=M.|last3=Macaluso|first3=M.|last4=Mouzon|first4=J. de|title=The number of babies born globally after treatment with the assisted reproductive technologies (ART)|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213025867|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.07.1807|pages=S42|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
The term "In Vitro Fertilization" is derived from the Latin words "In Vitro" and the English word "Fertilization". In vitro fertilization is the scientific practice of fusing the male and female [[gamete]]sto form a zygote. Therefore, the term refers to the medical practice of fusing the male sperm and female ova in a controlled environment such as a petri dish, test tube or a laboratory beaker. However, advances in technology have made it easier to use the [[petri dish]]es.

The Latin term is relevant to the concept of fertilization as it was initially used to denote biological experiments in which physical tissues were cultivated outside the living organisms which they were extracted from. Hence, the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) concept involves the performing of ovum and sperm fusion outside the female body.

[[Insemination|In Vivo Fertilization]] is the antonym of the term as it is performed by introducing a sperm cell directly to the egg in the uterus.

In a broader sense, the IVF is a form of [[Assisted reproductive technology|Assisted Reproductive Technology]] (ART) for individuals grappling with infertility. The first step is to extract the ova from the ovaries which are done using [[Transvaginal oocyte retrieval|the transvaginal oocyte retrieval method]]. On the male perspective, semen is extracted in three ways. Firstly, there is the ejaculation through self-stimulation that is effortless for most men. This can be done at home under hygiene conditions. The semen is then deposited directly to a sterilized container. Secondly, there is the Testicular Sperm Extraction method (TESA). This is for men whose semen contain extreme low spermatozoa. Lastly, there is sperm donation method. The semen is usually obtained on the same day as the harvesting of ova.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/00269753.pdf|title=In Vitro Fertilization Second Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IVF biological procedure is more than just the collection of sperms and ova. The first process is to stimulate the ovaries to release the eggs to the follicles. This process is however not necessary in selected cases as the woman can be in the ideal period. In this case, minimal stimulation is undertaken. Secondly, the embryologist assesses the status of the egg. This practice is followed by incubation to keep the egg alive. Meanwhile, the semen is sorted to retrieve healthy sperms. Thirdly, the IVF process entails controlling of the environment in which the specimens are kept to encourage growth, development, and maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brownfertility.com/treatments/ivf/|title=What Is IVF {{!}} Treatments {{!}} Brown Fertility, Jacksonville and Orlando FL|website=www.brownfertility.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IVF procedure also involves the scientific process of embryo culture. In this stage, the sperm is introduced to the egg and fertilization occurs in the culture dish. The duration can range from two to five days. Lastly, the embryo is implanted into the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.corning.com/media/worldwide/cls/documents/sellsheets/IVF_illustrations.pdf|title=IVF Steps Illustrated Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IVF administration is painless and no sedatives are required. The ultimate success of the ART is dependent on the good quality of sperm and ova, medical condition of donors, and the health status of both the male and female patients.

==Medical uses==
{{see|Infertility}}
IVF may be used to overcome [[female infertility]] when it is due to problems with the [[fallopian tube]]s, making in vivo fertilisation difficult. It can also assist in [[male infertility]], in those cases where there is a defect in [[sperm quality]]; in such situations [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) may be used, where a sperm cell is injected directly into the egg cell. This is used when sperm has difficulty penetrating the egg. In  these cases the partner's or a donor's sperm may be used. ICSI is also used when sperm numbers are very low. When indicated, the use of ICSI has been found to increase the success rates of IVF.&lt;ref name=NICE2013/&gt;

According to UK's {{abbrlink|NICE|National Institute for Health and Care Excellence}} guidelines, IVF treatment is appropriate in cases of unexplained infertility for women who have not conceived after 2 years of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=NICE2013&gt;[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems]. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]] ;– Issued: February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success rates===
IVF success rates are the percentage of all IVF procedures that result in a favourable outcome. Depending on the type of calculation used, this outcome may represent the number of confirmed pregnancies, called the [[pregnancy rate]], or the number of live births, called the [[live birth rate]]. The success rate depends on variable factors such as maternal age, cause of infertility, embryo status, reproductive history, and lifestyle factors.

Maternal age: Younger candidates of IVF are more likely to get pregnant. Women older than 41 are more likely to get pregnant with a donor egg.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = In vitro fertilization (IVF) Results - Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/basics/results/prc-20018905|website = www.mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive history: Women who have been previously pregnant are in many cases more successful with IVF treatments than those who have never been pregnant.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.org"/&gt;

Due to advances in reproductive technology, IVF success rates are substantially higher today than they were just a few years ago.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- Meaning? And range from what to what? --&gt;

====Live birth rate====
The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live birth. This rate does not include [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]];  multiple-order births, such as twins and triplets, are counted as one pregnancy. A 2012 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine which reports the average IVF success rates in the United States per age group using non-donor eggs compiled the following data:&lt;ref name="2012 Clinic Summary Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Clinic Summary Report|url=https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|work=Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| Live birth rate || 40.7 || 31.3 || 22.2 || 11.8 || 3.9
|}

In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%.&lt;ref name=canadians/&gt; Birth rates in younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those 21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated. Success rates for older patients were also lower and decrease with age, with 37-year-olds at 27.4% and no live births for those older than 48, the oldest group evaluated.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/art/ART2006/section1.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331150713/http://www.cdc.gov/art/ART2006/section1.htm|archivedate=31 March 2009|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|title=2006 Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Report: Section 2|accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some clinics exceeded these rates, but it is impossible to determine if that is due to superior technique or patient selection, because it is possible to artificially increase success rates by refusing to accept the most difficult patients or by steering them into oocyte donation cycles (which are compiled separately). Further, pregnancy rates can be increased by the placement of several embryos at the risk of increasing the chance for multiples.

The live birth rates using donor eggs are also given by the SART and include all age groups using either fresh or thawed eggs.&lt;ref name="2009 Clinic Summary Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Clinic Summary Report|url=https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|work=Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Fresh donor egg embryos !! Thawed donor egg embryos
|-
| Live birth rate || 55.1 || 33.8
|}

Because not each IVF cycle that is started will lead to oocyte retrieval or embryo transfer, reports of live birth rates need to specify the denominator, namely IVF cycles started, IVF retrievals, or embryo transfers. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) summarised 2008-9 success rates for US clinics for fresh embryo cycles that did not involve donor eggs and gave live birth rates by the age of the prospective mother, with a peak at 41.3% per cycle started and 47.3% per embryo transfer for patients under 35 years of age.

IVF attempts in multiple cycles result in increased cumulative live birth rates. Depending on the demographic group, one study reported 45% to 53% for three attempts, and 51% to 71% to 80% for six attempts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99654924 Study: Sixth Time May Be Charm For In Vitro] by Patti Neighmond. ''Day to Day'', National Public Radio. 21 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy rate====
Pregnancy rate may be defined in various ways. In the United States, the pregnancy rate used by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and the Centers for Disease Control (and appearing in the table in the Success Rates section above) are based on fetal heart motion observed in ultrasound examinations.

The 2009 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine included the following data for the United States:&lt;ref name="2009 Clinic Summary Report"/&gt;

|}

In 2006, Canadian clinics reported an average pregnancy rate of 35%.&lt;ref name=canadians&gt;Branswell, Helen (15 December 2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090318062752/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081215.wivf1215/BNStory/National/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20081215.wivf1215 Success rate climbs for in vitro fertilization]. The Canadian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A French study estimated that 66% of patients starting IVF treatment finally succeed in having a child (40% during the IVF treatment at the centre and 26% after IVF discontinuation). Achievement of having a child after IVF discontinuation was mainly due to [[adoption]] (46%) or [[spontaneous pregnancy]] (42%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de La Rochebrochard E, Quelen C, Peikrishvili R, Guibert J, Bouyer J | title = Long-term outcome of parenthood project during in vitro fertilization and after discontinuation of unsuccessful in vitro fertilization | journal = Fertil.

====Predictors of success====
The main potential factors that influence pregnancy (and live birth) rates in IVF have been suggested to be [[maternal age]], duration of infertility or subfertility, [[basal FSH|bFSH]] and number of oocytes, all reflecting [[Ovary#Function|ovarian function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Loendersloot LL, van Wely M, Limpens J, Bossuyt PM, Repping S, van der Veen F | title = Predictive factors in in vitro fertilization (IVF): a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 577–589 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20581128 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal woman's age is 23–39 years at time of treatment.&lt;ref name=nice/&gt;

A 2013 [[systematic review|review]] and [[metaanalysis]] of [[randomised controlled trial]]s of [[acupuncture]] as an [[adjuvant therapy]] in IVF found no overall benefit, and concluded that an apparent benefit detected in a subset of published trials where the control group (those not using acupuncture) experienced a lower than average rate of pregnancy requires further study, due to the possibility of [[publication bias]] and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manheimer E, van der Windt D, Cheng K, Stafford K, Liu J, Tierney J, Lao L, Berman BM, Langenberg P, Bouter LM | title = The effects of acupuncture on rates of clinical pregnancy among women undergoing in vitro fertilization: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 696–713 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23814102 | pmc = 3796945 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==

===Multiple births===
The major complication of IVF is the risk of [[multiple birth]]s. This is directly related to the practice of transferring multiple embryos at embryo transfer. Multiple births are related to increased risk of pregnancy loss, [[obstetrical complications]], [[preterm birth|prematurity]], and neonatal morbidity with the potential for long term damage. Strict limits on the number of embryos that may be transferred have been enacted in some countries (e.g. Britain, Belgium) to reduce the risk of high-order multiples (triplets or more), but are not universally followed or accepted. Spontaneous splitting of embryos in the womb after transfer can occur, but this is rare and would lead to identical twins. A double blind, randomised study followed IVF pregnancies that resulted in 73 infants (33 boys and 40 girls) and reported that 8.7% of singleton infants and 54.2% of twins had a birth weight of &lt; {{convert|2500|g|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olivennes F, Mannaerts B, Struijs M, Bonduelle M, Devroey P | title = Perinatal outcome of pregnancy after GnRH antagonist (ganirelix) treatment during ovarian stimulation for conventional IVF or ICSI: a preliminary report | journal = Hum. Reprod. | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 1588–91 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11473947 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/16.8.1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence also suggest that singleton offspring after IVF is at higher risk for lower birth weight for unknown reasons.

===Sex ratio distortions===

Certain kinds of IVF, in particular [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] (first applied in 1991) and [[blastocyst transfer]] (first applied in 1984) have been shown to lead to distortions in the [[sex ratio]] at birth. ICSI leads to slightly more female births (51.3% female) while blastocyst transfer leads to significantly more boys (56.1% male) being born. Standard IVF done at the second or third day leads to a normal sex ratio.

Epigenetic modifications caused by extended culture leading to the death of more female embryos has been theorised as the reason why blastocyst transfer leads to a higher male sex ratio, however adding retinoic acid to the culture can bring this ratio back to normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/12/3197.abstract | doi=10.1073/pnas.1523538113| pmid=26951653| pmc=4812732| title=Impaired imprinted X chromosome inactivation is responsible for the skewed sex ratio following in vitro fertilization| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=113| issue=12| pages=3197–3202| year=2016| last1=Tan| first1=Kun| last2=An| first2=Lei| last3=Miao| first3=Kai| last4=Ren| first4=Likun| last5=Hou| first5=Zhuocheng| last6=Tao| first6=Li| last7=Zhang| first7=Zhenni| last8=Wang| first8=Xiaodong| last9=Xia| first9=Wei| last10=Liu| first10=Jinghao| last11=Wang| first11=Zhuqing| last12=Xi| first12=Guangyin| last13=Gao| first13=Shuai| last14=Sui| first14=Linlin| last15=Zhu| first15=De-Sheng| last16=Wang| first16=Shumin| last17=Wu| first17=Zhonghong| last18=Bach| first18=Ingolf| last19=Chen| first19=Dong-bao| last20=Tian| first20=Jianhui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread of infectious disease===
By [[sperm washing]], the risk that a chronic disease in the male providing the sperm would infect the female or offspring can be brought to negligible levels.

In males with [[hepatitis B]], The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine advises that sperm washing is not necessary in IVF to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hepatitis and reproduction | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 90 | issue = 5 | pages = S226–S235 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19007636 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.08.040 | author1 = Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lutgens2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lutgens SP, Nelissen EC, van Loo IH, Koek GH, Derhaag JG, Dunselman GA | title = To do or not to do: IVF and ICSI in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 24 | issue = 11 | pages = 2676–2678 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19625309 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dep258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In females with hepatitis B, the risk of [[vertical transmission]] during IVF is no different from the risk in spontaneous conception.&lt;ref name=Lutgens2009/&gt; However, there is not enough evidence to say that [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring.&lt;ref name=Lutgens2009/&gt;

Regarding potential spread of [[HIV/AIDS]], Japan's government prohibited the use of IVF procedures for couples in which both partners are infected with HIV. Despite the fact that the ethics committees previously allowed the [[Ogikubo, Tokyo]] Hospital, located in Tokyo, to use IVF for couples with HIV, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] of Japan decided to block the practice. Hideji Hanabusa, the vice president of the Ogikubo Hospital, states that together with his colleagues, he managed to develop a method through which scientists are able to remove HIV from sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/japan-bans-in-vitro-fertilization-for-hiv-couples.html |title=Japan Bans in Vitro Fertilisation for HIV Couples |publisher=Infoniac.com |date=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other risks to the egg provider/retriever===
A risk of ovarian stimulation is the development of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]], particularly if hCG is used for [[Final maturation (IVF)|inducing final oocyte maturation]]. This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.

During egg retrieval, there exists a small chance of bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures like bowel and bladder (transvaginal ultrasound aspiration) as well as difficulty in breathing, chest infection, allergic reactions to medication, or nerve damage (laproscopy).

[[Ectopic pregnancy]] may also occur if a fertilised egg develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes and requires immediate destruction of the fetus.

===Birth defects===
A review in 2013 came to the result that infants resulting from IVF (with or without ICSI) have a [[relative risk]] of birth defects of 1.32 (95% [[confidence interval]] 1.24–1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants.&lt;ref name="pmid23449641"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hansen M, Kurinczuk JJ, Milne E, de Klerk N, Bower C | title = Assisted reproductive technology and birth defects: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Hum.

The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk itself in the absence of any treatment (odds ratio 1.29), consistent with a Danish national registry study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhu JL, Basso O, Obel C, Bille C, Olsen J | title = Infertility, infertility treatment, and congenital malformations: Danish national birth cohort | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 333 | issue = 7570 | page = 679 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16893903 | pmc = 1584372 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38919.495718.AE }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "...implicates patient factors in this increased risk."

IVF, including [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]], is associated with an increased risk of [[imprinting disorder]]s (including [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] and [[Angelman syndrome]]), with an [[odds ratio]] of 3.7 (95% [[confidence interval]] 1.4 to 9.7).&lt;ref name="LazaraviciuteKauser2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazaraviciute|first1=G.|last2=Kauser|first2=M.|last3=Bhattacharya|first3=S.|last4=Haggarty|first4=P.|last5=Bhattacharya|first5=S.|title=A systematic review and meta-analysis of DNA methylation levels and imprinting disorders in children conceived by IVF/ICSI compared with children conceived spontaneously|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=20|issue=6|year=2014|pages=840–852|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu033|pmid=24961233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
[[File:IVF.jpg|thumb|412x412px|A depiction of the procedure of in-vitro fertilisation.]]
Theoretically, IVF could be performed by collecting the contents from a woman's fallopian tubes or uterus after natural ovulation, mixing it with [[sperm]], and reinserting the fertilised ova into the uterus. However, without additional techniques, the chances of pregnancy would be extremely small. The additional techniques that are routinely used in IVF include [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] to generate multiple eggs, ultrasound-guided [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]] directly from the ovaries, co-incubation of eggs and sperm, as well as culture and selection of resultant embryos before [[embryo transfer]] into a uterus.

===Ovarian hyperstimulation===
{{Main|Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation}}
Ovarian hyperstimulation is the stimulation to induce development of multiple follicles of the ovaries. It should start with response prediction by e.g. age, [[antral follicle count]] and level of [[anti-Müllerian hormone]].&lt;ref name=LaMarca2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=La Marca A, Sunkara SK | title = Individualization of controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF using ovarian reserve markers: from theory to practice | journal = Hum. Reprod. Update | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 124–40 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24077980 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting prediction of e.g. poor or hyper-response to ovarian hyperstimulation determines the protocol and dosage for ovarian hyperstimulation.&lt;ref name=LaMarca2013/&gt;

Ovarian hyperstimulation also includes suppression of spontaneous ovulation, for which two main methods are available: Using a (usually longer) [[GnRH agonist]] protocol or a (usually shorter) [[GnRH antagonist]] protocol.&lt;ref name=LaMarca2013/&gt; In a standard long GnRH agonist protocol the day when hyperstimulation treatment is started and the expected day of later oocyte retrieval can be chosen to conform to personal choice, while in a GnRH antagonist protocol it must be adapted to the spontaneous onset of the previous menstruation. On the other hand, the GnRH antagonist protocol has a lower risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS), which is a life-threatening complication.&lt;ref name=LaMarca2013/&gt;

For the ovarian hyperstimulation in itself, injectable [[gonadotropin]]s (usually [[Follicle stimulating hormone|FSH]] analogues) are generally used under close monitoring. Such monitoring frequently checks the [[estradiol]] level and, by means of [[gynecologic ultrasonography]], follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of injections will be necessary.

===Natural IVF===
{{Main|Natural cycle in vitro fertilisation}}
There are several methods termed ''natural cycle IVF'':&lt;ref name="Allersma2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allersma T, Farquhar C, Cantineau AE | title = Natural cycle in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for subfertile couples | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 8 | issue = 8| pages = CD010550 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23990351 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* IVF using no drugs for [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]], while drugs for [[ovulation suppression]] may still be used.
* IVF using ovarian hyperstimulation, including gonadotropins, but with a [[GnRH antagonist]] protocol so that the cycle initiates from natural mechanisms.
* [[Frozen embryo transfer]]; IVF using [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]], followed by [[embryo cryopreservation]], followed by [[embryo transfer]] in a later, natural, cycle.&lt;ref name="EvansHannan2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=J.|last2=Hannan|first2=N.

IVF using no drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation was the method for the conception of [[Louise Brown]]. This method can be successfully used when women want to avoid taking ovarian stimulating drugs with its associated side-effects. [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority|HFEA]] has estimated the [[live birth rate]] to be approximately 1.3% per IVF cycle using no hyperstimulation drugs for women aged between 40–42.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfea.gov.uk/natural-cycle-ivf.html Natural cycle IVF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512083412/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/natural-cycle-ivf.html |date=12 May 2012 }} at the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] homepage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mild IVF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nargund G | title = Natural/mild assisted reproductive technologies: Reducing cost and increasing safety | journal = Women's Health | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 359–360 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19586428 | pmc =  | doi = 10.2217/whe.09.32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method where a small dose of ovarian stimulating drugs are used for a short duration during a woman's natural cycle aimed at producing 2–7 eggs and creating healthy embryos. This method appears to be an advance in the field to reduce complications and side-effects for women and it is aimed at quality, and not quantity of eggs and embryos. One study comparing a mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with GnRH antagonist co-treatment combined with [[single embryo transfer]]) to a standard treatment (stimulation with a [[GnRH agonist]] long-protocol and transfer of two embryos) came to the result that the proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term [[Live birth (human)|live birth]] after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid17336650"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heijnen EM, Eijkemans MJ, De Klerk C, Polinder S, Beckers NG, Klinkert ER, Broekmans FJ, Passchier J, Te Velde ER, Macklon NS, Fauser BC | title = A mild treatment strategy for in-vitro fertilisation: a randomised non-inferiority trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9563 | pages = 743–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17336650 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60360-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mild IVF can be cheaper than conventional IVF and with a significantly reduced risk of [[multiple birth|multiple gestation]] and [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome|OHSS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fauser BC, Nargund G, Andersen AN, Norman R, Tarlatzis B, Boivin J, Ledger W | title = Mild ovarian stimulation for IVF: 10 years later | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 2678–2684 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20858698 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deq247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final maturation induction===
{{Further|Final maturation induction}}
When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development, [[Final maturation induction|induction of final oocyte maturation]] is performed, generally by an injection of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the "trigger shot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infertility.about.com/od/infertilitytreatments/ss/ivf_treatment_5.htm |title=IVF Treatment Step Four: Final Oocyte|publisher=Infertility.about.com |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; hCG acts as an analogue of [[luteinising hormone]], and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473515 HCG Injection After Ovulation Induction With Clomiphene Citrate] at Medscape. By Peter Kovacs. Posted: 23 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]]. Using a [[GnRH agonist]] instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a reduced delivery rate if the embryos are transferred fresh.&lt;ref name=Humaidan2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Humaidan P, Kol S, Papanikolaou EG | title = GnRH agonist for triggering of final oocyte maturation: time for a change of practice? | journal = Hum. Reprod. Update | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 510–524 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21450755 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr008 | author4 = Copenhagen GnRH Agonist Triggering Workshop Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or embryos following agonist trigger.

===Egg retrieval===
{{Further|Transvaginal oocyte retrieval}}
The eggs are retrieved from the patient using a transvaginal technique called [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]], involving an ultrasound-guided needle piercing the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries. Through this needle follicles can be aspirated, and the follicular fluid is passed to an embryologist to identify ova. It is common to remove between ten and thirty eggs. The retrieval procedure usually takes between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the number of mature follicles, and is usually done under [[conscious sedation]] or [[general anaesthesia]].

===Egg and sperm preparation===
In the laboratory, the identified eggs are stripped of surrounding cells and prepared for [[fertilisation]]. An [[oocyte selection]] may be performed prior to fertilisation to select eggs with optimal chances of successful pregnancy. In the meantime, [[semen]] is prepared for fertilisation by removing inactive cells and seminal fluid in a process called [[sperm washing]]. If semen is being provided by a [[sperm donor]], it will usually have been prepared for treatment before being frozen and quarantined, and it will be thawed ready for use.

===Co-incubation===
The sperm and the egg are incubated together at a ratio of about 75,000:1 in a [[culture media]] in order for the actual [[Human fertilization|fertilisation]] to take place. A review in 2013 came to the result that a duration of this co-incubation of about 1 to 4 hours results in significantly higher [[pregnancy rate]]s than 16 to 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang XD, Liu JX, Liu WW, Gao Y, Han W, Xiong S, Wu LH, Huang GN | title = Time of insemination culture and outcomes of in vitro fertilization: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 685–695 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23912477 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the egg will be fertilised during co-incubation and will show two [[pronuclei]]. In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells.

In [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]], eggs are removed from the woman and placed in one of the fallopian tubes, along with the man's sperm. This allows fertilisation to take place inside the woman's body. Therefore, this variation is actually an in vivo fertilisation, not in vitro.

===Embryo culture===
{{Main|Embryo culture}}
The main durations of embryo culture are until [[human embryogenesis|cleavage stage]] (day two to four after [[co-incubation]]) or the [[blastocyst]] stage (day five or six after [[co-incubation]]).&lt;ref name="DarLazer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dar S, Lazer T, Shah PS, Librach CL | title = Neonatal outcomes among singleton births after blastocyst versus cleavage stage embryo transfer: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Hum.

===Embryo selection===
{{Further|Embryo quality}}
Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge ovocyte and [[embryo]] quality. In order to optimise [[pregnancy rate]]s, there is significant evidence that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of embryos.&lt;ref name=Rebmann&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rebmann V, Switala M, Eue I, Grosse-Wilde H | title = Soluble HLA-G is an independent factor for the prediction of pregnancy outcome after ART: a German multi-centre study | journal = Hum Reprod | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 1691–8 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20488801 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deq120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 where the first [[time-lapse microscopy]] system for IVF was approved for clinical use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unisense FertiliTech A/S Receives CE Mark of Approval for EmbryoScope(TM) Embryo Monitoring System | url=http://www.medindia.net/health-press-release/Unisense-FertiliTech-AS-Receives-CE-Mark-of-Approval-for-EmbryoScopeTM-Embryo-Monitoring-System-47803-1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; morphokinetic scoring systems has shown to improve to [[pregnancy rate]]s further.&lt;ref name="Meseguer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meseguer M, Rubio I, Cruz M, Basile N, Marcos J, Requena A | title = Embryo incubation and selection in a time-lapse monitoring system improves pregnancy outcome compared with a standard incubator: A retrospective cohort study | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 98 | issue = 6 | pages = 1481–1489.e10 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22975113 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.08.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when all different types of [[time-lapse embryo imaging]] devices, with or without morphokinetic scoring systems, are compared against conventional embryo assessment for IVF, there is insufficient evidence of a difference in live-birth, pregnancy, stillbirth or miscarriage to choose between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Time-lapse systems for embryo incubation and assessment in assisted reproduction|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 1 January 2015|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 25721906|pages = CD011320|volume = 2|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011320.pub2|first = Sarah|last = Armstrong|first2 = Nicola|last2 = Arroll|first3 = Lynsey M.|last3 = Cree|first4 = Vanessa|last4 = Jordan|first5 = Cindy|last5 = Farquhar}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800485|date = July 2018}}

===Embryo transfer===
{{Main|Embryo transfer}}
The number to be transferred depends on the number available, the age of the woman and other health and diagnostic factors. In countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are transferred except in unusual circumstances. In the UK and according to [[HFEA]] regulations, a woman over 40 may have up to three embryos transferred, whereas in the US, there is no legal limit on the number of embryos which may be transferred, although medical associations have provided practice guidelines. Most clinics and country regulatory bodies seek to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, as it is not uncommon for multiple embryos to implant if multiple embryos are transferred. Embryos are transferred to the patient's uterus through a thin, plastic [[catheter]], which goes through her [[vagina]] and cervix. Several embryos may be passed into the uterus to improve chances of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and pregnancy.

===Adjunctive medication===
[[Luteal support]] is the administration of medication, generally [[progesterone]], [[progestin]]s, hCG, or [[GnRH agonist]]s, and often accompanied by estradiol, to increase the success rate of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and early [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], thereby complementing and/or supporting the function of the [[corpus luteum]]. A Cochrane review found that hCG or progesterone given during the luteal phase may be associated with higher rates of [[Live birth rate|live birth]] or ongoing pregnancy, but that the evidence is not conclusive.&lt;ref name="van-der-Linden2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=2015|title=Luteal phase support for assisted reproduction cycles|url=|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=|issue=7|pages=CD009154|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009154.pub3|pmid=26148507|via=|vauthors=van der Linden M, Buckingham K, Farquhar C, Kremer JA, Metwally M|hdl=2066/98072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-treatment with [[GnRH agonist]]s appears to improve outcomes,&lt;ref name=van-der-Linden2011/&gt; by a live birth rate [[risk difference|RD]] of +16% (95% [[confidence interval]] +10 to +22%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyrou D, Kolibianakis EM, Fatemi HM, Tarlatzi TB, Devroey P, Tarlatzis BC | title = Increased live birth rates with GnRH agonist addition for luteal support in ICSI/IVF cycles: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 734–740 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21733980 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[growth hormone]] or [[aspirin]] as adjunctive medication in IVF have no evidence of overall benefit.&lt;ref name=Farquhar2013/&gt;

==Expansions==
There are various expansions or additional techniques that can be applied in IVF, which are usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly performing methods of IVF.

===Preimplantation genetic screening or diagnosis===
{{Main|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}
[[Preimplantation genetic screening]] (PGS) or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been suggested to be able to be used in IVF to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing [[randomised controlled trial]]s came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy as measured by [[live birth rate]].&lt;ref name=Mastenbroek2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mastenbroek S, Twisk M, van der Veen F, Repping S | title = Preimplantation genetic screening: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 454–466 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21531751 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, for women of [[advanced maternal age]], PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly lowers the live birth rate.&lt;ref name=Mastenbroek2011/&gt; Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]] are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.&lt;ref name=Mastenbroek2011/&gt;

Still, as an expansion of IVF, patients who can benefit from PGS/PGD include:
* Couples who have a family history of inherited disease
* Couples who want [[prenatal sex discernment]]. This can be used to diagnose [[monogenic disorders]] with [[sex linkage]]. It can potentially be used for [[sex selection]], wherein a fetus is aborted if having an undesired sex.
* Couples who already have a child with an incurable disease and need compatible cells from a second healthy child to cure the first, resulting in a "[[saviour sibling]]" that matches the sick child in [[HLA type]].&lt;ref&gt;Britten, Nick (2011) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8499394/Saviour-sibling-cures-sick-older-brother.html Saviour Sibling Cures Sick Older Brother] The Daily Telegraph, Health News, 7 May 2011. Retrieved 8 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

PGS screens for numeral chromosomal abnormalities while PGD diagnosis the specific molecular defect of the inherited disease. In both PGS and PGD, individual cells from a pre-embryo, or preferably trophectoderm cells biopsied from a [[blastocyst]], are analysed during the IVF process. Before the transfer of a pre-embryo back to a woman's uterus, one or two cells are removed from the pre-embryos (8-cell stage), or preferably from a [[blastocyst]]. These cells are then evaluated for normality. Typically within one to two days, following completion of the evaluation, only the normal pre-embryos are transferred back to the woman's uterus.  Alternatively, a blastocyst can be cryopreserved via vitrification and transferred at a later date to the uterus.  In addition, PGS can significantly reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies because fewer embryos, ideally just one, are needed for implantation.

===Cryopreservation===
{{Main|Oocyte cryopreservation|Embryo cryopreservation}}
[[Cryopreservation]] can be performed as [[oocyte cryopreservation]] before fertilisation, or as [[embryo cryopreservation]] after fertilisation.

The Rand Consulting Group has estimated there to be 400,000 frozen embryos in the United States in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/souls_on_ice.html |title=Souls On Ice: America's Embryo Glut and the Wasted Promise of Stem Cell Research|publisher=Motherjones.com |date=July–August 2006|author=Mundy, Liza }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage is that patients who fail to conceive may become pregnant using such embryos without having to go through a full IVF cycle. Or, if pregnancy occurred, they could return later for another pregnancy.  Spare oocytes or embryos resulting from fertility treatments may be used for [[oocyte donation]] or [[embryo donation]] to another woman or couple, and embryos may be created, frozen and stored specifically for transfer and donation by using donor eggs and sperm. Also, oocyte cryopreservation can be used for women who are likely to lose their ovarian reserve due to undergoing [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porcu E, Fabbri R, Damiano G, Fratto R, Giunchi S, Venturoli S | title = Oocyte cryopreservation in oncological patients | journal = Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol | volume = 113 Suppl 1 | pages = S14–6 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15041124 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2003.11.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, many centers have adopted embryo cryopreservation as their primary IVF therapy, and perform few or no fresh embryo transfers.  The two main reasons for this have been better endometrial receptivity when embryos are transferred in cycles without exposure to ovarian stimulation and also the ability to store the embryos while awaiting the results of pre-implantation genetic testing.

The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521111033/http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.cfm |archivedate=21 May 2009 |title=Genetics &amp; IVF Institute |publisher=Givf.com |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other expansions===
* [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (''ICSI'') is where a single [[spermatozoon|sperm]] is injected directly into an [[ovum|egg]]. Its main usage as an expansion of IVF is to overcome male infertility problems, although it may also be used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in conjunction with [[sperm donation]]. It can be used in [[teratozoospermia]], since once the egg is fertilised abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence [[blastocyst]] development or blastocyst morphology.&lt;ref name=french&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=French DB, Sabanegh ES, Goldfarb J, Desai N | title = Does severe teratozoospermia affect blastocyst formation, live birth rate, and other clinical outcome parameters in ICSI cycles? | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 1097–1103 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19200957 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytoplasmic transfer was created to aid women who experience infertility due to deficient or damaged [[mitochondria]], contained within an egg's [[cytoplasm]].

==Leftover embryos or eggs==
{{Further|Embryo donation|Egg donor}}
There may be leftover embryos or eggs from IVF procedures if the woman for whom they were originally created has successfully carried one or more pregnancies to term. With the woman's or couple's permission, these may be donated to help other women or couples as a means of [[third party reproduction]].

In [[embryo donation]], these extra embryos are given to other couples or women for [[Embryo transfer|transfer]] with the goal of producing a successful pregnancy. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor, the same as occurs with [[egg donor|egg donation]] or [[sperm donation]].

Typically, genetic parents donate the eggs to a [[fertility clinic]] or where they are preserved by [[oocyte cryopreservation]] or [[embryo cryopreservation]] until a carrier is found for them. Typically the process of matching the embryo(s) with the prospective parents is conducted by the agency itself, at which time the clinic transfers ownership of the embryos to the prospective parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://familybuilding.resolve.org/site/PageServer?pagename=lrn_wamo_pd&amp;JServSessionId_form=login&amp;printer_friendly=1 Donor Embryo: Online Guide for Potential Donors&amp;nbsp;– RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association]. Familybuilding.resolve.org. Retrieved on 3 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, women seeking to be an embryo recipient undergo infectious disease screening required by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and reproductive tests to determine the best placement location and cycle timing before the actual Embryo Transfer occurs. The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own [[embryologist]] conduct further testing.

Alternatives to donating unused embryos are destroying them (or having them implanted at a time where pregnancy is very unlikely),&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;Beil, Laura (1 September 2009) [http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/09/01/extra.ivf.embryos/ "What happens to extra embryos after IVF?"] ''CNN''.&lt;/ref&gt; keeping them frozen indefinitely, or donating them for use in research (which results in their unviability).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Douglas T, Savulescu J | year = 2009 | title = Destroying unwanted embryos in research: Talking Point on morality and human embryo research | url = | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 307–312 | doi=10.1038/embor.2009.54| pmid = 19337299 | pmc = 2672894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual moral views on disposing leftover embryos may depend on personal views on the [[beginning of human personhood]] and definition and/or value of [[potential person|potential future persons]] and on the value that is given to fundamental research questions.

==History==
{{Main|History of in vitro fertilisation}}
The first successful birth of a child after IVF treatment, [[Louise Brown]], occurred in 1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in [[Royton]], Oldham, England. [[Robert G. Edwards]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2010, the physiologist who co-developed the treatment together with [[Patrick Steptoe]] and embryologist [[Jean Purdy]]; Steptoe and Purdy were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.&lt;ref name="Moreton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The second successful birth of a test tube baby occurred in [[India]] just 67 days after Louise Brown was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2011/01/the-award-of-th.html Is an "Indian Crab Syndrome" Impeding Indian Science?] ''sciencemag.org''. Retrieved 20 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The girl, named Durga conceived in vitro using a method developed independently by Dr. [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (physician)|Subhash Mukhopadhyay]], a physician and researcher from [[Kolkata]], India.

With [[egg donation]] and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have reached [[menopause]] can still become pregnant. [[Adriana Iliescu]] held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006. After the IVF treatment some couples are able to get pregnant without any fertility treatments.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; In 2012 it was estimated that five million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques.&lt;ref name="Adamson S42"/&gt; {{TOC limit|3}}

==Ethics==

===Mix-ups===
In some cases, laboratory mix-ups (misidentified gametes, transfer of wrong embryos) have occurred, leading to legal action against the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example is the case of a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Ayers C | title=Mother wins $1m for IVF mix-up but may lose son| journal = Timesonline | year=2004 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article465773.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to many authorities and individual clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups.  The [[HFEA]], for example, requires clinics to use a double witnessing system,  the identity of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are transferred. Alternatively, technological solutions are gaining favour, to reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce risks with uniquely numbered [[RFID]] tags which can be identified by readers connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although the use of RFID tracking has expanded in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproductive Clinic Uses RFID to Guarantee Parental Identity|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?3683|author=Swedberg, Claire |date=15 October 2007|work=RFID Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is still not widely adopted. However, In other cases there has been not mix-up of embryos or gametes, but the intentional use of embryos of another couple or gamete donor, without informed consent of parents, both: receptors or donors. Some of these cases are taking a legal and judicial course.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis or screening===
Another concern is that people will screen in or out for particular traits, using [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) or preimplantation genetic screening. For example, a deaf British couple, Tom and Paula Lichy, have petitioned to create a deaf baby using IVF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lawson|first=Dominic|title=Of course a deaf couple want a deaf child|work=The Independent |date=11 March 2008|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-of-course-a-deaf-couple-want-a-deaf-child-794001.html|accessdate=12 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[bioethics|medical ethicists]] have been very critical of this approach. [[Jacob M. Appel]] wrote that "intentionally culling out blind or deaf embryos might prevent considerable future suffering, while a policy that allowed deaf or blind parents to select ''for'' such traits intentionally would be far more troublesome."&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob (12 March 2009). More 'designer' options. ''The Winnipeg Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of decisively altering genes has coined the concept of the [[Designer Baby]]. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections for the future power of PGD in its ability to create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one's life course for predesignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sandel M | year = 2004 | title = The Case Against Perfection | url = | journal = Atlantic Monthly | volume = 293 | issue = 3| pages = 51–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human's genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the gene manipulation lead to worry of toxin production and too much weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ahima RS | year = 2003 | title = Obesity gene therapy: slimming immature rats | url = | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 196–197 | doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3301920}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent some of these issues from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of gene modification to the human embryos in IVF.

===Profit desire of the industry===
Many people do not oppose the IVF practice itself (i.e. the creating of a pregnancy through "artificial" ways) but are highly critical of the current state of the present day industry. Such individuals argue that the industry has now become a multibillion-dollar industry, which is widely unregulated and prone to serious abuses in the desire of practitioners to obtain profit. For instance, in 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets (see [[Suleman octuplets]]). This has made international news, and had led to accusations that many doctors are willing to seriously endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry "corrupt" and "greedy" saying that "One of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry," and that "What has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation "The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/may/31/medicineandhealth.health | location= London | work = The Guardian  | first=Alok | last=Jha | title=Winston: IVF clinics corrupt and greedy | date= 31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVF industry can thus be seen as an example of what social scientists are describing as an increasing trend towards a market-driven construction of health, medicine and the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, J. (2012) Drugs for Life: How Pharmaceutical Companies Define Our Health. Duke University Press: Durham&lt;/ref&gt;

As the science progresses, the industry is further driven by money in that researchers and innovators enter into the fight over patents and intellectual property rights. The [[Copyright Clause]] in the US Constitution protects innovator's rights to their respective work in attempts to promote scientific progress. Essentially, this lawful protection gives incentive to the innovators by providing them a temporary monopoly over their respective work. In the IVF industry, already incredibly expensive for patients, patents risk even higher prices for the patients to receive the procedure as they have to also cover the costs of protected works. For example, company 23andMe has patented a process used to calculate probability of gene inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancesco, L. (2014). [http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n1/full/nbt0114-8.html 23andMe's designer baby patent.] Nature biotechnology, 32(1), 8-8.&lt;/ref&gt; While this innovation could help many, the company retains sole right to administer it and thus does not have economic competition. Lack of economic competition leads to higher prices of products.

The industry has been accused of making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only ''can'' be treated through bio-medical procedures, but ''should'' be treated by them.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, H (May 1986). "IVF: what can we do?" Paper presented to the Liberation or Loss? conference, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11649236"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Warren MA | title = IVF and women's interests: an analysis of feminist concerns | journal = Bioethics | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–57 | year = 1988 | pmid = 11649236 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.1988.tb00034.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr Sami David, a fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of the early days of the IVF treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: "It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort.  Now it's a first resort.  I think that's an injustice to women. I also think it can harm women in the long run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date = 12 August 2009 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/12/earlyshow/health/main5236035.shtml | work=CBS News | title= Is In Vitro Fertilization Being Overused?}}&lt;/ref&gt; IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to 'sell' corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the 'healthy' or 'normal' body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring.

===Pregnancy past menopause===
Although menopause is a natural barrier to further conception, IVF has allowed women to be pregnant in their fifties and sixties. Women whose uteruses have been appropriately prepared receive embryos that originated from an egg of an egg donor. Therefore, although these women do not have a genetic link with the child, they have a physical link through pregnancy and childbirth. In many cases the genetic father of the child is the woman's partner. Even after menopause the uterus is fully capable of carrying out a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parks JA | title = A closer look at reproductive technology and postmenopausal motherhood | journal = CMAJ | volume = 154 | issue = 8 | pages = 1189–91 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8612255 | pmc = 1487687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex couples, single and unmarried parents===
{{See also|Donor conceived person}}
A 2009 statement from the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine|ASRM]] found no persuasive evidence that children are harmed or disadvantaged solely by being raised by single parents, unmarried parents, or homosexual parents. It did not support restricting access to assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of a prospective parent's marital status or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=asrm2009&gt;{{cite journal | author = The Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine | title = Access to fertility treatment by gays, lesbians, and unmarried persons | journal = Fertil.

Ethical concerns include reproductive rights, the welfare of offspring, nondiscrimination against unmarried individuals, homosexual, and professional autonomy.&lt;ref name=asrm2009/&gt;

A recent controversy in California focused on the question of whether physicians opposed to same-sex relationships should be required to perform IVF for a lesbian couple. Guadalupe T. Benitez, a lesbian medical assistant from San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had "religious-based objections to treating her and homosexuals in general to help them conceive children by artificial insemination," and Fenton refused to authorise a refill of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Appel JM | title = May doctors refuse infertility treatments to gay patients? | journal = Hastings Cent Rep | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 20–1 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16898357 | doi = 10.1353/hcr.2006.0053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, M.

IVF is increasingly being used to allow lesbian and other LGBT couples to share in the reproductive process through a technique called [[reciprocal IVF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a17851346/how-lesbian-couples-have-babies/|title=Shared motherhood: The amazing way lesbian couples are having babies|date=2018-02-14|work=Cosmopolitan|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs of one partner are used to create embryos which the other partner carries through pregnancy.

[[Nadya Suleman]] came to international attention after having twelve embryos implanted, eight of which survived, resulting in eight newborns being added to her existing six-child family. The Medical Board of California sought to have fertility doctor Michael Kamrava, who treated Suleman, stripped of his licence. State officials allege that performing Suleman's procedure is evidence of unreasonable judgment, substandard care, and a lack of concern for the eight children she would conceive and the six she was already struggling to raise. On 1 June 2011 the Medical Board issued a ruling that Kamrava's medical licence be revoked effective 1 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/10/25/license_hearing_for_octomom_doctor_resumes_in_la/|author=Mohajer, Shaya Tayefe |title=License hearing for Octomom doctor resumes in LA |agency=Associated Press|date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breuer |first=Howard |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20436389,00.html |title=Octomom's Doctor Tearfully Apologizes, Admits Mistake |work=People |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K., Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and some Australian states, donors are not paid and cannot be anonymous.

In 2000, a website called [[Donor Sibling Registry]] was created to help biological children with a common donor connect with each other.&lt;ref name="IVF donor NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="donor-conceived WP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Donor-conceived children use Internet to find relatives and share information|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/donor-conceived-children-use-internet-to-find-relatives-and-share-information/2011/07/01/gIQA3BiwzK_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post|date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unwanted embryos===

During the [[Embryo selection|selection]] and transfer phases, many embryos may be discarded in favour of others. This selection may be based on criteria such as genetic disorders or the sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifenews.com/2011/09/06/pro-life-concerns-about-ivf-include-abortion-exploitation/ Pro-Life Concerns About IVF Include Abortion, Exploitation]. LifeNews.com (6 September 2011). Retrieved on 3 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest cases of special gene selection through IVF was the case of the Collins family in the 1990s, who selected the sex of their child.&lt;ref&gt;Lemonick, M. D. (1999). [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,17696,00.html/ "Designer Babies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308081926/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,17696,00.html |date=8 March 2016 }} ''Time Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ethic issues remain unresolved as no consensus exists in science, religion, and philosophy on when a human embryo should be recognised as a person. For those who believe that this is at the moment of conception, IVF becomes a moral question when multiple eggs are fertilised, begin development, and only a few are chosen for implantation. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

If IVF were to involve the fertilisation of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then this would not be an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time.  As a result, the couple must decide what to do with these extra embryos. Depending on their view of the embryo's humanity or the chance the couple will want to try to have another child, the couple has multiple options for dealing with these extra embryos. Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in [[stem cell]] research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.

===Religious response===
{{main|Religious response to assisted reproductive technology}}

The [[Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of [[assisted reproductive technology]] and artificial [[contraception]], on the grounds that they separate the procreative goal of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Matrimony|marital sex]] from the goal of uniting married couples.
The Catholic Church permits the use of a small number of reproductive technologies and contraceptive methods like [[natural family planning]], which involves charting ovulation times, and allows other forms of reproductive technologies that allow conception to take place from normative sexual intercourse, such as a fertility lubricant. Pope Benedict XVI had publicly re-emphasised the Catholic Church's opposition to in vitro fertilisation, saying that it replaces love between a husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper=Medical news today |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38686.php |title=Pope Benedict XVI Declares Embryos Developed For In Vitro Fertilization Have Right To Life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229164506/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38686.php |archivedate=29 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church, in accordance with the Catholic understanding of [[Natural law#Contemporary Christian understanding|natural law]], teaches that reproduction has an "inseparable connection" to the sexual union of married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | location = Rome  | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html | title = Humanae Vitae: Encyclical of Pope Paul VI on the Regulation of Birth, sec 12| author = Pope Paul VI | authorlink = Pope Paul VI|date= 25 July 1968|accessdate= 25 November 2008|publisher = Vatican}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the church opposes IVF because it might result in the disposal of embryos; in Catholicism, an embryo is viewed as an individual with a [[soul]] that must be treated as a person.&lt;ref name=medill&gt;[http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=136743 Reconciling religion and infertility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104194217/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=136743 |date=4 November 2013 }} By Alina Dain. 30 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church maintains that it is not objectively evil to be infertile, and advocates adoption as an option for such couples who still wish to have children.&lt;ref name = "catechism"&gt;{{cite web| title = Catechism of the Catholic Church.

[[Hindu]]s welcome IVF as gift for those who are unable to bear children and have declared doctors related to IVF to be conducting [[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]] as there are several characters who were claimed to be born without intercourse, mainly [[Karna]] and five [[Pandava]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Science in hinduism-Test tube babies | url = http://www.mallstuffs.com/Blogs/BlogDetails.aspx?BlogId=333&amp;BlogType=Spiritual&amp;Topic=Science%20in%20hinduism-Test%20tube%20babies |accessdate=30 May 2016|publisher =  |date= 20 October 2013 | location = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the response to IVF of [[Islam]], the conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa include that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | last = Inhorn | first = MC | title= Making Muslim babies: IVF and gamete donation in Sunni versus Shi'a Islam | journal= Cult Med Psychiatry | volume= 30 |issue= 4 |pages = 427–50 |date=December 2006 | pmid= 17051430 | pmc = 1705533 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-006-9027-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician.
*Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to ''zina'', or [[adultery]].

Within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community the concept is debated as there is little precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Regarding [[Judaism and sexuality|laws of sexuality]], religious challenges include [[masturbation]] (which may be regarded as "seed wasting"&lt;ref name=medill/&gt;), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation ([[niddah]]) and the specific laws regarding intercourse. An additional major issue is that of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father's identity is determined by a legal presumption ([[chazakah]]) of legitimacy: ''rov bi'ot achar ha'baal'' - a woman's [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] are assumed to be with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]] (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father.&lt;ref&gt;Tzitz Eliezer 9 p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] has generally approved IVF.&lt;ref name="medill"/&gt;

===Society and culture===

Many people of sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their children to infertile women. IVF enables these infertile women to have their own children, which imposes new ideals to a culture in which fostering children is seen as both natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more respect in their society by taking care of the children of other mothers, and this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to access resources that are important for their development and also aids the development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Drah B | title = Orphans in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Crisis, the Interventions, and the Anthropologist | journal = Africa Today | volume = 59 | issue = 2 (Winter2012 2012) | pages = 3–21 | doi=10.2979/africatoday.59.2.3| year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional involvement==
Studies have indicated that IVF mothers show greater emotional involvement with their child, and they enjoy motherhood more than mothers by natural conception. Similarly, studies have indicated that IVF fathers express more warmth and emotional involvement than fathers by adoption and natural conception and enjoy fatherhood more. Some IVF parents become overly involved with their children.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilioi|first1=E.

==Men and IVF==
Research has shown that men largely view themselves as 'passive' contributors&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, K, Gill, R 2004, '"it's different for men": masculinity and IVF', LSE Research Online, Men and Masculinities, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; since they have 'less physical involvement'&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker A 2009, 'Global technologies and transnational reproduction in Thailand', Asian Studies Review, vol. 33, no. 3, pp. 324&lt;/ref&gt; in IVF treatment. Despite this, many men feel distressed after seeing the toll of hormonal injections and ongoing physical intervention on their female partner.&lt;ref name="Throsby, K 2004, pp. 344"&gt;Throsby, K, Gill, R 2004, '"it's different for men": masculinity and IVF', LSE Research Online, Men and Masculinities, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 344&lt;/ref&gt;
Fertility was found to be a significant factor in a man's perception of his masculinity, driving many to keep the treatment a secret.&lt;ref name="Throsby, K 2004, pp. 344"/&gt; In cases where the men did share that he and his partner were undergoing IVF, they reported to have been teased, mainly by other men, although some viewed this as an affirmation of support and friendship. For others, this led to feeling socially isolated.&lt;ref name="Throsby, K 2004, pp. 336"&gt;Throsby, K, Gill, R 2004, '"it's different for men": masculinity and IVF', LSE Research Online, Men and Masculinities, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 336&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison with women, men showed less deterioration in mental health in the years following a failed treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid9949886"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beutel M, Kupfer J, Kirchmeyer P, Kehde S, Köhn FM, Schroeder-Printzen I, Gips H, Herrero HJ, Weidner W | title = Treatment-related stresses and depression in couples undergoing assisted reproductive treatment by IVF or ICSI | journal = Andrologia | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–35 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9949886 | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0272.1999.tb02839.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However many men did feel guilt, disappointment and inadequacy, stating that they were simply trying to provide an 'emotional rock' for their partners.&lt;ref name="Throsby, K 2004, pp. 336"/&gt;

==Availability and utilisation==

High costs keep IVF out of reach for many developing countries, but research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claim to have found a much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, James.

Moreover, the laws of many countries permit IVF for only single women, lesbian couples, and persons participating in surrogacy arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Berg Brigham, K., Cadier, B., &amp; Chevreul, K. (28 March 2013). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23223400 The diversity of regulation and public financing of IVF in Europe and its impact on utilization].&lt;/ref&gt; Using PGD gives members of these select demographic groups disproportionate access to a means of creating a child possessing characteristics that they consider "ideal," raising issues of equal opportunity for both the parents'/parent's and the child's generation.  Many fertile couples{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} now demand equal access to embryonic screening so that their child can be just as healthy as one created through IVF.  Mass use of PGD, especially as a means of [[population control]] or in the presence of legal measures related to population or demographic control, can lead to intentional or [[Unintended consequences|unintentional]] demographic effects such as the skewed live-birth sex ratios seen in communist China following implementation of its [[one-child policy]].

===USA===
In the United States, overall availability of IVF in 2005 was 2.5 IVF physicians per 100,000 population, and utilisation was 236 IVF cycles per 100,000.&lt;ref name=hammoud&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammoud AO, Gibson M, Stanford J, White G, Carrell DT, Peterson M | title = In vitro fertilization availability and utilization in the United States: a study of demographic, social, and economic factors | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1630–1635 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18539275 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.10.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 126 procedures are performed per million people per year.

===Israel===
Israel has the highest rate of IVF in the world, with 1657 procedures performed per million people per year. The second highest rate is in Iceland, with 899 procedures per million people per year. Israel provides unlimited free IVF procedures for its citizens for up to two children per woman under 45 years of age. In other countries the coverage of such procedures is limited if it exists at all. The Israeli Health Ministry says it spends roughly $3450 per procedure.

===United Kingdom===

Availability of IVF in England is determined by [[Clinical commissioning group]]s. The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) recommends up to 3 cycles of treatment for women under 40 and one cycle for some women aged between 40 and 42, but financial pressure has eroded compliance with this recommendation.  CCGs in [[Healthcare in Essex|Essex]], [[Healthcare in Bedfordshire|Bedfordshire]] and [[Healthcare in Somerset|Somerset]] have reduced funding to one cycle, or none, and it is expected that reductions will become more widespread. Funding may be available in "exceptional circumstances" – for example if a male partner has a transmittable infection or one partner is affected by cancer treatment.  According to the campaign group Fertility Fairness at the end of 2014 every CCG in England was funding at least one cycle of IVF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RIP IVF?

The [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] said in September 2018 that parents who are limited to one cycle of IVF, or have to fund it themselves, are more likely choose to implant multiple embryos in the hope it increases the chances of pregnancy.  This significantly increases the chance of multiple births and the associated poor outcomes, which would increase NHS costs.  The president of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] said that funding 3 cycles was  "the most important factor in maintaining low rates of multiple pregnancies and reduce(s) associated complications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Regulator says IVF cuts put mothers and babies at risk |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/commissioning/exclusive-regulator-says-ivf-cuts-put-mothers-and-babies-at-risk/7023274.article |accessdate=8 October 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
The penetration of the IVF market in India is quite low at present with only 2,800 cycles/million infertile women in the reproductive age group (20–44 years) as compared to China which has 6,500 cycles. The key challenges are lack of awareness, affordability and accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://businessworld.in/article/IVF-Fertile-Ground/08-08-2016-104172/|title=IVF: Fertile Ground|last=Chatterjee|first=Paramita|work=BW Businessworld|access-date=8 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; India in 2018 becomes the destination for Fertility Tourism because of most affordable IVF treatment cost.

Sunni Muslim nations generally allow IVF between married couples when conducted with their own respective sperm and eggs, but not with donor eggs from other couples. But Iran, which is Shi'a Muslim, has a more complex scheme. Iran bans sperm donation but allows donation of both fertilised and unfertilised eggs. Fertilised eggs are donated from married couples to other married couples, while unfertilised eggs are donated in the context of mut'ah or temporary marriage to the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Inhorn, Marcia C.  |url=http://berghahnbooksonline.com/journals/ame/pdfs/2006/1-1/AM010104.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224210/http://berghahnbooksonline.com/journals/ame/pdfs/2006/1-1/AM010104.pdf|archivedate=7 July 2011|title= Islam, IVF and Everyday Life in the Middle East|journal=AIME: Anthropology of the Middle East|volume= 1|issue=1|pages= 37–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal regulations in the United States include screening [[Current Good Tissue Practices|requirements and restrictions]] on donations, but generally do not affect sexually intimate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1271.90|title=21 CFR 1271.90(a)(2)|publisher=[[US Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, doctors may be required to ''provide'' treatments due to nondiscrimination laws, as for example in California.&lt;ref name="Bob Egelko 2008"/&gt; The US state of [[Tennessee]] proposed a bill in 2009 that would have defined donor IVF as adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/106/Fiscal/HB2159.pdf |title=Fiscal Note, HB 2159 – SB 2136, from Tennessee General Assembly Fiscal Review Committee |format=PDF |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same session another bill proposed barring adoption from any unmarried and cohabitating couple, and activist groups stated that passing the first bill would effectively stop unmarried people from using IVF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/billinfo/BillSummaryArchive.aspx?BillNumber=SB0078&amp;ga=106 |title=SB 0078 by Stanley, Bunch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6332">'''Induced gravity''' (or '''emergent gravity''') is an idea in [[quantum gravity]] that [[space-time curvature]] and its dynamics [[emergence|emerge]] as a [[mean field approximation]] of underlying microscopic [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], similar to the [[fluid mechanics]] approximation of [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s. The concept was originally proposed by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1967.

==Overview==
Sakharov observed that many [[condensed matter]] systems give rise to emergent phenomena that are analogous to [[general relativity]]. For example, [[Crystallographic defect|crystal defects]] can look  like [[curvature]] and [[Torsion tensor|torsion]] in an [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan spacetime]]. This allows one to create a theory of gravity with torsion from a [[world crystal]] model of spacetime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title =  Gravity as Theory of Defects in a Crystal with Only Second-Gradient Elasticity

Sakharov's idea was to start with an arbitrary background [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] (in modern treatments, possibly with torsion) and introduce quantum fields (matter) on it but not introduce any gravitational dynamics explicitly. This gives rise to an [[effective action]] which to [[one-loop order]] contains the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] with a [[cosmological constant]]. In other words, general relativity arises as an emergent property of matter fields and is not put in by hand. On the other hand, such models typically predict huge [[cosmological constant]]s.

Some argue that the particular models proposed by Sakharov and others have been proven impossible by the [[Weinberg–Witten theorem]]. However, models with emergent gravity are possible as long as other things, such as spacetime dimensions, emerge together with gravity. Developments in [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] after 1997 suggest that the microphysical degrees of freedom in induced gravity might be radically different. The bulk space-time arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the space-time. According to some prominent researchers in emergent gravity (such as [[Mark Van Raamsdonk]]) spacetime is built up of quantum entanglement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Raamsdonk|first=Mark|date=19 June 2010|title=Building up spacetime with quantum entanglement.|journal=General Relativity and Gravitation|volume=42|issue=10|pages=2323–2329|doi=10.1007/s10714-010-1034-0|arxiv=1005.3035|bibcode=2010GReGr..42.2323V}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that quantum entanglement is the fundamental property that gives rise to spacetime. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Jacobson]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Ted|date=1995-08-14|title=Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1260–1263|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260|pmid=10060248|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1260J|arxiv=gr-qc/9504004}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the [[Einstein field equations]] can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics applied at local Rindler horizons.

==Introduction==
The International Cable Protection Committee was formed in 1958 and its primary goal is to promote the safeguarding of international submarine cables against man-made and natural hazards. The organisation provides a forum for the exchange of technical, legal and environmental information about submarine cables and, with more than 155 members from over 60 nations, including cable operators, owners, manufacturers, industry service providers, as well as governments, it is the world’s premier submarine cable organization.

Nearly 100% of the world's intercontinental electronic communications traffic is carried by the undersea cable infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ROGUCCI&gt;IEEE, [http://www.ieee-rogucci.org/files/The%20ROGUCCI%20Report.pdf "Reliability of Global Undersea Communications Cable Infrastructure (ROGUCCI) Report, p 33, Issue 1"], ''IEEE'', February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, submarine power cables underpin the global expansion of offshore renewable energy generation. As such, the impact of failures of these critical telecommunications and power cables can be devastating to social and economic stability. This is why submarine cables are classified as "critical infrastructure" that is to be protected from physical damage due to manmade or natural causes.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;Biodiversity Series 31, [http://www.iscpc.org/publications/ICPC-UNEP_Report.pdf "Submarine Cables and the Oceans – Connecting the World"], p. 64, {{ISBN|978-0-9563387-2-3}}, ICPC/UNEP-WCMC January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Activities of the ICPC==
The prime activities of the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) are related to promoting the awareness of submarine cables, both telecom and power, as critical infrastructure that must be protected, particularly to other seabed users, governments, and the public by establishing internationally agreed upon standards for cable installation, protection, and maintenance. The ICPC actively monitors the evolution of international treaties and national legislation and help to ensure that submarine cable interests are fully understood and protected by all relevant stakeholders. ICPC supports peer-reviewed research into the interactions of cables with the ocean environment to provide an evidence-based foundation for those interactions.&lt;ref name=TAIWAN&gt;L. Carter, J. D. Milliman, P. J. Talling, R. Gavey, R. B. Wynn, [http://www.iscpc.org "Near-Synchronous and Delayed Initiation of Long Run-Out Submarine Sediment Flows from a Record-Breaking River Flood, Offshore Taiwan"], Geophysical Research Letters, p. 39, L12603, {{doi|10.1029/2012GL051172}}, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Cable Damage Committee was established on May 22, 1958. The name of the committee was later changed to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) in 1967 to better reflect that intended aims of the organisation and its membership.&lt;ref name=ICPC&gt;[http://www.iscpc.org "International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC)"]&lt;/ref&gt; The original organisation was for the "Main Committee", as it was originally known, to formulate the policies, which a small Sub-Committee of members, voted in at each Main Committee meeting. Adopted policies were then organised and subsequently implemented. In addition, the Sub-Committee ran the internal administration of the organisation through the secretary.

In the early years, the Sub-Committee would meet frequently, organising many aspects, such as Cable Warning Charts, which were later devolved down to the organisation of individual members. Most of the detailed notes from these early meetings have disappeared prior to 1975, but they always produced a formal report to the Main Committee. The frequency of the meetings prevents their listing prior to the formation of the Executive Committee in 1977.

The title "Plenary" for the Main Committee first appeared in 1972, but would not appear to have been a firm change, but rather a title that evolved gradually during the 1970s. By contrast, the title "Executive" for the Sub-Committee was a firm decision of the 1977 Plenary meeting.

The offices of chairman and vice chairman have been held by the member administration rather than the individual person. This enables a reorganization of staff to take place within an administration, without effecting the committee's organisation. Before 1976 there was no vice chairman, and if the administration holding the chair was unable to attend, as occurred twice, then a chairman had to be nominated at the start of the meeting. After 1976 the absence of the chairman was more smoothly covered, as occurred in 1979 and 1991.

The secretary was initially provided by Cable &amp; Wireless, and subsequently changed to the British Post Office in 1960, although for a number of years after that, the official address remained with Cable &amp; Wireless. The secretariat remained with BPO/British Telecom International continuously until 1990, when an independent secretary was engaged. This was followed later by appointment of an International Cable Legal Advisor (1999) and Marine Environmental Advisor (2003).

Presently, governance is exercised by the ICPC Limited, which operates through a 17-member executive committee elected by the ICPC membership. ICPC membership has expanded and since 2011, national governments have been allowed to join as a government member in its own right. Government members include the Australia, Malta, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Since February 2013, Associate membership has been made available to any person or group that shares the goals of the ICPC.

==Membership==
As of March 2017, the ICPC has more than 155 Members from over 60 countries. The membership includes cable owners, operators and manufacturers as well as survey companies, research groups, industry service providers and national governments, and it is the world’s premier submarine cable organisation.

==Response to change==
Numerous changes and associated challenges that affect submarine cables are actively studied and addressed by the ICPC membership through the development of industry recommendations. These recommendations contain the combined knowledge of the ICPC membership such that submarine cables are best protected thus ensuring the utmost in reliability of this critical undersea infrastructure. Some of the changes that are actively monitored by the ICPC are summarized below.

* Rapid development of offshore renewable energy
* Increased incidence of damage caused by shipping
* Seabed becoming crowded in some areas
* Environment responses to climate change particularly regarding natural hazards &lt;ref name=ICPC /&gt;
* Need to maintain harmony with other seabed users
* Need to ensure harmony with seabed environment &lt;ref name=UNEP /&gt;
* Need to improve security of submarine cables

==Industry recommendations development==
The ICPC develops and maintains a suite of industry standards targeted at the various lifespan stages of undersea cables, from conception to retirement. These standards are available to organisations involved with these various stages through ICPC membership.

==Educational resources==
The ICPC provides educational materials for the benefit of those who need to be informed about submarine cables and their role as critical infrastructure.&lt;ref name=UNEP /&gt;&lt;ref name=ICPC /&gt; These materials are intended to promote the awareness of the strategic, socio-economic, and social benefits of submarine cables, especially to government agencies, the fishing industry, other seabed users and the public. Relevant information is also provided to prospective new submarine cable owners to encourage the adoption of minimum industry standards for the benefit of all involved with the seabed. The ICPC has also entered into memorandums of understanding with the International Seabed Authority and the Rhodes Academy to further cooperation with these two bodies. The ICPC also has a working relationship with the East-West Institute.

==Information sharing==
The ICPC provides a forum for members to interact and learn about legal, technical, and environmental developments relevant to submarine cables where areas of common interest are identified such that members can benefit from working together and each other's expertise and real-world experience. To ensure information sharing external to the ICPC, affiliations are also developed with equivalent seabed user organisations the world over. Formal relationships with appropriate international organisations are also developed with the goal of information sharing.

==Projects==
The ICPC engages in projects that are beneficial to the protection of submarine cable systems. For example, a global database showing fault causes and average repair times is developed and maintained. Research projects associated with the potential effects of submarine cables on the seabed environment are also performed to ensure harmony with the undersea environment.&lt;ref name=UNEP /&gt;

==Law==
The ICPC actively monitors the development of international treaties and national legislation to advise and support committee members when changes to laws are proposed that may affect submarine cables. Expertise to ensure ongoing compatibility and uniformity of the law with various industry requirements is also provided through ICPC membership.

Workshops are held by the ICPC with national governments and regional organisations to foster understanding of the rights and obligations that States have with respect to submarine cables under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS).

The ICPC sponsors a reference handbook based on unique collaboration of 15 industry experts, scientists, and international law scholars that address critical legal and governance issues, as it pertains to submarine cables deployed around the world.&lt;ref name=LAW&gt;D.R. Burnett, R. Beckman, and T. Davenport, [http://www.iscpc.org "Submarine Cables the Handbook of Law and Policy"], ICPC and the National University of Singapore – Centre for International Law, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Submarine Telecommunication Cables and the Marine Environment ==
The interaction between submarine cables and the marine environment is documented in peer-reviewed, mainstream publications.&lt;ref name=UNEP /&gt;&lt;ref name=TAIWAN /&gt;&lt;ref name=WHALE&gt;M.P. Wood, L. Carter, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4769692&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4769692  "Whale Entanglements with Submarine Telecommunication Cables"], Issue 33, pp. 445–460, ''IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref =HYPERPYCNAL&gt;R. Gavey, [http://www.iscpc.org "An Evaluation of Modern Hyperpycnal Processes and their Relevance to the Geological Record"], p. 339, Southampton University, United Kingdom, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ICPC supports such research as a means of providing evidence-based analyses to assist cable protection in naturally hazardous regions &lt;ref name=TAIWAN /&gt; and cable operations in environmentally sensitive areas. Briefly, cable/environmental interactions can be summarized as follows.

'''Deep Ocean (greater than 2000 meters)'''

Over 80% of trans-oceanic telecommunication cables are located in water depths &gt;2000m. There, the risks posed by fishing and shipping – the main causes of cable damage – are small. Accordingly, a typical cable is a 17-22mm diameter tube, the size of a domestic garden hose. It is composed of optical glass fibres, a copper power conductor and steel wires to add strength, all of which are encased in chemically inert, marine-grade polyethylene.&lt;ref name="Burnett, D.R. pp. 237"&gt;Burnett, D.R., Beckman, R.C. and Davenport, T.M. eds.

Furthermore, the amount of power in a cable is small being around 0.6 to 1 ampere, which is less than a laptop computer. Deep-ocean cables are laid on the seabed surface with minimal disturbance to the benthic environment.

Laying is planned as an one-off operation in the 20-25 year life of a cable (note the operational life may extend to 30 or more years as improved signal processing has expanded the carrying capacity of some existing cables). Given their well proven design and low risk from deep ocean hazards, cables are subject to an average of 4 faults annually worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer‑Felgate, Andy, Nigel Irvine, Simon Ratcliffe and Seng Sui Bah, 2013.

'''Continental Margin (less than 2000 meters)'''

Aptly phrased the "urban sea", this sector of the ocean is the focus of a wide range of human activities that include fishing, mineral exploration, shipping, dredging, renewable energy generation, scientific research as well as telecommunications.  As a result, special measures are required to protect cables. This includes (i) strengthening with steel wire armour, which increases  cable diameter up to ~50mm, (ii) burial beneath the seabed&lt;ref name="Burnett, D.R. pp. 237"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter2009 /&gt; and positive engagement with other seabed users to share information and knowledge regarding their respective industries.

'''Natural Hazards'''

Most cable faults result from human activities especially ships' anchoring and commercial fishing that involves contact with the seabed, e.g. bottom trawling.&lt;ref name="Burnett, D.R. pp. 237"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter2009 /&gt; Collectively, these activities account for over 65% of cable faults and occur primarily in water depths &lt;200m.&lt;ref&gt;Drew, S., 2009.

Those effects are minimized by cable armouring and burial beneath the seabed. Less frequent but nonetheless devastating are tsunami such as the 2011 Great Tohuku Earthquake of 2011 that severely damaged Japanese coastal infrastructure. Such earthquakes may also generate submarine landslides and turbidity currents – sediment-laden currents that travel long distances (100s to 1000s kilometres) at high speeds (up to 68 kilometres/hour). These turbulent flows break cables in water depths down to 5000m and deeper.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cattaneo, A. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heezen, B.C 1952"/&gt; For example, offshore Taiwan and Algeria suffered earthquakes in 2006 and 2003 that caused 22 and 29 cable breaks respectively. Turbidity currents also form under major rain storms. The discharged flood waters are so laden with mud and sand that they sink to the seabed and move downslope to form cable-damaging turbidity currents.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Ed,  Talling, P.J. and Carter, L., 2016.

While such forces may be locally significant, worldwide they are minor compared to earthquakes and storms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3127">The '''Israeli Citizens' Fund''' ({{lang-he|קרן לאזרחי ישראל}}, ''Keren LeEzraḥei Yisra'el'') is a [[sovereign wealth fund]] (SWF) in [[Israel]]. It was established in order to handle the [[windfall profits]] expected from the discovery of the [[Tamar gas field|Tamar]] and [[Leviathan gas field]]s. The fund is managed by the [[Bank of Israel]].

Without the fund, the economy of Israel would run the risk of the so-called "[[Dutch disease]]". This happens when a significant increase in revenue from one sector (such as [[natural gas]]) causes the local currency (the [[Israeli new shekel|shekel]]) to strengthen, which in turn would make other sectors of the economy less competitive.

In November 2010 the [[International Monetary Fund]] recommended, in its Article IV Consultation, that Israel set up a sovereign wealth fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/112910.htm |title=Israel, Article IV Consultation—Concluding Statement of the Mission |date=November 29, 2010 |publisher=International Monetary Fund |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410085059/http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/112910.htm |archivedate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OECD]] recommended likewise in 2011. The OECD estimates that its size by 2040 would be between 40 to 175 billion USD (that is, between 10 and 50 percent of Israel's GDP) depending on the rate of new discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2011 |title=OECD Economic Surveys: Israel 2011 |publisher=OECD Publishing |location=Paris |doi=10.1787/eco_surveys-isr-2011-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law establishing the fund was passed by [[Knesset]] in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawSecondary.aspx?lawitemid=481584&lt;/ref&gt; The law states that the fund will begin operating a month after the state's tax revenues from natural gas exceeds one billion. Originally expected to happen by 2017, more recent estimates expect this threshold to be passed by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-sovereign-wealth-fund-wont-operate-before-2020-1001177034 |title=Sovereign wealth fund won't operate before 2020 |date=15 February 2017 |first=Amiram |last=Barkat |newspaper=[[Globes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-natgas-idUSL5N1HC37U |title=Israel natural gas wealth fund expected to begin around 2020 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complicated nature of the windfall tax might cause companies to use intricate forms of [[tax avoidance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.809632 |title=Why Hasn’t Israel’s Windfall-profit Tax Blown in Yet? |date=30 August 2017 |first=Meirav |last=Arlosoroff |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubbard Glacier August 14.2002.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A jökulhlaup]]
A '''jökulhlaup''' ({{IPA-is|ˈjœːkʏl̥øip}}) (literally "glacial run") is a type of [[glacial]] [[outburst flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kirk Johnson |title=Alaska Looks for Answers in Glacier’s Summer Flood Surges |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/us/alaska-looks-for-answers-in-glaciers-summer-flood-surges.html?hp&amp;gwh=9894863643696671986A9922F6C3223D&amp;_r=0 |quote=Glaciologists even have a name for the process, which is happening in many places all over the world as climates change: jokulhlaup, an Icelandic word usually translated as 'glacier leap.' |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] term that has been  adopted in [[glaciology|glaciological]] terminology in many languages. 
It originally referred to the well-known subglacial outburst floods from [[Vatnajökull]], [[Iceland]], which are triggered by geothermal heating and occasionally by a volcanic [[subglacial eruption]], but it is now used to describe any large and abrupt release of water from a [[subglacial lake|subglacial]] or [[Proglacial lake|proglacial lake/reservoir]].

Since jökulhlaups emerge from [[hydrostatic]]ally-sealed lakes with floating levels far above the threshold, their peak [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] can be much larger than that of a marginal or extra-marginal lake burst. The [[hydrograph]] of a jökulhlaup from Vatnajökull typically either climbs over a period of weeks with the largest flow near the end, or it climbs much faster during the course of some hours. These patterns are suggested to reflect channel melting, and sheet flow under the front, respectively.&lt;ref name=helgi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Björnsson|first=Helgi|title=Subglacial Lakes and Jökulhlaups in Iceland|journal=Global and Planetary Change|year=2002|volume=35|pages=255–271|url=http://www.norvol.hi.is/pdf/HB2003GlobPlanCh.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0921-8181(02)00130-3|bibcode = 2003GPC....35..255B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar processes on a very large scale occurred during the [[deglaciation]] of North America and Europe after the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] (e.g., [[Lake Agassiz]] and the [[English Channel]]), and presumably at earlier times, although the geological record is not well preserved.

==Jökulhlaup process==

===Subglacial water generation===
Subglacial meltwater generation is one key to the understanding of subglacial meltwater flow. Meltwater may be produced on the glacier surface (supraglacially), below the glacier (basally) or in both locations.&lt;ref name=shaw2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=John|author2=A. Pugin |author3=R. R. Young |title=A Meltwater Origin for Antarctic Shelf Bedforms with Special Attention to Megalineations|journal=Geomorphology|date=December 2008|issue=3–4|pages=364–375|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2008.04.005|bibcode = 2008Geomo.102..364S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smellie|first=John L. |author2=J. S. Johnson |author3=W. C. McIntosh |author4=R. Esserb |author5=M. T. Gudmundsson |author6=M. J. Hambrey |author7=B. van Wyk de Vriese |title=Six Million Years of Glacial History Recorded in Volcanic Lithofacies of the James Ross Island Volcanic Group, Antarctic Peninsula|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=April 2008|volume=260|issue=1–2|pages=122–148|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ablation]] (surface melting) tends to result in surface pooling. Basal melting results from geothermal heat flux out of the earth, which varies with location, as well as from friction heating which results from the ice moving over the surface below it. Analyses by Piotrowski concluded that, based on basal meltwater production rates, the annual production of subglacial water from one typical northwestern Germany catchment was 642x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; during the last [[Weichselian glaciation]].&lt;ref name=Piotrowski1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piotrowski|first=Jan A.|title=Subglacial Hydrology in North-Western Germany During the Last Glaciation: Groundwater Flow, Tunnel Valleys, and Hydrological Cycles|url=ftp://ftp.shef.ac.uk/pub/uni/academic/D-H/geog/felix/PAC_Summer_Reading/piotrowski_1997.pdf |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|year=1997|volume=16|issue=2|pages=169–185|doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(96)00046-7|bibcode = 1997QSRv...16..169P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supraglacial and subglacial water flow===
Meltwater may flow either above the glacier (supraglacially), below the glacier (subglacially/basally) or as groundwater in an [[aquifer]] below the glacier as a result of the [[Hydraulic conductivity#Transmissivity|hydraulic transmissivity]] of the subsoil under the glacier. If the rate of production exceeds the rate of loss through the aquifer, then water will collect in surface or subglacial ponds or lakes.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski1997/&gt;

The signatures of supraglacial and basal water flow differ with the passage zone. Supraglacial flow is similar to stream flow in all surface environments—water flows from higher areas to lower areas under the influence of [[gravity]]. Basal flow under the glacier exhibits significant differences. In basal flow the water, either produced by melting at the base or drawn downward from the surface by gravity, collects at the base of the glacier in ponds and lakes in a pocket overlain by hundreds of metres of ice. If there is no surface drainage path, water from surface melting will flow downward and collect in crevices in the ice, while water from basal melting collects under the glacier; either source can form a subglacial lake. The [[hydraulic head]] of the water collected in a basal lake will increase as water drains through the ice until the pressure grows high enough either to force a path through the ice or to float the ice above it.&lt;ref name=shaw2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smellie2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smellie|first=John L.|title=Basaltic Subglacial Sheet-Like Sequences: Evidence for Two Types with Different Implications for the Inferred Thickness of Associated Ice|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|date=May 2008|volume=88|issue=1–2|pages=60–88|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2008.01.004|bibcode = 2008ESRv...88...60S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episodic releases===
If meltwater accumulates, the discharges are episodic under continental ice sheets as well as under Alpine glaciers. The discharge results when water collects, the overlying ice is lifted, and the water moves outward in a pressurized layer or a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice is most easily lifted (i.e. areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) are lifted first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice.&lt;ref&gt;A [[waterbed]] analogy can be applied here—the water moves under the pressure of the overlying ice, just as it does when a mass is placed on a water bed.&lt;/ref&gt; As water collects, additional ice is lifted until a release path is created.&lt;ref name=Wingham2006&gt;Wingham2006&lt;/ref&gt;

If no preexisting channel is present, the water is initially released in a broad-front jökulhlaup which can have a flow front that is tens of kilometres wide, spreading out in a thin front. As the flow continues, it tends to erode the underlying materials and the overlying ice, creating a [[tunnel valley]] channel even as the reduced pressure allows most of the glacial ice to settle back to the underlying surface, sealing off the broad front release and channelizing the flow. The direction of the channel is defined primarily by the overlying ice thickness and second by the gradient of the underlying earth, and may be observed to "run uphill" as the pressure of the ice forces the water to areas of lower ice coverage until it emerges at a glacial face. Hence the configuration of the various tunnel valleys formed by a specific glaciation provides a general mapping of the glacier thickness when the tunnel valleys were formed, particularly if the original surface relief under the glacier was limited.&lt;ref name=shaw2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A/&gt;

The rapid, high-volume discharge is highly erosive, as evidenced by the debris found in tunnels and at the mouth of tunnels, which tends to be coarse rocks and boulders. This erosive environment is consistent with creation of tunnels over 400&amp;nbsp;m deep and 2.5&amp;nbsp;km wide, as have been observed in the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=shaw2008 /&gt;

Piotrowski has developed a detailed analytic model of the process, which predicts a cycle as follows:&lt;ref name=Piotrowski1997/&gt;
# Meltwater is produced as a result of geothermal heating from below. Surface ablation water is not considered as it would be minimal at the glacial maximum and evidence indicates that surface water does not penetrate more than 100 meters into a glacier.
# Meltwater initially drains through subglacial aquifers.
# When the hydraulic transmissivity of the substratum is exceeded, subglacial meltwater accumulates in basins.
# Water accumulates sufficiently to open the ice blockage in the tunnel valley which accumulated after the last discharge.
# The tunnel valley discharges the meltwater excess—turbulent flow melts out or erodes the excess ice as well as eroding the valley floor.
# As the water level drops, the pressure decreases until the tunnel valleys again close with ice and water flow ceases.

*[[Mýrdalsjökull]] is subject to large jökulhlaups when the subglacial volcano [[Katla volcano|Katla]] erupts, roughly every 40 to 80 years. The eruption in 1755 is estimated to have had a peak discharge of 200,000 to 400,000&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic metres per second|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s]].
*The [[Grímsvötn]] volcano frequently causes large jökulhlaups from [[Vatnajökull]]. The 1996 eruption caused a peak flow of 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic metres per second|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s]] and lasted for several days.
* The [[Eyjafjallajökull]] volcano can cause jökulhlaups.

As the Laurentide Ice Sheet receded from its maximum extent from around 21,000 to 13,000 years ago, two significant meltwater rerouting events occurred in eastern [[North America]]. Though there is still much debate among geologists as to where these events occurred, they likely took place when the ice sheet receded from the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the [[St.&amp;nbsp;Lawrence Lowlands]].
* First, [[Glacial Lake Iroquois]] drained to the Atlantic in catastrophic [[Hudson Valley]] releases, as the receding ice sheet dam failed and re-established itself in three jökulhlaups. Evidence of the scale of the meltwater discharge down the Hudson Valley includes deeply incised sediments in the valley, large sediment deposit lobes on the continental shelf, and [[glacial erratic]] boulders greater than 2&amp;nbsp;metres in diameter on the outer shelf.
* Later, when the [[St.&amp;nbsp;Lawrence Valley]] was deglaciated, [[Glacial Lake Candona]] drained to the [[North Atlantic]], with subsequent drainage events routed through the [[Champlain Sea]] and St.&amp;nbsp;Lawrence Valley. This surge of meltwater to the North Atlantic by jökulhlaup about 13,350 years ago is believed to have triggered the reduction in [[thermohaline circulation]] and the short-lived [[Allerød oscillation|Northern Hemisphere Intra-Allerød cold period]].&lt;ref name= Donnelly2005&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Donnelly  | first = Jeffrey P. |author2=Neal W.

* Finally, [[Lake Agassiz]] was an immense glacial lake located in the center of North America. Fed by glacial runoff at the end of the last glacial period, its area was larger than all of the modern Great Lakes combined, and it held more water than contained by all lakes in the world today. It drained in a series of events between 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]] and 8,400 BP.
* Also, into the Pacific Ocean, large drainage events took place through the [[Columbia River Gorge]], dubbed the [[Missoula Floods]].

[[File:Borah Peak ID 2-22-15.JPG|thumb|400px|[[Borah Peak]] is the highest summit of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Idaho|State of Idaho]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Idaho|State of Idaho]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in this article include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 40 highest major summits of Idaho by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 40 most prominent summits of Idaho.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 40 most isolated major summits of Idaho.
__TOC__{{clear}}

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the highest major summits of Idaho, ten peaks exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation and 34 peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11169">This is a list of named '''[[mountain]]s on the [[Moon]]'''.

Note that the heights listed below are not consistent across sources. In the 1960s, the US Army Mapping Service used elevation relative to 1,737,988 meters from the center of the Moon. In the 1970s, the US Defense Mapping Agency used 1,730,000 meters. The [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] topographic data published in the 1990s uses 1,737,400 meters.

Also note that this table is not comprehensive, and does not list the highest places on the Moon. Clementine data show a range of about 18,100 meters from lowest to highest point on the Moon. [[Selenean summit|The highest point]], located on the far side of the Moon, is approximately 6500 meters higher than Mons Huygens (usually listed as the tallest mountain).

==Mountains==
These are isolated mountains or [[massif]]s.

There are fifteen [[national park]]s in [[Spain]]: ten in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and four in the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. Twelve of the seventeen [[autonomous communities of Spain]] have national parks. Canary Islands has the most (four), followed by [[Andalusia]], [[Castile-La Mancha]] and [[Castile and León]] (two each). There are five autonomous communities that have no national parks: [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], [[Murcia]], [[Navarre]], [[Valencian Community]].

About 10 million people visited Spanish national parks in 2009, with [[Teide National Park|Teide]] accounting for about 30% of all visitors. The second most visited park was [[Picos de Europa National Park|Picos de Europa]] (18%), followed by [[Timanfaya National Park|Timanfaya]] (13%). The least visited parks were [[Cabrera Archipelago Maritime-Terrestrial National Park|Cabrera Archipelago]] (0.60%) and [[Cabañeros National Park|Cabañeros]] (0.90%).&lt;ref name="laopinion_2010"/&gt; With more than 2.5 million visitors in 2013, Teide was the most visited national park in Europe that year, and sixth most visited in the world.&lt;ref name="laopinion_2014"/&gt;

The [http://www.nationalparkspain.com Sierra de las Nieves Natural Park] in the province of Malaga is being elevated to National Park status.

'''[[Psilocybin mushrooms]]''' are mushrooms which contain the [[hallucinogen]]ic substances [[psilocybin]], [[psilocin]], [[baeocystin]] and [[norbaeocystin]]. The mushrooms are collected and grown as an entheogen and recreational drug, despite being [[Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms|illegal in many countries]]. Many psilocybin mushrooms are in the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'', but species across several other genera contain the drugs.

The '''Luzon tropical pine forests''' are a [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|tropical coniferous forest]] [[ecoregion]] of the [[Philippines]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]]. These pine forests are home to a large number of the island's endemic plants and animals.

==Location and description==
[[Luzon]] is the largest island in the Philippines and lies at the north of the group of islands. These pine forests are found at elevations over 1000m in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] mountains in the north of the island, where they are mixed in with areas of [[Luzon montane rain forests]] especially at the northern end of the range. The Cordillera Central includes Luzon's highest peak [[Mount Pulag]] along with other high peaks such as [[Mount Puguis]], [[Mount Polis]] and [[Mount Data]]. Pine forests are also found in the [[Zambales Mountains]] of west-central Luzon, particularly in [[Mount Tapulao]] and [[Mount Redondo]] near [[Subic, Zambales]].

Rainfall is high (over 2500mm per year) but concentrated in the July/August monsoon with a long dry season from November to April.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0302|name=Luzon tropical pine forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
[[File:FvfBokod0174 03.JPG|thumb|right|A pine forest in [[Bokod, Benguet|Bokod]]]]
Luzon has long been isolated from other land masses so a unique flora has developed. In this ecoregion Benguet pine (''[[Pinus insularis]]'') trees are thinly spread over the grasslands that cover the slopes. Regular fires in the dry season maintain the balance of pines and grassland and prevent other deciduous trees and shrubs from taking hold.

==Fauna==
There are a number of mammals endemic to the Cordillera Central, mainly species of mice and rats including large squirrel-like [[cloud rat]]s. Three larger mammals of the forest are the [[Philippine long-tailed macaque]] (''Macaca fascicularis''), [[Philippine warty pig]] (''Sus philippensis''), and [[Malayan civet]] (''Viverra tangalunga'') all of which are vulnerable to forest clearance while the pig and the macaque are prey for hunters. Birds of the pine forest include the pine-nut eating [[common crossbill]], which is found in pine forests all over the world.

==Threats and preservation==
Pine trees have been cut down for timber, firewood and [[turpentine]] production for centuries and today this is intensified as forest is cleared for agriculture and copper and gold mining projects as the population of the Philippines grows and remains impoverished in these rural areas.  In the dry season it is a straightforward process to set fires for forest clearance. Protected areas include Mount Pulag, home to a number of endemic plants and birds.

'''Marine clay''' is a type of [[clay]] found in coastal regions around the world.  In the northern, deglaciated regions, it can sometimes be [[quick clay]], which is notorious for being involved in landslides. 

Marine clay is a particle of soil that is dedicated to a particle size class, this is usually associated with USDA’s classification with [[sand]] at 0.05mm, [[silt]] at 0.05-.002mm and clay being less than 0.002 mm in diameter. Paired with the fact this size of particle was deposited within a marine system involving the [[erosion]] and [[transportation]] of the clay into the ocean. 

Soil particles become suspended when in a [[solution]] with water, with sand being affected by the force of gravity first with suspended silt and clay still floating in solution. This is also known as [[turbidity]], in which floating soil particles create a murky brown color to a water solution. These clay particles are then transferred to the [[abyssal plain]] in which they are deposited in high percentages of clay. A soil is only considered a clay if it has above 55% total clay content. This is due to the way in which the clay reacts to things like water, heat and other chemicals. 

Once the clay is deposited on the ocean floor it can change its structure through a process known as [[flocculation]], process by which fine particulates are caused to clump together or floc.  These can be either edge to edge flocculation or edge to face flocculation. Relating to individual clay particles interacting with each other. Clays can also be aggregated or shifted in their structure besides being flocculated. 

Clay particles can self-assemble into various configurations, each with totally different properties.

This change in structure to the clay particles is due to a swap in [[cations]] with the basic structure of a clay particle. This basic structure of the clay particle is known as a silica [[tetrahedral]] or aluminum [[octahedral]]. They are the basic structure of clay particles composing of one [[cation]], usually [[silica]] or [[aluminum]] surrounded by [[hydroxide]] [[anions]], these particles form in sheets forming what we know as clay particles and have very specific properties to them including micro [[porosity]] which is the ability of clay to hold water against the force of gravity, [[shrink swell capacity]] and [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] capabilities. 

When clay is deposited in the [[ocean]], the presence of excess ions in seawater causes a loose, open structure of the clay particles to form, a process known as [[flocculation]]. Once stranded and dried by ancient changing ocean levels, this open framework means that such clay is open to water infiltration.  Construction in marine clays thus presents a [[geotechnical engineering]] challenge. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/dpwes/publications/marineclay.htm "Overcoming Problems with Marine Clays", Fairfax County, Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where clay overlies peat, a lateral movement of the coastline is indicated and shows a rise in relative sea level

Swelling of marine clay has the potential to destroy [[Foundation_(engineering)|building foundations]] in only a few years.  Due to the changes in climatic conditions on the construction site, the pavement constructed on the marine clay (as subgrade) will have less durability and requires lot of maintenance cost.  Some simple precautions, however, can reduce the hazard significantly {{Fact|date=July 2008}}.

The swapping of this positive [[cation]] with another is what makes different types of clays including [[Kaolinite]], [[montmorillonite]], [[smectite]] and [[illite]]. This happens in marine clays due the fact the oceans water is high in solution with cations making it very easy to overcome the clays negative net charge and swap the clays cation with a less positive one. These marine clays can be what are known as quick clays, which are notorious for its erosive properties. A great example of these quick clays is in the [[pacific northwest]]. They are known as [[blue goo]] which is a mix of clay and [[mélange]] ([[Greenstone belt|greenstone]], [[basalt]], [[chert]], [[shale]], [[sandstone]], [[schists]]. uplifted through the [[accretionary wedge]]). These quick clays have a very high-risk factor associated with them if they are built upon, as they are very unstable due to the fact that [[liquefaction]] happens when it becomes [[Water content|saturated]] and literally flows, causing mass wasting events to happen. Other marine clays are used all around the world for many different uses, such as [[ceramics]], building material, including [[adobe]]. Clay layers in soils which can be used as an impermeable layer are very important for dumps or [[chemical spills]] as they have a very high absorption capacity for heavy metals. For these clays to be available for human use they must have been eroded deposited on the ocean floor and then [[uplifted]] through means of [[tectonic]] activity to bring it to land.

During the construction of [[Marina Barrage]] in [[Singapore]], marine clay was found at the site. Since marine clay was the cause of the [[Nicoll Highway collapse]] years previous, the construction team removed all the marine clay to ensure the stability of Marina Barrage. {{Fact|date=December 2012}} Later on, they found marine clay mixed with seawater even in the deeper underground.

Geotechnical problems posed by marine clay can be handled by various ground improvement techniques.  Marine clay can be densified by mixing it with cement or similar binding material in specific proportions.  Marine clay can be stabilised using wastes of various industries like porcelain industry and tree-cutting industries.  This method is usually adopted in highways where marine clay is used as a subgrade soil. {{Fact|date=December 2012}}

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

The effect has also been used to explain the spatial version of the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which an otherwise unstable object may be stabilised by rapidly repeated observations.&lt;ref name="zeno"/&gt;

===Molecules===
Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects. In 1999, a research team in [[Vienna]] demonstrated diffraction for molecules as large as [[fullerene]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Wave-particle duality of C60| first=M.| last=Arndt| author2=O.

Still one step further than Louis De Broglie go theories which in quantum mechanics eliminate the concept of a pointlike classical particle and explain the observed facts by means of wavepackets of matter waves alone.&lt;ref&gt;See section VI(e) of Everett's thesis: ''The Theory of the Universal Wave Function'', in [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R.

The de Broglie equations relate the [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} to the [[momentum]] {{math|''p''}}, and [[frequency]] {{math|''f''}} to the total energy {{math|''E''}} of a particle:&lt;ref name="Resnick 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles |edition=2nd |first=R. |last=Resnick |first2=R. |last2=Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=1985 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-87373-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

Miller, Plenum Press, New York, {{ISBN|978-1-4684-8773-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009). ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}, pp. 30–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

== Mythology ==
Moria makes an appearance in [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', in an episode that is as follows. Tylus accidentally touched a serpent, which then attacked Tylus, coiled round his body and suffocated him; Tylus was not his first victim. Moria only could helplessly watch her brother die, but then [[Damasen]], a [[Gigantes|Giant]] son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], arrived on the spot; Moria implored him to help and he killed the serpent, hitting it with the trunk of a tree he tore out of the ground. Then a female serpent, the slain monster's mate, appeared and used a magical herb, referred to as "[[Zeus]]' flower", to bring the dead serpent back to life. Moria then used the same herb to revive her brother.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'', 25. 452 ff&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been speculated that the myth of Moria, Tylus and Damasen may be rooted in [[Lydia]]n mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheMoria.html Theoi.com - Moria] (accessed on April 13, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottawabonnecheregrabenmap.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Ottawa-Bonnechere and Timiskaming grabens]]
The '''Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben''' (also known as the '''Ottawa Graben''') is a geological structure that coincides with a {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}} wide topographic depression extending from near Montréal through Ottawa. It is part of the St. Lawrence rift system that also includes the seismically active Saguenay graben.&lt;ref name="OBGraben"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370705000098|title=Evolution of faulting and paleo-stress field within the Ottawa graben, Canada|first=Rolly E.|last=Rimando|first2=Keith|last2= Benn|year=2005|journal=Journal of Geodynamics|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|volume=39|issue=4|pages= 337–360|doi=10.1016/j.jog.2005.01.003|bibcode=2005JGeo...39..337R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rift valley was formed when the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] moved downward about a kilometre between two major [[fault (geology)|fault zone]]s known as the Mattawa and Petawawa faults. The length of the graben is about {{convert|700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

The Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben runs from the [[Montreal]] area on the east to near [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Lake Nipissing]] on the west. On the east, it joins the [[Saint Lawrence rift system]], a [[half-graben]] which extends more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] [[valley]] and links the Ottawa and [[Saguenay Graben]].&lt;ref name = Tremblay&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Tremblay | first = Alain | last2 = Lemieux | first2 = Yvon | title = Supracrustal Faults of the St. Lawrence rift System between Cap Tourments and Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec| work = Current Research 2001-D15 |publisher = Geological Survey of Canada | url = http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/M44-2001-D15E.pdf | year = 2001| accessdate = 2007-06-20 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = map&gt;{{cite web |title= Map  |url= http://bp0.blogger.com/_viWbhRtuOio/Rnbnf0fttkI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/bc_L4_sDoJU/s1600-h/ott.png

The {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} segment of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben west of Ottawa was the first to be recognized as a [[graben]].

Since the Late Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic, [[erosion]] has removed the volcanic peaks, exposing a number of relic [[volcanic pipe]]s, such as [[Callander Bay]] and the [[Manitou Islands (Lake Nipissing)|Manitou Islands]] in Lake Nipissing.&lt;ref name = background/&gt;

These features are [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] [[geology|geological]] structures formed by the violent, [[supersonic]] eruption of deep-origin [[volcano]]es. [[Batholith]]s and [[dike (geology)|dikes]] were also exposed by erosion, such as the Timber Lake, Mulock, West Arm, Powassan and Bonfield batholiths.&lt;ref name= background/&gt; The expressions of a thick pile of dominantly [[mafic]], bimodal volcanics and the Tibbit Hill volcanics in the Humber Zone of the [[Quebec]] [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] are believed to be related to the formation of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The precise age of these volcanics is unknown but they are either early [[Cambrian]] and late [[Precambrian]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This volcanism was probably coeval with the emplacement of the [[Grenville dike swarm]].

Minor but significant igneous activity occurred during the Mesozoic era, including [[kimberlite]] emplacement during the Jurassic period, and the development of [[igneous rock|alkalic]] [[intrusion]]s along the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben and elsewhere in Ontario. This second episode of alkalic volcanism occurred along the eastern part of the graben in the early [[Cretaceous]].

The products of this event are the [[Monteregian Hills]] in [[Montérégie]], Quebec. These are thought to have formed as a result of the [[North American Plate]] sliding westward over a long-lived center of upwelling [[magma]] called the [[New England hotspot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Inferred track of the Great Meteor hotspot | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7134/fig_tab/nature05675_F2.html | accessdate = 2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the [[erosion|eroded]] remnants of intrusive stocks.

Along the northern side of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben lies a dramatic [[escarpment]] that forms the southern edge of the [[Gatineau Hills]]. This escarpment, called the Eardley Escarpment, makes this part of the graben an attractive location for [[rock climbing|rock climber]]s and [[hiking|hiker]]s, offering a beautiful view of the relatively flat fields below, which extend to the Ottawa River.

==History==

The depressions formed by the graben across the rugged Canadian Shield were a [[spillway]] for the [[Great Lakes]] after the last [[Ice Age]].&lt;ref name = Mattawa/&gt;  Later they became a thoroughfare for exploration and trade.  These depressions now contain the Ottawa River and its tributary the Mattawa, which rises at [[Trout Lake (Ontario)|Trout Lake]] near Lake Nipissing.  The latter is the source of the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]], which drains into [[Lake Huron]].  This water route, with few [[portage]]s, connected Lake Huron and the Saint Lawrence River by a much shorter route than through the lower Great Lakes.  It was the mainline of the French-Canadian [[voyageurs]] engaged in the [[fur trade]]; they took canoes on the waterways along this route from [[Montreal]] to the upper Great Lakes and the ''pays d'en haut''—the "upper country" in the old Northwest.&lt;ref name=Mattawa&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Areas Report: Mattawa River |work=National Heritage Information Center |date=2005-06-05 |publisher=Ontario Ministry of National Resources |url=http://nhic.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/nhic/areas/areas_report.cfm?areaid=18523 |accessdate=2007-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109200517/http://nhic.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/nhic/areas/areas_report.cfm?areaid=18523 |archivedate=November 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the arrival of European settlers in North America, the [[Mattawa River]] was an important transportation corridor for native peoples of the region and formed part of the water route leading west to [[Lake Superior]] in the days of the [[fur trade]]. [[Canoe]]s travelling north up the Ottawa turned left to enter the Mattawa, reaching [[Lake Nipissing]] by way of "La Vase Portage", an {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} stretch of water and [[portage]]s. In the 19th century, the river provided access to large untouched stands of white pine. The river was also used to transport logs to sawmills. While [[logging]] is still an important industry in this region, almost the full length of the river has been designated as a [[Canadian Heritage River]], and as such, its shores are now protected from further development and logging. Today, the river and lakes are mainly used for recreation.

'''''Plutonia''''' (''Плутония'') is an early [[science-fiction]] novel by Russian academician [[Vladimir Obruchev]]. It was written in 1915 in [[Kharkov]] and first published in the original [[Russian language|Russian]] in [[1924 in literature|1924]].

==Plot==
The title ''Plutonia'' refers to the novel's setting in a [[Lost world (genre)|lost land]]. It is an [[Hollow earth|underground world]] having its own sun, called Pluto for the [[Pluto (mythology)|Roman god of the underworld]]. The terrain is marked by dramatic geographic features and inhabited by monstrous animals and primitive people. These are essentially the animal and plant life of previous geological periods in their natural surroundings. As the characters venture deeper into the underground area, they encounter more and more ancient life forms, back to [[dinosaurs]] and other [[Jurassic]] species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1648670.Plutonia Goodreads: Plutonia, by Vladimir Obruchev]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive vorticity advection''', or PVA, is the result of more cyclonic values of [[vorticity]] advecting into lower values of vorticity. It is more generally referred to as "Cyclonic Vorticity Advection" (CVA). In the Northern Hemisphere this is positive, whilst in the Southern Hemisphere it is negative.

==Development==
Vorticity in the [[atmosphere]] is created in three different ways, which are named in their resultant vorticity. These are; [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] vorticity, [[curvature]] vorticity, and [[Shear rate|shear]] vorticity. For example, at the base of a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]], there is curvature and shear vorticity. Curvature vorticity is due to the increasing cyclonic turning as an air parcel enters the trough base. The maximum counter-clockwise spin (positive vorticity in the N.H.) is at the trough base. Shear vorticity is caused by the difference in wind speed between air moving through the trough base (typically a jet or jet finger) and slower moving air on either poleward and equatorward side of the faster flow. Consider that slower air to the poleward side will be imparted counter-clockwise spin (picture faster moving air (jet) south and slower air to the north, spin is created). Thus, to the north (poleward) of the trough base an air parcel will experience positive vorticity. Likewise, to the south of the faster flow the air is spun in a clockwise direction (faster air (jet)to the north with slower air to the south, spin is created). Thus, to the south of the faster winds will be an area of negative vorticity. 

When these areas of negative and positive vorticity are moved (advected) they produce areas of negative vorticity advection (NVA) and positive vorticity advection (PVA) respectively, downstream from the trough base. The positive vorticity advection area is typically associated with divergence and upward motion. The negative vorticity advection area will be associated with convergence and downward motion.{{Cn|date=October 2014}}

This produces [[Convergence zone|convergence]] because of the way the air gains cyclonic vorticity while entering the base of the trough. The opposite happens when air is exiting the base of a trough. This air has more cyclonic vorticity than the air it is entering and therefore produces CVA. CVA produces [[divergence]] as a result of how there is a loss of cyclonic vorticity. Coriolis vorticity in this situation is ignored because it acts about the same on all the air flowing through the base of the trough.

==Significance in forecasting==
The divergence with CVA is significant because it creates forced [[Lift (force)|lift]] in the atmosphere. This forced lift, in the presence of conditions favorable for [[atmospheric convection]], can cause [[cloud]]s or [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. AVA will do the opposite and lead to a stable atmosphere. In combination with a jet streak, CVA can lead to the amplification of a trough which is significant for forecasting many conditions of the atmosphere.

The positron has an [[electric charge]] of +1&amp;nbsp;''[[elementary charge|e]]'', a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1/2 (same as electron), and has the same [[Electron rest mass|mass as an electron]]. When a positron collides with an electron, [[annihilation]] occurs. If this collision occurs at low energies, it results in the production of two or more [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s (see [[electron–positron annihilation]]).

Positrons can be created by [[positron emission]] radioactive decay (through [[weak interaction]]s), or by [[pair production]] from a sufficiently energetic [[photon]] which is interacting with an atom in a material.

==History==

===Theory===

In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] published a paper&lt;ref name="QuantumElectron"&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing that electrons can have both a positive and negative charge. This paper introduced the [[Dirac equation]], a unification of quantum mechanics, [[special relativity]], and the then-new concept of electron [[Spin (physics)|spin]] to explain the [[Zeeman effect]]. The paper did not explicitly predict a new particle but did allow for electrons having either positive or negative energy as solutions. [[Hermann Weyl]] then published a paper discussing the mathematical implications of the negative energy solution.&lt;ref&gt;

 |pmid=16587474
 |pmc=522457
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive-energy solution explained experimental results, but Dirac was puzzled by the equally valid negative-energy solution that the mathematical model allowed. Quantum mechanics did not allow the negative energy solution to simply be ignored, as classical mechanics often did in such equations; the dual solution implied the possibility of an electron spontaneously jumping between positive and negative energy states. However, no such transition had yet been observed experimentally. He referred to the issues raised by this conflict between theory and observation as "difficulties" that were "unresolved".

Dirac wrote a follow-up paper in December 1929&lt;ref name="ElectronProton"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Dirac |first=P. A. M.

 |doi-access=free
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that attempted to explain the unavoidable negative-energy solution for the relativistic electron. He argued that "... an electron with negative energy moves in an external [electromagnetic] field as though it carries a positive charge." He further asserted that all of space could be regarded as a [[Dirac sea|"sea" of negative energy states]] that were filled, so as to prevent electrons jumping between positive energy states (negative electric charge) and negative energy states (positive charge). The paper also explored the possibility of the [[proton]] being an island in this sea, and that it might actually be a negative-energy electron. Dirac acknowledged that the proton having a much greater mass than the electron was a problem, but expressed "hope" that a future theory would resolve the issue.

[[Robert Oppenheimer]] argued strongly against the proton being the negative-energy electron solution to Dirac's equation. He asserted that if it were, the hydrogen atom would rapidly self-destruct.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persuaded by Oppenheimer's argument, Dirac published a paper in 1931 that predicted the existence of an as-yet-unobserved particle that he called an "anti-electron" that would have the same mass and the opposite charge as an electron and that would mutually annihilate upon contact with an electron.&lt;ref&gt;

Likewise, in 1929 [[Chung-Yao Chao]], a graduate student at [[Caltech]], noticed some anomalous results that indicated particles behaving like electrons, but with a positive charge, though the results were inconclusive and the phenomenon was not pursued.&lt;ref name="MehraRechenberg"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson did not coin the term ''positron'', but allowed it at the suggestion of the ''[[Physical Review]]'' journal editor to which he submitted his discovery paper in late 1932. The positron was the first evidence of [[antimatter]] and was discovered when Anderson allowed cosmic rays to pass through a cloud chamber and a lead plate. A magnet surrounded this apparatus, causing particles to bend in different directions based on their electric charge. The ion trail left by each positron appeared on the photographic plate with a curvature matching the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of an electron, but in a direction that showed its charge was positive.&lt;ref name="Penny_Gilmer_6-19-11"&gt;

The positron had also been contemporaneously discovered by [[Patrick Blackett]] and [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1932. Blackett and Occhialini had delayed publication to obtain more solid evidence, so Anderson was able to publish the discovery first.&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;

==Natural production==
{{main|Positron emission}}
Positrons are produced naturally in β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, [[potassium-40]]) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. [[Antineutrino]]s are another kind of antiparticle produced by natural radioactivity (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) [[cosmic rays]]. Recent (as of January 2011) research by the [[American Astronomical Society]] has discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above [[thunderstorm]] clouds; positrons are produced in gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds.&lt;ref&gt;

Antiparticles, of which the most common are positrons due to their low mass, are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the [[pair production]] threshold). During the period of baryogenesis, when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter,&lt;ref&gt;

Positron production from radioactive [[Beta decay|{{Subatomic particle|beta+}} decay]] can be considered both artificial and natural production, as the generation of the radioisotope can be natural or artificial. Perhaps the best known naturally-occurring radioisotope which produces positrons is [[potassium-40]], a long-lived isotope of potassium which occurs as a [[primordial isotope]] of potassium. Even though a small percent of potassium (0.0117%) it is the single most abundant [[radioisotope]] in the human body. In a human body of 70&amp;nbsp;kg mass, about 4,400 nuclei of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K decay per second.&lt;ref&gt;

===Observation in cosmic rays===
{{main|Cosmic ray}}
Satellite experiments have found evidence of positrons (as well as a few antiprotons) in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. These do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the Big Bang, or indeed complex antimatter in the universe (evidence for which is lacking, see below). Rather, the antimatter in cosmic rays appear to consist of only these two elementary particles, probably made in energetic processes long after the Big Bang. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Preliminary results from the presently operating [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (''AMS-02'') on board the [[International Space Station]] show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 [[Wiktionary:gigaelectron volt|GeV]] to 250 GeV. In September 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters.&lt;ref&gt;

Positrons, like anti-protons, do not appear to originate from any hypothetical "antimatter" regions of the universe. On the contrary, there is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as [[antihelium]] nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for. A prototype of the ''AMS-02'' designated ''AMS-01'', was flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any [[Antihelium#Antihelium|antihelium]] at all, the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio.&lt;ref&gt;

==Applications==
Certain kinds of [[particle accelerator]] experiments involve colliding positrons and electrons at relativistic speeds. The high impact energy and the mutual annihilation of these matter/antimatter opposites create a fountain of diverse subatomic particles. Physicists study the results of these collisions to test theoretical predictions and to search for new kinds of particles.

The [[Antiproton Decelerator#ALPHA|ALPHA]] experiment combines positrons with [[antiproton]]s to study properties of [[antihydrogen]].

Gamma rays, emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), are detected in [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanners used in hospitals. PET scanners create detailed three-dimensional images of metabolic activity within the human body.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">The term '''quantum defect''' is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]]. Various meanings are discussed below. Characteristic is that the defect deals with the loss on the smallest energy scale of light: that of the [[quantum]].

==In laser science==
In [[laser]] science, the term "'''quantum defect'''" refers to the fact that the energy of a pump photon is generally higher than that of a ''signal photon'' (photon of the output radiation). The difference of energies goes to the heat; this heat may carry away the excess of [[entropy]] delivered with the multimode incoherent pump.

The quantum defect of a [[laser]] can be defined as part of the energy of the pumping photon, which is lost (not turned into photons at the lasing wavelength) in the [[gain medium]] at the [[lasing]].&lt;ref name="LaserQD"&gt;{{cite journal

At given frequency &lt;math&gt;~\omega_{\rm p}~&lt;/math&gt; of [[pump]] and given frequency &lt;math&gt;~\omega_{\rm s}~&lt;/math&gt; of [[lasing]], the quantum defect &lt;math&gt;~q=\hbar\omega_{\rm p}-\hbar\omega_{\rm s}~&lt;/math&gt;. Such quantum defect has dimension of energy; for the efficient operation, the [[temperature]] of the [[gain medium]]
(measured in units of energy) should be small compared to the quantum defect.

&lt;!--
Some colleagues define the '''quantum defect''' in a different way.
At given frequency &lt;math&gt;~\omega_{\rm p}~&lt;/math&gt; of [[pump]] and given frequency &lt;math&gt;~\omega_{\rm s}~&lt;/math&gt; of [[lasing]], the quantum defect &lt;math&gt;~q=1-\omega_{\rm s}/\omega_{\rm p}~&lt;/math&gt;; according to this definition, '''quantum defect''' is dimensionless
.&lt;ref&gt;
'''[[WHO HAD PUBLISHED A PAPER WITH SUCH DEFINITION??? Reference, please!!]]'''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
!--&gt;
At a fixed pump frequency, the higher the quantum defect, the lower is the upper bound for the power efficiency.

==In Rydberg atoms==
The '''quantum defect''' of a [[Rydberg atom]] refers to a correction applied to the equations governing Rydberg atom behavior to take into account the fact that the inner electrons do not entirely screen their associated charge in the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phy.davidson.edu/StuHome/joesten/IntLab/final/rydberg.htm,{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Rydberg Atoms and the Quantum Defect at the site of [[Davidson College]], Physics department&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used particularly for the alkalis that contain a single electron in their outer shell.

The perfect [[Laplace expansion (potential)|1/''r'' potential]] in the [[hydrogen atom]] leads to an [[electron]] [[binding energy]] given by
  
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{B} = -\dfrac{Rhc}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''R'' is the [[Rydberg constant]], ''h'' is Planck's constant, ''c'' is the speed of light and ''n'' is the [[principal quantum number]].

For multi-electron atoms in Rydberg states with a low value of the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]], there is a high probability of finding the excited electron near the nucleus where it can [[Polarizability|polarize]] or even penetrate the ion core, modifying the potential.  The resulting shift of the energy levels is represented mathematically as an angular momentum dependent quantum defect, δ&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{B} = -\dfrac{Rhc}{(n-\delta_l)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The largest shifts occur when the orbital angular momentum is equal to 0 (normally labelled 's') and these are shown in the table for the [[alkali metals]]:&lt;ref&gt;C.J.Foot, Atomic Physics, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-850695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10934">[[Image:rice chaffs.jpg|thumb|Rice husk]]
'''Rice hulls''' (or '''rice husks''') are the hard protecting coverings of grains of [[rice]]. In addition to protecting rice during the growing season, rice hulls can be put to use as [[building material]], [[fertilizer]], [[insulation material]], or [[fuel]] or [[gasoline]]

==Production==
Rice [[husk|hulls]] are the coatings of seeds, or grains, of rice. The husk protects the seed during the growing season, since it is formed from hard materials, including opaline [[silica]] and [[lignin]]. The hull is mostly indigestible to humans.

[[Winnowing]], used to separate the rice from hulls, is to put the whole rice into a pan and throw it into the air while the wind blows. The light hulls are blown away while the heavy rice fall back into the pan. Later [[Mortar and pestle|pestles]] and a simple machine called a [[rice pounder]] were developed to remove hulls. In 1885 the modern [[rice huller|rice hulling machine]] was invented in Brazil. During the [[miller|milling]] processes, the hulls are removed from the raw grain to reveal whole [[brown rice]], which may then sometimes be milled further to remove the [[bran]] layer, resulting in [[white rice]].

==Uses==
[[File:Bata Candi-candi Batujaya.JPG|thumb|The temples of the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site]] in [[Indonesia]] (5th century AD) were built with bricks containing rice hulls.]]

===Ash===
Combustion of rice hulls affords '''rice husk ash''' (acronym '''RHA'''). This ash is a potential source of amorphous reactive [[silica]], which has a variety of applications in [[materials science]].  Most of the ash is used in the production of [[Portland cement]]&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;Otto W. Flörke, et al.  "Silica" in  Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2008, Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, . {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_583.pub3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.  When burnt completely, the ash can have a [[Air_permeability_specific_surface#Blaine_method|Blaine number]] of as much as 3,600 compared to the Blaine number of cement (between 2,800 and 3,000), meaning it is finer than cement. Silica is the basic component of sand, which is used with cement for plastering and concreting. This fine silica will provide a very compact concrete.  The ash also is a very good thermal insulation material.  The fineness of the ash also makes it a very good candidate for sealing fine cracks in civil structures, where it can penetrate deeper than the conventional cement sand mixture.

A number of possible uses for RHA include absorbents for oils and chemicals, soil ameliorants, a source of silicon, insulation powder in steel mills, as repellents in the form of "vinegar-tar"  release agent in the ceramics industry, as an insulation material.
More specialized applications include the use of this material as a [[catalyst support]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Chumee et al. "Characterization of platinum–iron catalysts supported on MCM-41 synthesized with rice husk silica and their performance for phenol hydroxylation" Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 9 (2008) 015006 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1468-6996/10/1/015006 free download]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
===SiC production===
--&gt;Rice hulls are a low-cost material from which silicon carbide "[[Monocrystalline whisker|whiskers]]" can be manufactured. The SiC whiskers are then used to reinforce ceramic cutting tools, increasing their strength tenfold.&lt;ref name="ORNL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ms.ornl.gov/researchgroups/process/cpg/sic.htm |title=SiC Whisker-Reinforced Ceramic Composites |work=Materials Science and Technology Division - Physical Sciences Directorate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816181003/http://www.ms.ornl.gov/researchgroups/process/cpg/sic.htm |archivedate=2009-08-16 |publisher=[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] |location=Oak Ridge,   TN, USA |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;!--[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/physical_sciences_directorate/mst/--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toothpaste===
In [[Kerala]], [[India]], charcoal from Rice husks (''Umikari'' in [[Malayalam]]) were universally used for over centuries in cleaning teeth, before toothpaste replaced it.

===Brewing===
Rice hulls can be used in [[brewing]] [[beer]] to increase the [[lautering]] ability of a mash.

=== Fertilizer and substrate ===
Rice hulls can be [[Composting|composted]], but their high [[lignin]] content can make this a slow process. Sometimes [[earthworm]]s are used to accelerate the process. Using [[vermicompost]]ing techniques, hulls can be converted to fertilizer in about four months.

Rice hulls that are parboiled (PBH) are used as a substrate or medium for gardening, including certain [[hydroculture]]s. The hulls decay over time. Rice hulls allow drainage,&lt;ref name="woodfibre pgr" /&gt; and retain less water than [[growstones]].&lt;ref name="growstones rice"&gt;{{cite web

===Fireworks===
Rice hulls are coated with fine-grained [[gunpowder]] and used as the main bursting charge in aerial fireworks shells.

===Fuel===
[[File:Packaging of woodfire made by rice residue.jpg|thumb|Rice hulls can be pressed into logs for use in cooking fires instead of wood]]
With proper techniques, rice hulls can be burned and used to power [[steam engine]]s. Some rice mills originally disposed of hulls in this way.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
Unfortunately the direct combustion of rice hulls produces large quantities of smoke. An alternative is [[gasification]]. Rice hulls are easily gasified in top-lit updraft gasifiers. The combustion of this rice hull gas produces a blue flame, and rice hull [[biochar]] makes a good soil amendment.&lt;ref name="ESRLA"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul |last1=Olivier |first2=Todd |last2=Hyman |title=Biomass Gasification and the Benefits of Biochar |url=http://esrla.com/pdf/landfill_06.pdf |date=2012-03-27 |publisher= Engineering, Separation and Recycling LLC |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;!--http://esrla.com/--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juice extraction===
Rice hulls are used as a "press aid" to improve extraction efficiency of [[apple]] [[Fruit press|pressing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vincentcorp.com/press_design/issue198.html Press aids]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pet food fiber===
Rice hulls are an inexpensive [[byproduct]] of human food processing, serving as a source of [[fiber]] that is considered a [[Filler (animal food)|filler]] [[ingredient]] in [[pet food]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=badingredients |title=Ingredients to avoid |publisher=The Dog Food Project |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pillow stuffing===
Rice hulls are used as [[pillow]] stuffing. The pillows are loosely stuffed and considered therapeutic as they retain the shape of the head.

===Insulating material===
Rice hulls themselves are a class A [[thermal insulation|thermal insulating]] material because they are difficult to burn and less likely to allow moisture to propagate [[mold]] or [[fungus|fungi]].&lt;ref name="ricehulls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appropedia.org/Rice_hulls_in_construction |title=Rice hulls in construction - Appropedia: The sustainability wiki |publisher=Appropedia |date=2013-02-23 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as roofing after mixing it with mud and water.

===Particle boards and cardboard===
Rice hulls are also used to make [[particle board]]s and [[cardboard]]. The silica in rice husk make the particle boards less attractive to [[termite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coxworth|first1=Ben|title=Rice husks may find use in cheaper, greener, longer-lasting particleboard|url=https://newatlas.com/rice-husk-particleboard/37730/|website=New Atlas|publisher=GIZMAG PTY LTD 2017|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early life==
[[File:Robert Angus Smith blue plaque .jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] Blue plaque commemorating Smith in Grosvenor Square [[Chorlton-on-Medlock|Manchester]], the site of Smith's laboratory]]
Born at [[Pollokshaws]], Glasgow, Smith was educated at the [[University of Glasgow]] in preparation for ministry in the [[Church of Scotland]] but left before graduating. He worked as a personal tutor and, accompanying a family to [[Gießen]] in 1839, he stayed on in Germany to study [[chemistry]] supervised by [[Justus von Liebig]], earning a PhD in 1841.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Career and research==
On returning to England the same year, he again considered [[Holy Orders]] but instead was attracted to [[Manchester]] to join the chemical laboratory of [[Lyon Playfair]] at the [[Royal Manchester Institution]]. Here he became involved in some of the environmental issues of the world's first industrial city (see ''[[History of Manchester]]''). Playfair left for greener pastures in 1845 and Smith worked at making a living as an independent [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]]. After some initial alarming experiences, Smith refused to take on [[expert witness]] work which was a staple of consulting scientists of the day and which he saw as corrupt. Consequently, when the [[Alkali Inspectorate]] was established by the [[Alkali Act 1863]], Smith's integrity made him the natural candidate. As Queen Victoria's Inspector of Alkali Works, he was the prototype of the scientific civil servant.&lt;ref name=geras /&gt; He held the post until his death.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; He is buried in the graveyard of St Paul's Church on [[Kersal Moor]], [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsparish.org.uk/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042815/http://www.stpaulsparish.org.uk/about.php |archivedate=20 August 2008 |df= }}Retrieved on 10 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 Smith published the book ''Air and Rain: The Beginnings of a Chemical Climatology'', which presents his studies of the chemistry of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; These studies include the discovery, in 1852, of acid rain in northern British cities, a consequence of the burning of coal rich in sulfur.&lt;ref name=geras /&gt; He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iesis.org/honorary-fellows.html|title=
Honorary Members and Fellows|publisher=iesis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death his collection of about 4,000 books was acquired by the library of [[Owens College]], Manchester. They are now in the [[John Rylands University Library]], the successor of the college library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/smithandschunck/ |title=Smith Memorial collection and Schunck Library |publisher=University of Manchester (The) |accessdate=7 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604102131/http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/smithandschunck/ |archivedate=4 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritualism==

Smith with his friend [[William Crookes]], attended a [[séance]] on 21 April 1870 in London. He sent Crookes 15 letters on [[spiritualism]] between April 1869 and 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, William Hodson. (2008). ''William Crookes (1832–1919) and the Commercialization of Science. ''Science'', technology, and Culture, 1700–1945''. Ashgate Publishing. p. 124. {{ISBN|0-7546-6322-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith did not choose to write widely about spiritualism as he believed it may have damaged his scientific reputation. He was a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] from 1882 to 1884. After he died, 89 books on the [[occult]] were discovered in his library.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Peter. (2014).

A '''roving''' is a long and narrow bundle of fiber. Rovings are produced during the process of making [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] yarn from [[wool]] fleece, raw cotton, or other fibres. Their main use is as fibre prepared for spinning, but they may also be used for specialised kinds of knitting or other textile arts.

After [[carding]], the fibres lie roughly parallel in smooth bundles. These are drawn out, by hand or machine, and slightly twisted to form lengths suitable for spinning. These unspun strands of fibre are the rovings. Roving can also mean a roll of these strands, the strands in general (as a [[mass noun]]), or the process of creating them.

Because it is carded, the fibres are less parallel than [[wool top|top]] (which is combed) and are not of uniform length. Carded rovings look fluffier than combed top, which looks smooth and has a high lustre. The fibres in combed top tend to be of a fairly uniform length due to the method of preparation. Though drawing it into strips may line the fibres up a bit.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, Kimberlie and Norton, Marjorie J.T., ''Broadwoven Fabrics'', USITC Publication 3410: 4 {{ISBN|1-4289-5826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depts.ttu.edu/itc/spinprep_lab.htm ''Spinning Prep/Combing Lab''], International Textile Center&lt;/ref&gt; Roving is not to be confused with [[sliver (textiles)|sliver]] as there is twist in roving.

'''Pencil roving''' is a type of roving that has been drawn until it is the size of a fat pencil. It can be used by spinners with minimal drafting (withdrawing fibers from a clump). Knitters also use pencil roving, similar to [[Lopi]] style yarns, or when making a [[Thrum (textiles)|thrummed]] item. (Regular roving can also be used in thrummed knitting.)

{{Wikivoyage}}
'''Skagen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|æ|ɡ|ən}}, {{IPA-da|ˈsɡæːɪn&lt;!--stod?--&gt;|lang}}) is [[Denmark]]'s northernmost town, on the east coast of the [[Skagen Odde]] peninsula in the far north of [[Jutland]], part of [[Frederikshavn Municipality]] in [[North Denmark Region|Nordjylland]], {{convert|41|km}} north of [[Frederikshavn]] and {{convert|108|km}} northeast of [[Aalborg]]. The [[Port of Skagen]] is Denmark's main fishing port and it also has a thriving tourist industry, attracting 2 million people annually.

Originally the name was applied to the peninsula but it now usually refers to the town itself. The settlement began in the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its [[herring]] industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and evening light, towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of [[impressionism|Impressionist]] artists now known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the [[Skagensbanen]] railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.

In the early 1910s, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and [[Queen Alexandrine]] often visited Skagen and brought friends from other European monarchies. They built the summer residence [[Klitgaarden]], completed in 1914. Between the 1930s and 1950s the town grew rapidly, with the population more than doubling from 4,048 in 1930 to 9,009 in 1955. Skagen reached a peak population of 14,050 in 1980, after which it gradually declined. As of 1 January 2014 it has a population of 8,198. Thanks to the artistic community which still remains in Skagen, the local arts and crafts trade remains important to the income of the town with its numerous crafts shops and galleries. Chains such as the international jeweller [[Skagen Designs]] have branches in the town, and given the abundance of fresh fish coming in at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple in Skagen's restaurants.

[[The Sand-Covered Church|St Lawrence's Church]] was built just outside the village at the end of the 14th century, but after it was buried in drifting sand it was replaced by [[Skagen Church]] in 1841 designed by [[Christian Frederik Hansen]]. It was redeveloped in 1909–10 by [[Ulrik Adolph Plesner|Ulrik Plesner]] who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen, including Klitgaarden and the railway station. Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them, including [[Brøndums Hotel]], [[Skagens Museum]], [[Michael and Anna Ancher House|Michael and Anna Ancher's House]], and [[Drachmann's House]].

Skagen's first school was the ''Latinskole'', a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen, and in 1921, Skagen's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships, and in 1955, the [[Danish Folkeskole Education|public school]] ''Ankermedets skole'' was opened on Skagavej. The primary gymnasium of the town, Skagen Kultur- og Fritidscenter, opened in 1972, and was later expanded with an aquatic centre and a number of smaller training facilities. Skagen's Sportscenter was completed in 1974, primary to accommodate badminton and tennis. The local football club, Skagen Idræts Klub, was founded in 1946 and reached the Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in [[Football in Denmark|Danish football]], as their best position. The Hvide Klit Golf Club is {{convert|17| km|abbr=on}} south of the town.

[[Skagen station]] is the most northerly railway station in mainland Denmark and is the terminus of the Skagensbanen. [[Nordjyske Jernbaner]] operates the local train service between Skagen, Frederikshavn and Aalborg with onward national connections by [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]]. From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to [[Gothenburg]], [[Oslo]] and [[Læsø]]. [[Aalborg Airport]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Skagen.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Skagens tilsandede kirke.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The sand-engulfed Buried Church (''tilsandede kirke'') at Skagen.]]
Skagen was mentioned as far back as the first century AD by [[Pliny the Elder]]:
:"Promenturium Cimbrorum excurrens in maria longe paeninsulam efficit quae Tastris appellatur" (Book IV, 97)
:"The promontory of the Cimbri running far out into the seas makes a peninsula, which is called Tastris."

This is the only time the name Tastris is mentioned but Skagen itself, first documented as ''Skaffuen'' in 1284, simply means narrow promontory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelalderinfo.dk/bynavne.php Flemming Elimar Jensen, "Hvad betyder bynavnene &amp; landsdels navne?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215091902/http://www.middelalderinfo.dk/bynavne.php |date=15 February 2015 }}, MiddelalderInfo. {{da icon}} Retrieved 10 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dsd/&gt;

The first building in the area, dating from the 12th century, was in [[Højen]] on the west side of the peninsula. It belonged to Tronder, a shepherd who also became Skagen's first fisherman. Around 1340, Vesterby, on the east coast (to the south west of today's harbour), developed into the main village. Further to the south west, [[The Sand-Covered Church|St Lawrence's Church]] was built at the end of the 14th century. In 1413, [[Erik of Pommern]] granted Skagen the status of [[market town]] with the result that for a time it became [[Vendsyssel]]'s largest community with up to 2,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=slf&gt;[http://www.skagenlokal.dk/tidstavle.html "Tidstavle"], Skagen Lokalhistoriske Forening. {{da icon}} Retrieved 10 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1549 a grammar school was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first lighthouse was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked off the coast of Skagen.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.

===17th–19th centuries===
[[File:Skagenhaus 1.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Skagen house: red tiled roof with white trimmings, yellow-plastered walls and a white fence]]
In the 17th century, fishing suffered from a decline in herring stocks. Shortly after the beginning of the [[Torstensson War]], the Swedish army arrived in Skagen in January 1644, plundering the town.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danskekonger.dk/andet/torstenssonkrigen "Torstenssonkrigen 1643–45"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109110521/http://www.danskekonger.dk/andet/torstenssonkrigen |date=9 November 2013 }}, Danske konger. {{da icon}} Retrieved 9 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Skagen's White Lighthouse]] with adjoining accommodation for the keeper was built in 1747. In 1775, accumulations of drifting sand made it difficult to access St Lawrence's Church, finally leading to its closure and partial demolition in 1795. Its remaining artefacts were sold by auction in 1810. St Lawrence's was replaced by [[Skagen Church]], completed in 1841 and redesigned in the local style by Ulrik Plesner in 1910.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt;

[[File:Brøndums Hotel 1891-92.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Skagen Painters]] in the Dining room in Brøndums Hotel, Skagen, ca. 1891]]
On a single day in 1825, 23 ships were left stranded off the coast.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; In 1833, [[Martinus Rørbye]] became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, almost half a century before the arrival of the Skagen Painters.{{sfn|Folsach|samling|1996|p=48}} Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; In 1858, the [[Skagen Lighthouse|grey lighthouse]] was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the [[cholera]] epidemic of 1853.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt;

[[Hans Christian Andersen]] visited the town in 1859. During his stay at Brøndums Hotel, the future painter [[Anna Ancher]], daughter of the inn-keeper, was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2009/07/07/anna-ancher-celebrated/ "Anna Ancher celebrated"], Euronews, 7 July 2009. Retrieved 10 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/kultur/anna-ancher-indtager-washington|title=Anna Ancher indtager Washington|accessdate=9 November 2013|date=1 March 2013|last=Dannemand Jensen|first=Henrik|publisher=[[Berlingske]]|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, the author [[Holger Drachmann]] and the painters [[Fritz Thaulow]] and [[Karl Madsen]] arrived in Skagen, the first of the colony of artists which became known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. They were followed by [[Carl Locher]] in 1872, [[Michael Ancher]] in 1874 and [[Peder Severin Krøyer]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt;   
 
In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the railway.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=24}} In 1890, the [[Skagensbanen]] narrow-gauge railway from [[Frederikshavn]] finally arrived in Skagen, connecting the town to the rest of Denmark.&lt;ref name=sbanen&gt;[http://www.nordjyllands-jernbaner.dk/ "Skagensbanen"], Nordjyllands jernbaner. {{da icon}} Retrieved 10 October 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were widened in 1916 to avoid the need to transfer cargoes of fish in Frederikshavn. Many of the town's typical yellow-plastered houses with red roofs which grew up along Sankt Laurentii Vej from 1890 to 1930 were designed by Ulrik Plesner. He was also the architect behind many other buildings in the town, including the railway station, [[Brøndums Hotel]] and [[Skagen Museum]]. Skagen Missionshus was opened in 1896.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt;

===20th century===
{{Double image|right|Kong Christian 10.jpg|180|Klitgården Alexandrine 1913.jpg|185|Left: [[Christian X of Denmark]]. Right: [[Queen Alexandrine]] at Skagen in 1913}}

In 1904-7, the fishing harbour was built with inner and outer sections under the patronage of hydraulic engineer [[Palle Bruun]]. It was inaugurated on 20 November 1907,{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=24}} and later additions were made for cold storage and the fish processing industry. The distinctive warehouses next to the harbour were designed by [[Thorvald Bindesbøll]].

In the early 1910s, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and [[Queen Alexandrine]] often visited Skagen in the royal yacht ''[[HDMY Dannebrog (1879)|Kongeskibet Dannebrog]]''. Occasionally they arrived by train and brought friends from other European monarchies and stayed at the Brøndums and Grenen hotels.

In the 1930s, development of the town as a tourist attraction led to the opening of new hotels. In 1931, the residents of Skagen and their famous friends campaigned for a monument to be established on the square in the town, commemorating the fishermen and lifeboatmen of Jutland. Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen was commissioned to erect a {{convert|3|m}} bronze statue of a lifeboatman in garb, holding a lifeline.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=27}} The monument was showcased at the Free Exhibition Hall in Copenhagen in the spring of 1931, before fundraising enabled it to be brought by sea to Skagen on 10 November 1932.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=27}} In October 1938, lightning struck the Skagens Badehotel, affecting the wing with the salons and music rooms. During World War II, the hotel was taken over by the Germans, until it was demolished in 1943.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=24}} Further facilities were developed in the 1950s. From the 1960s, housing estates were constructed to the north, forming a built-up area extending to Højen. Anna and Michael Ancher's house was opened as a museum (1967) and the new town hall was completed in 1969.&lt;ref name=dsd/&gt;&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; The [[Skagen Festival]] was founded in 1971, making it the oldest music festival in the country.

In 1977, [[Drachmanns House]] was broken into and four paintings were stolen, and then in 1980, a painting by [[Christian Krohg]] was stolen from Skagens Museum.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt;

Several fires and industrial incidents occurred in the 1980s. In 1981, an oil slick affected the coastline of Skagen municipality, and in 1985 a pipe bomb exploded at Ankermedet School. Skagen ice factory was affected by a chemical incident in 1989.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; A new shrimp factory opened in the industrial area in 1991, while the local cinema was closed in 1993.

==Skagen Painters==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
[[File:Hipp hipp hurra! Konstnärsfest på Skagen - Peder Severin Krøyer.jpg|thumb|left|P.S. Krøyer: ''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'' (1888)]]
The [[Skagen Painters]] were a group of Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until the turn of the century. They were attracted by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint ''[[en plein air]]'' following the example of the French [[Impressionist]]s while sometimes adopting the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] approach of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon School]]. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.{{sfn|Svanholm|2001|pp=30-43}}

The group was reputed to have adopted a bohemian lifestyle. It encompassed not only painters, but also writers, and other influential people. While only a few were full-time residents of the area, they were often joined by family and friends, especially during the summer months. The group initially revolved around [[Michael Ancher]] and his wife to be [[Anna Ancher|Anna]], the only member of the group who was a native of Skagen. [[P.S. Krøyer]], who arrived in 1882, was perhaps the most colourful member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer "P.S. Krøyer"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 5 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'' shows several of the artists celebrating around a table out in the garden. The painters included the Swedes [[Oscar Björck]] and [[Johan Krouthén]], the Norwegians [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Eilif Peterssen]], and the Danes [[Karl Madsen]], [[Laurits Tuxen]], [[Marie Triepcke Krøyer Alfvén]], [[Carl Locher]], [[Viggo Johansen]] and [[Thorvald Niss]].  The group also included the writers [[Holger Drachmann]], [[Georg Brandes]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] and the Swedish composer [[Hugo Alfvén]]. They often gathered in [[Brøndums Hotel]] whose dining room now forms part of [[Skagens Museum]].{{sfn|Svanholm|2001|pp=30-43}}

In 1890, the railway to Skagen not only led to the expansion of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists' colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, [[Laurits Tuxen]] in 1901, Holger Drachmann in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Mona Jensen (editor), "Danske kunstnerkolonier. Skagen. Fyn. Bornholm", Aarhus Kunstmuseums Forlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, continued to visit the area. They included [[Jørgen Aabye]], [[Tupsy Clement|Tupsy]] and [[Gad Frederik Clement]], [[Ella Heide]], [[Frederik Lange]] and [[Johannes Wilhjelm]], some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum's has a large collection of works from all the recognized artists who painted in Skagen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturarv.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/kulturarv/museer/dokumenter/arbejdsplaner/Skagens_Museum.pdf "Skagens Museum: Insamling"], Kulturarv.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 29 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Skagen from the lighthouse.JPG|thumb|250px|View of Skagen from the north]]
[[File:Skagen map.png|thumb|250px|Street map of the main area of Skagen.]]
Skagen is Denmark's northernmost town, located {{convert|41|km}} north of Frederikshavn, {{convert|108|km}} northeast of [[Aalborg]], and {{convert|226|km}} northeast of [[Aarhus]] by road.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{Google maps | url =https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=57.716667,10.583333&amp;q=loc:57.716667,10.583333&amp;hl=en&amp;t=h&amp;z=12 | accessdate =1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from the  peninsula which projects into the waters between the North Sea and the straits of Denmark. The oldest areas lie along the south coast. [[Gammel Skagen]] (Old Skagen), also known as Højen, is located next to ''Nordstrand'' on the western side. Vesterby and Østerby are notable for their little fishermen's cottages and narrow streets.&lt;ref name=dsd/&gt; [[Danish national road 40]] to Frederikshavn passes through Skagen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_AE7B478523809AFB954EF1FAF696D1D59D830300/filename/RPT085.pdf "Udbygning af landevejen Ålbæk – Skagen"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Naturstyrelsen. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Grenen]]''' (also known as ''the Skagen Odde peninsula'') is bordered by [[Ålbæk Bay]] (''Ålbæk Bugt'') to the east on the [[Kattegat]] and Tannis Bay (''Tannis Bugt'') to the west on the [[Skagerrak]]. The area is picturesque, and distinguished by its low, yellow houses with red tile roofs nestled into the [[beach]] areas.{{sfn|Lonely Planet|2005|p=285}}
The wild landscape was largely formed by a severe process of [[desertification]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Problems with moving [[dune]]s and desertification were subsequently brought under control in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by establishing large plantations of grasses, bushes and fir trees. Two significant migratory dunes remain in the area, one of which is the enormous [[Råbjerg Mile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toppenafdanmark.dk/denmark/raabjerg-mile-gdk640523 "Råbjerg Mile"], Toppen af Danmark. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bird life in Skagen ===
Skagen is the place in Denmark where the most bird species can be experienced, a total of 367 out of 471 bird species in the country.(2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skagenfuglestation.dk/fugletraekket/arter-og-tal|title=Arter og tal|author=|date=|website=www.skagenfuglestation.dk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netfugl.dk/dklist.php|title=DK listen - Netfugl.dk|author=|date=|website=www.netfugl.dk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year round the area around Skagen, especially Grenen, is visited by hundreds of birdwatchers from all over Denmark, particularly in April–May and the beginning of June and to a lesser degree in August–November. Furthermore, the area is visited by birdwatchers from Sweden, Norway and Germany.

Other well-visited locations for birdwatchers are Ellekrattet, Nordstrand (near Batterivej), Skagen Harbour, Flagbakken southwest of the town as well as horse fields and brushwood near Fyrvej, Bøjlevejen and Buttervej.

Every day all year round Skagen Bird Observatory observes the migration on Grenen from the highest sand dune located between the parking lot and Grenen: "The World's End".

Volunteers at [https://www.skagenfuglestation.dk/ Skagen Bird Observatory] ring thousands of small birds in the Skagen area every year with permission from the [[University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum|Zoological Museum]] in Copenhagen.

==Climate==
Being surrounded by the sea in three directions, Skagen has a cool [[oceanic climate]] with a lack of temperature extremes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=14060&amp;cityname=Skagen%2C+Denmark&amp;units=|title=Skagen, Denmark Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maritime and moderated characteristics is shared with the rest of the country.

==Demographics==
The population of Skagen has mostly grown steadily, reaching a peak of 14,050 people in 1980, but has shown a marked decline in the 21st century. In 1672 Skagen had a population of 1,004, but by 1781 this had declined to 650.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; The 1801 population of 834 began to grow significantly in subsequent decades, reaching 1,052 people in 1824 and jumping to 1,632 by 1840.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; By 1850, however, it had dropped to 1,400, after which is again began to grow steadily. Major growth occurred in the 1870s and 1880s, with the population growing from 1,615 in 1870 to 1,954 in 1880 and 2,323 inhabitants in 1890.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; Several of the new inhabitants were artists, who significantly altered the ethnic composition of Skagen, as they brought their friends and families from abroad to join the colony at Skagen. Noticeable change occurred between 1901 and 1906, when the population grew from 2,438 to 2,936, and again in the late 1910s, growing from 3,212 in 1916 to 3,854 in 1921.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; Major growth began to take place in the 1930s and 1940s in Skagen which grew  from 4,048 inhabitants in 1930 to 5,358 in 1940. Skagen's population more than doubled between 1930 and 1955 when it reached a population of 9,009.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; By 1960, Skagen had 10,213 inhabitants, growing to 11,253 in 1965. Following a municipal merger in 1971, the population jumped from 11,749 to 13,513.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; Thereafter the population grew very steadily, reaching a peak of 14,050 in 1980.  There has since been a steady decline, with 13,724 people recorded in 1990, 13,298 in 1994, and 12,691 in 2000.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; In the 2000s, the permanent population of Skagen has shown a marked decline, falling from 12,213 in 2003&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; to 8,088 inhabitants in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistikbanken.dk/BY1|title=Statistikbanken|author=|date=|website=www.statistikbanken.dk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{see also|Port of Skagen}}
[[File:Skagen værft.JPG|thumb|270px|Wharf of the [[Port of Skagen]]]]
For generations, Skagen's economy has been based on its fishing industry which continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest [[fish oil]] factory. The town's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at dawn in the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.{{sfn|Porter|Prince|2009|p=403}}

Tourism has now become the town's main industry. Initially attracted by its associations with the Skagen Painters, well-to-do visitors sought to benefit from its special light, colour and its fishermen. Their interest led to new hotels, summer houses and expensive villas. The old fishing village was transformed into a miniature city with fine streets lined with boutiques. From the 1960s, it became increasingly fashionable for the upper-classes to spend their summers in Skagen.{{sfn|Lindeborg|Lindkvist|2013|p=64}}

Galleries selling local art and reproductions of Skagen's most iconic paintings have spread across the town, making it one of the places in Denmark with most galleries. Thanks to the town's growing reputation, sailing enthusiasts from Norway, Sweden and Denmark are now also among its frequent visitors. The quality brand name of Skagen has spread far afield, resulting in the establishment of the successful American watch company [[Skagen Designs]] which "set out to create a design driven company centred around the welcoming spirit of the city".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagen.com/us/en/about-us.html|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=skagen.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a new tourist initiative "The Top of Denmark" targets Skagen as a year-round attraction, not just a summer resort.{{sfn|Lindeborg|Lindkvist|2013|p=64}} The harbour is also being adapted to accommodate large international cruise ships.

Until 2007, Skagen was a municipality in its own right with a substantial local administration. With the reforms of 2007, it became part of Frederikshavn Municipality with a resulting loss in administrative jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skagen-tourist.dk/nordjylland/skagen-historisk-set "Skagen historisk set"], Skagen-tourist.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?KoebstadID=50 "Skagen"], Dansk Center for Byhistorie. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank of Skagen was established in 1862, and in 1865 a telegraph station was established in the town.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; The pharmacy opened in 1904, a hospital in 1916, and telephone services were automated in 1956.&lt;ref name=slf/&gt; Ankermedet School was established in 1955.

Currently the harbour is being enlarged in order to accommodate larger vessels, especially cruise ships. From 2015 the enlarged harbour is expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present. The new harbour should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the harbour from 2,000 today to some 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and fish oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/vaekst/boomtown-paa-toppen-stoerste-investering-i-skagen-i-100-aar|title=Boomtown på toppen: Største investering i Skagen i 100 år|author=Lars Erik Skovgaard|publisher=''Berlingske''|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=14 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shops and restaurants===

[[File:The lighthouse at skagen denmark 6th of may 2006.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Skagen Lighthouse]]]]
At the headland at [[Grenen]], the northernmost point of Denmark, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. Because of their different densities, a clear dividing line can be seen. As a result of turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Grenen "Grenen"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 12 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These frequent losses combined with the town's strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark's earliest lighthouses, [[Skagen's Vippefyr|Vippefyr]], a [[lever light]] constructed in 1627. A faithful copy has now been constructed on the site of the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skagen-tourist.dk/denmark/vippefyret-gdk642658 "Vippefyret"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 12 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Lighthouse (''det Hvide fyr'') just north of the town is Denmark's oldest brick-built lighthouse. With a height of {{convert|21|m|abbr=on}}, it was designed by [[Philip de Lange]] and lit for the first time in 1747. In 1858, it was replaced by the Grey Lighthouse (''det Grå fyr'') 2&amp;nbsp;km further north. Restored in 1960, the White Lighthouse now houses art exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_fyr/Det_Hvide_Fyr_i_Skagen "Det Hvide Fyr i Skagen"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 12 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Churches===
[[File:Skagen church.jpg|thumb|left|The modern [[Skagen Church]]]]
The old village church from the 14th century is now known as [[The Sand-Covered Church]] as only its tower can still be seen.  Sand began drifting in from Råbjerg Mile around 1600, the area surrounding the church becoming affected by the [[Dune#Desertification|desertification]] which destroyed the fields. In 1775, the church door had to be dug free for the congregation to be able to attend the service, and for the following 20 years, the Skageners struggled to keep the church free from sand, without being allowed to close it down. In 1795 the church was closed by royal decree and the body of the church demolished.&lt;ref name=kirkehistorie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkehistorie.dk/hjor/sogn1198.htm|title=Skagen gamle kirke (den tilsandede)|publisher=Danmarks Kirkehistorie|language=Danish|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{sfn|Osborne|Mouritsen|2010|p=261}} A new church was built in 1841 to the design of [[Christian Frederik Hansen]]. The design was adapted in 1909–10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen. Plesner collaborated with [[Thorvald Bindesbøll]] on the interior. Anne L. Hansen created interior decorations and a new colour scheme in 1989.&lt;ref name=dsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/Skagen|title=Skagen|language=Danish|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Skagens Museum}}
Towards the end of the 19th century, Skagen became the summer venue of a group of artists who were attracted by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes.{{sfn|Ancher|Ancher|Sandby|Agerholm|2000|p=np}} Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and [[Degn Brøndum]], who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989.{{sfn|Ancher|Ancher|Sandby|Agerholm|2000|p=np}} Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works of art at its disposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/ "Skagens Museum"].

==Education==
Skagen's first school was the ''Latinskole'', a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen: one in Vesterby, another in Østerby and a third in Højen. As a result of evolving legislation, a new public primary school (''Borgerskolen'') designed by A. Haunstrup was completed in 1901. A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate the growing number of pupils. A secondary school (''Realskolen'') was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on Sct. Laurentii vej. The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended.

The '''smallest organisms''' found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of [[organism]] size; including [[volume]], [[mass]], [[height]], [[length]], or [[genome]] size.
 
Given the incomplete nature of [[Knowledge#Scientific knowledge|scientific knowledge]], it is possible that the smallest organism is undiscovered. Furthermore, there is some debate over the definition of [[life]], and what entities qualify as organisms; consequently the smallest known organism (microorganism) is debatable.

== Microorganisms ==

=== Viruses ===
Many [[Biology|biologists]] consider [[virus]]es to be non-living because they lack a [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure and cannot [[metabolism|metabolize]] by themselves, requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesize new products. A minority of scientists hold that, because viruses do have [[genetic material]] and can employ the metabolism of their host, they can be considered organisms. As well, an emerging idea that is gaining traction among some virologists is the concept of the virocell, in which the actual [[phenotype]] of a virus is the infected cell, and the virus particle is simply a reproductive or dispersal stage, much like pollen or a spore.&lt;ref name="Forterre 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. Forterre |title=The virocell concept and environmental microbiology|journal=The ISME Journal|year=2012|doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.110 |volume=7 |pages=233–236|pmc=3554396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest viruses in terms of genome size are single-stranded DNA ([[SsDNA virus|ssDNA]]) viruses. Perhaps the most famous is the [[bacteriophage]] [[Phi-X174]] with a genome size of 5386 [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/265687a0 |title=Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage ΦX174 DNA |year=1977 |last1=Sanger |first1=F. |last2=Air |first2=G. M. |last3=Barrell |first3=B. G. |last4=Brown |first4=N. L. |last5=Coulson |first5=A. R. |last6=Fiddes |first6=J. C. |last7=Hutchison |first7=C. A. |last8=Slocombe |first8=P.

For example, [[Porcine circovirus]] type 1 has a genome of only 1759 nucleotides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=APorcine circoviruses--small but powerful |vauthors=Finsterbusch T, Mankertz A |year=2009 | journal = Virus Research | volume = 143 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–183 | pmid=19647885 | doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2009.02.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a capsid diameter of only 17&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phene.cpmc.columbia.edu/ICTVdB/WWW/16002005.htm ICTVdB Virus Description – 00.016.0.01.005.

However, the two [[capsid]]s making up the virus are fused; divided, the capsids would be 15&amp;nbsp;nm in length. Other environmentally characterized ssDNA viruses such as CRESS DNA viruses as well as others can have genomes that are considerably less that 2,000 nucleotides.&lt;ref name="Rosario 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K. Rosario |author2=R.O. Schenck |author3=R.C. Harbeitner |author4=S.N. Lawler |author5=M. Breitbart |title=Novel circular single-stranded DNA viruses identified in marine invertebrates reveal high sequence diversity and consistent predicted intrinsic disorder patterns within putative structural proteins |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|year=2015|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.00696 |volume=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labonte 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.M. Labonté |author2=C.A. Suttle|title=Previously unknown and highly divergent ssDNA viruses populate the oceans|journal=The ISME Journal|year=2013|doi=10.1038/ismej.2013.110 |volume=7 |pages=2169–2177|pmc=3806263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest [[RNA virus]]es in terms of [[genome]] size are small [[retrovirus]]es such as [[rous sarcoma virus]] with genomes of 3.5 [[Base pair|kilo base pairs (kb)]] and particle diameters of 80 [[1 E-9 m|nanometres (nm)]]. The smallest double stranded [[DNA virus]]es are the [[Hepadnaviridae|hepadnaviruses]] such as [[Hepatitis B]], at 3.2 kb and 42&amp;nbsp;nm; [[parvovirus]]es have smaller [[capsid]]s, at 18-26&amp;nbsp;nm, but larger genomes, at 5 kb. It is important to consider other self replicating genetic elements, such as [[Satellite (biology)|satelliviruses]], [[viroid]]s and [[ribozymes]].

=== Obligate endosymbiotic bacteria ===
The genome of ''[[Nasuia deltocephalinicola]]'', a symbiont of the European pest leafhopper, [[Macrosteles quadripunctulatus]] consists of a [[Circular bacterial chromosome|circular chromosome]] of 112,031 base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Gordon M.|last2=Abbà|first2=Simona|last3=Kube|first3=Michael|last4=Marzachì|first4=Cristina|title=Complete Genome Sequences of the Obligate Symbionts "Candidatus Sulcia muelleri" and "Ca.

''[[Nanoarchaeum|Nanoarchaeum equitans]]'''s genome is 490,885 nucleotides long.

=== ''Pelagibacter ubique'' ===
[[Pelagibacter ubique]] is one of the smallest known '''free-living''' bacterium with a length of 0.37-0.89 μm and an average cell diameter of 0.12-0.20 μm. They also have the smallest free-living bacterium genome; 1.8Mbp, 1354 protein genes, 35 RNA genes. They are one of the most common and smallest organisms in the ocean, with their total weight equaling more than all fish presently in the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Pelagibacter_ubique|title=Pelagibacter ubique - microbewiki|author=|date=|website=microbewiki.kenyon.edu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' ===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', a [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[bacterium]] which lives in the [[primate]] bladder, waste disposal organs, genital, and respiratory tracts, is thought to be the smallest known organism capable of independent [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[reproduction]]. With a size of approximately 200 to 300 [[nanometer|nm]], ''M. genitalium'' is an [[Ultramicrobacteria|ultramicrobacterium]], smaller than other small bacteria, including [[rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydia]]. However, the vast majority of bacterial strains have not been studied, and the marine ultramicrobacteria ''Sphingomonas'' sp strain RB2256 is reported to have passed through a 220&amp;nbsp;nm [[ultrafiltration|ultrafilter]]. A complicating factor is nutrient-downsized bacteria, bacteria that become much smaller due to a lack of available [[nutrient]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/sep2001/1001464156.Gb.r.html |title=Re: What is the smallest living thing? |publisher=Madsci.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Urzwerg.jpg|thumb|100px|''[[Nanoarchaeum equitans]]'' and [[Archaea|archaeon]] host, ''[[Ignicoccus]]'']]

=== ''Nanoarchaeum'' ===
''[[Nanoarchaeum|Nanoarchaeum equitans]]'' is a species of tiny [[microbe]] 400 [[nanometre|nm]] in diameter. It was discovered in 2002 in a [[hydrothermal vent]] off the coast of [[Iceland]] by [[Karl Stetter]]. A [[thermophile]] that grows in near-[[boil]]ing temperatures, ''Nanoarchaeum'' appears to be an obligatory [[symbiosis|symbiont]] on the [[archaea|archaeon]] ''[[Ignicoccus]]''; it must be in contact with the host organism to survive.

=== Eukaryotes ===
[[Prasinophyte]] [[alga]]e of the genus ''[[Ostreococcus]]'' is the smallest free-living [[eukaryote]]. The single cell of an ''Ostreococcus'' measures only 0.8 [[micrometre|μm]] across.

== Animals ==
Several species of [[Myxozoa]] (obligately parasitic [[cnidarian]]s) never grow larger than 20&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;Fiala, Ivan. 2008. Myxozoa. Version 10 July 2008 (under construction). http://tolweb.org/Myxozoa/2460/2008.07.10 in The Tree of Life Web Project, http://tolweb.org/&lt;/ref&gt; One of the smallest species (''Myxobolus shekel'') is no more than 8.5&amp;nbsp;µm when fully grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two new species of Myxobolus (Myxozoa: Myxosporea: Bivalvulida) infecting an Indian major carp and a cat fish in wetlands of Punjab, India | pmc=3235390 | pmid=23024499 | doi=10.1007/s12639-011-0061-4 | volume=35 | year=2011 | journal=J Parasit Dis | pages=169–76 | last1 = Kaur | first1 = H | last2 = Singh | first2 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Molluscs]] ===
==== [[Bivalvia]] ====
The shell of the nut clam ''[[Condylonucula maya]]'' grows only 0.54 mm long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abele |first1=Doris |last2=Brey |first2=Thomas |last3=Philipp |first3=Eva |title=Part N, Revised, Volume 1, Chapter 7: Ecophysiology of Extant Marine Bivalvia|website= Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology |url=https://journals.ku.edu/treatiseonline/article/view/6583 |doi=10.17161/to.v0i0.6583}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== [[Gastropods]] ====

It measures 0.32 to 0.46&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Páll-Gergely|first1=Barna|last2=Hunyadi|first2=András|last3=Jochum|first3=Adrienne|last4=Asami|first4=Takahiro|title=Seven new hypselostomatid species from China, including some of the world's smallest land snails (Gastropoda, Pulmonata, Orthurethra)|journal=ZooKeys|date=28 September 2015|volume=523|pages=31–62|doi=10.3897/zookeys.523.6114|pmid=26478698|pmc=4602296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Newly Discovered Land Snail Is The Tiniest In The World|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-land-snail-tiniest-in-the-world_563907f9e4b079a43c04dfe2?section=india&amp;adsSiteOverride=in|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=The Huffington Post|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest land snail is ''[[Acmella nana]]''. Discovered in Borneo, Malaysia, and described in November 2015, it measures only 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geggel|first1=Laura|title=Micro Mollusk Breaks Record for World's Tiniest Snail|url=http://www.livescience.com/52664-borneo-smallest-snail.html|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=LiveScience|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record was that of ''[[Angustopila dominikae]]'' from China, which was reported in September 2015.

=== [[Arthropods]] ===

==== Smallest crustacean ====
The smallest [[crustacean]], and indeed the smallest [[arthropod]], is the [[tantulocarid]] ''[[Stygotantulus stocki]]'', at a length of only {{convert|94|um|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="M&amp;D"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://atiniui.nhm.org/pdfs/3839/3839.pdf |title=An Updated Classification of the Recent Crustacea |author=Joel W.

==== [[Arachnids]] ====
[[Eriophyid]] mites measure 125 to 250&amp;nbsp;μm in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mohanasudaram, M. |year=1987 |title=Studies on the genus ''Aceria'' (Acari, Eriophyidae) from South India |journal=Journal of Acarology |volume=12 |issue=1 &amp; 2 |pages=15–88 |publisher=Acarological Society of India |url=http://www.acarology.in/download/Vol12_1_%202.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903044648/http://www.acarology.in/download/Vol12_1_%202.pdf |archivedate=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insects ====
Adult males of the parasitic wasp ''[[Dicopomorpha echmepterygis]]'' can be as small as 139 μm long, smaller than some species of protozoa (single-cell creatures); females are 40% larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_38.shtml |title=University of Florida Book of Insect Records |publisher=Entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu |date=1998-04-17 |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013854/http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_38.shtml |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Megaphragma|Megaphragma caribea]]'' from [[Guadeloupe]], measuring 170&amp;nbsp;μm long, is another contender for smallest known insect in the world.
* '''Beetles'''
Beetles of the tribe [[Ptiliinae|Nanosellini]] are all less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm long; the smallest confirmed specimen is of ''[[Scydosella musawasensis]]'' at 325&amp;nbsp;μm long; a few other nanosellines are reportedly smaller, in historical literature, but none of these records have been confirmed using accurate modern tools. These are among the tiniest non-parasitic insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The smallest [[vertebrate]]s (and smallest amphibians) known are ''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'' frogs from Papua New Guinea, which range in length from {{convert|7.0|-|8.0|mm|in}}, and average {{convert|7.7|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="TinyAustralian"&gt;{{cite news |title=World's tiniest frogs found in Papua New Guinea |author= |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/worlds-tiniest-frogs-found-in-papua-new-guinea/story-fn3dxity-1226242332383 |newspaper=The Australian |date=12 January 2012 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rittmeyeretal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rittmeyer |first1=Eric N. |last2=Allison |first2=Allen |last3=Gründler |first3=Michael C. |last4=Thompson |first4=Derrick K. |last5=Austin |first5=Christopher C. |year=2012 |title=Ecological guild evolution and the discovery of the world's smallest vertebrate |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= e29797|publisher= |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029797 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029797 |accessdate=11 January 2012 |pmid=22253785 |pmc=3256195|bibcode=2012PLoSO...729797R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the title of smallest vertebrate was held by members of the fish [[genus]] ''[[Paedocypris]]'' of [[Indonesia]].

=== Fish ===
{{main|List of smallest fish}}
The world's smallest fish based on the minimum size at maturity is ''[[Paedocypris progenetica]]'' from [[Indonesia]], with mature females measuring as little as {{convert|7.9|mm|abbr=on}} in [[standard length]].&lt;ref name=Pprogenetica&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Paedocypris | species = progenetica | month = September| year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fish, a member of the [[Cyprinidae|carp family]], has a translucent body and a head unprotected by a skeleton.

Male individuals of the [[anglerfish]] species ''[[Photocorynus spiniceps]]'' have been documented to be {{convert|6.2|-|7.3|mm|in}} at maturity, and thus claimed to be a smaller species. However, these survive only by [[Chimera (genetics)#"Parasitic" chimerism in anglerfish|sexual parasitism]] and the female individuals reach the significantly larger size of {{convert|50.5|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4645708.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scientists find 'smallest fish' | date=2006-01-25 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amonline.net.au/fishes/faq/smallest.htm |title=What is the smallest species of fish? |publisher=Amonline.net.au |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220152323/http://amonline.net.au/fishes/faq/smallest.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4666736.stm | work=BBC News | title=Smallest fish compete for honours | date=2006-01-31 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/041027_Smallest_Fish.html Bragging Rights: The Smallest Fish Ever | LiveScience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706153957/http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/041027_Smallest_Fish.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amphibians ===

==== Salamanders ====
The average snout-to-[[Cloaca|vent]] length of several specimens of the salamander ''[[Thorius arboreus]]'' was only {{convert|17|mm|in}}.

==== Frogs ====
Frogs include the smallest vertebrates known. The smallest known frog species is ''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'', with a snout-vent length reported as 7.7&amp;nbsp;mm, which occurs among leaf-litter in the tropical montane forests of New Guinea. Other very small frogs include ''[[Brachycephalus didactylus]]'' from Brazil (reported as 9.6-9.8&amp;nbsp;mm), several species of ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'' such as ''[[Eleutherodactylus iberia]]'' (around 10mm) from Cuba, Gardiner's Frog ''[[Sechellophryne gardineri]]'' from the Seychelles (up to 11&amp;nbsp;mm), several species of ''[[Stumpffia]]'' such as ''[[Stumpffia tridactyla]]'' and ''[[Stumpffia pygmaea]]'' from Madagascar, and the Rough Moss-frog ''[[Arthroleptella rugosa]]'' of South Africa (11.9 - 14.1&amp;nbsp;mm). In general these extremely small frogs occur in tropical forest and montane environments. There is relatively little data on size variation among individuals, growth from metamorphosis to adulthood or size variation among populations in these species. Additional studies and the discovery of further minute frog species are likely to change the rank order of this list.

==== Turtles ====
The world's smallest [[turtle]] is the [[speckled padloper tortoise]] (''Homopus signatus'') from [[South Africa]]. The males measure {{convert|6|-|8|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while females measure up to almost {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Branch, B. (1998).

==== Snakes ====
One of the smallest snakes known is the recently discovered [[Barbados threadsnake]] (''Leptotyphlops carlae''). Adults average about {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, which is only about twice as long as the [[hatchling]]s.

=== Dinosaurs ===
The smallest known [[dinosaur]] (excluding modern birds) is ''[[Anchiornis]]'', a genus of feathered dinosaur that lived in what is now [[China]] during the Late [[Jurassic Period]] 160 to 155 million years ago. Adult specimens range from {{convert|34|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and the weight has been estimated at up to {{convert|110|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, X., Zhao, Q., Norell, M., Sullivan, C., Hone, D., Erickson, G., Wang, X., Han, F. and Guo, Y. (2009). "A new feathered maniraptoran dinosaur fossil that fills a morphological gap in avian origin." [[Chinese Science Bulletin]], 6 pages, accepted November 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Dinosaur size|sizes of dinosaurs]] are commonly labelled with a level of uncertainty, as the available material often (or even usually) is incomplete.

==== Birds ====
[[File:Bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae) immature male.jpg|thumb|Bee hummingbird (''Mellisuga helenae'') immature male]]
With a mass of approximately {{convert|1.8|g|oz}} and a length of 5 centimetres (2.0&amp;nbsp;in), the [[bee hummingbird]] (''Mellisuga helenae'') is the world's smallest [[bird]] species and the smallest [[warm-blooded]] [[vertebrate]]. Called the ''zunzún'' in its native habitat on [[Cuba]], it is lighter than a [[penny (Canadian coin)|Canadian]] or [[Cent (United States coin)|U.S. penny]]. It is said that it is "more apt to be mistaken for a [[bee]] than a bird".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mschloe.com/hummer/carib.htm Hummingbirds of the Caribbean [mschloe.com&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130703194008/http://www.mschloe.com/hummer/carib.htm |date=2013-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bee hummingbird eats half its total [[body mass]] and drinks eight times its total body mass each day. Its nest is 3&amp;nbsp;cm across.

=== Mammals ===
The [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] [[Kitti's hog-nosed bat]] (''Craseonycteris thonglongyai''), also known as the bumblebee bat, from [[Thailand]] and [[Myanmar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bates, P. | author2 = Bumrungsri, S. | author3 = Francis, C. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Craseonycteris thonglongyai'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2008 | page = e.T5481A11205556 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2008 | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/5481/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T5481A11205556.en | access-date = 12 January 2018}} Listed as Vulnerable&lt;/ref&gt; is the smallest [[mammal]], at {{convert|3-4|cm|in}} in length and {{convert|1.5-2|g|oz}} in weight.

The [[Etruscan shrew]] (''Suncus etruscus''), is the smallest mammal by mass, weighing only about {{Convert|1.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} on average. The bumblebee bat has a smaller [[skull]] size. The smallest mammal that ever lived, the shrew-like ''[[Batodonoides vanhouteni]]'', weighed only {{convert|1.3|g|oz}}.

==== Rodents ====
The smallest member of the rodent order is the [[Baluchistan pygmy jerboa]], with an average body length of only 4.4&amp;nbsp;cm (1.7&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name=SmallestAnimals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetoptenz.net/smallest-animals/ |title=World's Smallest Animals |publisher=Thetoptenz.net |date=2013-09-29 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carnivorans ====
The smallest member of the order [[Carnivora]] is the [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), with an average body length of 114–260&amp;nbsp;mm (4.5-10.2&amp;nbsp;in). It weighs between 29.5 – 250 grams with females being lighter.

==== Marsupials ====
The smallest marsupial is the [[Long-tailed planigale]] from Australia. It has a body length of {{convert|110-130|mm|in}} (including tail) and weigh {{convert|4.3|g|oz}} on average.

The [[Pilbara ningaui]] is considered to be of similar size and weight.&lt;ref name="SmallestAnimals" /&gt;

==== Primates ====
The smallest member of the [[primate]] [[Order (biology)|order]] is [[Madame Berthe's mouse lemur]] (''Microcebus berthae''), found in [[Madagascar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primates.co.uk/lemurs/pygmy-mouselemur.html (Retrieved on March 17, 2010).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716201423/http://www.primates.co.uk/lemurs/pygmy-mouselemur.html |date=July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average body length of 92&amp;nbsp;mm (3.6&amp;nbsp;in).

==== Cetaceans ====
The smallest [[cetacea]]n, which is also (as of 2006) the most endangered, is the [[vaquita]]. Male vaquitas grow to an average of around 135&amp;nbsp;cm (53&amp;nbsp;in); the females are slightly longer, averaging about 141&amp;nbsp;cm (55&amp;nbsp;in) in length.

'''Ultra-linear''' electronic circuits are those used to couple a [[tetrode]] or [[pentode]] vacuum-tube (also called "electron-valve") to a load (e.g. to a [[loudspeaker]]).

'Ultra-linear' is a special case of 'distributed loading'; a circuit technique patented by [[Alan Blumlein]] in 1937 (Patent No. 496,883), although the name 'distributed loading' is probably due to [[Mullard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mullard Ltd. |year=1959 |title=[[Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he applied for the US patent 2218902. The particular advantages of ultra-linear operation, and the name itself, were published by [[David Hafler]] and Herbert Keroes in the early 1950s through articles in the magazine "Audio Engineering" from the USA.&lt;ref name="AudioEngineering"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hafler |first1=David |last2=Keroes |first2=Herbert I |date=November 1951 |title=An Ultra-Linear Amplifier |journal=Audio Engineering |pages=15–17 |url=http://www.aikenamps.com/images/Documents/UL.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.tubecad.com/Classic_Articles/page2.html |archivedate=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The special case of 'ultra linear' operation is sometimes confused with the more general principle of distributed loading.

==Operation==
A [[pentode]] or [[tetrode]] vacuum-tube (valve) configured as a common-cathode amplifier (where the output signal appears on the plate) may be operated as:

* a pentode or tetrode, in which the screen-grid is connected to a stable DC voltage so there are no signal variations on the screen-grid (i.e. the screen-grid has 0% of the plate's output signal impressed on it), or
* a triode, in which the screen-grid is connected to the plate (i.e. the screen-grid has 100% of the plate's output signal voltage impressed on it), or
* a blend of triode and pentode, in which the screen-grid has a percentage (between 0% and 100%) of the plate's output signal impressed on it. This is the basis of the distributed load circuit, and is usually achieved by incorporating a suitable "tap" on the primary winding of the output transformer that the vacuum-tube (valve) is connected to.

The impression of any portion of the output signal onto the screen-grid can be seen as a form of feedback, which alters the behaviour of the electron stream passing from cathode to anode.

==Advantages==
By judicious choice of the screen-grid percentage-tap, the benefits of both triode and pentode vacuum-tubes can be realised. Over a very narrow range of percentage-tapping, distortion is found to fall to an unusually low value&amp;mdash;sometimes less than for either triode or pentode operation&lt;ref name="AudioEngineering"/&gt;&amp;mdash;while power efficiency is only slightly reduced compared with full pentode operation. The optimum percentage-tap to achieve ultra-linear operation depends mainly on the type of valve used; a commonly seen percentage is 43% (of the number of transformer primary turns on the plate-circuit) which applies to the KT88, although many other valve types have optimum values close to this. A value of 20% was recommended for 6V6GTs. [[Mullard]] circuits such as the [[Mullard 5-10|5-20]] also used 20% distributed loading (but did not achieve ultra-linear operation), while [[LEAK]] amplifiers used 50%.

The characteristics of the circuit which make distributed loading suitable for audio power amplifiers, when compared to a tetrode or pentode amplifier, are:

* The output impedance is lowered to be about half that achieved with a triode.
* Distortion is lowered to approach that achieved with a triode tube, but may be even less for ultra-linear operation.
* The power output is higher than from a triode, approaching that delivered by a pentode.
* The power output is more constant as distributed loading is a combination of a transconductance amplifier and a voltage amplifier.

The distributed load circuit may be applied to either push-pull or single-ended amplifier circuits.

Note that the term 'ultra linear' was expressly reserved only for the condition of optimum tapping point. As Hafler and Keroes wrote:
"''Our patent claims cover the use of any primary tap in this circuit arrangement. However, we have restricted the use of the term "Ultra Linear" to the conditions where the dynamic plate characteristic curves are most linear''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hafler |first1=David |last2=Keroes |first2=Herbert I. |date=September 1952 |title=Ungilding the Lily (letter) |journal=Audio Engineering |page=8 |url=http://dalmura.com.au/projects/Gilding%20the%20Lily%20-%20July%201952%20-%20Audio.pdf |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;!--Page 5 of PDF--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related circuits==
The "QUAD II" amplifier from [[QUAD]] uses a circuit in which the cathode has a portion of the output signal applied to it, and was referred to as "distributed load" by Peter Walker of QUAD. In the United States, [[McIntosh Laboratories]] used this technique extensively in their vacuum-tube power amplifiers. [[Audio Research Corp]] have also used a similar circuit.

'''Violette Cordery''', (10 January 1900 – 30 December 1983)&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; (married name Hindmarsh) was a British racing driver and long distance record breaker.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=101214|first1=Jean|last1=Williams|first2=Simon|last2=Williams|title=Cordery, Violette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Cordery was born in London to Henry Cordery and had an elder sister (Lucy)/Leslie and a younger sister Evelyn who also participated in her driving exploits.

A '''withy''' or '''withe''' is a strong flexible [[willow]] stem, typically used in [[thatching]] and for gardening.

Several species and hybrid [[cultivar]]s of willows (often known as osiers) are grown for withy production; typical species include ''[[Salix acutifolia]]'', ''[[Salix daphnoides]]'', ''[[Salix × mollissima]]'', ''[[Salix purpurea]]'', ''[[Salix triandra]]'', and ''[[Salix viminalis]]''.&lt;ref name=rdm&gt;Meikle, R. D. (1984). ''Willows and Poplars of Great Britain and Ireland''. BSBI Handbook No. 4. {{ISBN|0-901158-07-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used to describe any type of flexible rod used in [[rural crafts]] such as [[hazel]] or [[Fraxinus|ash]].

Withies traditionally serve to mark minor tidal channels in UK harbours and estuaries. In many places they remain in use {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} and are often marked on navigation charts. At high tide the tops of a line of withies stuck in the mud on one or both sides of a channel will show above water to indicate where the deeper water lies. Note the images of international navigation-chart symbols for withies (port and starboard).

Places such as [[Wythenshawe]] and Withy Grove (both in [[Manchester]]) take their names from the willow woods and groves that grew there in earlier times. The [[Somerset Levels]] remain the only area in the UK growing basket willow commercially.
