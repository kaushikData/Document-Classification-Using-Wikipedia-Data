'''Altimo''' (alt. '''Alfa Telecom International Mobile''') is the telecoms investment arm of Russia's [[Alfa Group]] Consortium, controlled by Russian oligarch [[Mikhail Fridman]]. Altimo investee companies operate in Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tadjikistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Beirut, Lebanon]]; it holds stakes in [[VimpelCom]], [[MegaFon]], [[Kyivstar]], and [[Turkcell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alfa.com.lb/Default.aspx|title=Alfa - The leading mobile operator in Lebanon - شبكة المحمول الأولى في لبنان|work=alfa.com.lb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Altimo's investee companies have more than 150 million mobile phone subscribers.{{cn|date=October 2015}} . Altimo Holdings &amp; Investments Ltd. is a [[British Virgin Islands]] company. A majority of its shares are owned by CTF Holdings, a [[Gibraltar]] limited liability company, whose sole shareholder is [[Crown Finance Foundation]], a [[Liechtenstein]] foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468091/000134100412001096/sc_13da.htm|title=sc_13da.htm|work=sec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since its formation in 2004, Altimo has been involved in numerous conflicts with all its main partners in each of the four companies which form the backbone of its investments. These conflicts have resulted in what [[Judge Lynch]] of the [[United States District Court]], Southern District of [[New York (state)|New York]] described as a "brazen history of collusive and vexatious litigation . . . used to avoid compliance with their legal obligations".&lt;ref&gt;Guy Chazan, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e291cdc6-c325-11e4-ac3d-00144feab7de.html "Telecoms case shows Fridman’s taste for combat"], Financial Times (March 5, 2015). Retrieved 21 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Altimo acquired a 13.2% stake in [[Turkcell]], the largest Turkish mobile phone operator. This acquisition was the subject of considerable controversy due to doubt whether the Turkish [[Group Cukurova]] was in violation of a shareholders agreement it had in place with [[TeliaSonera]], the other major shareholder in Turkcell. Altimo was also engaged in a dispute with TeliaSonera over [[MegaFon]] at the time of this transaction. 

Altimo's efforts (2008) to expand into India met with a rebuff when the home ministry observed that Altimo and its parent company, Alpha, have a "tainted background".&lt;ref&gt;Joji Thomas Philip, [http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-08-12/news/28450963_1_altimo-telecom-arm-telecom-licences "Russian telco Altimo's past to haunt India plans"], The Economic Times (Aug 12, 2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7768">'''Armin S.''' (complete name unknown) is an independent [[Security (finance)|securities]] trader from Germany.

== Life ==
Armin S. started his career as a trader at the German [[WestLB]] Investment boutique. Afterwards he worked 8 years at [[Citigroup]] on the trading floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/finanzen/boerse/bank-irrtum-zu-seinen-gunsten-dieser-mann-hatte-ploetzlich-163-millionen-euro-auf-dem-konto_id_5569376.html|title=Bank-Irrtum zu seinen Gunsten|last=Niesmann|first=Andreas|date=2016-06-05|website=FOCUS|archive-url=|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Subsequently, he traded for his own account. Armin S. compares his job with the work of a used car dealer, selling and buying securities constantly and making his margin on the [[Bid–ask spread|Bid-Ask Spread]], the difference between the selling price and buying price.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==€163 million lawsuit ==
Armin S. achieved international recognition when he sued [[BNP Paribas]] for over €160m, one the largest civil cases brought by a private investor in Germany.

The German newspaper [[Focus (German magazine)|FOCUS]] was the first to publish an article regarding a €163m [[erroneous trade]] allegedly involving [[BNP Paribas Arbitrage]]. The bank had sold securities for €326,400 to an investor but the value of the securities was €163 million, according to the bank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days, and [[BNP Paribas|BNP]] had even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules. The lawyer of Armin S., Mario Bögelein, stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.

Next, Armin S. commented on his case in the German magazine [[AnlegerPlus]], questioning the breaches on the risk-management side of [[BNP Paribas|BNP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anlegerplus.de/assets/Downloads/APlus-NEWS/2016/AnlegerPlusNews92016.pdf|format=pdf|language=de|title=Erfahrungsbericht des Sdk Mitglieds Armin S.|last=S.|first=Armin|date=2016-09-01|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 2017 the French newspaper [[Les Échos (France)|Les Echos]] published an article with the headline “trader requests 161m EUR from BNP Paribas”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/banque-assurances/0211872239814-un-trader-reclame-161-millions-deuros-a-bnp-paribas-2071501.php|language=fr|title=Un trader réclame 161 millions d’euros à BNP Paribas|last=Lacour|first=Jean-Philippe|date=2017-03-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[European Banking Authority]] retweeted the article as an example of operational risks within the banking sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cjnijdam/status/840645573241901061|language=fr|title=Voilà un exemple concret de ce qu'on appelle le risque "opérationnel" dans le secteur bancaire [This is a concrete example of what is called "operational" risk in the banking sector]|last=Nijdam|first=Christophe|date=2017-03-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2017 [[Bloomberg News]] dedicated a spotlight article on the case. The 152m EUR case will be one of the largest civil cases of one individual in Germany. The author highlighted the prevailing [[erroneous trade]] rules, that erroneous trades could only be canceled until the next day. [[:de:Hans-Peter Burghof|Hans-Peter Burghof]], a renowned university professor, was cited with the words "a bank is obliged to execute their trading activities correctly, this may not have happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/bloomberg/article164814287/Daytrader-verlangt-von-BNP-Paribas-wegen-Preisirrtum-152-Mio.html|language=de|title=Daytrader verlangt von BNP Paribas wegen Preisirrtum 152 Mio € - WELT|website=DIE WELT|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2017, Armin S. commented on the case with the words "If (the loss) is about 163m EUR, this should have caught the immediate attention of a major bank." Further "The arrogance of the bankers makes me sick. They think of themselves they are the best and brightest – which they sometimes are – but once something goes against them they ignore it"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.focus.de/finanzen/boerse/kurioser-prozess-dieser-mann-hat-ueber-nacht-163-millionen-euro-verdient-aber-seine-bank-zahlt-nicht_id_7313775.html|title=Dieser Mann verdiente über Nacht 163 Millionen Euro - aber seine Bank zahlt nicht|last=Sackmann|first=Christoph|date=5 July 2017|work=Focus Online|access-date=2017-07-11|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July, an article on the front page of the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]] appeared by Christian Siedenbiedel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/finanzen/meine-finanzen/mann-bekommt-durch-bankirrtum-163-millionen-euro-15092995.html|language=de|title=Plötzlich Multimillionär durch einen Bankirrtum|last=Siedenbiedel|first=Christian|date=2017-07-05|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ)|access-date=2017-07-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A speaker of the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] said that they would have spotted an 163m EUR mistrade ([[erroneous trade]]), however the transaction was executed [[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC), without the involvement of a stock exchange. 

The lawyer Michael Lusk published an article with the title ''"Do banks' internal control system work?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-banks-internal-control-systems-work-michael-lusk|title=Do banks’ internal control systems work?|date=2017-07-31|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Why [[BNP Paribas|BNP]] did not spot the mistake in their [[risk management]] and thereby violated supervisory rules by the [[European Central Bank]] remains unknown.

== BNP's Risk-management affair ==
The [[Financial Times]] published an article in March 2018 about the case with the title ''"BNP Paribas failed to book trades in Germany for a week"''. They cite internal documents that show why the error has not been detected: as it turns out, BNP forgot to book all trades that happened in [[Structured product|structured products]] in Germany from 2 December 2015 to 9 December 2015. The Financial Times estimates that 8500 trades might have been affected. It also questions if the bank has [[Hedge (finance)|hedged]] their positions if the trades have not been booked. Armin S. is cited with the words ''“I don’t think it’s fair if on the one hand, BNP wants to rely on statutory safeguard clauses but on the other hand they ignored all control-tasks imposed by the regulators — ECB, BaFin and AMF — for a whole week"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a9e8b574-22f0-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11|title=BNP Paribas failed to book trades in Germany for a week|last=Binham|first=Caroline|date=2018-03-09|website=ft.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFMnRleSGwY&amp;t|title=ArminS vs BNP Paribas|last=|first=|date=2018-09-26|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bandwidth throttling''' is the intentional slowing or speeding of an internet service by an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). It is a reactive measure employed in communication networks to regulate network traffic and minimize bandwidth congestion. Bandwidth throttling can occur at different locations on the network. On a local area network ([[LAN]]), a [[system administrator]] ("sysadmin") may employ bandwidth throttling to help limit [[network congestion]] and server crashes. On a broader level, the [[Internet service provider]] may use bandwidth throttling to help reduce a user's usage of bandwidth that is supplied to the local network. Bandwidth throttling is also used to speed up the Internet on speed test websites.

Throttling can be used to actively limit a user's upload and download rates on programs such as [[video streaming]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocols and other [[file sharing]] applications, as well as even out the usage of the total bandwidth supplied across all users on the network. Bandwidth throttling is also often used in [[Internet]] applications, in order to spread a load over a wider network to reduce local network congestion, or over a number of servers to avoid overloading individual ones, and so reduce their risk of the system [[Crash (computing)|crashing]], and gain additional revenue by giving users an incentive to use more expensive tiered pricing schemes, where bandwidth is not throttled.

==Operation==
A computer network typically consists of a number of [[Server (computing)|servers]], which host data and provide services to [[Client (computing)|clients]]. The Internet is a good example, in which [[web server]]s are used to host websites, providing information to a potentially very large number of client computers. Clients will make requests to servers, which will respond by sending the required [[data]], which may be a song file, a video, and so on, depending on what the client has requested. As there will typically be many clients per server, the data processing demand on a server will generally be considerably greater than on any individual client. And so servers are typically implemented using computers with high data capacity and processing power. The traffic on such a network will vary over time, and there will be periods when client requests will peak, sometimes exceeding the capacity of parts of network and causing congestion, especially in parts of the network that form [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottlenecks]]. This can cause data request failures, or in worst cases, server crashes.

In order to prevent such occurrences, a [[server administrator]] may implement bandwidth throttling to control the number of requests a server responds to within a specified period of time. When a server using bandwidth throttling reaches the specified limit, it will offload new requests and not respond to them. Sometimes they may be added to a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] to be processed once the bandwidth use reaches an acceptable level, but at peak times the request rate can even exceed the capacities of such queues and requests have to be thrown away.

==Application==
A bandwidth intensive device, such as a [[Server (computing)|server]], might limit, or throttle, the rate at which it accepts data, in order to avoid overloading its processing capacity. This can be done both at the local network servers or at the ISP servers. ISPs often employ [[deep packet inspection]] (DPI), which is widely available in routers or provided by special DPI equipment. Additionally, today’s networking equipment allows ISPs to collect statistics on flow sizes at line speed, which can be used to mark large flows for [[traffic shaping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/papers/traffic_shaping.pdf|title=The Local and Global Effects of Traffic Shaping in the Internet|author=Massimiliano Marcon|publisher=MPI|accessdate=May 3, 2011|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140358/http://www.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/papers/traffic_shaping.pdf|archivedate=July 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two ISPs, Cox and Comcast, have stated that they engage in this practice, where they limit users' bandwidth by up to 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://broadband.mpi-sws.org/transparency/results/ |title=Glasnost: Results from tests for BitTorrent traffic blocking |author=Max Planck Institute |date=March 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404134316/http://broadband.mpi-sws.org/transparency/results/ |archivedate=April 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today most if not all [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] throttle their users' bandwidth, with or without the user ever even realizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netequalizernews.com/2009/03/21/analysis-the-white-lies-isps-tell-about-broadband-speeds/ |title=Is Your ISP Throttling Your Bandwidth? |author=netequalizer |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405170221/http://netequalizernews.com/2009/03/21/analysis-the-white-lies-isps-tell-about-broadband-speeds/ |archivedate=April 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the specific case of [[Comcast]], an equipment vendor called [[Sandvine]] developed the network management technology that throttled P2P file transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kevin Werbach |year=2009 |title=Higher Standards Regulation in the Network Age |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=217 |publisher=Harvard University |ssrn=1557265|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those that could have their bandwidth throttled are typically someone who is constantly downloading and uploading torrents, or someone who just watches a lot of online videos. Many consider this as an unfair method of regulating the bandwidth because consumers are not getting the required bandwidth even after paying the prices set by the ISPs. By throttling the people who are using so much bandwidth, the ISPs claim to enable their regular users to have a better overall quality of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geeksavy.com/what-is-bandwidth-thrtottling/113 |title=What is Bandwidth Throttling? |date=February 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817024642/http://geeksavy.com/what-is-bandwidth-thrtottling/113 |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network neutrality==
[[Net neutrality]] is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. It aims to guarantee a level playing field for all websites and Internet technologies. With net neutrality, the network's only job is to move data—not to choose which data to privilege with higher quality, that is faster, service. In the US, on February 26, 2015, the [[Federal Communication Commission]] adopted Open Internet rules. They designed to protect free expression and innovation on the Internet and promote investment in the nation's broadband networks. The Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The new rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Open Internet|url = https://www.fcc.gov/openinternet|website = www.fcc.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-03|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150615044837/https://www.fcc.gov/openinternet|archivedate = 2015-06-15|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright line rules:
* No blocking: broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
* No throttling: broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
* No paid prioritization: broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration or payment of any kind—in other words, no "fast lanes." This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their own affiliated businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Open Internet|url = https://www.fcc.gov/openinternet|website = www.fcc.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-03|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150615044837/https://www.fcc.gov/openinternet|archivedate = 2015-06-15|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throttling vs. capping==
Bandwidth throttling works by limiting (throttling) the rate at which a bandwidth intensive device (a [[Server (computing)|server]]) accepts data. If this limit is not in place, the device can overload its processing capacity.

Contrary to throttling, in order to use bandwidth when available, but prevent excess, each node in a proactive system should set an outgoing [[bandwidth cap]] that appropriately limits the total number of bytes sent per unit time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |citeseerx=10.1.1.71.7264 |title=Proactive replication for data durability |author=Emil Sit |author2=Andreas Haeberlen |author3=Frank Dabek |author4=Byung-Gon Chun |author5=Hakim Weatherspoon |author6=Robert Morris |author7=M. Frans Kaashoek |author7-link=M. Frans Kaashoek |author8=John Kubiatowicz |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of bandwidth capping. A standard cap limits the [[bitrate]] or speed of data transfer on a broadband Internet connection. Standard capping is used to prevent individuals from consuming the entire transmission capacity of the medium. A lowered cap reduces an individual user’s bandwidth cap as a defensive measure and/or as a punishment for heavy use of the medium’s [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Oftentimes this happens without notifying the user.

The difference is that bandwidth throttling regulates a bandwidth intensive device (such as a [[Server (computing)|server]]) by limiting how much data that device can accept or receive. Bandwidth capping on the other hand limits the total transfer capacity, upstream or downstream, of data over a medium.

==Court cases==

===''Comcast Corp. v. FCC''===
{{Main|Comcast Corp. v. FCC}}
In 2007, [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], [[Public Knowledge]], and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] filed a complaint against Comcast's Internet service. Several subscribers claimed that the company was interfering with their use of peer-to-peer networking applications. The Commission stated that it had jurisdiction over Comcast's network management practices and that it could resolve the dispute through negotiation rather than through rulemaking. The Commission believed that Comcast had "significantly impeded consumers' ability to access the content and use the applications of their choice", and that because Comcast "ha[d] several available options it could use to manage network traffic without discriminating" against peer-to-peer communications, its method of [[bandwidth management]] "contravene[d] ... federal policy". At this time, "Comcast had already agreed to adopt a new system for managing bandwidth demand, the Commission simply ordered it to make a set of disclosures describing the details of its new approach and the company's progress toward implementing it". Comcast complied with this Order but petitioned for a review and presented several objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Comcast vs. FCC &amp; U.S. |vol=08-1291 |opinion=Chief Judge [[David S.

==ISP bandwidth throttling==

===Canada===
In 2008, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) decided to allow [[Bell Canada]] to single out [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) traffic for bandwidth throttling between the hours of 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 2&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/11/canadian-regulators-allow-p2p-throttling.ars |title=Canadian regulators allow P2P throttling |newspaper=[[Ars Technica]] |first=Nate |last=Anderson |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325062508/http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/11/canadian-regulators-allow-p2p-throttling.ars |archivedate=25 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the CRTC released a guideline for bandwidth throttling rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-657.htm|title=Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2009-657|publisher=CRTC|year=2009|accessdate=April 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712184101/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-657.htm|archivedate=July 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, following a major [[Rogers Hi-Speed Internet#Throttling|complaint]] by the Canadian Gamers Organization against Rogers for breaking the 2009 rules already in place, the CRTC created an addendum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-609.htm|title=Internet traffic management practices – Guidelines for responding to complaints and enforcing framework compliance by Internet service providers|publisher=CRTC|year=2011|accessdate=April 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712184106/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-609.htm|archivedate=July 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their ITMP policy, allowing them to send the complaint to their Enforcements Division. The Canadian Gamers Organization in their submissions alluded to filing a complaint against Bell Canada. On December 20, 2011, Bell Canada announced they would end throttling by March 31, 2012 for their customers, as well as their wholesale customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/12/20/technology-bell-throttling-crtc.html|title=Bell to stop internet throttling|year=2011|accessdate=April 21, 2012|publisher=CBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419160703/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/12/20/technology-bell-throttling-crtc.html|archivedate=April 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2012, in an effort to get out of trouble with the CRTC (which had continued its own testing and had found additional non-compliance and demanded immediate compliance), Rogers announced 50% of their customers would be throttle-free by June 2012, and 100% of their customers would be throttle-free by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/02/03/tech-rogers-throttling.html|title=Rogers promises to end internet throttling|year=2012|accessdate=April 21, 2012|publisher=CBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427164122/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/02/03/tech-rogers-throttling.html|archivedate=April 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Rogers, this did not mollify the CRTC Enforcements Division.

===Europe===
In April 2011, the [[European Union]] launched an investigation into Internet service providers' methods for managing traffic on their networks. Some ISPs, for instance, restrict access to services such as [[Skype]] or the BBC iPlayer at peak times so that their users all receive an equal service. The EU's commissioner for the digital agenda, [[Neelie Kroes]], said: "I am absolutely determined that everyone in the EU should have the chance to enjoy the benefits of an open and lawful Internet, without hidden restrictions or slower speeds than they have been promised." The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (Berec) will examine the issues for the EU, and will ask both businesses and consumers for their views. The EU will publish the results of its investigation by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8462422/EU-launches-net-neutrality-investigation.html |title=EU launches net neutrality investigation |author=Matt Warman |date=April 20, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426010403/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8462422/EU-launches-net-neutrality-investigation.html |archivedate=April 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{update|FCC [[net neutrality]] rules|date=September 2015}}
In 2007, [[Comcast]] was caught interfering with peer-to-peer traffic. Specifically, it falsified packets of data that fooled users and their peer-to-peer programs into thinking they were transferring files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21376597/ |title=Comcast blocks some Internet traffic |author=Peter Svensson |date=2007-10-19 |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=May 3, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507232209/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21376597/ |archivedate=7 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast initially denied that it interfered with its subscribers' uploads, but later admitted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10004508-38.html |title=FCC formally rules Comcast's throttling of BitTorrent was illegal |author=Declan McCullagh |date=August 1, 2008 |publisher=CNET News |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110153951/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10004508-38.html |archivedate=November 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC held a hearing and concluded that Comcast violated the principles of the Internet Policy Statement because Comcast's "discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelched the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible Internet and did not constitute reasonable network management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/system/files/FccComcastOrder.pdf |title=Comcast Memorandum Opinion and Order |author=FCC |date=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801224516/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/system/files/FccComcastOrder.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC also provided clear guidelines to any ISP wishing to engage in reasonable network management. The FCC suggested ways that Comcast could have achieved its goal of stopping network congestion, including capping the average user's capacity and charging the most aggressive users overage (going over a maximum) fees, throttling back the connections of all high capacity users, or negotiating directly with the application providers and developing new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael P. Murtagh |year=2008 |title=The FCC, the DMCA, and Why Takedown Notices Are Not Enough |journal=[[Hastings Law Journal]] |volume=61 |issue=233 |pages=242–243 |publisher=University of California |url=http://uchastings.edu/hlj/archive/vol61/Murtagh_61-HLJ-233.pdf |accessdate=2011-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174951/http://uchastings.edu/hlj/archive/vol61/Murtagh_61-HLJ-233.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2008, [[Comcast]] amended their Acceptable Usage Policy and placed a specific 250 GB monthly cap. Comcast has also announced a new bandwidth-throttling plan. The scheme includes a two-class system of "priority-best-effort" and "best-effort" where "sustained use of 70% of your up or downstream throughput triggers the BE state, at which point you'll find your traffic priority lowered until your usage drops to 50% of your provisioned upstream or downstream bandwidth for "a period of approximately 15 minutes". A throttled Comcast user being placed in a BE state "may or may not result in the user's traffic being delayed or, in extreme cases, dropped before PBE traffic is dropped". Comcast explained to the FCC that "If there is no congestion, packets from a user in a BE state should have little trouble getting on the bus when they arrive at the bus stop. If, on the other hand, there is congestion in a particular instance, the bus may become filled by packets in a PBE state before any BE packets can get on. In that situation, the BE packets would have to wait for the next bus that is not filled by PBE packets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/New-Comcast-Throttling-System-100-Online-100015 |title=New Comcast Throttling System 100% Online |author=Karl Bode |date=January 5, 2009 |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810104724/http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/New-Comcast-Throttling-System-100-Online-100015 |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

US cell phone ISP's have also increasingly resorted to bandwidth throttling in their networks. [[Verizon]] and [[AT&amp;T]] even applied such throttling to data plans advertised as "unlimited", resulting in pushback from the FCC and the FTC respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/technology/FTC-says-ATT-deceived-consumers-on-unlimited-data-plan.html |title=AT&amp;T Accused of Deceiving Smartphone Customers With Unlimited Data Plans |author=Edward Wyatt |date=October 28, 2014 |accessdate=October 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029143304/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/technology/FTC-says-ATT-deceived-consumers-on-unlimited-data-plan.html |archivedate=October 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===
[[Antel]] has a state-enforced monopoly forcing consumers who require non-wireless Internet access (i.e. ADSL or fiber – cable Internet is outlawed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/103433/solo-cuba-y-uruguay-no-ofrecen-internet-por-cable-modem/ Only Cuba and Uruguay don't offer Internet access via cable modem (In Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514135318/http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/103433/solo-cuba-y-uruguay-no-ofrecen-internet-por-cable-modem/ |date=2013-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to purchase it directly from Antel. Its practices provide insight into the probable behavior of ISPs in markets that have little or no competition and/or lack balancing regulations in the interest of consumers. All of Antel's Internet access plans for consumers are either capped or throttled. Capped plans are typically marketed under the brand "flexible". On such plans once a user reaches a data tier (e.g. 5&amp;nbsp;GB) additional data usage is billed at a rate of approximately 5 $US/GB. Once a second tier is reached (e.g., 15&amp;nbsp;GB), Internet services are suspended until the start of the next billing cycle. Throttled plans are typically marketed under the brand "Flat Rate" (for ADSL) and "Vera" (for fiber.) Such plans allow full bandwidth on the connection (e.g. 20 Mbit/s down on the Vera fiber plan) from the beginning of the billing month but are restricted to a percentage of the contracted transmission rate (e.g., to 2Mbit/s down, or 10% of the advertised speed) once a data tier (e.g. 150&amp;nbsp;GB) is reached. Full bandwidth capability is restored at the beginning of the next billing month.&lt;ref&gt;[[Telecommunications in Uruguay]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130114063450/http://www.antel.com.uy/antel/personas-y-hogares/internet/planes/ Planes de Internet] – Antel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrics for ISPs==
Whether aimed at avoiding network congestion or at pushing users to upgrade to costlier Internet plans, the increasingly common capping and throttling practices of ISPs undoubtedly have an effect on the value proposition of the plans they offer. For consumers to be able to make an informed decision when choosing an Internet plan, ISPs should publish their capping and throttling practices with the necessary level of detail. While the net effect of some throttling and capping strategies can be hard to compare across ISPs, some basic metrics that are of interest for any kind of throttled/capped Internet connection are:
* '''Maximum monthly payload:''' This is the amount of data that an Internet connection would be able to carry in a hypothetical setting assuming no bottlenecks external to the ISP. In the example Antel 20Mbs fiber connection (see ''Uruguay'' above), the maximum monthly payload in that hypothetical setting would be reached by running the connection at 20Mbs for the first 150 GB, and at 2Mbs for the rest of the month. Thus the maximum monthly payload of that connection is 60,000 seconds * 2.5 MB/s + 2,532,000 seconds * 0.25 MB/s = 783 GB (about the size of a large laptop disk drive in 2013.)
* '''Maximum utilization percentage:''' This is the ratio of the maximum monthly payload of a throttled Internet connection to the maximum unthrottled monthly payload of the same connection. In the example Antel fiber 20Mbs connection the maximum unthrottled monthly payload of that connection is 2,592,000 seconds * 2.5 MB/s = 6,480 GB. Thus the maximum utilization percentage of that connection is 783 GB / 6,480 GB = 12%
* '''Throttling percentage:''' This represents how much the maximum monthly payload of an Internet connection gets reduced by the ISP's throttling policy. It is calculated simply as 1 − maximum utilization percentage. In the example Antel fiber 20Mbs connection it is 1 − 12% = 88%
* '''Equivalent connection bandwidth''': This is the bandwidth of an unthrottled Internet connection whose maximum monthly payload is the same as the maximum monthly payload of the throttled connection in question. This can be calculated as unthrottled connection bandwidth * throttling percentage. In the example Antel fiber 20Mbs connection the equivalent connection bandwidth is 20 Mbs * 12% = 2.4 Mbs
* '''Cost per unit payload''': The ultimate metric of throttling's effect on an Internet connection's potential value to a customer is the cost per GB (or TB in the case of fast connections) carried assuming perfect utilization of the connection. It is calculated by dividing the monthly cost of the connection by the maximum monthly payload. In the example Antel fiber 20 Mbs connection it would be US$36 / 0.783 TB = US$46 per TB. By comparison, if the same 20Mbs connection weren't throttled by the ISP it would have a cost per unit payload of US$36 / 6.48 TB = US$5.6 per TB
* '''Unthrottled connection cost:''' This is how much it would cost the customer to offset the effect of throttling by aggregating throttled Internet connections from the ISP. It is calculated by dividing the monthly cost of a throttled connection by the throttling percentage. In the example Antel fiber connection the cost of building an unthrottled 20Mbit/s fiber Internet connection by aggregating 20Mbit/s throttled ones would be US$36 / 12% = US$300 per month

Although ISPs may actively throttle bandwidth, there are several known methods to bypass the throttling of a user's bandwidth, if the throttling is focused on a particular protocol. These methods, nicknamed "workarounds", include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filesharefreak.com/tutorials/workarounds-for-bandwidth-throttling/ |title=Workarounds For Bandwidth Throttling |author=Remisser |accessdate=April 26, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303193711/http://filesharefreak.com/tutorials/workarounds-for-bandwidth-throttling/ |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blackmer v. United States''''', 284 U.S. 421 (1932), is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

Harry M. Blackmer was a [[United States citizen]] resident in [[Paris]]. Blackmer was found guilty of [[contempt of court|contempt]] by the [[Supreme Court of the District of Columbia]] for refusing to appear as a witness for the [[United States]] in a criminal trial, which is related to the [[Teapot Dome Scandal]], after being [[subpoena]]ed.

Blackmer was subsequently fined $30,000 and the costs of the court. Blackmer challenged the fine under the due process clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].

The Court unanimously ruled against Blackmer, with Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] delivering the judgment and opinion of the Court and Justice [[Owen Josephus Roberts]] not participating.

Chief Justice Hughes, in delivering the opinion of the Court, stated "[n]or can it be doubted that the United States possesses the power inherent in sovereignty to require the return to this country of a citizen, resident elsewhere, whenever the public interest requires it, and to penalize him in case of refusal." Also, "[i]t is also beyond controversy that one of the duties which the citizen owes to his government is to support the administration of justice by attending its courts and giving his testimony whenever he is properly summoned."

{{refimprove|date=September 2013}}

'''C-Bus''' is a communications protocol based on a seven layer [[OSI model]] for home and building automation that can handle cable lengths up to 1000 meters using [[Cat-5]] cable.  It is used in Australia, New Zealand, [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], Russia, United States, [[South Africa]], the UK and other parts of Europe including [[Greece]] and [[Romania]].  C-Bus was created by [[Clipsal|Clipsal Australia]]'s ''Clipsal Integrated Systems''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.clipsal.com/Trade/Products/Integrated-Systems&lt;/ref&gt; division (now part of [[Schneider Electric]]) for use with its brand of home automation and building [[lighting control]] system. C-Bus has been briefly available in the United States but [[Schneider Electric]] has now discontinued sales in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schneider-electric.us/sites/us/en/support/faq/faq_main.page?page=content&amp;id=FA241002&amp;viewlocale=en_US&amp;country=US&amp;lang=en&amp;locale=en_US&amp;redirect=true&lt;/ref&gt;

C-Bus is used in the control of [[domotics]], or [[home automation]] systems, as well as commercial building lighting control systems.
Unlike the more common [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] protocol which uses a signal imposed upon the [[Power line communication|AC power line]], C-Bus uses a dedicated low-voltage cable or two-way wireless network to carry command and control signals. This improves the reliability of command transmission and makes C-Bus far more suitable for large, commercial applications than X10.

== C-Bus System ==
The C-Bus System can be used to control lighting and other electrical systems and products automatically or via [[remote control]] and can also be interfaced to a home security system, AV products or other electrical items. The C-Bus system is available in a wired version and a [[wireless]] version, with a gateway available to allow messages to be sent between wired and wireless networks.

The wired C-Bus system uses a standard category 5 UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable as its network communications cable and does not require end of line termination.  Clipsal manufactures a specific category 5 cable for use within electrical distribution panels.  This cable has a pink outer sheath which is rated to ensure adequate electrical isolation between the mains voltages found in distribution panels and the extra low voltage C-Bus.  Outside of distribution panels standard category 5 UTP cable can be used.

The category 5 C-Bus network wiring uses a free topology architecture. The maximum length of cable used on a C-Bus network is 1000 metres; however this is easily extended using C-Bus Network Bridges.  Up to 100 units can be installed on a C-Bus network and this can also be extended using Network Bridges.

The maximum number of C-Bus networks in one installation is 255 (note that this limitation does not apply if a C-Bus Ethernet Interface is utilised, the system size is then limited to IP Addressing only).  The maximum number of networks connected in series to the local network via Network Bridges is seven (i.e. using six network bridges).

Each standard C-Bus unit requires 18mA @ 15-36Vdc to operate, however some C-Bus units require up to 40mA.

More than one C-Bus power supply can be connected to a C-Bus network to provide sufficient power to the C-Bus units, the C-Bus power supplies will share the load evenly.

Each C-Bus network requires a network burden if there are insufficient C-Bus units on the network. This network burden can be enabled on C-Bus output units through software or a hardware burden can be connected to the network.

Each C-Bus network requires at least one system clock generating unit for data synchronisation.

The isolation between the mains supply circuitry and the 36 V DC C-Bus circuitry is greater than 3.5 kV. This is achieved using double wound transformers and opto isolators. This means the C-Bus wiring, connections and circuitry can be considered Extra Low Voltage.

== Wiring Design of C-Bus Systems ==
With conventional wiring, the mains power (120 / 230 V) is wired from the distribution board (DB) to the load (for example, a ceiling light) via a wall switch.

[[File:CBus Conventional Wiring.gif]]

In C-Bus systems, the connections between the DB and (for example) the ceiling lights, and between the DB and the junction box (wall switch) are completely separate. In addition, there are no connections between the junction box and the respective ceiling lights.

[[File:CBus Wiring.gif]]

The power control in a C-Bus system lies in a “Dimmer” or “Relay” which is installed in the DB and replaces the traditional switch used in conventional wiring. This Dimmer (or Relay) has a 120/230 V Line interconnection directly to the ceiling light and a neutral connection back from the ceiling light to the Dimmer. The Dimmer will control the light directly and will receive its commands from another device on the C-Bus network (for example, a wall mounted light switch/keypad). This wall mounted light switch would not be connected to any load whatsoever; it would be directly connected with the Dimmer by means of a control/signalling cable. The Dimmers normally come as 4-, 8- or 12-channel DIN-rail mounted devices.

== C-Bus Interoperability ==
As of 9 December 2008 Clipsal opened its C-Bus protocols to anyone who wants to interact with it programatically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.clipsal.com/downloads/OpenCBus/OpenCBusProtocolDownloads.html Open C-Bus Serial Protocol Documents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbus-enabled.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Using one of Clipsal's C-Bus interface modules (PCI for RS232 or USB and CNI for Ethernet TCP/IP), you can interact with other home automation systems, or with applications on devices like Android, iPad or iPhone.

The C-Bus protocol was developed using the OSI 7 layer reference model. C-Bus supports a number of interfaces such as RS232 and TCP/IP and makes these protocols available to third party companies.

C-Bus interface specifications are available through the [http://www.cbus-enabled.com/what-cbus.htm C-Bus Enabled Program], however it is necessary to agree to a license agreement.

== Geographic use of C-Bus and Compatibility ==
C-Bus as a home automation and commercial building lighting control system is used primarily in [[Australia, China and New Zealand]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}. C-Bus is currently available in [[Asia]], the United Kingdom ([http://schneider.bsky.net/802570BC0051FDC4/0/E4034508C43E9DFB8025727900577196?Open&amp;Highlight=2,c-bus,DomainSearchExclude installed] in Number 10 Downing Street, [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Manchester City Football Club]]), Russia and a number of other countries are now using this system. The C-Bus wireless (RF) system and wired C-Bus Occupancy Controllers can be retrofitted using the existing mains wiring.

C-Bus is compatible with Translink C-Bus Gateway, [[OLE for process control|OPC]], [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]], DSI, BACnet, TCP/IP, Control4,Crestron, AMX, RTI, LonWorks, ModBus, Charmed Quark Controller, the Comfort Intelligent Home System and some other protocols through interfaces.

'''''Cardona v. Shinseki''''' was an appeal brought in the [[United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]] (CAVC) of a decision by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Board of Veterans' Appeals]] upholding the denial of service-connected disability benefits for the dependant wife of a female [[veteran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Disabled Navy Veteran in Same-Sex Marriage to Sue for Benefits | last=Miller | first=Joshua Rhett | url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/13/disabled-navy-veteran-in-same-sex-marriage-to-sue-for-denied-benefits | newspaper=FoxNews.com | date=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] denied the disability benefits based on the definition of "spouse" as "a person of the opposite sex" under federal statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Denied Veterans Benefits Over Same-Sex Marriage, Ex-Sailor Challenges Law | last=Dao | first=James | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/us/denied-veterans-benefits-over-same-sex-marriage-carmen-cardona-sues.html | newspaper=New York Times | date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2014, the CAVC dismissed the case as moot after the Secretary of Veterans Affairs advised the Court that he would neither defend nor enforce the federal statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Clinics/vlsc_Cardona_Decision_on_Mootness_14-0311.pdf |title=Cardona v.

Shinseki, Yale Law School Veterans Legal Services Clinic |accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings in the Department of Veterans Affairs==

Carmen Cardona, a [[veteran]] of the [[United States Navy]], applied in 2010 for service-connected disability benefits for her dependent wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Law students aid veteran's appeal |last=Gideon |first=Gavan |author2=Daniel Sisgoreo |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/oct/14/law-students-aid-veterans-appeal |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=October 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111154727/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/oct/14/law-students-aid-veterans-appeal/ |archivedate=November 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Veterans' Affairs Regional Office in Hartford, Connecticut, declined to recognize Cardona's marriage. Title 38 of the [[United States Code]], which relates to veterans' benefits, defines a "spouse" as "a person of the opposite sex who is a wife or husband".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|38|101(31)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Code of Federal Regulations|federal regulation]] that tracks and implements Title 38 defines "spouse" as "a person of the opposite sex" who meets certain requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/3.50 |title=38 C.F.R. § 3.50 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardona appealed the decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA), which confirmed the denial of disability benefits based on its conclusion that Cardona's wife is not a "spouse" for purposes of veterans' benefits even though their marriage is valid under Connecticut law.&lt;ref name="Decision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Clinics/VLSC_Cardona_decision.pdf |title='&amp;#39;In the appeal of Carmen J.

==Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims==

On October 13, 2011, Cardona, represented by the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pending Cases Challenging the Defense of Marriage Act - GLAD | url=http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/publications/pending-doma-cases.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed an appeal in the CAVC against [[Shinseki|Eric K. Shinseki]], the [[United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs]].

[[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] informed [[United States Congress|Congress]] on February 17, 2012, of his conclusion that the definition of "spouse" in Title 38 of the United States Code violates the equal protection component of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/ag/boehner02-17-12.pdf |title=Letter from Eric H.

House of Representatives, February 17, 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holder explained that neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) had identified any justifications that would warrant treating Title 38 differently from Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which he previously concluded violates equal protection.&lt;ref name="Letter"/&gt;

On April 19, 2012, Cardona filed a brief with the court, arguing that Title 38 and Section 3 of DOMA are unconstitutional because they violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.

===Amicus briefs===

Six amicus ([[Amicus curiae|"friend of the court"]]) briefs were filed in the case, all in support of Cardona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Disabled veteran, denied spousal benefit, finds support | last=O'Leary | first=Mary E. | url=http://www.registercitizen.com/articles/2012/04/28/news/doc4f9b7135ccc15077215328.txt | newspaper=Torrington Register Citizen | date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Connecticut Attorney General|Connecticut attorney general]] argued that the federal statutes and regulations violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] by intruding on the state's sovereign authority to determine the marital status of its citizens and to guarantee all married couples equal rights and benefits under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://efiling.uscourts.cavc.gov/cmecf/servlet/TransportRoom?servlet=ShowDoc/01201962167 |title=Brief of the State of Connecticut as Amicus Curaie in Support of the Appellant, Carmen Cardona, '&amp;#39;Carmen Cardona v.

[[File:Magna Carta (1297 version with seal, owned by David M Rubenstein).png|thumb|upright=0.7|Copy of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' from 1297.]]

A '''constitution''' is a set of [[fundamental principles]] or [[established precedents]] according to which a [[State (polity)|state]] or other organization is governed.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'', Second Edn., [[Erin McKean]] (editor), 2051 pages, May 2005, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-517077-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules together make up, i.e. ''constitute'', what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a ''written'' constitution; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a ''codified'' constitution. Some constitutions (such as the [[constitution of the United Kingdom]]) are uncodified, but written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases or treaties.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' [2014] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/3.html UKSC 3], [207]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign states to companies and unincorporated associations. A [[treaty]] which establishes an [[international organization]] is also its constitution, in that it would define how that organization is constituted. Within [[state (polity)|states]], a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom. Some constitutions, especially codified constitutions, also act as limiters of state power, by establishing lines which a state's rulers cannot cross, such as [[fundamental rights]].

The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution of any [[sovereign country]] in the world,&lt;ref name="longest"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pylee | first = M.V. | authorlink = | title = India's Constitution | publisher = S.

==Etymology==
The term ''constitution'' comes through [[French (language)|French]] from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''constitutio'', used for regulations and orders, such as the [[Roman Emperor|imperial]] enactments (''constitutiones principis'': edicta, mandata, decreta, rescripta).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2MqfUsMiDbYC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22constitutiones+principis%22 The historical and institutional context of Roman law, George Mousourakis, 2003, p. 243]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the term was widely used in [[canon law]] for an important determination, especially a decree issued by the [[Pope]], now referred to as an ''[[apostolic constitution]]''.

==General features==
Generally, every modern written constitution confers specific powers to an organization or institutional entity, established upon the primary condition that it abide by the said constitution's limitations. According to Scott Gordon, a political organization is constitutional to the extent that it "contain[s] [[institution]]alized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and [[Liberty|liberties]] of the [[citizenry]], including those that may be in the [[Minority group|minority]]".&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1999 |page=4 |isbn=0-674-16987-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of officials within an organization or polity that fall within the constitutional or statutory authority of those officials are termed "within power" (or, in Latin, ''intra vires'');  if they do not, they are termed "beyond power" (or, in Latin, ''[[ultra vires]]'').  For example, a [[students' union]] may be prohibited as an organization from engaging in activities not concerning students;  if the union becomes involved in non-student activities, these activities are considered to be ''ultra vires'' of the union's charter, and nobody would be compelled by the charter to follow them. An example from the constitutional law of [[sovereign state]]s would be a provincial [[parliament]] in a [[federal state]] trying to legislate in an area that the constitution allocates  exclusively to the federal parliament, such as ratifying a treaty.  Action that appears to be beyond power may be [[judicial review|judicially reviewed]] and, if found to be beyond power, must cease.  Legislation that is found to be beyond power will be "invalid" and of no force;  this applies to primary legislation, requiring constitutional authorization, and secondary legislation, ordinarily requiring statutory authorization. In this context, "within power", ''intra vires'', "authorized" and "valid" have the same meaning;  as do "beyond power", ''ultra vires'', "not authorized" and "invalid".

In most but not all modern states the constitution has supremacy over ordinary [[statutory law]] (see [[#Uncodified constitution|Uncodified constitution]] below); in such states when an official act is unconstitutional, i.e. it is not a power granted to the government by the constitution, that act is ''null and void'', and the nullification is ''[[ab initio]]'', that is, from inception, not from the date of the finding. It was never "law", even though, if it had been a statute or statutory provision, it might have been adopted according to the procedures for adopting legislation. Sometimes the problem is not that a statute is unconstitutional, but the application of it is, on a particular occasion, and a court may decide that while there are ways it could be applied that are constitutional, that instance was not allowed or legitimate. In such a case, only the application may be ruled unconstitutional. Historically, the remedy for such violations have been petitions for common law [[writ]]s, such as ''[[quo warranto]]''.

==History and development==

===Pre-modern constitutions===
====Ancient====
[[File:Hammurabi.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail from [[Hammurabi]]'s [[stele]] shows him receiving the laws of [[Babylon]] from the seated [[sun deity]].]]
Excavations in modern-day [[Iraq]] by [[Ernest de Sarzec]] in 1877 found evidence of the earliest known [[code of justice]], issued by the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Urukagina]] of [[Lagash]] ''ca'' 2300 BC. Perhaps the earliest prototype for a law of government, this document itself has not yet been discovered; however it is known that it allowed some rights to his citizens. For example, it is known that it relieved tax for widows and orphans, and protected the poor from the [[usury]] of the rich.

After that, many [[Forms of government|governments]] ruled by special codes of written laws. The oldest such document still known to exist seems to be the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] of [[Ur]] (''ca'' 2050 BC). Some of the better-known ancient law codes include the code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]], the [[code of Hammurabi]] of [[Babylonia]], the [[Hittite laws|Hittite code]], the [[Assyrian law|Assyrian code]] and [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]].

In 621 BC, a scribe named [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] codified the cruel oral laws of the [[city-state]] of [[Athens]]; this code prescribed the [[death penalty]] for many offences (nowadays very severe rules are often called "Draconian"). In 594 BC, [[Solon]], the ruler of Athens, created the new ''[[Solonian Constitution]]''. It eased the burden of the workers, and [[Determinacy|determined]] that membership of the ruling class was to be based on wealth ([[plutocracy]]), rather than by birth ([[aristocracy]]). [[Cleisthenes of Athens|Cleisthenes]] again reformed the Athenian constitution and set it on a democratic footing in 508 BC.

[[File:Aristotle's constitutions diagram.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Diagram illustrating the classification of constitutions by [[Aristotle]].]]
[[Aristotle]] (''ca'' 350 BC) was the first to make a formal distinction between ordinary law and constitutional law, establishing ideas of constitution and [[constitutionalism]], and attempting to classify different forms of constitutional government. The most basic definition he used to describe a constitution in general terms was "the arrangement of the offices in a state". In his works ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of Athens]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' he explores different constitutions of his day, including those of Athens, [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Sparta]], and [[Carthage]]. He classified both what he regarded as good and what he regarded as bad constitutions, and came to the conclusion that the best constitution was a mixed system, including monarchic, aristocratic, and democratic elements. He also distinguished between citizens, who had the right to participate in the state, and non-citizens and slaves, who did not.

The Romans first codified their constitution in 450 BC as the ''[[Twelve Tables]]''. They operated under a series of laws that were added from time to time, but [[Roman law]] was never reorganised into a single code until the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' (AD 438); later, in the Eastern Empire the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex repetitæ prælectionis]]'' (534) was highly influential throughout Europe. This was followed in the east by the ''Ecloga'' of [[Leo III the Isaurian]] (740) and the ''Basilica'' of [[Basil I]] (878).

The ''[[Edicts of Ashoka]]'' established constitutional principles for the 3rd century BC [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] king's rule in [[History of India|Ancient India]]. For constitutional principles almost lost to antiquity, see the [[code of Manu]].

====Early Middle ages====

Many of the Germanic people that filled the power vacuum left by the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]] codified their laws. One of the first of these [[Germanic tribal laws|Germanic law codes]] to be written was the Visigothic ''Code of [[Euric]]'' (471). This was followed by the ''[[Lex Burgundionum]]'', applying separate codes for Germans and for Romans; the ''[[Lex Alamannorum|Pactus Alamannorum]]''; and the [[Salic Law]] of the [[Franks]], all written soon after 500. In 506, the ''[[Breviary of Alaric|Breviarum]]'' or ''"Lex Romana"'' of [[Alaric II]], king of the Visigoths, adopted and consolidated the ''Codex Theodosianus'' together with assorted earlier Roman laws. Systems that appeared somewhat later include the ''[[Edictum Rothari]]'' of the [[Lombards]] (643), the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]'' (654), the ''Lex Alamannorum'' (730) and the ''[[Lex Frisionum]]'' (''ca'' 785). These continental codes were all composed in Latin, while [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] was used for those of England, beginning with the Code of [[Æthelberht of Kent]] (602). In ca. 893, [[Alfred the Great]] combined this and two other earlier Saxon codes, with various Mosaic and Christian precepts, to produce the ''[[Doom book]]'' code of laws for England.

[[Japan]]'s ''[[Seventeen-article constitution]]'' written in 604, reportedly by [[Prince Shotoku|Prince Shōtoku]], is an early example of a constitution in Asian political history. Influenced by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings, the document focuses more on social morality than institutions of government ''per se'' and remains a notable early attempt at a government constitution.

The [[Constitution of Medina]] ({{lang-ar|صحیفة المدینه}}, Ṣaḥīfat al-Madīna), also known as the Charter of Medina, was drafted by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] after his flight ([[Hegira|hijra]]) to Yathrib where he became political leader. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See:

''Islamic Quarterly'' 8 (1964) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws ([[Banu Aus|Aus]]) and [[Khazraj]] within Medina. To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish, and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community—the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

The precise dating of the Constitution of Medina remains debated but generally scholars agree it was written shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (622).&lt;ref&gt;Watt. ''Muhammad at Medina''. pp. 227–228 Watt argues that the initial agreement was shortly after the hijra and the document was amended at a later date specifically after the battle of Badr (AH [anno hijra] 2, = AD 624). Serjeant argues that the constitution is in fact 8 different treaties which can be dated according to events as they transpired in Medina with the first treaty being written shortly after Muhammad's arrival.

Wellhausen argues that it belongs to the first year of Muhammad's residence in Medina, before the battle of Badr in 2/624. Wellhausen bases this judgement on three considerations; first Muhammad is very diffident about his own position, he accepts the Pagan tribes within the Umma, and maintains the Jewish clans as clients of the Ansars see Wellhausen, Excursus, p. 158. Even Moshe Gil a skeptic of Islamic history argues that it was written within 5 months of Muhammad's arrival in Medina. Moshe Gil. "The Constitution of Medina: A Reconsideration."

In [[Wales]], the ''[[Welsh law|Cyfraith Hywel]]'' was codified by [[Hywel Dda]] c. 942–950.

====Middle ages after 1000====
The ''Pravda Yaroslava'', originally combined by [[Yaroslav the Wise]] the [[List of Ukrainian rulers|Grand Prince of Kyiv]], was granted to [[Great Novgorod]] around 1017, and in 1054 was incorporated into the ''[[Russkaya Pravda|Ruska Pravda]]'', that became the law for all of [[Kievan Rus]]. It survived only in later editions of the 15th century.

In [[England]], [[Henry I of England|Henry I's]] proclamation of the [[Charter of Liberties]] in 1100 bound the king for the first time in his treatment of the clergy and the nobility. This idea was extended and refined by the English barony when they forced [[John of England|King John]] to sign ''[[Magna Carta]]'' in 1215. The most important single article of the ''Magna Carta'', related to "''[[habeas corpus]]''", provided that the king was not permitted to imprison, outlaw, exile or kill anyone at a whim—there must be [[due process]] of law first. This article, Article 39, of the ''Magna Carta'' read:

''No free man shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his property, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor shall we go against him or send against him, unless by legal judgement of his peers, or by the law of the land.''

This provision became the cornerstone of English liberty after that point. The [[social contract]] in the original case was between the king and the nobility, but was gradually extended to all of the people. It led to the system of [[Constitutional Monarchy]], with further reforms shifting the balance of power from the monarchy and nobility to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

The [[Nomocanon]] of [[Saint Sava]] ({{lang-sr|Законоправило/Zakonopravilo}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QDFVUDmAIqIC&amp;pg=PA118 The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century ... - John V.

This legal act was well developed. [[St. Sava's Nomocanon]] was the compilation of [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]], based on [[Roman Law]] and [[Canon law]], based on [[Ecumenical Councils]] and its basic purpose was to organize functioning of the young [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian kingdom]] and the [[Serbian Ortodox Church|Serbian church]]. Saint Sava began the work on the Serbian Nomocanon in 1208 while being at [[Mount Athos]], using ''The Nomocanon in Fourteen Titles'', ''Synopsis of Stefan the Efesian'', ''Nomocanon of [[John Scholasticus]]'', Ecumenical Councils' documents, which he modified with the canonical commentaries of Aristinos and [[Joannes Zonaras]], local church meetings, rules of the [[Holy Fathers]], the law of [[Moses]], translation of Prohiron and the [[Byzantine emperors]]' [[Novellae Constitutiones|Novellae]] (most were taken from [[Justinian]]'s Novellae). The Nomocanon was completely new compilation of civil and canonical regulations, taken from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, but completed and reformed by St. Sava to function properly in Serbia. Beside decrees that organized the life of church, there are various norms regarding civil life, most of them were taken from Prohiron. [[Legal transplants]] of [[Roman Law|Roman]]-[[Byzantine law]] became the basis of the Serbian medieval law. The essence of Zakonopravilo was based on [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]].

[[Stefan Dušan]], Emperor of Serbs and Greeks, enacted [[Dušan's Code]] ({{lang-sr|Душанов Законик/Dušanov Zakonik}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dusanov-zakonik.com/indexe.html Dusanov Zakonik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803074722/http://www.dusanov-zakonik.com/indexe.html |date=August 3, 2010 }}. Dusanov Zakonik. Retrieved July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Serbia]], in two state congresses: in 1349 in [[Skopje]] and in 1354 in [[Serres]]. It regulated all social spheres, so it was the second Serbian constitution, after St. Sava's Nomocanon (Zakonopravilo). The Code was based on [[Roman Law|Roman]]-[[Byzantine law]]. The legal [[Legal transplants|transplanting]] is notable with the articles 171 and 172 of Dušan's Code, which regulated the juridical independence. They were taken from the Byzantine code [[Basilika]] (book VII, 1, 16–17).

In 1222, Hungarian King [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1222]].

Between 1220 and 1230, a [[Saxony|Saxon]] administrator, [[Eike von Repgow]], composed the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', which became the supreme law used in parts of Germany as late as 1900.

In 1998, S. Kouyaté reconstructed from oral tradition what he claims is a 14th-century charter of the [[Mali Empire]], called the ''[[Kouroukan Fouga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mangoné Naing, [http://www.oecd.org/swac/events/38516561.pdf SAH/D(2006)563 The KURUKAN FUGA Charter: An example of an Endogenous Governance Mechanism for Conflict Prevention], Inter-generational Forum on Endogenous Governance in West Africa organised by Sahel and West Africa Club / [[OECD]], Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), June 26 to 28, 2006. pp. 71–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1240, the [[Copt]]ic Egyptian Christian writer, [['Abul Fada'il Ibn al-'Assal]], wrote the ''[[Fetha Negest]]'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. 'Ibn al-Assal took his laws partly from apostolic writings and Mosaic law, and partly from the former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] codes. There are a few historical records claiming that this law code was translated into [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and entered Ethiopia around 1450 in the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]]. Even so, its first recorded use in the function of a constitution (supreme law of the land) is with [[Sarsa Dengel]] beginning in 1563. The ''Fetha Negest'' remained the supreme law in Ethiopia until 1931, when a modern-style [[Constitution of Ethiopia|Constitution]] was first granted by Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] I.

[[File:ConstCATMonso1535.png|thumb|upright=0.75|left|Third volume of the compilation of Catalan Constitutions of 1585]]
In the [[Principality of Catalonia]], the [[Catalan constitutions]] were promulgated by the Court from 1283 (or even two centuries before, if we consider the [[Usatges of Barcelona]] as part of the compilation of Constitutions) until 1716, when [[Philip V of Spain]] gave the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], finishing with the historical laws of [[Catalonia]]. These Constitutions were usually made formally as a royal initiative, but required for its approval or repeal the favorable vote of the [[Catalan Courts]], the medieval antecedent of the modern Parliaments. These laws had, as the other modern constitutions, preeminence over other laws, and they could not be contradicted by mere decrees or edicts of the king.

The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] was a decree issued by a ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' in Nuremberg headed by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] that fixed, for a period of more than four hundred years, an important aspect of the constitutional structure of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In [[China]], the [[Hongwu Emperor]] created and refined a document he called ''[[Huang Ming Zu Xun|Ancestral Injunctions]]'' (first published in 1375, revised twice more before his death in 1398). These rules served in a very real sense as a constitution for the [[Ming Dynasty]] for the next 250 years.

The oldest written document still governing a sovereign nation today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/08/jon-huntsman/oldest-surviving-one-document-text/ |title=The United States has "the longest surviving constitution." |publisher=PolitiFact.com |accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[San Marino]]. The ''[[Constitution of San Marino|Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini]]'' was written in Latin and consists of six books. The first book, with 62 articles, establishes councils, courts, various executive officers and the powers assigned to them. The remaining books cover criminal and civil law, judicial procedures and remedies. Written in 1600, the document was based upon the ''Statuti Comunali'' (Town Statute) of 1300, itself influenced by the ''Codex Justinianus'', and it remains in force today.

In 1392 the ''Carta de Logu'' was [[legal code]] of the [[Giudicato of Arborea]] promulgated by the ''giudicessa'' [[Eleanor of Arborea|Eleanor]]. It was in force in [[Sardinia]] until it was superseded by the code of [[Charles Felix of Sardinia|Charles Felix]] in April 1827. The Carta was a work of great importance in [[Sardinia]]n history. It was an organic, coherent, and systematic work of legislation encompassing the [[Civil law (area)|civil]] and [[penal law]].

====Iroquois "Great Law of Peace"====
{{main|Great Law of Peace}}
The ''Gayanashagowa'', the oral constitution of the [[Iroquois]] nation also known as the Great Law of Peace, established a system of governance in which [[sachem]]s (tribal chiefs) of the members of the Iroquois League made decisions on the basis of universal consensus of all chiefs following discussions that were initiated by a single tribe.

In 1639, the [[Colony of Connecticut]] adopted the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], which was the first [[North America]]n constitution, and is the basis for every new Connecticut constitution since, and is also the reason for [[Connecticut]]'s nickname, "the [[Constitution State]]".

The [[English Protectorate]] that was set up by [[Oliver Cromwell]] after the [[English Civil War]] promulgated the first detailed written constitution adopted by a modern state;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/240140/Instrument-of-Government Instrument of Government (England [1653&amp;#93;) - Encyclopædia Britannica]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; it was called the [[Instrument of Government]]. This formed the basis of government for the short lived republic from 1653 to 1657 by providing a legal rationale for the increasing power of Cromwell, after Parliament consistently failed to govern effectively. Most of the concepts and ideas embedded into modern constitutional theory, especially [[bicameralism]], [[separation of powers]], the written constitution, and [[judicial review]], can be traced back to the experiments of that period.

Drafted by [[John Lambert (General)|Major-General John Lambert]] in 1653, the ''Instrument of Government'' included elements incorporated from an earlier document "[[Heads of Proposals]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tyacke [https://books.google.com/books?id=McvcmiZ6h8gC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Heads+of+Proposals%22+++%22Instrument+of+Government%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heads%20of%20Proposals%22%20%20%20%22Instrument%20of%20Government%22&amp;f=false p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farr [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmxFHPk0MSUC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Heads+of+Proposals%22+++%22Instrument+of+Government%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heads%20of%20Proposals%22%20%20%20%22Instrument%20of%20Government%22&amp;f=false pp. 80,81]. See ''Declaration of Representation'' of June 14, 1647&lt;/ref&gt; which had been agreed to by the [[Army Council (1647)|Army Council]] in 1647, as a set of propositions intended to be a basis for a constitutional settlement after King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was defeated in the [[First English Civil War]]. Charles had rejected the propositions, but before the start of the Second Civil War, the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandees]] of the [[New Model Army]] had presented the ''Heads of Proposals'' as their alternative to the more radical [[Agreement of the People]] presented by the Agitators and their civilian supporters at the [[Putney Debates]].

On January 4, 1649 the [[Rump Parliament]] declared "that the  people are, under God, the original of all just power; that the Commons of England, being chosen by and representing the people, have the supreme power in this nation".&lt;ref name=Fritze&gt;Fritze, Ronald H. &amp; Robison, William B.

The ''Instrument of Government'' was adopted by Parliament on December 15, 1653 and [[Oliver Cromwell]] was installed as [[Lord Protector]] on the following day. The constitution set up a state council consisting of 21 members while executive authority was vested in the office of "[[Lord Protector of the Commonwealth]]"; this position was designated as a non-hereditary life appointment. It also required the calling of triennial [[Parliament]]s, with each sitting for at least five months.

The ''Instrument of Government'' was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], proposed by Sir [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Christopher Packe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Lee|Lee, Sidney]] (1903), [[Dictionary of National Biography]] [https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft#page/991/mode/1up Index and Epitome p. 991].&lt;/ref&gt; The Petition offered hereditary [[monarchy]] to [[Oliver Cromwell]], asserted [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s control over issuing new [[taxation]], provided an independent council to advise the king and safeguarded 'Triennial' meetings of Parliament. A modified version of the Humble Petition with the clause on kingship removed was ratified on 25 May. This finally met its demise in conjunction with the death of Cromwell and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of the monarchy.

Other examples of European constitutions of this era were the [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 and the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772]].

All of the British colonies in North America that were to become the 13 original United States, adopted their own constitutions in 1776 and 1777, during the American Revolution (and before the later [[Articles of Confederation]] and [[United States Constitution]]), with the exceptions of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] adopted [[Constitution of Massachusetts|its Constitution]] in 1780, the oldest still-functioning constitution of any U.S. state; while Connecticut and Rhode Island officially continued to operate under their old colonial charters, until they adopted their first state constitutions in 1818 and 1843, respectively.

What is sometimes called the "enlightened constitution" model was developed by philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[John Locke]]. The model proposed that constitutional governments should be stable, adaptable, accountable, open and should represent the people (i.e., support [[democracy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/134169/constitution constitution (politics and law) - Encyclopædia Britannica].

''[[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk|Agreements and Constitutions of Laws and Freedoms of the Zaporizian Host]]'' was written in 1710 by [[Pylyp Orlyk]], ''hetman'' of the [[Zaporozhian Host]]. It was written to establish a free [[Cossack Hetmanate|Zaporozhian-Ukrainian Republic]], with the support of [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. It is notable in that it established a democratic standard for the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of Montesquieu's ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]''. This Constitution also limited the executive authority of the ''hetman'', and established a democratically elected Cossack parliament called the General Council. However, Orlyk's project for an independent [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] State never materialized, and his constitution, written in exile, never went into effect.

[[Corsican Constitution]]s of 1755 and 1794 were inspired by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. The latter introduced  [[universal suffrage]] for property owners.

The [[United States Constitution]], ratified June 21, 1788, was influenced by the writings of [[Polybius]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and others.

Another landmark document was the [[French Constitution of 1791|French Constitution]], ratified on September 3, 1791.

On March 19, the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] was ratified  by a [[Cortes Generales|parliament]] gathered in [[Cadiz]], the only Spanish continental city which was safe from [[Peninsular War|French occupation]]. The Spanish Constitution served as a model for other liberal constitutions of several [[South Europe|South-European]] and [[Latin America]]n nations like, for example, [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Portuguese Constitution of 1822]], constitutions of various [[Italy|Italian]] states during [[Carbonari]] revolts (i.e., in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]), [[Constitution of Norway|the Norwegian constitution of 1814]], or the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1824]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |authorlink=Stanley G.

Italian liberalism in 1820–1821 relied on junior officers and the provincial middle classes, essentially the same social base as in Spain. It even used a Hispanized political vocabulary, for it was led by ''giunte'' (juntas), appointed local ''capi politici'' (''jefes políticos''), used the terms of ''liberali'' and ''servili'' (emulating the Spanish word serviles applied to supporters of absolutism), and in the end talked of resisting by means of a ''guerrilla''. For both Portuguese and Italian liberals of these years, the Spanish constitution of 1812 remained the standard document of reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the Constitution of 1824 expressed the option for the monarchy as political system after Brazilian Independence. The leader of the national emancipation process was the Portuguese prince [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], elder son of the king of Portugal. Pedro was crowned in 1822 as first emperor of Brazil. The country was ruled by Constitutional monarchy until 1889, when finally adopted the Republican model.

In [[Denmark]], as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[absolute monarchy]] lost its personal possession of [[Norway]] to another absolute monarchy, [[Sweden]]. However the Norwegians managed to infuse a radically democratic and liberal [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] in 1814, adopting many facets from the American constitution and the revolutionary French ones; but maintaining a hereditary [[Constitutional monarchy|monarch]] limited by the constitution, like the Spanish one.

The first [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] was put in force in September 1848 (with official revisions in 1878, 1891, 1949, 1971, 1982 and 1999).

The [[Serbian revolution]] initially led to a proclamation of a proto-constitution in 1811; the full-fledged Constitution of Serbia followed few decades later, in 1835. The first Serbian constitution ([http://sr.wikipedia.org/sr/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%9A%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2 Sretenjski ustav]) was adopted at the national assembly in [[Kragujevac]] on February 15, 1835.

The [[Constitution of Canada]] came into force on July 1, 1867 as the British North America Act, an act of the British Parliament. Over a century later, the BNA Act was patriated to the Canadian Parliament and augmented with the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11/latest/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11.html#sec60 Constitution Act, 1982, s. 60]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the ''Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982'', Canada's constitution also has unwritten elements based in common law and convention.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Law Group, Canadian Constitutional Law. 3rd ed.

==Principles of constitutional design==
After tribal people first began to live in cities and establish nations, many of these functioned according to unwritten customs, while some developed autocratic, even tyrannical monarchs, who [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]], or mere personal whim. Such rule led some thinkers to take the position that what mattered was not the design of governmental institutions and operations, as much as the character of the rulers. This view can be seen in [[Plato]], who called for rule by "philosopher-kings."&lt;ref&gt;'' Aristotle, by Francesco Hayez&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers, such as [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]], would examine designs for government from a legal and historical standpoint.

The [[Renaissance]] brought a series of political philosophers who wrote implied criticisms of the practices of monarchs and sought to identify principles of constitutional design that would be likely to yield more effective and just governance from their viewpoints. This began with revival of the Roman [[law of nations]] concept&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.constitution.org/victoria/victoria_.htm Relectiones]'', Franciscus de Victoria (lect. 1532, first pub. 1557).&lt;/ref&gt; and its application to the relations among nations, and they sought to establish customary "laws of war and peace"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Law of War and Peace]]'', Hugo Grotius (1625)&lt;/ref&gt; to ameliorate wars and make them less likely. This led to considerations of what authority monarchs or other officials have and don't have, from where that authority derives, and the remedies for the abuse of such authority.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.constitution.org/vct/vct.htm Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos (Defense of Liberty Against Tyrants)]'', "Junius Brutus" (Orig. Fr. 1581, Eng. tr. 1622, 1688)&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminal juncture in this line of discourse arose in England from the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] [[Commonwealth of England|Protectorate]], the writings of [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Samuel Rutherford]], the [[Levellers]], [[John Milton]], and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], leading to the debate between [[Robert Filmer]], arguing for the divine right of monarchs, on the one side, and on the other, [[Henry Neville (writer)|Henry Neville]], [[James Tyrrell (writer)|James Tyrrell]], [[Algernon Sidney]], and [[John Locke]]. What arose from the latter was a concept of government being erected on the foundations of first, a state of nature governed by natural laws, then a state of society, established by a social contract or compact, which bring underlying natural or social laws, before governments are formally established on them as foundations.

Along the way several writers examined how the design of government was important, even if the government were headed by a monarch. They also classified various historical examples of governmental designs, typically into democracies, aristocracies, or monarchies, and considered how just and effective each tended to be and why, and how the advantages of each might be obtained by combining elements of each into a more complex design that balanced competing tendencies. Some, such as [[Montesquieu]], also examined how the functions of government, such as legislative, executive, and judicial, might appropriately be separated into branches. The prevailing theme among these writers was that the design of constitutions is not completely arbitrary or a matter of taste. They generally held that there are underlying principles of design that constrain all constitutions for every polity or organization. Each built on the ideas of those before concerning what those principles might be.

The later writings of [[Orestes Brownson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2053 ''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny''], O. A. Brownson (1866)&lt;/ref&gt; would try to explain what constitutional designers were trying to do. According to Brownson there are, in a sense, three "constitutions" involved: The first the ''constitution of nature'' that includes all of what was called "natural law." The second is the ''constitution of society'', an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it establishes the third, a ''constitution of government''. The second would include such elements as the making of decisions by public [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] called by [[public notice]] and conducted by established [[Parliamentary procedure|rules of procedure]]. Each constitution must be consistent with, and derive its authority from, the ones before it, as well as from a historical act of society formation or constitutional ratification. Brownson argued that a [[state (polity)|state]] is a society with effective dominion over a well-defined territory, that consent to a well-designed constitution of government arises from presence on that territory, and that it is possible for provisions of a written constitution of government to be "unconstitutional" if they are inconsistent with the constitutions of nature or society. Brownson argued that it is not ratification alone that makes a written constitution of government legitimate, but that it must also be competently designed and applied.

Other writers&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Constitutional Design'', Donald S. Lutz (2006) {{ISBN|0-521-86168-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that such considerations apply not only to all national constitutions of government, but also to the constitutions of private organizations, that it is not an accident that the constitutions that tend to satisfy their members contain certain elements, as a minimum, or that their provisions tend to become very similar as they are amended after experience with their use. Provisions that give rise to certain kinds of questions are seen to need additional provisions for how to resolve those questions, and provisions that offer no course of action may best be omitted and left to policy decisions. Provisions that conflict with what Brownson and others can discern are the underlying "constitutions" of nature and society tend to be difficult or impossible to execute, or to lead to unresolvable disputes.

Constitutional design has been treated as a kind of [[metagame]] in which play consists of finding the best design and provisions for a written constitution that will be the rules for the game of government, and that will be most likely to optimize a balance of the utilities of justice, liberty, and security. An example is the metagame [[Nomic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/ The Paradox of Self-Amendment], byPeter Suber (1990) {{ISBN|0-8204-1212-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political economy theory regards constitutions as coordination devices that help citizens to prevent rulers from abusing power. If the citizenry can coordinate a response to police government officials in the face of a constitutional fault, then the government have the incentives to honor the rights that the constitution guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weingast|first=Barry R.|date=Summer 2005|title=The Constitutional Dilemma of Economic Liberty|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=89–108|doi=10.1257/089533005774357815}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view considers that constitutions are not enforced by the citizens at-large, but rather by the administrative powers of the state. Because rulers cannot themselves implement their policies, they need to rely on a set of organizations (armies, courts, police agencies, tax collectors) to implement it. In this position, they can directly sanction the government by refusing to cooperate, disabling the authority of the rulers. Therefore, constitutions could be characterized by a self-enforcing equilibria between the rulers and powerful administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González de Lara|first=Yadira|last2=Greif|first2=Avner|last3=Jha|first3=Saumitra|date=May 2008|title=The Administrative Foundations of Self-Enforcing Constitutions|url=|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=98 |issue=2|pages=105–109|doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most commonly, the term ''constitution'' refers to a set of rules and principles that define the nature and extent of government. Most constitutions seek to regulate the relationship between institutions of the state, in a basic sense the relationship between the executive, legislature and the judiciary, but also the relationship of institutions within those branches. For example, executive branches can be divided into a head of government, government departments/ministries, executive agencies and a [[civil service]]/administration. Most constitutions also attempt to define the relationship between individuals and the state, and to establish the broad rights of individual citizens. It is thus the most basic law of a territory from which all the other laws and rules are hierarchically derived; in some territories it is in fact called "[[Basic Law]]".

===Key features===
The following are features of democratic constitutions that have been identified by political scientists to exist, in one form or another, in virtually all national constitutions.

====Classification====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type !! Form !! Example
|-
| Codified   || in single act (document) || ''Most of the world constitutions.''
|-
| Uncodified || fully written (in few documents) || [[Constitution of San Marino|San Marino]], Israel, Saudi Arabia
|-
| Uncodified || partially unwritten (see [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]) || Canada, NZ, UK
|}

====Codification====
A fundamental classification is codification or lack of codification. A codified constitution is one that is contained in a single document, which is the single source of constitutional law in a state. An uncodified constitution is one that is not contained in a single document, consisting of several different sources, which may be written or unwritten; see [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]].

=====Codified constitution=====
Most states in the world have codified constitutions.

Codified constitutions are often the product of some dramatic political change, such as a [[revolution]]. The process by which a country adopts a constitution is closely tied to the historical and political context driving this fundamental change. The legitimacy (and often the longevity) of codified constitutions has often been tied to the process by which they are initially adopted and some scholars have [http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/75150/wiki-constitutionalism pointed out] that high constitutional [[Wiki-constitutionalism|turnover]] within a given country may itself be detrimental to separation of powers and the rule of law.

States that have codified constitutions normally give the constitution supremacy over ordinary [[statute]] law. That is, if there is any conflict between a legal statute and the codified constitution, all or part of the statute can be declared ''ultra vires'' by a court, and struck down as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. In addition, exceptional procedures are often required to [[constitutional amendment|amend a constitution]]. These procedures may include: convocation of a special [[constituent assembly]] or constitutional convention, requiring a [[supermajority]] of legislators' votes, the consent of regional legislatures, a [[referendum]] process, and/or other procedures that make amending a constitution more difficult than passing a simple law.

Constitutions may also provide that their most basic principles can never be abolished, even by amendment. In case a formally valid amendment of a constitution infringes these principles protected against any amendment, it may constitute a so-called ''unconstitutional constitutional law''.

Codified constitutions normally consist of a ceremonial [[preamble]], which sets forth the goals of the state and the motivation for the constitution, and several articles containing the substantive provisions. The preamble, which is omitted in some constitutions, may contain a [[Constitutional references to God|reference to God]] and/or to fundamental values of the state such as [[liberty]], [[democracy]] or [[human rights]]. In ethnic nation-states such as [[Estonia]], the mission of the state can be defined as preserving a specific nation, language and culture.

=====Uncodified constitution=====
{{Main|Uncodified constitution}}
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|[[Magna Carta]]]]
{{As of|2017}} only two sovereign states, [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], have wholly uncodified constitutions. The [[Basic Laws of Israel]] have since 1950 been intended to be the basis for a constitution, but as of 2017 it had not been drafted. The various Laws are considered to have precedence over other laws, and give the procedure by which they can be amended, typically by a simple majority of members of the Knesset (parliament).&lt;ref name=lawsintro&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Laws - Introduction|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_yesod.htm|website=The Knesset|date=2016|accessdate=7 May 2017}} Article gives information on the procedures for amending each of the Basic Laws of Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncodified constitutions are the product of an "evolution" of laws and conventions over centuries (such as in the [[Westminster System]] that developed in Britain). By contrast to codified constitutions, uncodified constitutions include both written sources – e.g. constitutional statutes enacted by the Parliament – and unwritten sources – [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]], observation of [[precedent]]s, [[royal prerogative]]s, [[convention (norm)|customs]] and traditions, such as holding general elections on Thursdays; together these constitute [[British constitutional law]].

=====Written versus unwritten; codified versus uncodified=====
Some constitutions are largely, but not wholly, codified. For example, in the Constitution of Australia, most of its fundamental political principles and regulations concerning the relationship between branches of government, and concerning the government and the individual are codified in a single document, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. However, the presence of statutes with constitutional significance, namely the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], as adopted by the Commonwealth in the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]], and the [[Australia Act 1986]] means that Australia's constitution is not contained in a single constitutional document. It means the Constitution of Australia is uncodified, it also contains [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]], thus is partially unwritten.

The [[Constitution of Canada]], which evolved from the [[British North America Acts]] until severed from nominal British control by the [[Canada Act 1982]] (analogous to the Australia Act 1986), is a similar example. Canada's constitution [[List of Canadian constitutional documents|consists of almost 30 different statutes]].

The terms ''written constitution'' and ''codified constitution'' are often used interchangeably, as are ''unwritten constitution'' and ''uncodified constitution'', although this usage is technically inaccurate. A codified constitution is a single document; states that do not have such a document have uncodified, but not entirely unwritten, constitutions, since much of an uncodified constitution is usually written in laws such as the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] and the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts]] of the United Kingdom. Uncodified constitutions largely lack protection against amendment by the government of the time. For example, the UK [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] legislated by simple majority for strictly [[Fixed-term election|fixed-term parliaments]]; until then the ruling party could call a general election at any convenient time up to the maximum term of five years. This change would require a constitutional amendment in most nations.

====Entrenchment====
{{Original research|section|date=December 2010}}

[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|[[United States Constitution]]]]

{{further|Fundamental Laws of England}}

The presence or lack of entrenchment is a fundamental feature of constitutions. An entrenched constitution cannot be altered in any way by a legislature as part of its normal business concerning ordinary statutory laws, but can only be amended by a different and more onerous procedure. There may be a requirement for a [[Constituent assembly|special body]] to be set up, or the proportion of favourable votes of members of existing legislative bodies may be required to be higher to pass a constitutional amendment than for [[statute]]s. The [[entrenched clause]]s of a constitution can create different degrees of entrenchment, ranging from simply excluding constitutional amendment from the normal business of a legislature, to making certain amendments either more difficult than normal modifications, or forbidden under any circumstances.

Entrenchment is an inherent feature in most codified constitutions. A codified constitution will incorporate the rules which must be followed for the constitution itself to be changed.

The US constitution is an example of an entrenched constitution, and the UK constitution is an example of a constitution that is not entrenched (or codified). In some states the text of the constitution may be changed; in others the original text is not changed, and [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]] are passed which add to and may override the original text and earlier amendments.

Procedures for constitutional amendment vary between states. In a nation with a federal system of government the approval of a majority of state or provincial legislatures may be required. Alternatively, a national referendum may be required. Details are to be found in the articles on the constitutions of the various nations and federal states in the world.

In constitutions that are not entrenched, no special procedure is required for modification. Lack of entrenchment is a characteristic of uncodified constitutions; the constitution is not recognised with any higher legal status than ordinary [[statutes]]. In the UK, for example laws which modify written or unwritten provisions of the constitution are passed on a simple majority in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. No special "constitutional amendment" procedure is required. The principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] holds that no sovereign parliament may be bound by the acts of its predecessors;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040821114312/http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/eucon/fcosov.html UK principle: no Parliament is bound by the acts of its predecessors]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no higher authority that can create law which binds Parliament. The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]] is nominally the head of state with important powers, such as the power to declare war; the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|uncodified and unwritten constitution]] removes all these powers in practice.

In practice democratic governments do not use the lack of entrenchment of the constitution to impose the will of the government or abolish all civil rights, as they could in theory do, but the distinction between constitutional and other law is still somewhat arbitrary, usually following historical principles embodied in important past legislation. For example, several British [[Acts of Parliament]] such as the [[English Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], Human Rights Act and, prior to the creation of Parliament, Magna Carta are regarded as granting fundamental rights and principles which are treated as almost constitutional. Several rights that in another state might be guaranteed by constitution have indeed been abolished or modified by the British parliament in the early 21st century, including{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} the unconditional right to [[trial by jury]], the [[right to silence]] without prejudicial inference, [[Habeas corpus|permissible detention before a charge is made]] extended from 24 hours to 42 days, and the [[Double jeopardy|right not to be tried twice for the same offence]].

=====Absolutely unmodifiable articles=====
The strongest level of [[entrenched clause|entrenchment]] exists in those constitutions that state that some of their most fundamental principles are absolute, i.e. certain articles may not be amended under any circumstances. An amendment of a constitution that is made consistently with that constitution, except that it violates the absolute non-modifiability, can be called an ''unconstitutional constitutional law''. Ultimately it is always possible for a constitution to be overthrown by internal or external force, for example, a [[revolution]] (perhaps claiming to be justified by the [[right to revolution]]) or invasion.
In the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court has created the [[Doctrine of Basic Structure]] in Kesavananda Bharti's case (1973) stating that the essential features of the Basic structure cannot be amended by the Parliament. The Court has identified judicial review, independence of Judiciary, free and fair election, core of Fundamental Rights as a few of the essential features which are unamendable. However, the Supreme Court did not identify specific provisions which are in the category of absolute entrenchment. A critical analysis of the Doctrine of Basic Structure appears in Professor M.K. Bhandari's book ''Basic Structure of Indian Constitution - A Critical Reconsideration''.

An example of absolute unmodifiability is found in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]. Articles 1 and 20 protect human dignity, human rights, democracy, rule of law, federal and social state principles, and the people's right of resistance as a last resort against an attempt to abolish the constitutional order. [[Entrenched clause#Germany|Article 79, Section 3]] states that these principles cannot be changed, even according to the methods of amendment defined elsewhere in the document, until a new constitution comes into effect.

Another example is the [[Constitution of Honduras]], which has an article stating that the article itself and certain other articles cannot be changed in any circumstances. Article 374 of the Honduras Constitution asserts this unmodifiability, stating, "It is not possible to reform, in any case, the preceding article, the present article, the constitutional articles referring to the form of government, to the national territory, to the presidential period, the prohibition to serve again as President of the Republic, the citizen who has performed under any title in consequence of which she/he cannot be President of the Republic in the subsequent period."&lt;ref name="georgetown_const_82-05_art374"&gt;{{Cite journal | title= Republic of Honduras: Political Constitution of 1982 through 2005 reforms; Article 374 | work= Political Database of the Americas | publisher= [[Georgetown University]] | url= http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html  | language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unmodifiability article played an important role in the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]].

====Distribution of sovereignty====
{{See also|Federalism}}

Constitutions also establish where sovereignty is located in the state. There are three basic types of distribution of sovereignty according to the degree of centralisation of power: unitary, federal, and confederal. The distinction is not absolute.

In a unitary state, sovereignty resides in the state itself, and the constitution determines this. The territory of the state may be divided into regions, but they are not sovereign and are subordinate to the state. In the UK, the constitutional doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]] dictates than sovereignty is ultimately contained at the centre. Some powers have been [[devolution|devolved]] to [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] (but not [[England]]). Some unitary states ([[Spain]] is an example) devolve more and more power to sub-national governments until the state functions in practice much like a federal state.

A federal state has a central structure with at most a small amount of territory mainly containing the institutions of the federal government, and several regions (called ''states'', ''provinces'', etc.) which compose the territory of the whole state. Sovereignty is divided between the centre and the constituent regions. The constitutions of Canada and the United States establish federal states, with power divided between the federal government and the provinces or states. Each of the regions may in turn have its own constitution (of unitary nature).

A confederal state comprises again several regions, but the central structure has only limited coordinating power, and sovereignty is located in the regions. Confederal constitutions are rare, and there is often dispute to whether so-called "confederal" states are actually federal.

To some extent a group of states which do not constitute a federation as such may by [[treaty|treaties]] and accords give up parts of their sovereignty to a [[supranational]] entity. For example, the countries constituting the [[European Union]] have agreed to abide by some Union-wide measures which restrict their absolute sovereignty in some ways, e.g., the use of the [[metric system of measurement]] instead of national units previously used.

====Separation of powers====
{{Main|Separation of powers}}

Constitutions usually explicitly divide power between various branches of government. The standard model, described by the [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], involves three branches of government: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary|judicial]]. Some constitutions include additional branches, such as an [[audit|auditory branch]]. Constitutions vary extensively as to the degree of separation of powers between these branches.

====Lines of accountability====
In [[presidential]] and [[semi-presidential]] systems of government, department secretaries/ministers are accountable to the [[president]], who has patronage powers to appoint and dismiss ministers. The president is accountable to the people in an election.

In [[parliamentary]] systems, Cabinet Ministers are accountable to [[Parliament]], but it is the [[prime minister]] who appoints and dismisses them. In the case of the United Kingdom and other countries with a monarchy, it is the monarch who appoints and dismisses ministers, on the advice of the prime minister. In turn the prime minister will resign if the government loses the confidence of the parliament (or a part of it). Confidence can be lost if the government loses a [[vote of no confidence]] or, depending on the country,&lt;ref&gt;A synchronic comparative perspective were before the founding fathers of Italian Constitution, when they were faced with the question of bicameralism and related issues of confidence and the legislative procedure, {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Il bicameralismo tra due modelli mancati|journal= L’Ago e il filo edizione online|date=2013| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89409110}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; loses a particularly important vote in parliament, such as vote on the budget. When a government loses confidence, it stays in office until a new government is formed; something which normally but not necessarily required the holding of a general election.

====State of emergency====
{{Main|State of emergency}}
Many constitutions allow the declaration under exceptional circumstances of some form of state of emergency during which some rights and guarantees are suspended. This provision can be and has been abused to allow a government to suppress dissent without regard for human rights—see the article on [[state of emergency]].

===Facade constitutions===
{{See also|Constitutionalism}}
Italian political theorist [[Giovanni Sartori]] noted the existence of national constitutions which are a facade for authoritarian sources of power. While such documents may express respect for [[human rights]] or establish an independent judiciary, they may be ignored when the government feels threatened, or never put into practice. An extreme example was the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]] that on paper supported [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of speech]]; however, citizens who transgressed unwritten limits were summarily [[Political prisoner|imprisoned]]. The example demonstrates that the protections and benefits of a constitution are ultimately provided not through its written terms but through deference by government and society to its principles. A constitution may change from being real to a facade and back again as democratic and autocratic governments succeed each other.

==Constitutional courts==
{{Further|Constitutional court|Constitutionality}}

Constitutions are often, but by no means always, protected by a legal body whose job it is to interpret those constitutions and, where applicable, declare void executive and legislative acts which infringe the constitution. In some countries, such as [[Germany]], this function is carried out by a dedicated constitutional court which performs this (and only this) function. In other countries, such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the ordinary courts may perform this function in addition to their other responsibilities. While elsewhere, like in the [[United Kingdom]], the concept of declaring an act to be unconstitutional does not exist.

A constitutional violation is an action or legislative act that is judged by a [[constitutional court]] to be contrary to the constitution, that is, unconstitutional. An example of constitutional violation by the executive could be a public office holder who acts outside the powers granted to that office by a constitution. An example of constitutional violation by the legislature is an attempt to pass a law that would contradict the constitution, without first going through the proper [[constitutional amendment]] process.

Some countries, mainly those with uncodified constitutions, have no such courts at all. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] has traditionally operated under the principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] under which the laws passed by [[United Kingdom Parliament]] could not be questioned by the courts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2286">The '''Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions''' is a [[multilateral treaty]] that aims to prevent, detect, and punish [[match fixing]] in sport. The convention was concluded in [[Magglingen|Macolin/Magglingen]], [[Switzerland]], on 18 September 2014. At its conclusion, it was immediately signed by 15 states of the [[Council of Europe]]; it is open to ratification of Council of Europe states and other states that were involved in its negotiation. The treaty will enter into force after being ratified by five states, three of which must be Council of Europe states.

A major focus of the convention is to prevent and punish illegal [[sports betting]] operations and to prevent [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] in legal sports betting operators and sports organisations.

As of July 2016, the convention has been signed by 27 states and ratified by [[Norway]] and [[Portugal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3515">{{Politics of France}}
The '''Council of the Republic''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil de la République}}) was the name of the [[upper house]] of the [[legislature]] of the [[French Fourth Republic]] (1946–1958). It was replaced by the [[Senate of France|Senate]] when the [[Constitution of France|constitution]] of the [[French Fifth Republic]] came into force.

==History==
The constitution of the Fourth Republic, which came into force in 1946, stipulated that parliament was bicameral.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution de 1946, IVe République |url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/la-constitution/les-constitutions-de-la-france/constitution-de-1946-ive-republique.5109.html |publisher=Constitutional Council of France |language=French |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper house was named the "Council of the Republic" (as opposed to the Senate of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]) and was granted greatly diminished powers.&lt;ref name="upper"&gt;{{cite web |title=La Chambre haute avant la Vème République |url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/decouverte-institutions/institutions/approfondissements/chambre-haute-avant-veme-republique.html |language=French |work=Vie publique |publisher=Government of France |date=2006-05-06 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
The council did not have the power to make laws, which was the responsibility of the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. The council was mainly consultative, and bills were only given a single reading at the council before being passed.&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt;

However, it did share responsibility should the need arose to amend the constitution in matters regarding the election of the [[President of France|President of the Republic]].&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt; A formal notice to the council was required to declare war.&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

==Composition==
Members of the Council were known as '"councillors" (''conseiller'') from 1946 to 1948, and then "senators" from 1948 onwards. The number of senators had to be between 250 and 320.&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt; Senators were elected by indirect universal suffrage: five-sixths were elected by [[Communes of France|communes]] and [[Departments of France|departments]]; the other one-sixth were elected by the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]], the lower house.&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt; They served six-year terms.&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt;

===President===
The President was the presiding officer of the council.

'''Daylight harvesting''' systems use [[daylight]] to offset the amount of electric [[lighting]] needed to properly light a space, in order to reduce [[energy consumption]].  This is accomplished using [[lighting control system]]s that are able to dim or switch electric lighting in response to changing daylight availability.  The term Daylight Harvesting has become the standard in the fields of [[lighting]], [[sustainable architecture]], and [[active daylighting]] industries.

==System design and components==
Daylight harvesting systems are typically designed to maintain a minimum recommended [[illuminance|light level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoo|first1=Seunghwan|last2=Kim|first2=Jonghun|last3=Jang|first3=Cheol-Yong|last4=Jeong|first4=Hakgeun|title=A sensor-less LED dimming system based on  daylight harvesting with BIPV systems|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/view_article.cfm?gotourl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eopticsinfobase%2Eorg%2FDirectPDFAccess%2FDAB2FFC3-DA91-5E1D-69C013A04919E893_276152%2Foe-22-S1-A132%2Epdf%3Fda%3D1%26id%3D276152%26seq%3D0%26mobile%3Dno&amp;org=|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This light level will vary according to the needs and use of the space; for example, the commonly recommended light level for [[offices]] is 500 [[Lux]] (or around 50 [[footcandles]]) on the desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | author = ANSI-IESNA
 | author2 = Newsham, G. R.
 | publisher = ANSI-IESNA
 | year = 2004
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photosensors==
All daylight harvesting systems use a light level sensor, a [[photosensor]], to detect the prevailing light level, [[luminance]] or [[brightness]], in open-loop or closed-loop systems. Photosensors are used to adjust electric lighting based on the available daylight in the space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/researchAreas/reducingbarriers/photosensorSolutions.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lrc.rpi.edu"&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/PDF/VIEW/SR_Photosensors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[open-loop controller|open-loop system]], the photosensor detects the amount of available daylight only, and can be positioned on the building's exterior wall or roof, or inside the building facing the window or skylight. In a closed-loop system, the photosensor detects the total [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] amount of light, from both daylight and electric sources in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Lightning Product Information Program |url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/tutorials/photosensors/feed.asp |publisher=Lighting Research Center |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903090628/http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/tutorials/photosensors/feed.asp |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dilouie|first1=Craig|title=Photosensors: Technology and Major Trends|url=http://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/photosensors-technology-and-major-trends/|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in an office a closed-loop photosensor can be positioned on the [[ceiling]] facing the desktops in order to detect the amount of light on the work surface, as placing the sensor on the desktop itself would be impractical. In both the open- and closed-loop configurations, the signal from the photosensor must be carefully calibrated to accurately indicate the effect of exterior daylight variations on the light level on 'important function' areas in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control modules and dimming==
The signal from the photosensor is interpreted by a [[lighting control system]] module, an automated [[light switch]]ing device, in the electric lighting system which can reduce the electric lighting, by shutting off or dimming fixtures as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/daylighting/pdf/14005DayswitchReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/daylighting/pdf/DaySwitchDemoRpt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If the electric lighting is dimmable, then the artificial lighting may be continuously adjusted in proportion to the amount of daylight available. If the electric lighting is on-off only, then an electric lighting fixture or lamp must remain on at full output until daylight can meet the entire recommended light level for the space. Non-dimming variants include having multiple non-adjacent light fixtures such as alternate units in the ceiling 'grid layout,' or daylight source adjacent fixtures near windows or skylights, linked for [[X10 (industry standard)|module]] on-off switching. Another variant of on-off switching is step switching (sometimes referred to as "bi-level switching"), in which multiple lamps in a single light fixture can be switched on and off independent of each other. This allows for typically one or two steps between full output and zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Dimming systems are generally more expensive than on-off systems. They have the potential to save more energy, because they can reduce electric light output when daylight can only partially meet the needs of the space. However, dimming systems may also require a little more energy for their basic operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understand compatibility, performance, and dimming issues in LED lighting (MAGAZINE)|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/iif/print/volume-2/issue-6/features/understand-compatibility-performance-and-dimming-issues-in-led-lighting-magazine.html|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a dimming system is well-calibrated, the occupants of the space will not notice changes in electric lighting due to daylight harvesting, whereas they are very likely to notice the changes due to on-off or step switching.

==Energy savings==
Several studies have recorded the energy savings due to daylight harvesting.  Energy savings for electric lighting in the range of 20-60% are common.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Savings are very dependent on the type of space the light harvesting [[lighting control system|control system]] is deployed in, and its usage.&lt;ref name="lrc.rpi.edu"/&gt; Clearly, savings can only accrue in spaces with substantial daylight where electric lighting would have been otherwise used.  Therefore, daylight harvesting works best in spaces with access to conventional or [[clerestory]] [[window]]s, [[skylight]]s, [[light tube]] groups, [[glass block]] walls, and other [[passive daylighting]] sources from [[sunlight]]; and where electric lighting would otherwise be left on for long periods.  Such spaces have included [[office]]s, [[Atrium (architecture)|atria]], interior public multistory [[plaza]]s and [[shopping mall]] courts, and [[school]]s.

It is too simplistic to try to increase [[energy saving]]s by increasing the size of windows. Daylight [[over-illumination]] may cause [[Glare (vision)|glare]] for occupants, causing them to deploy [[blinds]] or other window shading devices, and compromising the daylight harvesting system. Even partially deployed [[venetian blind]]s can cut energy savings in half.

Impressive energy savings estimates may not be realized in practice due to poor system design, calibration, or [[Building commissioning|commissioning]].  Systems that dim or switch electric lighting in a distracting manner, or that produce overall light levels that are perceived as too low, can be sabotaged by occupants.

(For example, simply taping over a sensor will create constant electric lighting at maximum output.)

The adoption of daylight harvesting technologies has been hampered by high costs and imperfect performance of the technologies. However, studies have shown that by using daylight harvesting technologies, owners can see an average annual energy savings of 24%.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, R.P., R. Raghavan, O. Howlett, and C. Eaton. 2005 The Potential of Simplified Concepts for Daylight Harvesting. Lighting Research and Technology 37 (1): 21-40. Online at: http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/daylighting/rp_simplifiedconcepts.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

One method of predicting energy savings it to use commercially available software programs, such as TRACE 700 or (freeware) DOE-2, which considers thermal loads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe2.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payback, and drivers for adoption==
There is an incremental cost to daylight harvesting systems.  Dividing this cost by the annual energy savings provides a "simple payback", the number of years for the system to pay for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTEGRATED DAYLIGHTING  SYSTEMS|url=http://gsa.gov/portal/mediaId/193599/fileName/Integrated_Daylighting_Findings-508.action|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shorter the calculated [[payback period]], the more likely it is that a building owner will invest in the system.  Costs vary for a whole host of local factors, but generally if energy costs rise, or the cost of the control hardware and installation falls, the payback period will be reduced.

==Sustainability==
The [[green building]]-sustainable building movement encourages [[sustainable architecture]] design and building practices.  Various green building [[ecolabel]] [[certification marks]] exist around the world, such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]], [[Building Owners and Managers Association|BOMA]] Best, [[BREEAM]], HKBeam, and [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]].  All of these programs offer points for various building design features that promote [[sustainability]], and certification at various levels is awarded for reaching a given number of points.  One of the principal ways to gain points is through [[energy saving]] measures.

Thus green building practices are increasing the production of daylight harvesting components, leading to lower prices.
&lt;br /&gt;
Many electric utilities provide financial incentives for their customers to save energy. One such incentive is rebates on daylight harvesting systems

, which also reduces payback periods.

In addition, energy codes and standards are beginning to address daylight harvesting. For example, the [[California Energy Code]] Title 24-2008 recognizes primary and secondary daylight zones. At least 50% of the general lighting in primary zones must be controlled separately from other lighting, with automatic control required for larger zones. The code encourages automatic daylight harvesting in secondary zones by awarding power adjustment factor credits that can be applied to the lighting design.&lt;ref name=title24&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2008standards/|title=California's Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) recognizes daylight zones around vertical fenestration and skylights, and requires that the lighting in these zones be controlled separately from the general lighting in the space.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The 2010 [[ASHRAE 90.1]] energy standard, expected to be published in the fall 2010, is also expected to address daylight harvesting. Meanwhile, ASHRAE 189.1, the first of a generation of sustainable construction codes, defines daylight zones and requires daylight harvesting control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[File:Depreciation car.svg|thumb|380px|An asset depreciation at 15% per year over 20 years]]

In [[accountancy]], '''depreciation''' refers to two aspects of the same concept:&lt;ref&gt;Raymond H. Peterson, "Accounting for Fixed Assets", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* The decrease in value of [[assets]] ([[fair value]] depreciation)
* The allocation of the cost of assets to periods in which the assets are used (depreciation with the [[matching principle]])

Depreciation is a method of reallocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life span of it being in motion. Businesses depreciate long-term assets for both accounting and tax purposes.
The former affects the balance sheet of a business or entity, and the latter affects the net income that they report. Generally the cost is allocated, as depreciation [[expense]], among the periods in which the asset is expected to be used. Methods of computing depreciation, and the periods over which assets are depreciated, may vary between asset types within the same business and may vary for tax purposes. These may be specified by law or accounting standards, which may vary by country. There are several standard methods of computing depreciation expense, including fixed percentage, straight line, and declining balance methods. Depreciation expense generally begins when the asset is placed in service. For example, a depreciation expense of 100 per year for five years may be recognized for an asset costing 500.
Depreciation has been defined as the diminution in the utility or value of an asset. Depreciation is a non cash expense. It does not result in any cash outflow. Causes of depreciation are natural wear and tear.

==Accounting concept==
In determining the profits (net income) from an activity, the receipts from the activity must be reduced by appropriate costs. One such cost is the cost of assets used but not immediately consumed in the activity.&lt;ref&gt;Costs of assets consumed in producing goods are treated as [[cost of goods sold]]. Other costs of assets consumed in providing services or conducting business are an [[expense]] reducing income in the period of consumption under the [[matching principle]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Such cost so allocated in a given period is equal to the reduction in the value placed on the asset, which is initially equal to the amount paid for the asset and subsequently may or may not be related to the amount expected to be received upon its disposal.  Depreciation is any method of allocating such net cost to those periods in which the organization is expected to benefit from use of the asset. The asset is referred to as a depreciable asset. Depreciation is technically a method of allocation, not valuation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asc.fasb.org/section&amp;trid=2155842%26analyticsAssetName=subtopic_page_subsection%26nav_type=subtopic_page#d3e1173-110223 ASC 360-10-35-4].&lt;/ref&gt; even though it determines the value placed on the asset in the balance sheet.

Any business or income producing activity&lt;ref&gt;Under most systems, a business or income producing activity may be conducted by individuals or companies.&lt;/ref&gt; using tangible assets may incur costs related to those assets. If an asset is expected to produce a benefit in future periods, some of these costs must be deferred rather than treated as a current expense. The business then records depreciation expense in its financial reporting as the current period's allocation of such costs. This is usually done in a rational and systematic manner. Generally this involves four criteria:
*Cost of the asset
*Expected [[salvage value]], also known as residual value of the assets
*Estimated useful life of the asset
*A method of apportioning the cost over such life&lt;ref&gt;Kiesco, et al, p. 521.  See also Walther, Larry, [http://www.principlesofaccounting.com/chapter%2010.htm Principles of Accounting Chapter 10].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depreciable basis===
Cost generally is the amount paid for the asset, including all costs related to acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;An allocation of costs may be required where multiple assets are acquired in a single transaction.  [[Purchase price allocation]] may be required where assets are acquired as part of a business acquisition or combination.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries or for some purposes, [[salvage value]] may be ignored.  The rules of some countries specify lives and methods to be used for particular types of assets.  However, in most countries the life is based on business experience, and the method may be chosen from one of several acceptable methods.

===Impairment===
Accounting rules also require that an [[impairment charge]] or expense be recognized if the value of assets declines unexpectedly.&lt;ref&gt;A charge for such impairment is referred to in Germany as depreciation.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such charges are usually nonrecurring, and may relate to any type of asset.
Many companies consider write-offs of some of their long-lived assets because some property, plant, and equipment have suffered partial obsolescence. Accountants reduce the asset's carrying amount by its fair value. For example, if a company continues to incur losses because prices of a particular product or service are higher than the operating costs, companies consider write-offs of the particular asset. These write-offs are referred to as impairments. There are events and changes in circumstances might lead to impairment. Some examples are:
* Large amount of decrease in fair value of an asset
* A change of manner in which the asset is used 
* Accumulation of costs that are not originally expected to acquire or construct an asset 
* A projection of incurring losses associated with the particular asset 
Events or changes in circumstances indicate that the company may not be able recover the carrying amount of the asset. In which case, companies use the recoverability test to determine whether impairment has occurred. The steps to determine are:
1. Estimate the future cash flow of asset (from the use of the asset to disposition)
2. If the sum of the expected cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is considered impaired

===Depletion and amortization===
[[Depletion (accounting)|Depletion]] and [[amortization]] are similar concepts for minerals (including oil) and intangible assets, respectively.

===Effect on cash===
Depreciation expense does not require current outlay of cash.  However, since depreciation is an expense to the [[Income statement|P&amp;L account]], provided the enterprise is operating in a manner that covers its expenses (e.g. operating at a profit) depreciation is a source of cash in a statement of cash flows, which generally offsets the cash cost of acquiring new assets required to continue operations when existing assets reach the end of their useful lives.

===Accumulated depreciation=== &lt;!---This section linked from Wiktionary ---&gt;
While depreciation expense is recorded on the income statement of a business, its impact is generally recorded in a separate account and disclosed on the balance sheet as accumulated depreciation, under fixed assets, according to most accounting principles. Accumulated depreciation is known as a [[contra account]], because it separately shows a negative amount that is directly associated with another account.

Without an accumulated depreciation account on the balance sheet, depreciation expense is usually charged against the relevant asset directly. The values of the fixed assets stated on the balance sheet will decline, even if the business has not invested in or disposed of any assets. The amounts will roughly approximate fair value. Otherwise, depreciation expense is charged against accumulated depreciation. Showing accumulated depreciation separately on the balance sheet has the effect of preserving the historical cost of assets on the balance sheet. If there have been no investments or dispositions in fixed assets for the year, then the values of the assets will be the same on the balance sheet for the current and prior year (P/Y).

==Methods for depreciation== &lt;!---This section linked from article Earnings Quality---&gt;
There are several methods for calculating depreciation, generally based on either the passage of time or the level of activity (or use) of the asset.

===Straight-line depreciation===
Straight-line depreciation is the simplest and most often used method. In this method, the company estimates the [[residual value]] (also known as salvage value or scrap value) of the asset at the end of the period during which it will be used to generate revenues (useful life). (The salvage value may be zero, or even negative due to costs required to retire it; however, for depreciation purposes salvage value is not generally calculated at below zero.) The company will then charge the same amount to depreciation each year over that period, until the value shown for the asset has reduced from the original cost to the salvage value.

'''Straight-line method:'''
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{annual depreciation expense} = {\mbox{cost of fixed asset} - \mbox{residual value} \over \mbox{useful life of asset} (years)}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a vehicle that depreciates over 5 years is purchased at a cost of $17,000, and will have a salvage value of $2000. Then this vehicle will depreciate at $3,000 per year, i.e. (17-2)/5 = 3.
This table illustrates the straight-line method of depreciation. Book value at the beginning of the first year of depreciation is the original cost of the asset. At any time book value equals original cost minus accumulated depreciation.

'''book value = original cost − accumulated depreciation'''
Book value at the end of year becomes book value at the beginning of next year. The asset is depreciated until the book value equals scrap value.

|}

If the vehicle were to be sold and the sales price exceeded the depreciated value (net book value) then the excess would be considered a gain and subject to [[depreciation recapture]]. In addition, this gain above the depreciated value would be recognized as ordinary income by the tax office. If the sales price is ever less than the book value, the resulting capital loss is tax deductible.  If the sale price were ever more than the original book value, then the gain above the original book value is recognized as a capital gain.

If a company chooses to depreciate an asset at a different rate from that used by the tax office then this generates a timing difference in the income statement due to the difference (at a point in time) between the taxation department's and company's view of the profit.

In the UK used car pricing expert CAP regularly examine their data to find vehicles that devalue at a slower rate than others. They discuss the distinction and differences between percentage depreciate figures and real world cash depreciation to help motorists to reduce their long term costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cap.co.uk/car-valuation|title=CAP Car Valuation|last=|first=|date=|website=CAP|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When buying a new vehicle it is important to consider if you are likely to change the car in the next three years (when most cars lose between 50% and 60% of their value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatcar.com/advice/buying/depreciation-what-is-it-and-how-do-i-avoid-it/|title=How to avoid depreciation|last=|first=|date=|website=WhatCar|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the expected future value (also known as [[residual value]]). For example: "If you buy a car for £8,000 which 5 years later is only worth £2,000 you are actually going to have less value than if you had purchased a vehicle for £10,000 that 5 years later is worth £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.creditplus.co.uk/car-finance-glossary/d/depreciation/|title=Depreciation explained|last=|first=|date=|website=Creditplus|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double declining balance method ===

|}

When using the double-declining-balance method, the salvage value is not considered in determining the annual depreciation, but the book value of the asset being depreciated is never brought below its salvage value, regardless of the method used. Depreciation ceases when either the salvage value or the end of the asset's useful life is reached.

Since double-declining-balance depreciation does not always depreciate an asset fully by its end of life, some methods also compute a straight-line depreciation each year, and apply the greater of the two. This has the effect of converting from declining-balance depreciation to straight-line depreciation at a midpoint in the asset's life.

With the declining balance method, one can find the depreciation rate that would allow exactly for full depreciation by the end of the period, using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{depreciation rate} = 1 - \sqrt[N]{\mbox{residual value} \over \mbox{cost of fixed asset}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where N is the estimated life of the asset (for example, in years).

=== Annuity depreciation ===
Annuity depreciation methods are not based on time, but on a level of Annuity. This could be miles driven for a vehicle, or a cycle count for a machine. When the asset is acquired, its life is estimated in terms of this level of activity. Assume the vehicle above is estimated to go 50,000 miles in its lifetime. The per-mile depreciation rate is calculated as: ($17,000 cost - $2,000 salvage) / 50,000 miles = $0.30 per mile. Each year, the depreciation expense is then calculated by multiplying the number of miles driven by the per-mile depreciation rate..

=== Sum-of-years-digits method ===

Sum-of-years-digits is a shent depreciation method that results in a more accelerated write-off than the straight line method, and typically also more accelerated than the declining balance method. Under this method the annual depreciation is determined by multiplying the depreciable cost by a schedule of fractions.

Sum of the years' digits method of depreciation is one of the accelerated depreciation techniques which are based on the assumption that assets are generally more productive when they are new and their productivity decreases as they become old. The formula to calculate depreciation under SYD method is:

SYD depreciation = depreciable base x (remaining useful life/sum of the years' digits)
&lt;br&gt;
depreciable base = cost − salvage value

Example: If an asset has original cost of $1000, a useful life of 5 years and a salvage value of $100, compute its depreciation schedule.

First, determine years' digits. Since the asset has useful life of 5 years, the years' digits are: 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

Next, calculate the sum of the digits: 5+4+3+2+1=15

The sum of the digits can also be determined by using the formula (n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+n)/2 where n is equal to the useful life of the asset in years. The example would be shown as (5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+5)/2=15

Depreciation rates are as follows:

5/15 for the 1st year,
4/15 for the 2nd year,
3/15 for the 3rd year,
2/15 for the 4th year, and
1/15 for the 5th year.

|}

=== Units-of-production depreciation method ===

Under the units-of-production method, useful life of the asset is expressed in terms of the total number of units expected to be produced:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{annual depreciation expense} = {\mbox{cost of fixed asset} - \mbox{residual value} \over \mbox{estimated total production}} \times \mbox{actual production}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose, an asset has '''original cost $70,000''', '''salvage value $10,000''', and is expected to produce '''6,000 units'''.

'''Depreciation per unit = ($70,000−10,000) / 6,000 = $10'''

10 × actual production will give the depreciation cost of the current year.

The table below illustrates the '''units-of-production''' depreciation schedule of the asset.

Depreciation stops when book value is equal to the scrap value of the asset. In the end, the sum of accumulated depreciation and scrap value equals the original cost.

=== Units of time depreciation ===
Units of time depreciation is similar to units of production, and is used for depreciation equipment used in mining or natural resource exploration, or cases where the amount the asset is used is not linear year to year.

A simple example can be given for construction companies, where some equipment is used only for some specific purpose. Depending on the number of projects, the equipment will be used and depreciation charged accordingly.

=== Group depreciation method ===
The group depreciation method is used for depreciating multiple-asset accounts using a similar depreciation method.  The assets must be similar in nature and have approximately the same useful lives.

=== Composite depreciation method ===
The composite method is applied to a collection of assets that are not similar, and have different service lives. For example, computers and printers are not similar, but both are part of the office equipment. Depreciation on all assets is determined by using the straight-line-depreciation method.

'''Composite life''' equals the total depreciable cost divided by the total depreciation per year.
$5,900 / $1,300 = 4.5 years.

'''Composite depreciation rate''' equals depreciation per year divided by total historical cost.
$1,300 / $6,500 = 0.20 = 20%

'''Depreciation expense''' equals the composite depreciation rate times the balance in the asset account (historical cost). (0.20 * $6,500) $1,300.
Debit depreciation expense and credit accumulated depreciation.

When an asset is sold, debit cash for the amount received and credit the asset account for its original cost. Debit the difference between the two to accumulated depreciation. Under the composite method no gain or loss is recognized on the sale of an asset. Theoretically, this makes sense because the gains and losses from assets sold before and after the composite life will average themselves out.

To calculate composite depreciation rate, divide depreciation per year by total historical cost.
To calculate depreciation expense, multiply the result by the same total historical cost. The result, not surprisingly, will equal to the total depreciation per year again.

Common sense requires depreciation expense to be equal to total depreciation per year, without first dividing and then multiplying total depreciation per year by the same number.

==Tax depreciation==
Most income tax systems allow a [[tax deduction]] for recovery of the cost of assets used in a business or for the production of income.  Such deductions are allowed for individuals and companies.  Where the assets are consumed currently, the cost may be deducted currently as an [[expense]] or treated as part of [[cost of goods sold]].  The cost of assets not currently consumed generally must be deferred and recovered over time, such as through depreciation.  Some systems permit full deduction of the cost, at least in part, in the year the assets are acquired.  Other systems allow depreciation expense over some life using some depreciation method or percentage.  Rules vary highly by country, and may vary within a country based on type of asset or type of taxpayer.  Many systems that specify depreciation lives and methods for financial reporting require the same lives and methods be used for tax purposes.  Most tax systems provide different rules for real property (buildings, etc.) and personal property (equipment, etc.).

===Capital allowances===
A common system is to allow a fixed percentage of the cost of depreciable assets to be deducted each year.  This is often referred to as a [[capital allowance]], as it is called in the [[United Kingdom]].  Deductions are permitted to individuals and businesses based on assets placed in service during or before the assessment year.  [[Canada]]'s [[Capital Cost Allowance]] are fixed percentages of assets within a class or type of asset.  Fixed percentage rates are specified by type of asset.  The fixed percentage is multiplied by the tax basis of assets in service to determine the capital allowance deduction.  The tax law or regulations of the country specifies these percentages.  Capital allowance calculations may be based on the total set of assets, on sets or pools by year (vintage pools) or pools by classes of assets...
Depreciation has got three methods only.

===Tax lives and methods===
Some systems specify lives based on classes of property defined by the tax authority.  Canada Revenue Agency specifies numerous [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/slprtnr/rprtng/cptl/dprcbl-eng.html classes] based on the type of property and how it is used.  Under the [[MACRS|United States depreciation system]], the [[Internal Revenue Service]] publishes a [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf detailed guide] which includes a table of asset lives and the [[applicable convention]]s.  The table also incorporates specified lives for certain commonly used assets (e.g., office furniture, computers, automobiles) which override the business use lives.  U.S. tax depreciation is computed under the double declining balance method switching to straight line or the straight line method, at the option of the taxpayer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168(c)].&lt;/ref&gt;  IRS tables specify percentages to apply to the basis of an asset for each year in which it is in service.  Depreciation first becomes deductible when an asset is placed in service.

===Additional depreciation===
Many systems allow an additional deduction for a portion of the cost of depreciable assets acquired in the current tax year.  The UK system provides a first year capital allowance of £50,000.  In the United States, two such deductions are available.  A [https://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=177054,00.html deduction] for the full cost of depreciable tangible personal property is allowed up to $500,000 through 2013.  This deduction is fully phased out for businesses acquiring over $2,000,000 of such property during the year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/179- 26 USC 179]. Amounts extended by [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, additional first year depreciation of 50% of the cost of most other depreciable tangible personal property is allowed as a deduction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168(k)].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other systems have similar first year or accelerated allowances.

===Real property===
Many tax systems prescribe longer depreciable lives for buildings and land improvements.  Such lives may vary by type of use.  Many such systems, including the United States and Canada, permit depreciation for real property using only the straight line method, or a small fixed percentage of cost.  Generally, no depreciation tax deduction is allowed for bare land.  In the United States, residential rental buildings are depreciable over a 27.5 year or 40 year life, other buildings over a 39 or 40 year life, and land improvements over a 15 or 20 year life, all using the straight line method.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168](c) and (e).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Averaging conventions===
Depreciation calculations require a lot of record-keeping if done for each asset a business owns, especially if assets are added to after they are acquired, or partially disposed of. However, many tax systems permit all assets of a similar type acquired in the same year to be combined in a "pool".  Depreciation is then computed for all assets in the pool as a single calculation. These calculations must make assumptions about the date of acquisition. The United States system allows a taxpayer to use a half year convention for personal property or mid-month convention for real property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168(d)].&lt;/ref&gt; Under such a convention, all property of a particular type is considered to have been acquired at the midpoint of the acquisition period. One half of a full period's depreciation is allowed in the acquisition period (and also in the final depreciation period if the life of the assets is a whole number of years). United States rules require a mid-quarter convention for per  property if more than 40% of the acquisitions for the year are in the final quarter.

A '''démarche''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɑr|ʃ}}; from the French word whose literal meaning is "step"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/demarche/ 'Démarche'] in Dictionnaire.com (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; or "solicitation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/fren/demarche|title=demarche - traduction - Dictionnaire Français-Anglais WordReference.com|website=www.wordreference.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has come to refer either to
# a line of action; move; countermove; maneuver, especially in diplomatic relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/d-emarche | title=démarche definition | accessdate=2010-01-15 | publisher=YourDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demarche | title=démarche | accessdate=2010-01-15 | publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
# formal [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] representation ([[diplomatic correspondence]]) of the official position, views, or wishes on a given subject from one [[government]] to another government or [[intergovernmental organization]].

Diplomatic démarches are delivered to the appropriate official of the government or organization. Démarches generally seek to persuade, inform, or gather information from a foreign government. Governments may also use a démarche to [[protest]] or object to actions by a foreign government. Informally, the word is sometimes used as a [[verb]] to describe making or receiving such correspondence.

==Démarches by the United States==
The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] defines démarche as "a request or intercession with a foreign official, e.g., a request for support of a policy, or a protest about the host government's policy or actions".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/176174.pdf "Protocol for the modern diplomat"], Foreign Service Institute, U.S. Dept. of State&lt;/ref&gt; The US government issues démarches to foreign governments through "front-channel [[Telegraphy|cable]]" instructions from the [[United States Department of State]].

Any Department of State officer or other official under the authority of the [[Diplomatic mission|chief of mission]] can make a démarche. Unless the Department provides specific instructions as to rank (for example: "the Ambassador should call on the Foreign Minister"), the post has discretion to determine who should make the presentation and which official(s) in the host government should receive it.

===Preparation of the démarche===
Démarche instruction cables from the Department should include the following elements:

# '''Objective:''' The objective is a clear statement of the purpose of the démarche, and of what the U.S. Government hopes to achieve.
# '''Arguments:''' This section outlines how the Department proposes to make an effective case for its views. It should include a rationale for the U.S. Government’s position, supporting arguments, likely [[counter-argument]]s, and suggested [[rebuttal]]s.
# '''Background:''' The background should spell out pitfalls; particular sensitivities of other bureaus, departments, or agencies; and any other special considerations.
# '''Suggested talking points:''' Suggested talking points should be clear, conversational, and logically organized. Unless there are compelling reasons to require [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] delivery, the démarche instruction cable should make it clear that post may use its discretion and local knowledge to structure and deliver the message in the most effective way. ("Embassy may draw from the following points in making this presentation to appropriate host government officials.")
# '''Written material:''' This section is used to provide instructions on any written material to be left with the host government official(s). Such material could take the form of an [[aide-mémoire]], a letter, or a "non-paper" that provides a written version of the verbal presentation (i.e., the talking points as delivered). Unless otherwise instructed, post should normally provide an aide-memoire or non-paper at the conclusion of a démarche. Any classified aide-memoire or non-paper must be appropriately marked and [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]ed as to the countries authorized for receipt, e.g. "Rel. UK" indicates "Releasable to the [[United Kingdom]]")

===Delivery and follow-up action===
Upon receipt of démarche instructions from the Department, posts should make every effort to deliver the démarche to the appropriate foreign government official(s) as soon as possible.

After delivering the démarche, the post should report to the Department via front-channel cable. The reporting cable should include the instruction cable as a reference, but it need not repeat the talking points transmitted in that cable. It should provide the name and title of the person(s) to whom the démarche was made, and record that official’s response to the presentation. As appropriate, the reporting cable should also describe any specific follow-up action needed by post, Department, or the foreign government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4999">The '''Eady Levy''' was a tax on [[box office]] receipts in the United Kingdom, intended to support the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film industry]] and named after [[Wilfred Griffin Eady|Sir Wilfred Eady]]. It was established in 1957 and terminated in 1985.

== Background ==
A [[Tax|levy]] was first proposed by [[Harold Wilson]], then president of the [[Board of Trade]], in 1949. The levy was intended to assist producers of [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film]]. A direct governmental payment to British-based producers would have qualified as a [[subsidy]] under the terms of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], and would have led to objections from [[Cinema of the United States|American film]] producers. An indirect levy did not qualify as a subsidy, and so was a suitable way of providing additional funding for the UK film industry whilst avoiding criticism from abroad.

== Establishment ==
The Eady Levy came into effect on 9 September 1950 but was not established on a statutory basis until its incorporation in the [[Cinematograph Films Act 1957]]. It had the effect of both assisting the film industry, and reducing the effect of [[entertainment tax]] on film exhibition, to which all the cinema industry was opposed.

In the Eady Levy, a proportion of the ticket price was to be pooled&amp;nbsp;– half to be retained by exhibitors (i.e. effectively a [[tax rebate|rebate]] on the tax) and half to be divided among qualifying [[List of British films|'British' films]] in proportion to UK box office revenue, with no obligation to invest in further production. The [[Finance Act 1950]] had previously made the necessary changes in the entertainments tax. The levy was collected by [[HM Customs and Excise]] and administered by the [[British Film Fund Agency]].

The rise in British cinema (including the [[James Bond]] movies) during the 1960s caused by an influx of American producers can be attributed to the Eady Levy – and also to the cheaper production facilities&amp;nbsp;– making it cost far less in the UK to achieve the same quality of production. A number of American film makers worked in Britain in this period on a near-permanent basis, including [[Sidney Lumet]], [[Stanley Donen]], and [[John Huston]].  [[Stanley Kubrick]] moved to Britain in the early sixties to make ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'', ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' amongst others. Another expatriate American, Richard Lester, directed [[The Beatles]]' films ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]''.

To qualify as a British film a minimum of 85% of the film had to be shot in the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth, and only three non-British individual salaries could be excluded from the costs of the film, ensuring the employment of British actors, technicians and film crew.&lt;ref&gt;p.202 Mirisch, Walter  ''I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History'' Univ of Wisconsin Press, 27/02/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not only American film makers who came; a number of distinguished European directors also made films in Britain. These included [[Roman Polanski]], [[François Truffaut]] (who made ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' at [[Pinewood Studios]] and on location in London and Berkshire) and [[Jean-Luc Godard]].

The Eady Levy also provided funding for the [[National Film and Television School]], which trained a number of directors and actors still in work today.

== Termination ==
The Eady Levy was a tax on box office receipts, and was intended to support UK film production. However, in a [[White Paper]] in 1984, the [[British Government]] recognised that the levy was no longer fulfilling its original purpose, with much of the payment going directly to distributors rather than producers, and proving an unreasonable burden on the exhibition sector. 1984 had seen the lowest cinema attendances in the UK of any year in recorded history - with only 54 million tickets sold &lt;ref&gt;https://www.launchingfilms.com/research-databank/uk-cinema-admissions&lt;/ref&gt;, fewer than one ticket per head of population - thanks largely to competition from TV and home video, so the tax had a significant effect on the cinema chains' dwindling profits. The Eady Levy was terminated in 1985.

[[Image:Eas new.svg|thumb|Current logo]]
The '''Emergency Alert System''' ('''EAS''') is a national warning system in the United States put into place on January 1, 1997 (approved by [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in November 1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oldradio.com/current/bc_conel.htm | title = What is Conelrad? EBS? EAS?}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it replaced the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] (EBS), which in turn replaced the [[CONELRAD]] System. The official EAS is designed to enable the President of the United States to speak to the United States within 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23240430 | work=BBC News | title=Emergency broadcasts can be hacked, US researchers say | date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this requirement, the EAS is also designed to alert the public of local weather emergencies such as [[tornado]]es and [[flash flood]]s (and in some cases [[severe thunderstorm]]s depending on the severity of the storm). The most recent National EAS Test was performed on November 8, 2018 at 12:30 pm EDT (9:30 am PDT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Nationwide Emergency Alert Test Planned for Oct. 3; Test Messages Will be Sent to Cell Phones, TV and Radio |url=https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2018/10/02/nationwide-emergency-alert-test-planned-oct-3-test-messages-will-be-sent|location=Washington, D.C. |agency=FEMA |date=October 2, 2018 |accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This test was the second national test of the [[Integrated Public Alert and Warning System]] (IPAWS) and [[Wireless Emergency Alerts]] (WEA) systems. This test took place two minutes prior to the main test, at 2:18 pm EDT (11:18 am PDT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/emergency-alert-test|title=The IPAWS National Test|last=|first=|date=|website=FEMA|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next test date has not been scheduled.

The EAS is jointly coordinated by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). The EAS regulations and standards are governed by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau of the FCC.

Authorized organizations are able to disseminate and coordinate emergency alerts and warning messages through EAS and other public systems by means of IPAWS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system |title=Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 18, 2018 |website=fema.gov |publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency |access-date=September 22, 2018 |quote=IPAWS provides public safety officials with an effective way to alert and warn the public about serious emergencies using the Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems from a single interface.}}&lt;/ref&gt; EAS messages are transmitted primarily via terrestrial and satellite [[radio]] and television (including [[Terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[multichannel television]]), which are required to participate in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Federal Register 76220 |volume= 71 |number=244 |date= December 20, 2006 |work= Federal Communications Commission |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2006-12-20/pdf/E6-21770.pdf#page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wireless Emergency Alerts are a secondary system using [[Cell Broadcast]] to relay public alerts to cellphones.

==Technical concept==
{{Main article|Specific Area Message Encoding}}
Messages in the EAS are composed of four parts: a digitally encoded [[Specific Area Message Encoding|SAME]] [[header (computing)|header]], an attention signal, an audio announcement, and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker.

[[Image:Sage EAS Endec.jpg|right|thumb|A Sage EAS ENDEC unit.]]
The {{Audio|Same.wav|SAME header}} is the most critical part of the EAS design. It contains information about who originated the alert (the President, state or local authorities, the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), or the broadcaster), a short, general description of the event (tornado, flood, severe thunderstorm), the areas affected (up to 32 counties or states), the expected duration of the event (in minutes), the date and time it was issued (in [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]]), and an identification of the originating station (see [[Specific Area Message Encoding|SAME]] for a complete breakdown of the header).

77 radio stations are designated as National Primary Stations in the Primary Entry Point (PEP) System to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems.&lt;ref name="The National Public Warning System"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fema.gov/national-public-warning-system |title=The National Public Warning System |work=FEMA.gov |date=May 12, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emergency Action Notification is the notice to broadcasters that the President of the United States or his/her designee will deliver a message over the EAS via the PEP system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Emergency Alert System 2001 AM &amp; FM Handbook | booktitle=Emergency Alert System 2001 AM &amp; FM Handbook | pages=4 | publisher=United States Federal Communications Commission | year=2001 | location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations===
PEP stations are private or commercial radio broadcast stations that cooperatively participate with FEMA to provide emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during, and after incidents and disasters. The FEMA PEP stations also serve as the primary source of initial broadcast for a Presidential Emergency Action Notification (EAN). PEP stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) Program Management Office (PMO) is expanding the number of participating broadcast stations across the nation to directly cover over 90 percent of the U.S. population. PEP station expansion will help ensure that under all conditions the President of the United States can alert and warn the public.

In September 2009, FEMA contracted with the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) to equip selected radio stations to become FEMA Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations. The project with USACE is actively bringing new stations into the FEMA PEP program. High level tasks for activating a new PEP station include: initial site assessments, environmental assessments, design specifications, construction of special facilities, and coordinating memorandums of agreement with the stations and activity coordination with the State, territorial, tribal, and local jurisdictions and the FEMA regional offices.

PEP stations provide resilience for alerts and warnings to the public. The IPAWS Program Management Office (PMO) is modernizing existing PEP stations with next generation alert and warning equipment to include Common Alert Protocol (CAP) compliance equipment, and Internet Protocol enabled equipment.

Satellite communications infrastructure can be fully integrated with the legacy Emergency Alert System (EAS) and provides a reliable, redundant commercial system utilizing multiple uplinks and satellites for national level EAS distribution. The IPAWS PMO continues to complete the integration of satellite data transmission paths as a diverse path for EAS message delivery from FEMA to PEP stations. An XM Radio transmission path was completed in the first quarter of 2010, and direct satellite connectivity became available to the national PEP stations in the third quarter of 2010.

The IPAWS EAS Modernization and PEP Expansion project includes and maintains 77 operational PEP stations throughout the United States and its territories. Direct coverage of the nation's population will expand from approximately 67 percent in 2009 to over 90 percent when all 77 PEP stations become operational in 2015.&lt;ref name="The National Public Warning System"/&gt;

===Communication links===
The FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) "Provides Primary Entry Point service to the Emergency Alert System", and acts as an emergency presidential link into the EAS. The FNARS net control station is located at the [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/phin/conference/04conference/05-27-04/Session_12D_Ross_Merlin.pdf | format=PDF | title=Communications Systems for Public Health Contingencies | last=Merlin | first=Ross Z. | year=2004 | publisher=DHS/FEMA Wireless Program Management Team | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625023050/http://www.cdc.gov/phin/conference/04conference/05-27-04/Session_12D_Ross_Merlin.pdf | archivedate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an EAN is received by an EAS participant from a PEP station (or any other participant) the message then "daisy chains'" through the network of participants. "Daisy chains" form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations. This process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system.

Each EAS participant is required to monitor at least two other participants.

===EAS header===
Because the header lacks error detection codes, it is repeated 3 times for redundancy. However, the repetition of the data can itself be considered an error detection and correction code – like any error detection or correction code, it adds redundant information to the signal in order to make errors identifiable. EAS decoders compare the received headers against one another, looking for an exact match between any two, eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail. The decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station (following parameters set by the broadcaster).

The SAME header bursts are followed by an attention tone, which lasts between 8 and 25 seconds, depending on the originating station. The tone is {{Audio|1050Hz Tone.ogg|1050 Hz}} on a [[NOAA Weather Radio]] (NOAA/NWS) station. On commercial broadcast stations, a {{Audio|Emergency Alert System Attention Signal 20s.ogg|"two-tone"}} attention signal of 853&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz (frequency)|Hz]] and 960&amp;nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]s is used instead, the same signal used by the older [[Emergency Broadcast System]]. These tones have become infamous, and can be considered both frightening and annoying by viewers; in fact, the two tones, which form approximately the interval of a just [[major second]] at an unusually high pitch, were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention, due to their unpleasantness on the [[human ear]]. The SAME header is equally known for its shrillness, which many have found to be startling. The "two-tone" system is no longer required as of 1998, and is to be used only for audio alerts before EAS messages.&lt;ref name="cfr47"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2013-title47-vol1/pdf/CFR-2013-title47-vol1-sec11-61.pdf | title=United States Code of Federal Regulations - 47 CFR 11.61 - Tests of EAS procedures | publisher=access.gpo.gov | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2011}} Like the EBS, the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert.

[[Image:GormanCAPconverter.jpg|300p|upright=1.5|right|thumb|A Gorman-Redlich [[rack mounted]] [[Common Alerting Protocol|CAP]]-to-EAS converter which translates CAP formatted alerts into EAS headers.]]
The message ends with 3 bursts of the [[Audio frequency-shift keying|AFSK]] "EOM", or [[End of Message]], which is the text &lt;tt&gt;NNNN&lt;/tt&gt;, preceded each time by the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 10101011 calibration.

The White House endorsed the integration of the [[Common Alerting Protocol]] (CAP) in a presidential initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/omb/egov/c-2-2-disaster.html | title=Disaster Management |work=The White House (George W.

==Station requirements==
The FCC requires all broadcast stations and [[multichannel video programming distributor]]s (MVPD) to install and maintain FCC-certified EAS decoders and encoders at their control points or [[Cable television headend|headends]]. These decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for EAS messages. For reliability, at least two source stations must be monitored, one of which must be a designated ''local primary''. Stations are to retain the latest version of the EAS handbook.

Stations are required by federal law to keep logs of all received messages. Logs may be kept by hand but are usually kept automatically by a small receipt printer in the encoder/decoder unit. Logs may also be kept electronically inside the unit as long as there is access to an external printer or method to transfer them to a [[personal computer]].

In addition to the audio messages transmitted by radio stations, "television broadcast stations shall transmit a visual message containing the Originator, Event, Location and the valid time period of an EAS message".&lt;ref&gt;47&amp;nbsp;C.F.R.&amp;nbsp;§&amp;nbsp;11.51(D)&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a text "crawl" or a static visual message. A text "crawl" is displayed at the top of the screen that contains all of the information encoded in the initial SAME header. A color-coded "crawl" system is often used where the color signifies the priority of the message. Some television stations transmit only a static ''slide'' containing the required information. A television station may be used for monitoring by another station and thus the audio is necessary.&lt;ref name="cfr47" /&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Stations are required by federal law to relay [[Emergency Action Notification]] (EAN) messages immediately (47 CFR Part 11.54).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=763e47002785e63b94a7710dcf78869a&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=47:1.0.1.1.12.4.231.4&amp;idno=47 |title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=National Archives |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529053544/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr |archivedate=May 29, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as [[severe weather]], and [[child abduction]] emergencies ([[AMBER Alert]]s) if they so choose.

==System tests==
{{Listen|filename=NOAA Weather Radio MKE-KEC60 Weekly Test.ogg|title=NOAA Weather Radio MKE-KEC60 Weekly Test||description=The weekly Emergency Alert System test, usually initiated at 12 noon local time every Wednesday afternoon, as heard on [[KEC60]] in [[Milwaukee]] on November 24, 2010.}}
All EAS equipment must be tested on a weekly basis. The required weekly test (RWT) consists, at a minimum, of the header and end-of-message tones. Though an RWT does not need an audio or graphic message announcing the test, many stations provide them as a courtesy to the public. In addition, television stations are not required to transmit a video message for weekly tests. RWTs are scheduled by the station on random days and times, (though quite often during late night or early afternoon hours), and are generally not relayed.&lt;ref name="cfr47" /&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Required Monthly Test of Emergency Alert System in New Jersey.jpg|thumb|A Required Monthly Test (RMT) transmitted in New Jersey on April 15, 2014 as shown on a television set.]]
Required monthly tests (RMTs) are generally originated by the local or state primary station, a state emergency management agency, or by the National Weather Service (NWS) and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels. RMTs must be performed between 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and local sunset during odd numbered months, and between local sunset and 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. during even numbered months. Received monthly tests must be retransmitted within 60 minutes of receipt.&lt;ref name="cfr47" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State EAS Plans and Chairs|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/services/eas/chairs.html|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an RMT should not be scheduled or conducted during an event of great importance such as a pre-announced Presidential speech, coverage of a national/local election, major local or national news coverage outside regularly scheduled newscast hours or a major national sporting event such as the [[Super Bowl]] or [[World Series]], with other events such as the [[Indianapolis 500]] and [[Olympic Games]] mentioned in individual EAS state plans.

An RWT is not required during a calendar week in which an RMT is scheduled. No testing has to be done during a calendar week in which all parts of the EAS (header burst, attention signal, audio message, and end of message burst) have been legitimately activated.

In July 2018, in response to the aftermath of the [[2018 Hawaii false missile alert|false missile alert in Hawaii]] earlier in the year (which was caused by operator error during an internal drill protocol), the FCC announced that it would take steps to promote public awareness and improve efficiency of the system, including requiring safeguards to prevent distribution of false alarms, the ability to authorize "live code" tests—which would simulate the process and response to an actual emergency, and authorizations to use the EAS tones in public service announcements that promote awareness of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17565810/fcc-emergency-alert-system-test-psa|title=The FCC is changing up the country’s emergency alert system to prevent another Hawaii incident|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-352524A1.pdf|title=FCC PROMOTES EMERGENCY ALERT RELIABILITY|last=|first=|date=July 12, 2018|website=|format=PDF|publisher=FCC|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National tests===
{{Listen|filename=National EAS Test.ogg|title=National EAS Test||description=Audio recording of the first national EAS test on November 9, 2011, as heard on [[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]] and the cable EAS of [[Charter Communications]]'s Wisconsin [[cable television headend|headend]].}}
On February 3, 2011, the FCC announced plans and procedures for national EAS tests, which involve all television and radio stations connected to the EAS, as well as all cable and satellite services in the United States. They are not relayed on the NOAA Weather Radio (NOAA/NWS) network as it is an initiation-only network and does not receive messages from the PEP network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2011/db0203/DOC-304451A1.pdf | format=PDF | title=FCC Press Release: "FCC Action Paves Way for First-Ever Presidential Alert to be Aired Across U.S. on Nation's Emergency Alert System" | date=February 3, 2011 | website=fcc.gov | publisher=FCC | deadurl=yes | archivedate=March 4, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304021444/http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2011/db0203/DOC-304451A1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2011/db0203/FCC-11-12A1.pdf | format=PDF | title=FCC Third Report and Order: In the Matter of Review of the Emergency Alert System | date=February 3, 2011 | website=fcc.gov | publisher=FCC | deadurl=yes | archivedate=February 10, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210092109/http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2011/db0203/FCC-11-12A1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national test would transmit and relay an EAS test message from the White House.

Starting in a report by the FCC in 2009 on the preparedness of the FCC for major public emergencies concerns were raised regarding "frequency and scope of EAS testing".&lt;ref&gt;FCC Preparedness for Major Public Emergencies Chairmen's 30 Day Review, [http://www.fcc.gov/document/chairmen-genachowskis-thirty-day-public-safety-review-fcc-prepardness-major-public-emergen]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} last accessed March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This led to two preliminary tests in the state of [[Alaska]]; one occurred during January 2010.&lt;ref name="radiomag" /&gt;

The second national EAS Test happened on September 28, 2016 at 2:20 pm EDT (11:20 am PDT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/nationwide-emergency-alert-system-test-planned-september-28 | title=Nationwide Emergency Alert System Test Planned for September 28

The purpose of these tests were to ensure results of the 2011 test (see below) would not occur again.

A third national EAS Test occurred on September 27, 2017 at 2:20 pm EDT (11:20 am PDT) until 2:50 pm EDT (11:50 am PDT) with the National Periodic Test (NPT) event code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10714429000802/FEMA%202017%20National%20Test%20LOI.pdf | title=Nationwide Emergency Alert System Test Planned for September 27

The fourth national EAS test occurred on October 3, 2018 (delayed from September 20, 2018 due to [[Hurricane Florence]]), beginning for the first time with a Wireless Emergency Alerts presidential test message at 2:18 p.m. EDT (11:18 a.m. PDT), followed immediately by all other platforms at 2:20 p.m. EDT (11:20 a.m. PDT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/mark-your-calendars-next-eas-test-date-affirmed/|title=Mark Your Calendars: Next EAS Test Date Affirmed|website=Radio &amp; Television Business Report|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/15/politics/fema-presidential-alert-trump-emergency-test/index.html|title='Presidential Alert': Trump text slides to October 3|last=Stracqualursi|first=Veronica|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Emergency-alert-test-going-out-to-mobile-phones-13277858.php|title=Emergency alert test sounds off on mobile phones nationwide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National test results====

=====Results of November 9, 2011 test=====
[[Image:EAStest.jpg|thumb|Screen announcing the nationwide test of the EAS, November 9, 2011, mainly generated by the EAS decoder at cable operator headends, listing that the test was generated within the [[District of Columbia]] rather than locally.]]

On November 9, 2011, after the national test was attempted,&lt;ref name=ClaytonGaga&gt;{{cite web | last=Clayton | first=Mark | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/1109/Did-the-national-Emergency-Alert-System-mistakenly-play-Lady-Gaga | title=Did the national Emergency Alert System mistakenly play Lady Gaga? | work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] | date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stations began calling in saying that some of their receivers were not able to relay the test or simply just did not get the test at all; [[DirecTV]] users reported even hearing [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]" throughout the test. This was due to DirecTV using an off-air channel to deliver the SAME header for the message, which was also playing "Paparazzi" at the time the header was broadcast.&lt;ref name="radiomag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radiomagonline.com/currents/news/alaska-eas-success-0106/ | title=Alaska EAS EAN Test: Success | work=[[Radio (magazine)|Radio]] | date=January 6, 2010 | access-date=November 11, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308202824/http://radiomagonline.com/currents/news/alaska-eas-success-0106/ | archive-date=March 8, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2013, the [[FCC]] released the results of the November 9, 2011 test.&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;

According to the FCC, 18% of stations failed to either receive or retransmit the alert.&lt;ref name=EasResults&gt;{{cite web | title=Strengthening the Emergency Alert System (EAS): Lessons Learned from the Nationwide EAS Test | url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2013/db0412/DOC-320152A1.pdf | format=PDF | author=Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau | page=15 | date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message, according to some, also lacked the alert code which would allow the President to speak. Due to a feedback loop in the PEP system, the test could be heard several times in the background, and the EOM (end of message) code was sent twice, violating EAS rules. The test was cut down to 30 seconds rather than the proposed three minutes.

Although there were several frequently reported issues, the FCC stated that the test demonstrated that the national EAS architecture is basically sound. Some of these problems included:

* Bad audio quality&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;
** A malfunction at the National Primary level inserted a second level of header tones into the audio portion of the message, which created a large-delay reverb effect and noisy background levels, which increased in intensity each time the EAN message was passed on. Since then, FEMA has reconfigured their equipment correctly.&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;
* Lack of a Primary Entry Point in some areas, leaving those areas without a direct connection to FEMA&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;
** At the time of the test, there was no established Primary Entry Point in [[Portland, Oregon]]. The Oregon EAS State Plan instructed all stations west of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] (including Portland) to monitor [[public radio]] station [[KOPB-FM]], which would receive the alert from the [[NPR]] Squawk Channel. The audio quality of the alert that KOPB-FM received via the NPR Squawk Channel was exceptionally poor, and most monitoring stations' equipment did not recognize the alert at all or only broadcast the first few seconds of the alert. The FCC has since expanded PEP coverage to West of the Cascades (including Portland).&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;
* Use of alternatives to PEP-based EAN distribution&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;
** The FCC found that some stations chose to use alternatives to the PEP-based daisy-chain mode of propagation, and that some of these alternatives may not be able to receive the EAN effectively in times of emergency. The FCC has advised these stations to request approval from the FCC for these alternative ways of receiving the EAN.
* Inability of some participants to receive/transmit the EAN&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;
** Some EAS Participants stated that, although they heard the EAN from their monitoring stations, they were not able to rebroadcast it to their audience. The FCC found that the cause of this was usually operator error, or that the Participant's equipment was programmed incorrectly.
* Short test length&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt;
** The FCC found that some EAS equipment manufacturers designed their equipment to not rebroadcast EANs shorter than 75 seconds due to a misinterpretation of the FCC regulations. Another EAS Participant suggested that the 30 second duration of the test was insufficient to allow its engineers to manually override its equipment when automatic equipment functions failed.
* The use of the Emergency Action Notification process (which had never been used before) and a Washington, D.C. location code was also believed to have caused confusion to viewers, as there was a lack of public awareness of how the national test would be delivered.&lt;ref name="fcc-16results"/&gt;

The first-ever Nationwide EAS Test was a success in that it demonstrated that the national EAS would generally perform as designed, if activated.&lt;ref name="EasResults" /&gt; At the same time, the test showed several areas that needed improvement.

=====Results of September 28, 2016 test=====
Results of this test were released by the FCC on April 21, 2017, remarking that it "demonstrated that the Internet-based distribution of alerts via [[Integrated Public Alert and Warning System| IPAWS]] has modernized the EAS and greatly improved the quality, effectiveness, and accessibility of EAS alerts". However, half of the participants did not use IPAWS to receive the message, some "failed to receive or retransmit alerts due to erroneous equipment configuration, equipment readiness and upkeep issues, and confusion regarding EAS rules and technical requirements", and that participation among low-power broadcasters was low. Rather than delivering it as an EAN, the 2016 test was delivered with a new designation, "National Periodic Test" (NPT), and an explicit location code designating the entire country. These changes reduced viewer confusion and technical problems, and made the test resemble other routine tests.&lt;ref name="fcc-16results"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/september-28-2016-nationwide-eas-test|title=September 28, 2016 Nationwide EAS Test|date=2017-04-21|work=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/alerts/the-2016-national-eas-test-will-be-different.html|title=The 2016 National EAS Test Will Be Different|website=Govtech|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additions and proposals==

The number of event types in the national system has grown to eighty. At first, all but three of the events (civil emergency message, immediate evacuation, and emergency action notification [national emergency]) were weather-related (such as a [[tornado warning]]). Since then, several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added, including, in most states, the [[AMBER Alert]] System for child abduction emergencies.  In 2016, three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events, including Extreme Wind Warning (EWW), Storm Surge Warning (SSW) and Storm Surge Watch (SSA).

In 2004, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) seeking comment on whether EAS in its present form is the most effective mechanism for warning the American public of an emergency and, if not, on how EAS can be improved, such as mandatory text messages to cellphones, regardless of subscription. As noted above, rules implemented by the FCC on July 12, 2007 provisionally endorse incorporating CAP with the SAME protocol.

==EAS for consumers==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
The EAS is designed to be useful for the entire public, not just those with SAME-capable equipment. However, several consumer-level radios do exist, especially [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]] [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], which are available to the public through both [[mail-order]] and [[retailer]]s. Other specialty receivers for AM/FM/ACSSB (LM) are available only through mail-order, or in some places from federal, state, or local [[government]]s, especially where there is a potential hazard nearby such as a chemical factory. These radios come pre-tuned to a station in each area that has agreed to provide this service to local emergency management officials and agencies, often with a direct link back to the plant's safety system or control room for instant activation should an evacuation or other emergency arise.

The ability to narrow messages down so that only the actual area in danger is alerted is extremely helpful in preventing false warnings, which was previously a major tune-out factor. Instead of sounding for all warnings within a station's area, SAME-decoder radios now sound only for the counties for which they are programmed. When the alarm sounds, anyone with the radio ''knows'' that the danger is nearby and protective action should be taken. For this reason, the goal of the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS) is that each home should have both a [[smoke detector]] and a SAME [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]].

==Limitations==
The EAS can only be used to relay audio messages that preempt all programming; as the intent of an Emergency Action Notification is to serve as a "last-ditch effort to get a message out if the President cannot get to the media", it can easily be made redundant by the near-immediate media coverage that major weather events and terrorist attacks—such as, most prominently, the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001—receive from television broadcasters and [[news channel]]s. Following the attacks, then-FCC chairman [[Michael K. Powell]] cited "the ubiquitous media environment" as justification for not using the EAS in their immediate aftermath. Glenn Collins of ''[[The New York Times]]'' acknowledged these limitations, noting that "no president has ever used the current [EAS] system or its technical predecessors in the last 50 years, despite the [[Cold War|Soviet missile crisis]], a [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|presidential assassination]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], major earthquakes and three recent high-alert terrorist warnings", and that using it would have actually hindered the availability of live coverage from media outlets.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/21/nyregion/silence-alert-system-experts-urge-overhaul-plan-unused-even-sept-11.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Emergency%20Alert%20System&amp;st=cse | title=The Silence of the Alert System; Experts Urge Overhaul of Plan Unused Even on Sept. 11 | last=Collins | first=Glenn | date=December 21, 2001 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rwonline"&gt;{{cite web | last=Stine | first=Randy J. | url=http://www.rwonline.com/reference-room/special-report/rw-eas2.shtml | title=Terrorism Attacks Cue EAS Debate | work=Radio World | date=September 26, 2001 | publisher=IMAS Publishing (USA) Inc. | deadurl=yes | archivedate=October 24, 2001 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011024114726/http://www.rwonline.com/reference-room/special-report/rw-eas2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==

=== Tone usage outside of alerts ===

* During September 2010, the staff of [[KCST-FM]] in [[Florence, Oregon]] noticed that the station's EAS equipment would repeatedly unmute as if receiving an incoming EAS message several times a week. During each event, which was relayed from [[KKNU]] in [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]], the same commercial advertisement for [[ARCO]]/[[BP]] gasoline could be heard, along with the words "This test has been brought to you by ARCO". Further investigation by the primary station transmitting the commercial revealed that the spot had been produced using an audio clip of an actual EAS header which had been modified to lower the header's volume and presumably prevent it from triggering false positive alert reactions in EAS equipment. The spot was distributed nationally, and after it had once been identified as the source of the false EAS equipment trips, various stations around the country reported having had similar experiences. After a widespread notification by the [[Society of Broadcast Engineers]] was issued, ARCO's ad agency withdrew the commercial from airplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radiomagonline.com/currents/news/arco-oil-radio-ads-false-eas-header-0909/ | title=Arco Oil Radio Ads Include False EAS Header | work=Radio | date=September 9, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824070213/http://radiomagonline.com/currents/news/arco-oil-radio-ads-false-eas-header-0909/ | archivedate=August 24, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKenzie River Broadcasting, the parent company of KKNU, was later served with a Notice of Apparent Liability with a forfeiture amount of $10,000 for having played the commercial advertisement containing the header tones. This issue, once considered resolved without a fine being levied, resurfaced in 2013, holding up KKNU's license renewal application. Ultimately, no action by the FCC was taken and the license renewal was granted.
* On June 15, 2012, [[WNKY]], the NBC/[[CBS]] affiliate in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] premiered an advertisement for a local licensed sports apparel store it produced, featuring EAS tones within the ad used in a non-emergency manner and went out over the station's main NBC signal and CBS digital subchannel. On November 5, 2013, the station's owner, [[Max Media]], through its licensee, MMK License, was assessed a $39,000 fine (listed in the FCC's statement as a "voluntary contribution to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]") by the FCC due to the ad. WNKY's digital channels, in addition to the FCC fine, will also launch a local campaign about the EAS through their programs and the station's website, air additional emergency preparation [[public service announcement]]s, and lease space on their tower to the [[Warren County, Kentucky|Warren County]] Emergency Management agency and the City of Bowling Green for modernized warning equipment. Additionally in the same manner, the FCC proposed a $25,000 fine against the cable network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and its corporate parent [[Time Warner]] for an inappropriate use of EAS tones within a 2012 promotional spot for their talk show ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' which had not been put past [[standards and practices]]; the use of tones was part of a promotion involving guest [[Jack Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/mmk-license-llc-agrees-settle-eas-investigation | title=MMK License LLC Agrees to Settle EAS Investigation | date=November 5, 2013 | publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/496427-FCC_Proposes_Fining_TBS_25_000_Over_Conan_Promo.php | title=FCC Proposes Fining TBS $25,000 Over 'Conan' Promo; Issues general warning to industry about seriousness of bogus EAS warnings | last=Eggerton | first=John |date=November 5, 2013 | work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tones from the EAS were used in the trailer for the 2013 film ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]''; cable providers were fined $1.9 million by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 3, 2014 for misuse of EAS tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/false-alarm-olympus-movie-ad-draws-19m-fine |title=False alarm 'Olympus' movie ad draws $1.9M fine |work=The Big Story |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231204456/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/false-alarm-olympus-movie-ad-draws-19m-fine |archivedate=December 31, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An event similar to this previously occurred in November 2013, when TBS was fined $25,000 for the aforementioned use of EAS tones in a ''Conan'' advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/6/5072954/fcc-fines-tbs-25000-for-simulating-emergency-alert-in-conan-ad | title=FCC fines TBS $25,000 for simulating emergency alert tones in 'Conan' ad | date=November 6, 2013 | publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 24, 2014, television viewers of certain stations in Atlanta, Detroit, and Austin reported seeing EAS messages and notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/26882632/u-verse-customers-report-strange-emergency-message|title=U-Verse customers report strange emergency message|author=Will Nunley|date=October 24, 2014|work=myfoxatlanta.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024154353/http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/26882632/u-verse-customers-report-strange-emergency-message|archivedate=October 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency alert originated at [[Nashville, Tennessee]] radio station [[WSIX-FM]], where morning show host [[Bobby Bones Show|Bobby Bones]] replayed the 2011 EAS test as part of a rant about a genuine EAS test from Nashville's Fox affiliate, [[WZTV]], locally interrupting Game 2 of the [[2014 World Series]] on October 22. The errant test was relayed to some radio and television stations and cable systems nationwide, as Bobby Bones' program was also broadcast on other Country-formatted stations, particularly those owned by WSIX-FM's parent company, [[iHeartMedia]] (formerly Clear Channel Communications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/nerw-extra-20141027/|title=NERW Extra: A Few Words About EAS|author=Scott Fybush|work=Fybush Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2015, iHeartMedia was fined $1 million for the incident, and was ordered to implement a three-year compliance plan and remove all EAS tones or similar-sounding noises from its audio production libraries in order to avoid any further incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/93000/iheart-fined-1-million-for-bobby-bones-eas-trigger/ iHeart Fined $1 Million For Bobby Bones EAS Trigger] – ''Radio Insight'' (published May 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* From August 4 to August 6, 2016, [[Tegna, Inc.]]-owned [[NBC]] affiliate [[WTLV]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] aired an ad several times during NBC's primetime coverage of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] produced by the marketing department of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] featuring out-of-sequence EAS tones over Jaguars training camp footage and a voiceover noting 'this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast transmission...seek shelter immediately', along with the on-screen text 'the storm is coming'. The ad aired four times before station compliance authorities pulled the advertisement after the [[local news]] industry blog FTVLive criticized the station for carrying it, especially during the peak of the [[Atlantic hurricane season]]. FTVLive's piece would be noted by the FCC in their decision against WTLV rendered on May 30, 2017, when it was given a $55,000 fine for carrying the offending Jaguars ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jacksonville’s WTLV TV-12 owner fined for use of Emergency Alert tones in Jaguars promo|url=http://jacksonville.com/metro/business/2017-05-30/jacksonville-s-wtlv-tv-12-owner-fined-use-emergency-alert-tones-jaguars |last=Dixon|first=Drew|date=May 30, 2017|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=In the Matter of TEGNA Inc., parent of Multimedia Holdings Corporation Licensee of Station WTLV, Jacksonville, Florida|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|date=May 30, 2017|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-17-424A1.pdf|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacking ===

* On February 11, 2013, [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] broke into the EAS networks in [[Great Falls, Montana]] and [[Marquette, Michigan]] to broadcast an emergency alert that [[zombie]]s have risen from their graves in several counties in [[Montana]] and [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula]]. Stations [[KRTV]] in Great Falls, [[WBUP]] and [[WNMU-TV]] in Marquette broke into programming to broadcast the false alerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=859352#.URnQqPW8F8F |title=WLUC-TV: "Emergency Broadcast System hacked" |date=February 11, 2013 |website=uppermichiganssource.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215013020/http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=859352#.URnQqPW8F8F |archivedate=February 15, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/02/11/dead-bodies-are-rising-from-their-graves-hackers-use-emergency-alert-system-to-warn-of-zombie-apocalypse/ | title=‘Dead bodies are rising from their graves’: Hackers use emergency alert system to warn of zombie apocalypse | date=February 11, 2013 | agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that a number of stations installed station equipment without firewall or security protection, and further neglected to change default factory logins or passwords, opting to use factory presets instead. Because of this, the FCC, FEMA, equipment manufacturers, as well as trade groups, including the [[Michigan Association of Broadcasters]], urged broadcasters to change their passwords and to recheck their security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/02/zombie_apocalypse_now_michigan.html | title=Zombie apocalypse now?

* On February 28, 2017, [[WZZY]] in [[Winchester, Indiana]] was also hacked, when hackers accessed the station's SAGE ENDEC EAS equipment and played the same "zombies and dead bodies" audio from the February 11, 2013 incidents (likely meaning WZZY had the same EAS equipment affecting the 2013 stations, and had failed to change the password on the equipment or secured it). The incident prompted a public response from the Randolph County Sheriff's Department clarifying that the station's "alerting equipment had been hacked" and there was no actual emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox59.com/2017/03/01/hackers-take-over-randolph-county-radio-stations-alert-system-send-out-messages-about-fake-zombie-attack/|title=Hackers take over Randolph County radio station’s alert system, send out messages about fake zombie attack|work=Fox59.com|date=March 1, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-indiana/hacked-radio-station-reports-zombie-attack-and-disease-outbreak-in-randolph-county-indiana|title=WZZY 98.3FM zombie outbreak: Hacked radio station reports zombie attack in Randolph County, Indiana|first=PJ|last=O'Keefe|work=WCPO.com|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On October 19, 2008, [[KWVE-FM]] in [[San Clemente, California]] was scheduled to conduct a Required Weekly Test. However, it conducted a Required Monthly Test by mistake, causing all stations and cable systems in the immediate area to relay the test. In addition, the operator aborted the test midway through, leading the station to fail to broadcast the SAME EOM burst to end the test, causing all area outlets to broadcast KWVE-FM's programming until those stations took their equipment offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-09-2053A1.pdf | title=In the Matter of Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, Inc., FM Radio Station KWVE San Clemente, California: Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture Adopted: September 15, 2009 Released: September 17, 2009 | publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] | accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 15, 2009, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] fined its licensee, [[Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa]], $5,000 for the botched EAS test.

* On September 21, 2017, a technical glitch in another scheduled test by KWVE caused the end-of-message tone to be omitted, causing regional participants (particularly [[Charter Communications|Charter]] and [[Cox Cable]] systems in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]) to accidentally relay portions of [[Chuck Swindoll]]'s ''Insight for Living'' radio program. In the audio relayed, Swindoll was heard quoting [[2 Timothy 3|2 Timothy 3:1]] from the [[Bible]], stating that "extremely violent times will come".

* On February 1, 2005, the EAS was used to [[2005 Connecticut false evacuation alert|mistakenly issue]] an "immediate evacuation order for all of [[Connecticut]]", which contained no specific information on why it had been issued. The message was broadcast due to operator error while conducting an unannounced, but scheduled statewide test. A study conducted following the incident reported that at least 11% of residents actually saw the warning live, and that 63% of those surveyed were "a little or not at all concerned"—citing a suspicious lack of detail in the message, which a legitimate alert would include. Only 1% of those surveyed actually attempted to leave the state.

* In October 2004, the FCC fined [[Capital Media Corporation]] of [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls, NY]] $4,000 for failing to relay test messages and maintain EAS logs. The punishment came after an FCC inspection found that CMC failed to keep adequate records on the four stations owned by the company ([[WHAZ (AM)|WHAZ]], [[WBAR-FM]], [[WMYY]], and [[WMNV]]). The inspection found that the station did not relay a single monthly or weekly test between December, 2002 and April, 2003, in addition to failing to keep any EAS logs for the stations. Capital Media claimed that the tests were not relayed due to "power outages and inclement weather conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-04-3240A1.pdf|title=Capital Media Corporation Forfeiture Order|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522121928/https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-04-3240A1.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-22|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12265">{{for|the 1993 film|False Light}}

In [[law]], '''false light''' is a [[tort]] concerning [[privacy]] that is similar to the tort of [[defamation]]. The [[privacy laws in the United States]] include a [[Public figure|non-public person's]] right to protection from [[publicity]] which puts the person in a false light to the [[general public|public]]. That right is balanced against the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of [[free speech]].

False light differs from defamation primarily in being intended "to protect the [[plaintiff]]'s [[mind|mental]] or [[emotion]]al well-being", rather than to protect a plaintiff's [[reputation]] as is the case with the tort of [[defamation]]&lt;ref name=martin&gt;[http://netlaw.samford.edu/Martin/AdvancedTorts/falselight.htm FALSE LIGHT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227000000/http://netlaw.samford.edu/Martin/AdvancedTorts/falselight.htm |date=February 27, 2008 }} by Professor Edward C. Martin – [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Samford University]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in being about the impression created rather than being about veracity. If a [[publication]] of [[information]] is [[Falsity|false]], then a tort of [[defamation]] might have occurred. If that [[communication]] is not [[technicality|technically]] false but is still [[misleading]], then a tort of false light might have occurred.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
False light privacy claims often arise under the same facts as defamation cases, and therefore not all states recognize false light actions. There is a subtle difference in the way courts view the legal theories—false light cases are about damage to a person's personal feelings or dignity, whereas defamation is about damage to a person's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xANXqQVWB_IJ:www.publishlawyer.com/carousel4.htm When Truth Is No Defense]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The specific elements of the tort of false light vary considerably, even among those [[jurisdiction]]s which do recognize this Tort. Generally, these elements consist of the following: 
# A publication by the [[defendant]] about the [[plaintiff]]; 
# made with [[actual malice]] (very similar to that type required by ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan|New York Times v. Sullivan]]'' in "Defamation" cases);  
# which places the Plaintiff in a false light; AND
# that would be [[Morality|highly offensive]] (i.e., [[embarrassment|embarrassing]] to [[reasonable person]]s).&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some U.S. state courts have ruled that false light lawsuits brought under their states' laws must be rewritten as defamation lawsuits; these courts generally base their opinion on the premises that a) any publication or statement giving rise to a false-light claim will also give rise to a defamation claim, such that the set of statements creating false light is [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|necessarily, although not by definition]], [[Subset|entirely within]] the set of statements constituting defamation; and b) the standard of what would be "highly offensive" or "embarrassing" to a reasonable person is much more difficult to apply than is the state's standard for defamation, such that the potential penalties for violating the former standard would have an unconstitutional or otherwise unacceptable [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on the [[Mass media|media]]. However, "most states do allow false light claims to be brought, even where a defamation claim would suffice."&lt;ref name=accept&gt;{{cite journal |first=Wendy |last=Tannenbaum |title=A recent decision calls 'false light' outdated |journal=Libel &amp; Privacy |date=Fall 2002 |volume=26 |issue=4 |page=22 |url=http://www.rcfp.org/news/mag/26-4/lib-falselig.html |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly two-thirds of states do not recognize the false light claim. The states that do recognize it will not allow a plaintiff to maintain suit for both false light and defamation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Examples==
*In ''Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Globe Int'l, Inc.'', a tabloid newspaper printed the picture of a 96-year-old Arkansas woman next to the headline “SPECIAL DELIVERY: World's oldest newspaper carrier, 101, quits because she's pregnant! I guess walking all those miles kept me young.”&lt;ref&gt;786 F. Supp. 791, 792 (D. Ark. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The woman (who in fact was not pregnant), Nellie Mitchell, who had run a small newsstand on the town square since 1963, prevailed at trial under a theory of false light invasion of privacy. She was awarded damages of $1.5M. The tabloid appealed, generally disputing the offensiveness and falsity of the photograph, arguing that Mitchell had not actually been injured, and claiming that Mitchell had failed to prove that any employee of the tabloid knew or had reason to know that its readers would conclude that the story about the pregnant carrier related to the photograph printed alongside. The court of appeals rejected all of the tabloid’s arguments, holding that “[i]t may be. . .that Mrs. Mitchell does not show a great deal of obvious injury, but. . . Nellie Mitchell's experience could be likened to that of a person who had been dragged slowly through a pile of untreated sewage. . . [and] few would doubt that substantial damage had been inflicted by the one doing the dragging.”
*In a case against ''[[Playgirl]]'' magazine, actor Jose Solano Jr. won a false light claim because of the placement of headlines around his cover photo. The court said the gist of the magazine's cover—which featured headlines like "12 Sizzling Centerfolds Ready to Score With You" and "TV Guys. Primetime's Sexy Young Stars Exposed"—put Solano in a false light by suggesting he might be pictured nude inside the magazine, even though the cover could not have given rise to a defamation claim."&lt;ref name=accept/&gt;  The case was then later reversed due to the fact that he was a limited public figure and that the magazine was 'newsworthy.'
*A [[Fifth Circuit]] case helps elucidate the distinction between false light and defamation. Jeannie Braun was an entertainer who performed an amusement park act involving a swimming pig.&lt;ref&gt;''Braun v. Flynt'', 726 F.2d 245, 247 (5th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Through deception, a company owned by [[Larry Flynt]], “obtained her picture [with the pig] and placed it in a magazine of nationwide circulation devoted to the publication of lewd pictures of women and to sexual exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 256.&lt;/ref&gt; A jury awarded Braun $30,000 on her defamation claim and $55,000 on her false light claims.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fifth Circuit, however, held that Mrs. Braun could not recover under both theories, because they arose “from a single publication.”&lt;ref name="Id. at 258"&gt;Id. at 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the court instructed that if Braun waived her defamation claim, the district court should enter judgment on the false light claim.&lt;ref name="Id. at 258"/&gt; The court explained that the “facts of this case and the nature of the damages suffered – primarily, personal humiliation, embarrassment, pain and suffering – fit more precisely the ‘false light’ invasion of privacy theory than they do the defamation theory.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy | publisher = Vintage Books |title = The Right to Privacy | place = New York | date = 1997 | isbn = 0-679-41986-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ms.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19840514_0041150.C05.htm/qx | title = Braun v.

*The case of ''[[Spahn v. Messner|Warren E. Spahn v. Julian Messner, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;21 N.Y.2d 124 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; is a leading [[New York Court of Appeals]] of the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] court case involving the civil tort of false light that involved, among other things, a knowing lie about a military decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=610551609637886427 |title=Spahn v. Messner (NY Court of Appeals) |publisher=Scholar.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Messner]], Inc. published a supposed biography of baseball great [[Warren Spahn]], written by one Milton Shapiro; the biography was aimed at children. The biography was largely fictionalized but, in keeping with its genre and target audience, did not say things that made Spahn look bad (and thus was not libelous). Rather, the biography made him look more heroic than he was by, for example, falsely claiming that he had earned a Bronze Star. Spahn sought an [[injunction]] to prevent publication of this book, ''The Warren Spahn Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemagebooks.com/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=7215&amp;CLSN_857=1252611037857911d6f7a75d92370031 |title=The Warren Spahn Story – Shapiro, Milton J |publisher=Cinemagebooks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York court ruled in Spahn's favor. The court blocked further publication of the book and ordered the defendants to pay damages in the amount of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16324234202436618455 |title=Spahn v. Messner (NY trial court)|publisher=Scholar.google.com |date=1964-05-28 |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messner appealed. In its ruling, the New York court held that such speech was constitutionally unprotected, and therefore could give rise to a tort recovery, simply because of the emotional distress that the falsehoods caused Spahn. To this day, this is a classic and often-cited example of speech actionable under the false light tort and has been used in court decisions all across the country
*In the 1967 case of ''[[Time, Inc. v. Hill]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1965/1965_22/ |title=385 U.S. 374 (1967) |publisher=Oyez.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] invalidated a false light privacy judgment for the Hill family in the absence of proof of actual malice. James Hill and his family were held up for a day in 1952 by three escaped convicts in their home near Philadelphia. The convicts eventually released the Hill family without harm or injury. Joseph Hayes wrote a novel about the story titled ''[[The Desperate Hours (Hayes novel)|The Desperate Hours]]'', which would later be made into [[The Desperate Hours (play)|a Broadway play]]. Hayes’ work portrayed a family, similar to the Hills, but in Hayes’ story, the family is treated with considerable violence while held hostage. [[Life Magazine|''Life'' magazine]] published an article in 1955 "describing the play as a re-enactment, and using as illustrations photographs of scenes staged in the former Hill home."&lt;ref name="timehill"&gt;{{cite web |title=Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374 (1967) |url= https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/385/374.html|publisher=FindLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hill family sued Time, Inc., publisher of ''Life'', for invasion of privacy, reasoning that ''Life'' magazine was using their name and experience in order to increase circulation and to attract more people to the play. Time, Inc. argued that the issue was of public concern and was "published in good faith without any malice whatsoever."&lt;ref name="timehill"/&gt; Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], speaking for a five-member majority of the Court, wrote that a showing of innocent or negligent false reportage is insufficient to collect damages for a false light claim. Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]], writing in dissent, opined that the [[actual malice]] standard, as set forth by the Court three years earlier in ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', was too stringent for false light privacy cases.

[[File:SLNSW 479513 10 Registrar Generals Office SH 562.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Registrar General’s Office, [[Sydney]] Australia (1872)]]
'''General Register Office''' ('''GRO''') is the name given to the [[civil registry]] in [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations and [[Ireland]]. As such, the GRO is the [[government agency]] responsible for the [[Public records|recording]] of [[vital record]]s such as [[birth]]s, [[death]]s, and [[marriage]]s. The director of a General Register Office is titled '''Registrar General'''.

==Examples==
* [[General Register Office for England and Wales]]: The post of registrar general was created by the '''Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836''', and registration began in 1837. The first holder of the post was [[Thomas Henry Lister]]. The registrar general was soon given other responsibilities, such as the conduct of every [[Census in the United Kingdom|census]] in England and Wales since 1841, and eventually came to be head of a primarily statistical organisation. In 1972, with the creation of the [[Office of Population Censuses and Surveys]], the General Register Office became just one division of the new office, headed by a Deputy Registrar General. In England and Wales, birth registration with the state began on 1 July 1837. The birth was registered in the birth district and at the end of each quarter, the registrar sent a copy of all entries to the Registrar General. However, registration did not become compulsory until 1875. Until 1875 there was no penalty for not registering a birth; after that a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of £2 was introduced. Between 1837 and 1875 some births were not registered so a child could be sent out to work, or, after 1853, to avoid the [[compulsory vaccination]]s of children over three months old which began that year. With the creation of the [[Office for National Statistics]], the post of Registrar General was merged with that of Head of the [[Government Statistical Service]], who is now also the [[National Statistician]]. However, following the 2008 implementation of the [[Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]], the General Register Office continues to be part of a ministerially-accountable department, becoming a part of the [[Identity &amp; Passport Service]] in the [[Home Office]] and the post of Registrar-General is now held by its head.
* [[General Register Office for Scotland]].
* [[Registrar General of Canada]]: a government minister with entirely different and unrelated functions. Each province and territory in Canada has a Registrar General responsible for collecting and storing vital statistics like births, marriages and deaths in their respective regions.

The [http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/en/about-us/history/hiroshima-nagasaki-protocol/hiroshima-nagasaki-protocol.html Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol] is a proposed protocol complementary to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT) being championed by the [[Mayors for Peace]] [[2020 Vision Campaign]] and gathering the support of local authorities and civil society actors all over the world. It seeks to challenge national governments to follow through on the commitments they made in Article VI the Treaty. In this Article, the parties undertake to pursue "negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the [[nuclear arms race]] at an early date and to nuclear disarmament", and towards a "Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control". The Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol calls on the States Parties to the Treaty to live up to this "good faith" agreement. It challenges them to adopt an overarching approach to nuclear disarmament, rather than the go-nowhere-slowly step-by-step approach. It challenges the nuclear-weapon states to show good faith through unilateral reciprocal actions. Furthermore, it challenges the States Parties to adopt a legal-binding document, rather than the past political-pledges ignored or undermined by some of the nuclear-weapon States Parties in the past.

== Support for the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol ==

The Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol is an important initiative, which is rapidly gaining momentum as cities around the world express their strong support for it.  In June 2008, the [[U.S. Conference of Mayors]] (USCM) unanimously adopted a far-reaching resolution entitled “Support for the Elimination of All Nuclear Weapons by the Year 2020.”  The USCM resolution recommends that the U.S. government “urgently consider” the Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol as a means of “fulfilling the promise of the NPT by the year 2020, thereby meeting the obligation founded by the International Court of Justice in 1996 to ‘conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.’” The resolution also encourages USCM members to sign the Cities Appeal being circulated in support of the Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol and to encourage other elected officials in their cities to do likewise.

== The Cities Appeal ==

Since May 2008, the main focus of the work of the [[2020 Vision Campaign]] has been the signature drive for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100702161333/http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/filestorage/409/File/1/CitiesAppeal.pdf Cities Appeal] in support of the [[Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol]].

By signing the Cities Appeal, Mayors and elected local officials around the world are given the chance to get behind the Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol ahead of the formal and final presentation of the results of the international signature drive at the 2010 NPT Review Conference at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

As of February 2009, the number of signatories stands at 516 from 42 countries. They range from Sapporo (Japan) to San Francisco (USA), and from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Cape Town (South Africa) as far as Toronto (Canada). Of these, 468 are mayoral signatures, each representing the solidarity of their own city or municipality with the cause of nuclear disarmament.

== Article I ==

Article I calls for a “clampdown” on all weapon-usable fissile materials – be they in weapons, reactors, or stocks – accompanied by a cessation of nuclear weapons acquisition and of all preparations for the use of nuclear weapons.

== Article II ==

Article II calls for establishment of a negotiating forum open to all states, with the sole purpose of developing a Nuclear Weapons Convention or Framework Agreement for achieving nuclear disarmament in all its aspects by the year 2020.

== Article III ==

Article III underscores the need for all states to contribute to the international control system and to continue to comply fully with their NPT obligations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''''Horsley v MacLaren''''', [1972] S.C.R. 441, also known as '''''the Ogopogo'' case''',&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Alexander, "One Rescuer's Obligation to Another: The 'Ogopogo' Lands in the Supreme Court of Canada," ''The University of Toronto Law Journal'', vol. 22, no. 2. (Spring, 1972), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision where it was held that there is no duty at common law to rescue or aid anyone in distress. Furthermore, "a person who imperils himself by his carelessness may be as fully liable to a rescuer as a third person would be who imperils another."

==Background==
MacLaren was the owner and captain of a boat called ''The Ogopogo''. He invited several friends out on his boat including Mr. Matthews, Mr. Horsley, and Mr. and Mrs. Jones. During their cruise, Matthews fell overboard into the icy water which caused him to have a heart attack and die. MacLaren backed the boat up to rescue Matthews not knowing if he was alive. Horsley jumped into the water to save Matthews but he was also overcome by the cold water. Mrs. Jones then jumped in to help them both. Mr. Jones, Mrs. Jones' husband, moved the boat into a better position to rescue the three. In all, Mr. Matthews and Mr.Horsley were killed.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court held that "encouragement by the common law of the rescue of persons in danger would ... go beyond reasonable bounds if it involved [[legal liability|liability]] of one rescuer to a succeeding one where the former has not been guilty of any fault which could be said to have induced a second rescue attempt." The [[Donoghue v Stevenson]] case doesn't touch this principle, because it says that you have a [[duty]] to avoid causing harm, not a duty to help someone else. In the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] decision [1970] 2 O.R. 487, 11 D.L.R. (3d) 277, [[Arthur Jessup]] J. wrote for the court: "So, despite the moral outrage of the text writers, it appears presently the law that one can, with immunity, smoke a cigarette on the beach while one’s neighbour drowns and, without a word of warning watch a child or blind person walk into certain danger".

The '''Hostages Convention''' (formally the '''International Convention against the Taking of Hostages''') is a United Nations treaty by which states agree to prohibit and punish [[hostage taking]]. The treaty includes definitions of "hostage" and "hostage taking" and sets out the principle of ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]'': a party to the treaty must prosecute a hostage taker if no other state requests [[extradition]] for prosecution of the same crime.

==Creation and entry into force==
The creation of an anti-hostage-taking treaty was a project initiated by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenau, Bernhard. "The United Nations and Terrorism. Germany, Multilateralism, and Antiterrorism Efforts in the 1970s", Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;The convention was adopted on 17 December 1979 by the issuance of Resolution 34/1461 by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]. By the end of 1980, it had been signed by 39 states and it came into force on 3 June 1983 after it had been ratified by 22 states. As of October 2016, the convention has 176 state parties.

==State parties==
The convention has 176 state parties, which includes 175 [[Member states of the United Nations|UN members]] plus [[Niue]]. The 19 UN member states that are ''not'' parties to the treaty are:
{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|
*{{flagu|Angola}}
*{{flagu|Burundi}}
*{{flagu|Republic of the Congo}}
*{{flagu|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
*{{flagu|East Timor}}
*{{flagu|Eritrea}}
*{{flagu|Gambia}}
*{{flagu|Indonesia}}

*{{flagu|Somalia}}
*{{flagu|South Sudan}}
*{{flagu|Syria}}
*{{flagu|Tuvalu}}
*{{flagu|Vanuatu}}
*{{flagu|Zimbabwe}}
}}

Of these 19 states, the convention has been signed but not ratified by the DR Congo and Israel. Other non-state-parties include the [[Holy See]] and the [[Cook Islands]] (though New Zealand's ratification states that it applies to the Cook Islands and Niue (but not [[Tokelau]])).

===Former state parties and successions===
Former state parties that were not formally succeeded by any existing state include [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], and [[Yugoslavia]]. A number of states ratified but have since been succeeded by new states: [[Serbia]] ratified as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]; Russia ratified as the [[Soviet Union]]; [[Belarus]] ratified as the [[Byelorussian SSR]]; and [[Ukraine]] ratified as the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

'''Jim "The Hammer" Shapiro''' is an American [[Lawyer|attorney]] and author who was known in the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Florida]] areas (as well as some areas of Canada where the Rochester station [[WUHF]] is available on cable) for his aggressive [[Television advertisement|television commercials]], as well as for a letter of solicitation he sent to a [[coma]]tose accident victim.&lt;ref&gt;"Lawyer suspended over ads", ''Times Union'', 2 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2004/2004_03488.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Shapiro graduated from [[Boston University School of Law|Boston University Law School]]. He is a member of the New York [[Bar association|Bar]], and the Plaintiff's Securities Lawyers Group. He founded three law firms and had offices in [[Broward County, Florida]]; [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York.&lt;ref name=current&gt;http://www.yourlegalfortune.com/about.html Jim "The Hammer" Shapiro's website, accessed August 1, 2006. Link inactive October 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Shapiro became controversial for his self-promotional television commercials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2002/06/29/Opinion/s.o-b.Lawyer.Validates.His.Title-257106.shtml?norewrite200607301230&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailyorange.com ''Daily Orange''] article "'S.O.B.' lawyer validates his title", published June 14, 2006 and accessed July 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in which he promised to obtain large financial settlements for accident victims,&lt;ref&gt;"Flamboyant personal-injury lawyer dealt a setback", Associated Press Newswires, 14 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; referred to himself as "the meanest, nastiest [[Son of a bitch|S.O.B.]] in town"&lt;ref name=Case&gt;Case, Dick, "Annoyed viewers find they can’t nail ads by ‘The Hammer’," ''Syracuse Herald-Journal'', 16 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed to have "aggressive courtroom prowess".&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;Craig, Gary, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041220/NEWS01/412200312/1002/NEWS "'Hammer' Shapiro on other end of lawsuit"], ''Democrat and Chronicle'' published December 20, 2004 and accessed July 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; His ads' visuals frequently included vehicle crashes, falling bodies, [[Satan]], threats of physical violence against defendants, images from the video game [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]], animals and people being hit by trains, and explosions.&lt;ref name="DemChronFeb07"&gt;Zeigler, Michael, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070201/NEWS01/702010341/1002/NEWS "Lawyers are asked to tone down ads"], ''Democrat and Chronicle'' published and accessed February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He also began selling not-for-profit [[t-shirt]]s which featured "a vicious beast with blood dripping from its fangs" and the words "Protected by Vicious S.O.B., Jim The Hammer Shapiro."&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

Shapiro sold all three law firms and now writes books. He is the author of ''Victims'' [sic] ''Rights to Maximum Cash'', ''Sue the Bastards'', ''Million Dollar Lungs'', ''Injury Victims'' [sic] ''Rights to Maximum Cash'', ''Instant Credit Repair'' and ''Get Back All Your Lost Investments!''.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

In 2007, Shapiro's advertisements were cited by the Rochester ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]]'' as partial inspiration for a new set of rules the New York State Court System has implemented that limit attorneys' advertisements. The new rules prohibit, among other things, nicknames such as "The Hammer".&lt;ref name="DemChronFeb07" /&gt; The [[United States Constitution|constitutionality]] of the rules was called into question when [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Frederick Scullin]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] permanently [[injunction|enjoined]] some of the provisions in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Law Journal]]'', [http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?hubtype=TopStories&amp;id=1185482031426 "Upset of Few Attorney Advertising Rules Could Signal Return of 'Heavy Hitters'"], Joel Stashenko, July 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bar discipline==
In 2002, Christopher Wagner, a former client, sued Shapiro for malpractice. Wagner was injured in a 1995 motor vehicle accident and had responded to Shapiro's commercials. Wagner claimed he had incurred $182,000 in medical bills, but Shapiro's firm, Shapiro and Shapiro, encouraged him to accept a settlement of $65,000, promising more money could be obtained in a lawsuit against the state of New York. However, the state had no liability and Shapiro never pursued any further action on Wagner's behalf.&lt;ref name=OHara&gt;O'Hara, Jim, Jury whacks TV ad lawyer: Jim "The Hammer" Shapiro hit with $1.5M malpractice, false advertising judgment, ''The Post-Standard Syracuse'', 13 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In its opinion suspending Shapiro, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, found that he had "never tried a case to its conclusion [in New York] and had conducted approximately 10 depositions."&lt;ref name=NYSCA&gt;''In re Shapiro'', 7 A.D.3d 120, 124, 780 N.Y.S.2d 680, 684 (N.Y. App. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro had lived in Florida since 1995, remotely supervising his New York office.&lt;ref name=NYSCA /&gt; Wagner's lawyer, Robert Williams, claimed Shapiro's firm in Rochester was staffed by one lawyer who had only taken four cases to trial. The New York Supreme Court jury found the law firm owned by Shapiro had engaged in [[misleading advertising]] and legal [[malpractice]] and awarded a $1.5 million judgment against Shapiro.&lt;ref name=OHara/&gt;

Consequently, In 2004 he was suspended from practicing law for one year in New York. In 2005 he was also suspended from practicing law for one year in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/clerk/disposition/2005/10/04-1276.pdf The Florida Bar v. James J. Shapiro], Supreme Court of Florida, October 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro said the decision to suspend him from practicing in New York was "unfair and unconstitutional" but claimed the ruling would have little effect because he had sold his Rochester office and was now promoting books.&lt;ref&gt;Mariani, John, "Court rules "The Hammer' can't practice; judges: TV ads false and lawyer tried to get business from a comatose victim", ''The Post Standard/Herald-Journal'', May 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 2004, four additional former clients unsuccessfully sued Shapiro for unspecified damages, alleging he had engaged in misleading advertising and legal malpractice.&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Shapiro is known for his philanthropy in Rochester. Since 1996, he has donated $7,500 per year to elementary schools to purchase books. He has indicated that his goal is to put $600,000 worth of books into schools within ten years. In 1996, he donated {{convert|86.5|acre|m2}} of land worth $800,000 to the Rochester [[YMCA]]. He has also donated land in Rochester valued at $120,000 to be used as a park for children.&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Dunkin' Donuts]] parodied Shapiro in a commercial for its breakfast menu in 2010, with a sound-alike named Bob "The Bulldozer" Phillips. Phillips imitated Shapiro's "every single penny" advertisement almost to the letter.

'''John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln''' (1462/1464 – 16 June 1487) was a leading figure in the Yorkist aristocracy during the [[Wars of the Roses]].

After the death of his uncle [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], de la Pole was reconciled with the new Tudor regime, but two years later he organised a major Yorkist rebellion. He sought to place [[Lambert Simnel]] on the throne, claiming that Simnel was in fact his cousin [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward, Earl of Warwick]]. Whether or not de la Pole intended to take the throne for himself if he were successful is not known, but has been widely suspected by historians. He was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Stoke]] in 1487.

==Early life==
John de la Pole was the eldest son of [[John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk]] and [[Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk]]. His father was the son of [[Alice Chaucer]], granddaughter of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. His mother was the sixth child and third daughter born to [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] and [[Cecily Neville]]. He was thus the nephew of the Yorkist kings [[Edward IV of England]] and his successor [[Richard III of England]].

John's uncle Edward IV made him [[Earl of Lincoln]] in 1467.&lt;ref name = "enc"&gt;Wagner, John, ''Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses'', ABC-CLIO, 2001, pp.211–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heir to the throne==
After King Edward's death, de la Pole became a firm supporter of his uncle Richard III. He was given revenues of about 500 pounds a year, and was appointed president of the [[Council of the North]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross 159&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Richard's son and heir, [[Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales|Edward of Middleham]], he was appointed to replace him as the king's lieutenant in Ireland, though this was a nominal position as the government of Ireland was locally administered by [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]].&lt;ref name = "enc"/&gt;
 
During the last year of Richard's reign, Lincoln seems to have been designated heir to the throne, though he was never publicly proclaimed as such.&lt;ref name = "enc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kendall pp. 349–50, although Ross, p. 158, doubts it&lt;/ref&gt; Edward, Earl of Warwick would have had a superior claim but was attainted after his father, George, Duke of Clarence, was found guilty of treason against his brother, Edward IV, in 1478. Richard made important land grants to Lincoln and, significantly, granted him the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, traditionally given to the heir.&lt;ref name = "enc"/&gt;

==Rebellion==
After Richard's defeat at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] on 22 August 1485, Lincoln was reconciled with the new king, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], but soon became impatient with the new rule. A clergyman named Symonds introduced him to his protegé, Lambert Simnel, who bore a resemblance to Edward, Earl of Warwick. The real Edward had been imprisoned in the Tower of London by King Henry. Lincoln decided to promote Edward as the "true" Yorkist heir, while using Simnel to represent him, thus allowing Lincoln to become the actual leader of the Yorkists. Lincoln travelled to Burgundy to persuade his aunt [[Margaret of York|Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy]] to finance a military expedition to take the throne from Henry. While nominally supporting Simnel, "in private, he probably saw his own accession as the ultimate goal of the enterprise".&lt;ref name = "enc"/&gt; With an army of mercenaries, Lincoln sailed to Ireland, where he was supported by [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th  Earl of Kildare]], who was keen to see a return of Yorkist rule in England. This was mainly because the Yorkist kings had allowed Irish self-government with FitzGerald as almost the "uncrowned king of Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Bertram Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', Yale University Press, 1999. p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; Simnel was proclaimed king in Ireland and crowned in Dublin as "Edward VI".

With his army swelled by Irish recruits led by FitzGerald's brother [[Thomas FitzGerald of Laccagh]], Lincoln landed at [[Piel Island]] in Lancashire and proceeded to march towards York, formerly a stronghold of Richard III's supporters. However, the town refused to surrender to Lincoln. The Yorkists secured a victory over a small Lancastrian force at Bramham Moor and Lincoln managed to avoid Henry's main northern forces, which moved away when they received news that York was under attack. This may have been a diversion planned by the Yorkists. Lincoln's army was, however, repeatedly harassed by Lancastrian cavalry under Sir Edward Woodville.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Knight Errant, Sir Edward Woodville and the age of chivalry, C.P.Wilkins p142&lt;/ref&gt; The Yorkists then crossed the river Trent and set up their position at the top of a hill near the village of East Stoke. Soon the vanguard of the main Lancastrian army under [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]] caught up with them. In the subsequent [[Battle of Stoke Field]] on 16 June 1487, the Yorkist army was conclusively defeated. Lincoln himself was killed in the battle along with most of the other Yorkist leaders. In November 1487, he was posthumously attainted.

His death did not end the de la Pole claim to the throne. His younger brother [[Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk]] became the leading Yorkist claimant to the throne until his execution by orders of [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1513. Their younger brother [[Richard de la Pole]] continued their claim until his own death at the [[Battle of Pavia]] (24 February 1525) while a fourth brother, [[William de la Pole (1478–1539)|William]], was held prisoner in the [[Tower of London]] for 37 years, dying in 1539.

==Marriage and issue==
Lincoln married, perhaps by the late 1470s, Margaret FitzAlan, daughter of [[Thomas FitzAlan, 17th Earl of Arundel]], and Margaret Woodville, sister of [[Elizabeth Woodville]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1910|p=250}} by whom he had a son, Alan de la Pole, who died young; according to Horrox, however, there were no children of the marriage. In October 1524 Margaret's father, Thomas FitzAlan, bequeathed her a 'great ring with a turquoise'. She appears not to have remarried, and the date of her death is unknown.{{sfn|Horrox|2004}} According to Genealogy, Margaret was born in 1475 and died sometime after 1493 and she and John had two children - a son, Edward, who died young, and a daughter, Margaret, who went on to marry Sr John Hardy Sr and had a son, John Hardy Jr, Mayor of London&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/Margaret-FitzAlan-Countess-of-Lincoln/6000000008328370652&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In popular culture==
Lincoln was a major character in the opening episodes of the 1972 [[BBC 2]] drama series about the reign of Henry VII, ''[[The Shadow of the Tower]]''. He was played by [[James Laurenson]].

The '''''Kolpak'' ruling''' is a [[European Court of Justice]] ruling handed down on 8 May 2003 in favour of [[Maroš Kolpak]], a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[team handball|handball]] player. It declared that citizens of countries which have signed [[European Union Association Agreement]]s have the same right to freedom of work and movement within the EU as EU citizens. Thus any restrictions placed on their right to work (such as quotas setting maximum numbers of such foreign players in sports teams)  are deemed illegal under EU law.  The legal actions in Germany set a precedent for professional sports in Europe, which have had a wide-ranging effect, especially in regard to  English [[County Championship|county cricket]] and European professional rugby.

A '''Kolpak player''', or '''Kolpak''', is a term used in the United Kingdom for players in the domestic leagues in [[cricket]] and [[rugby football|both rugby codes]] from overseas, subject to the Kolpak ruling.

==Court ruling==
The Court of Justice's [[Bosman ruling]] in 1995 had declared that, in accordance with the [[EC Treaty]] rules regarding [[freedom of movement for workers]], no resident of the [[European Union]] should be restricted from working in another part of the EU on the grounds of their nationality. For example, a German [[association football|football]] team could not be prevented from signing a [[Greece|Greek]] player since both nations are members of the EU.

[[Maroš Kolpak]] was a Slovak [[Team handball|handball]] player, who was legally resident and working in Germany. He had been playing for the German second division handball side TSV Ostringen since 1997. The German Handball Association had a rule (Rule 15) which prohibited its member clubs from fielding more than two non-EU citizens. At that time, [[Slovakia]] was not yet a member of the European Union (it joined the EU in May 2004), and therefore the [[Bosman ruling]] did not apply to its citizens. Slovakia did however have an [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] with the European Union.

Kolpak was ejected by his club in 2000 as they had filled their quota of two non-EU players. Kolpak challenged the German Handball Association, claiming that Rule 15, by treating him differently from German citizens, placed an illegal restriction on his freedom of movement as a worker. The German Handball Association held that equality of treatment applied only to citizens of European Union countries (as per the Bosman Ruling) and not to non-EU citizens. The case was referred by the German [[Oberlandesgericht|higher court]] to the [[European Court of Justice]], for a determination on whether the Association Agreement between Slovakia and the European Union provided equal rights for Slovak workers who were living and working legally within the EU. The Court ruled in favour of Kolpak.

Thus the Kolpak Ruling declares that citizens of countries which have applicable [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]]s with the EU, and who are lawfully working within an EU country, have equal rights to work as EU citizens, and cannot have restrictions such as quotas placed upon them. Such countries include those within the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states]], such as South Africa, Jamaica and Zimbabwe.

==Implications for sport==

===Cricket===
In practice the decision has allowed English county cricket clubs to employ the services of a multitude of overseas cricketers, especially from South Africa. Prior to the Kolpak ruling [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] rules had limited each county to one overseas (non-EU) professional.

County cricket clubs could already employ any number of EU residents under the [[Bosman ruling]]. There were no other [[Test cricket]] nations within the EU, however, which explains why it was Kolpak, not Bosman, which has had the significant impact on English county cricket. The largest group of countries with an association agreement with the EU is the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP Group of States]], which includes South Africa, [[Zimbabwe]], and many of the nations that supply the [[West Indies cricket team]].

The English Cricket Board ruled that a player must not have represented their own country for over twelve months in order to qualify for Kolpak status but after South African [[Jacques Rudolph]] signed for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]], they admitted that this rule was unenforceable.&lt;ref name = "cricinfo_rudolph"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cricinfo Staff | title = Rudolph to play for Yorkshire under Kolpak | publisher = [[Cricinfo]] | date = 30 March 2007 | url = http://content.cricinfo.com/southafrica/content/story/287993.html | accessdate = 9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to combat the influx of Kolpak players, the ECB linked the central payments made to counties, to the number of English qualified players who play for that county. This in effect means that every game a Kolpak player plays instead of an English qualified player, a county gets £1,100 less from the ECB.&lt;ref name = "cricinfo_ECB"&gt;{{cite web | last = Luke | first = Will | title = ECB respond to influx of foreign signings | publisher = Cricinfo | date = 25 September 2005 | url = http://content.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/220424.html | accessdate = 9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this was classed as a way of encouraging counties to develop young players who could go on to play for England, rather than a restrictive quota system, it was legal under the EU rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/3613439.stm ECB 'can stop foreign influx'] – BBC News, 9 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, the system did not result in a significant drop in the number of Kolpak players, as counties chose to continue to sign foreign players, rather than maximize their handout from the ECB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/7398604.stm ECB will fight SA player influx] – BBC News, 13 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The influx reached a peak in 2008, when during a match between Northants and Leicestershire, half the players on the field were from non-EU countries.&lt;ref name="bbc4"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/8325975.stm ECB wins overseas player battle] – BBC News, 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the EU changed its reading of the [[Cotonou Agreement]] (the Association Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/7518580.stm Kolpak numbers could be slashed] – BBC News, 28 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It now stated that the Cotonou agreement should not be interpreted as mandating free movement of labour, but rather the free trade of goods and services. The Home Office were subsequently able to introduce new rules placing restrictions on Kolpak players, stating that only those who had held a valid work permit for four years had the right to be treated the same as EU citizens.&lt;ref name="bbc4"/&gt;

===Rugby===
In rugby league and rugby union, the Kolpak ruling has allowed teams to sign many players from [[Fiji]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]] and [[South Africa]], all of which are also ACP countries. Many rugby union clubs have also signed South African players under Kolpak, most notably the French team [[RC Toulonnais]] and English team [[Saracens F.C.]]

In a related issue, [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] player [[Andrew Mehrtens]], who was born in [[Durban]], decided to pursue a South African passport when he signed with the English side [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] for the [[National Division One 2005-06|2005–06 National Division One season]], as it would enable the club to sign another non-EU and non-Kolpak player.

This is chronological '''list of [[crime films]]''' split by decade. Often there may be considerable overlap particularly between Crime and other genres (including, [[action films|action]], [[thriller films|thriller]], and [[drama films]]); the list should attempt to document films which are more closely related to crime, even if it bends genres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26150">'''Landmark court decisions''', in present-day [[common law]] legal systems, establish [[precedent]]s that determine a significant new [[legal principle]] or concept, or otherwise substantially affect the interpretation of existing [[law]]. "'''Leading case'''" is commonly used in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions instead of "'''landmark case'''" as used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/leading-case Meaning of ''leading case'' in the English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. W. B. Simpson, ''Leading Cases in the Common Law'', Clarendon Press,
1996 [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198262992.001.0001/acprof-9780198262992]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Commonwealth countries, a reported decision is said to be a ''leading decision'' when it has come to be generally regarded as settling the law of the question involved. In 1914, Canadian jurist Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy said "a 'leading case' [is] one that settles the law upon some important point".&lt;ref&gt;Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy, ''Leading Cases in Canadian Constitutional Law.'' Toronto: Carswell, 1914, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading decision may settle the law in more than one way. It may do so by: 
* [[Distinguishing]] a new principle that refines a prior principle, thus departing from prior practice without violating the rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'';
* Establishing a "test" (that is, a measurable standard that can be applied by courts in future decisions), such as the [[R. v. Oakes|''Oakes test'']] (in Canadian law) or the [[Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee|''Bolam test'']] (in English law).
* Sometimes, with regard to a particular provision of a written constitution, only one court decision has been made. By necessity, until further rulings are made, this ruling is the leading case. For example, in Canada, "[t]he leading case on voting rights and electoral boundary readjustment is [[Reference re Provincial Electoral Boundaries (Sask.)|''Carter'']]. In fact, ''Carter'' is the only case of disputed electoral boundaries to have reached the Supreme Court."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pal and Sujit Choudry, “Is Every Ballot Equal? Visible Minority Vote Dilution in Canada”, ''IRPP Choices'' vol. 13, no. 1 (January 2007), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which this kind of leading case can be said to have "settled" the law is less than in situations where many rulings have reaffirmed the same principle.

== Landmark decisions in Australia ==
{{Main|List of High Court of Australia cases|List of Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases}}
Decisions in leading cases in Australia have usually been made by the [[High Court of Australia]], although historically some have been made by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in [[London]].

*''[[Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd.]]'' (Engineers' Case) (1920): Rejected the doctrines of implied intergovernmental immunities and reserved State powers and determined that each head of federal power should be interpreted simply on the words of the grant.
*''[[Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts]] (1921)'': dealt with what is a matter for the court and what the court can hear.
* In 1948, the High Court of Australia found that the [[Ben Chifley|Chifley]] government's legislation to nationalise Australia's private banks was unconstitutional.
* In 1951, the High Court of Australia found that [[Robert Menzies]]' attempts to ban the [[Communist Party of Australia]] were unconstitutional.
* In ''[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]'' ''(Tasmanian Dams Case)'', the High Court held that the Commonwealth was able to invoke its [[Section 51(xxix) of the Constitution of Australia|external affairs power]] to give effect to Australia's obligations under international law, including to prevent the construction of the Franklin Dam in a [[World Heritage Zone]]. 
* In  ''[[Eddie Mabo &amp; Ors v The State of Queensland (No.2)]]'' invalidated the declaration of [[terra nullius]].&lt;ref&gt; Mabo v Queensland (1989) 166 CLR 186 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/69.html AustLill]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dietrich v The Queen]]'', it was found that Australians accused of serious offences have a limited right to legal representation in order to guarantee a fair trial.
* In ''[[Plaintiff M70/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship]]'' ''(The [[Malaysian Solution]] Case)'' the High Court held that refugees could not be deported to countries that did not meet certain human rights protection standards.
* In ''[[Commonwealth v the ACT]]'' ''(Same-Sex Marriage Case)'' the High Court held that only the Commonwealth had the necessary legislative head of power to reform marriage laws to encompass same-sex marriage.
* In ''[[Williams v Commonwealth]]'' and ''[[Williams v Commonwealth (No 2)]]'' ''(School Chaplains Case)'' the High Court held that the Commonwealth did not have the necessary constitutional head of legislative power to fund the [[National School Chaplaincy Programme]].
* In ''[[Re Canavan]]'' ''(The Citizenship Seven Case)'', the High Court's earlier ruling in ''[[Sykes v Cleary]]'' was clarified and it was found that a [[dual citizen]], irrespective of whether they knew about their citizenship status, will be disqualified from sitting in Parliament unless they are irremediably prevented by foreign law from renouncing their foreign citizenship as a result of the operation of [[Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia|s 44(i) of the Australian Constitution]]. [[2017-18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|15 members]] of the [[45th Parliament of Australia|45th Parliament]] were either ruled ineligible to serve, or resigned on the basis of holding foreign citizenship.

== Landmark decisions in Canada ==
{{Main|List of Supreme Court of Canada cases|List of Judicial Committees of the Privy Council cases}}

There is no universally agreed-to list of "leading decisions" in Canada.

One indication, however, as to whether a case is widely regarded as being "leading" is its inclusion of the ruling in one or more of the series of compilations prepared over the years by various authors. One of the earlier examples is Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy's ''Leading Cases in Canadian Constitutional Law'', published in 1914. More recently, [[Peter H. Russell]] and a changing list of collaborators have published a series of books, including:
* ''Leading Constitutional Decisions'' (first published 1965, with several later editions);
* ''Federalism and the Charter: Leading Constitutional Decisions'' (published in 1989, co-edited by Russell, [[F.L. Morton]] and [[Rainer Knopff]]);
* ''The Court and the Charter: Leading Cases'' (published in 2008, co-edited by Russell, Morton, Knopff, Thomas Bateman and [[Janet Hiebert]]); and
* ''The Court and the Constitution: Leading Cases'' (published in 2008, co-edited by Russell, Morton, Knopff, Bateman and Hiebert).

Decisions in leading cases in [[Canada]] have usually been made by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. Prior to the abolition of appeals of Supreme Court decisions in the 1940s, most landmark decisions were made by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in [[London]].

== Landmark decisions in New Zealand ==
{{Main|List of cases of the Supreme Court of New Zealand|List of Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases}}
Decisions in leading cases in [[New Zealand]] were made by the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]] before the establishment of the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]], although historically some have been made by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in [[London]].

* In 1976, the Wellington Supreme Court in ''[[Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others]]'' held that Prime Minister Robert Muldoon had purported to suspend laws in a manner contrary to the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].
* In 1987, the Court of Appeal in ''[[New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General]]'' recognised the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.

== Landmark decisions in the United Kingdom ==
{{Main|List of House of Lords cases}}
Decisions in leading cases in the [[United Kingdom]] have usually been made by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], or more recently the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]; in Scotland by the [[Court of Session]] or [[High Court of Justiciary]]; in England and Wales by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] or the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]]. Some twentieth century examples involved contributions from the late [[Lord Denning]].

*''[[Darcy v Allein]]'' [[case citation|[1603] 77 Eng. Rep. 1260]] ([[King’s Bench]]): (most widely known as ''The Case of Monopolies''): establishing that it was improper for any individual to be allowed to have a [[monopoly]] over a trade.
*The ''[[Case of Prohibitions]]'' (1607) ([[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]])
*''[[Bushel's Case]]'' (1670) (Court of Common Pleas): establishing the principle that a [[judge]] cannot coerce a [[jury]] to convict.
*''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' [1765] 19 Howell's State Trials 1030: establishing the [[civil liberties]] of individuals and limiting the scope of [[executive power]].

*''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co. Ltd.]]'' [1915] A.C. 847: confirming [[Privity in English law|privity of contract]]: only a party to a contract can be sued on it. (This principle was later reformed by statute.)
*''[[A-G v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd]]'' [1920] AC 508: establishing that [[the Crown]] has no right under the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to take possession of an owner's land in connection with the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|defence of the realm]] without paying compensation, and that a statute in force may prevail to regulate the exercise of an existing prerogative power.
*''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] S.C.(H.L.) 31: [[Lord Atkin]] established the "[[neighbour principle]]" as the foundation of the modern [[Scots delict]] ([[English tort]]) of [[negligence]]. This case used a wide ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', which was held later as ''[[obiter]]'', but still established the ''[[law of tort]]''.
*''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] K.B. 130: establishing the doctrine of [[promissory estoppel]].
*''[[Wednesbury unreasonableness|Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation]]'' [1948] 1 KB 223: establishing the concept of [[Wednesbury unreasonableness]] for [[judicial review]].

*''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1969] 1 QB 439: a leading case illustrating the requirement for [[concurrence]] of ''[[actus reus]]'' ([[Latin]] for "guilty act") and ''[[mens rea]]'' (Latin for "guilty mind") in order to establish a criminal offence.
*''[[Ramsay v IRC]]'' [1982] A. C. 300: establishing a doctrine that ignores for tax purposes the purported effect of a pre-ordained series of transactions into which there are inserted steps that have no commercial purpose apart from the avoidance of a liability to tax.

{{Further|List of landmark court decisions in the United States}}

Landmark cases in the United States come most frequently (but not exclusively) from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. [[United States court of appeals|United States Courts of Appeals]] may also make such decisions, particularly if the Supreme Court chooses not to review the case, or adopts the holding of the court below. Although many cases from [[state supreme court]]s are significant in developing the law of that state, only a few are so revolutionary that they announce standards that many other state courts then choose to follow.

Representatives of [[Ukraine]], the [[Russian Federation]], the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] (DPR), and the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] (LPR) signed the '''Minsk Protocol''', an agreement to halt the [[War in Donbass|war in the Donbass region]] of Ukraine, on 5 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctv-america.com/2014/09/05/ukraine-ceasefire-agreement-signed-in-minsk|title=Ukraine ceasefire agreement signed in Minsk|work=CCTV America|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSCE5SEPT"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/cio/123245 | title=Chairperson-in-Office welcomes Minsk agreement, assures President Poroshenko of OSCE support | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=5 September 2014 | accessdate=1 October 2014 | location=Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSCE15sept"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/123591 | title=OSCE Chief Monitor in Ukraine urges all sides to allow monitors to carry out duties safely | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=15 September 2014 | accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed after extensive talks in [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]], under the auspices of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). The agreement, which followed multiple previous attempts to stop the fighting in the [[Donbass]], implemented an immediate [[ceasefire]]. It failed to stop fighting in Donbass.&lt;ref name=SKYNAEMP/&gt;

==Minsk process and drafting==
The agreement was drawn-up by the [[Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine]], which consisted of representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and the OSCE.&lt;ref name="2OSCESEPT"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/home/123124 | title=Press statement by the Trilateral Contact Group | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=2 September 2014 | accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was established in June as a way to facilitate dialogue and resolution of the strife across eastern and southern Ukraine. Meetings of the group, along with informal representatives of the breakaway [[Donetsk People's Republic|Donetsk]] and [[Lugansk People's Republic|Lugansk]] People's Republics, took place on 31 July, 26 August, 1 September, and 5&amp;nbsp;September. The details of the agreement, signed on 5 September, largely resembled Ukrainian president [[Petro Poroshenko]]'s 20 June "[[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine#Fifteen-point peace plan|fifteen-point peace plan]]". The following representatives signed the document:&lt;ref name="5OSCE2014"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/ru/home/123258?download=true | title=Minsk Protocol | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=5 September 2014 | accessdate=9 September 2014 | language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Former president of Ukraine and Ukrainian representative [[Leonid Kuchma]]
*Russian Ambassador to Ukraine and Russian representative [[Mikhail Zurabov]]
*DPR and LPR leaders [[Alexander Zakharchenko]] and [[Igor Plotnitsky]]

==Protocol==
The text of the protocol consists of twelve points:&lt;ref name="5OSCE2014"/&gt;
# To ensure an immediate bilateral ceasefire.
# To ensure the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire by the OSCE .
# Decentralisation of power, including through the adoption of the Ukrainian law "On temporary Order of Local Self-Governance in Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts".

==Follow-up memorandum==
In the two weeks after the Minsk Protocol was signed, there were frequent violations of the ceasefire by both parties to the conflict.&lt;ref name="BBC19SEPT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29290246 | title=Ukraine deal with pro-Russian rebels at Minsk talks | publisher=BBC News | date=19 September 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC19SEPT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukrainian-peace-talks-lead-to-buffer-zone-deal-1.2772573 | title=Ukrainian peace talks lead to buffer zone deal | publisher=CBC News | date=19 September 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks continued in Minsk, and a follow-up to the Minsk Protocol was agreed to on 19 September 2014. This memorandum clarified the implementation of the Protocol. Amongst some of the peacemaking measures agreed to were:&lt;ref name="BBC19SEPT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20SEPT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29299092 | title=Nato top general says truce 'in name only' | publisher=BBC News | date=20 September 2014 | accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSCE23SEPT"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/ru/home/123807?download=true | title=Memorandum of 19 September 2014 outlining the parameters for the implementation of commitments of the Minsk Protocol | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=19 September 2014 | accessdate=23 September 2014 | language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
After the follow-up memorandum, the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]] broke out, and both parties continued to accuse each other of ceasefire violations.&lt;ref name=SKYNAEMP&gt;[http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/mideast/2014/10/23/ukraine-rebels-vow-to-take-back-cities.html Ukraine rebels vow to take back cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023221330/http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/mideast/2014/10/23/ukraine-rebels-vow-to-take-back-cities.html |date=23 October 2014 }}, [[Sky News Australia]] (23 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In late October, DPR prime minister and Minsk Protocol signatory [[Alexander Zakharchenko]] said that his forces would retake the territory it had lost to Ukrainian forces during a [[War in Donbass#Post-ceasefire government offensive|July 2014 offensive]], and that DPR forces would be willing to wage "heavy battles" to do so.&lt;ref name=SKYNAEMP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/230346.html Poroshenko vows Kyiv will recapture militants-controlled areas], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (23 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Zakharchenko said that he had been misquoted, and that he had meant to say that these areas would be taken through "peaceful means".&lt;ref name="BBC24OCT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29755967 | title=Ukraine vote could push the country into chaos | publisher=BBC News | date=24 October 2014 | accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While campaigning in the lead-up to the [[Donbass parliamentary elections, 2014|2 November elections]] held by the DPR and LPR in violation of the Protocol, Zakharchenko said "These are historical times. We are creating a new country! It's an insane goal".&lt;ref name="Financial Times ZCI"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5c07e26c-59f4-11e4-9787-00144feab7de.html#slide0 Donetsk People’s Republic campaign reveals shambolic tendencies], ''[[Financial Times]]'' (23 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; OSCE chairman [[Didier Burkhalter]] confirmed that the elections ran "counter to the letter and spirit of the Minsk Protocol", and said that they would "further complicate its implementation".&lt;ref name="OSCE31OCT"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/cio/126242 | title=So-called elections not in line with Minsk Protocol, says OSCE Chair, calling for enhanced efforts and dialogue to implement all commitments | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=31 October 2014 | accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on 5 December, Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said that the [[Donbass general elections, 2014|2 November DPR and LPR elections]] were "exactly within the range in which they had been negotiated in Minsk", and that the Ukrainian parliament was supposed to pass an amnesty bill for DPR and LPR leaders after the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014|Ukrainian parliamentary election in late October]].&lt;ref name=Lav51214/&gt; According to Lavrov, closer monitoring of the [[Russo-Ukrainian border]], as specified by the Minsk Protocol, could only take place after such an amnesty law was approved.&lt;ref name=Lav51214&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/238216.html Too early to discuss broader monitoring of Ukraine-Russia border - Lavrov], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (5 December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that he thought that a Ukrainian presidential decree banning prosecution of Donbass separatist combatants was issued on 16 September, but said that "a bill has now been filed proposing to overturn" the decree.&lt;ref name=Lav51214/&gt;

By January 2015, the Minsk Protocol ceasefire had completely collapsed.&lt;ref name="GD21JAN"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/21/russia-ukraine-war-fighting-east | title=Ukraine forces admit loss of Donetsk airport to rebels | work=The Guardian | date=21 January 2015 | accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport|separatist victory]] at [[Donetsk International Airport]] in defiance of the Protocol, DPR spokesman [[Eduard Basurin]] said that "the Minsk Memorandum will not be considered in the form it was adopted".&lt;ref name="TASS23JAN"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://itar-tass.com/en/world/773095 | title=Ukraine suffers considerable losses – DPR Defense Ministry | work=Tass Russian News Agency | date=23 January 2015 | accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the DPR "will not make any attempts at ceasefire talks any more", and that his forces were going to "attack right up to the borders of Donetsk region".&lt;ref name="BBC23JAN"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30949527 | title=Ukraine rebel Zakharchenko 'rejects truce talks' | publisher=BBC News | date=23 January 2015 | accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' said that the ceasefire had "all but vanished".&lt;ref name="NYTJAN2015"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/world/europe/ukraine-violence.html | title=War Is Exploding Anew in Ukraine; Rebels Vow More | work=The New York Times | date=23 January 2015 | accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst increasing violence in the combat zone, another round of Minsk talks was scheduled for 31 January.&lt;ref name="OSCE1FEB"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/cio/138331 | title=Statement by the Chairmanship on the Trilateral Contact Group consultations in Minsk on 31 January 2015 | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=1 February 2015 | accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine|Trilateral Contact Group]] travelled to Minsk to meet representatives of the DPR and LPR. The DPR and LPR signatories of the Protocol did not attend, and those representatives that did attend were not able to discuss the implementation of the Protocol or memorandum. These representatives asked for the revision of the Protocol and the memorandum. The meeting was adjourned with no result.&lt;ref name="OSCE1FEB" /&gt;

A new package of measures meant to stop fighting in the Donbass, called "[[Minsk II]]", was agreed to on 12 February 2015.&lt;ref name="BBC12FEB"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31435812 | title=Ukraine crisis: Leaders agree peace roadmap | work=BBC News | date=12 February 2015 | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act''' was passed by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in December 2015 as part of the [[Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act]] to provide an incentive to bring to light safety-related problems.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2015-title49/USCODE-2015-title49-subtitleVI-partA-chap301-subchapIV-sec30172|title=49 U.S.C. 30172 - Whistleblower incentives and protections|website=www.gpo.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program allows industry insiders to report on violations of federal vehicle-safety laws and receive 10% to 30% of monetary sanctions over $1 million that the government imposes based on that information.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/05/12/auto-whistle-blower-law-help-keep-public-safe/84020634/|title=Auto whistle-blower law will help keep public safe|last=Lamprey|first=Wayne|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Republican Senator [[John Thune]] of [[South Dakota]] and Democratic Senator [[Bill Nelson]] of [[Florida]] cosponsored the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act in response to several high-profile auto safety scandals. The [[whistleblower]] program was designed to protect the public by providing an incentive for insiders working at auto manufacturers, vehicle part suppliers or dealerships to assist the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] (DOT) and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) by bringing to the Government's attention information about violations of vehicle-safety laws that are likely to cause unreasonable risk of death or serious physical injury. Whistleblowers are eligible for rewards under the Act if the information they bring forward contributes to the Government's success in an enforcement or related legal action. Awards are based on the value of a whistleblower's information and the extent of assistance provided.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The program works in concert with existing federal law to protect whistleblowers from unlawful employer retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whistleblowers.gov/statutes/map21|title=Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) {{!}} Whistleblower Protection Program|website=www.whistleblowers.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also allows whistleblowers to keep their identities confidential when reporting violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/308900-celebrating-motor-vehicle-safety-whistleblower-acts-first|title=Celebrating Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act's first anniversary|last=Yampolsky|first=Ari|date=2016-12-06|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A whistleblower does not have to be a U.S. citizen or resident to qualify for an award, and violations he or she reports on don't have to occur in the U.S. so long as some of the vehicles, or parts, at issue are distributed in the U.S. market.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Examples of safety violations for which whistleblowers can receive an award ==
The program applies broadly to safety-related vehicle and vehicle-equipment defects, including failures to notify the government of such defects. Examples of previous safety-related violations for which a whistleblower could have received an award under the program if he or she brought it to light include: [[Takata Corporation|Takata]]'s [[airbag]] ruptures, [[General Motors|GM's]] [[ignition switch]] defects, [[Toyota]]'s "sticky" pedals that caused unintended acceleration, and the Early Warning Reporting (EWR) failures that affected [[Fiat]], [[Chrysler]], [[Honda]], [[Ferrari]], Triumph, and [[Forest River (company)|Forest River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constantinecannon.com/practice/whistleblower/whistleblower-types/auto-safety/|title=Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Full citizens are descendants of residents who lived in Burma prior to 1823 or were born to parents who were citizens at the time of birth.
* Associate citizens are those who acquired citizenship through the 1948 Union Citizenship Law.
* Naturalized citizens are those who lived in Burma before 4 January 1948 and applied for citizenship after 1982.

==Dual citizenship==
Dual citizenship is not recognised by Myanmar. Naturalization in another country immediately voids Myanmar citizenship.

Foreigners cannot become naturalised citizens of Myanmar, unless they can prove a close familial connection to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tmqQWxLxU30J:www.ehow.com/about_6542313_myanmar-immigration-policies.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=Myanmar Immigration Policies|work=eHow|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board oversees the development of the Authority's budget and program plan, and the processes, policies and procedures in which staff are to perform their duties in their efforts to fulfill NYSERDA's mission, and in the public's interest. The Commissioners of the Departments of [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|Environmental Conservation]] and [[New York State Department of Transportation|Transportation]] and the Chairs of the [[New York Power Authority]] and [[New York State Public Service Commission]] serve ex officio. Additional members must include: research scientist(s), economist(s), not-for-profit environmentalist(s), member(s) of a not-for-profit consumer group, officer(s) of a utility primarily engaged in the distribution of gas, officer(s) of an electric utility, and three public members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/pdfs/Governance/NYSERDAOrgChartnew.pdf Board of Directors.] Retrieved 14 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Authority had operating expenses of $119.76 million, an outstanding debt of $2.654 billion, and a staffing level of 326 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abo.ny.gov/reports/annualreports/ABO2018AnnualReport.pdf|title=NYSABO 2018 Report|pp=16,29,44|date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and funding to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

===Emerging Authority===
During the energy crisis of the 1970s, oil embargoes made the United States acutely aware that the world's petroleum supplies were finite. NYSERDA's earliest efforts focused solely on research and development of renewable energy technologies with the goal of reducing New York State's petroleum consumption. NYSERDA was created as a public benefit corporation in 1975 under Article 8, [http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Files/About/NYSERDA-Act.pdf Title 9] and [http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Files/About/GJGNY-Act-2009.pdf Title 9A] of the State Public Authorities Law through the reconstitution of the New York State Atomic and Space Development Authority. In the 1980s, lines disappeared at gas stations but concerns about energy's impact on the environment would continue. Separate from NYSERDA during that time, the New York State Energy Office handled energy policy analysis and energy efficiency audits. Funding was derived primarily from federal grants and monies distributed via the Petroleum Overcharge Restitution Fund.

When the Energy Office was closed in 1995, NYSERDA took on critical energy efficiency, energy assessments, energy planning, and policy analysis functions. The national recession in the 1990s emphasized the need to help New York State residents and businesses increase energy efficiency in order to save money. Simultaneous global events highlighted the need for energy security and less reliance on foreign sources of oil, and signaled a renewed need for increased focus on protecting the environment.

===In Transition===
NYSERDA's funding structure changed in 1998 when the New York State Public Service Commission approved the ratepayer-supported System Benefits Charge ([http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/58290EDB9AE5A89085257687006F38D1?OpenDocument SBC]) Program and designated NYSERDA as the program's administrator. The SBC is collected by investor-owned utilities from gas and electric customers in the State, and funds the majority of NYSERDA's programs. The Public Service Commission also established in 1998 the nationally-recognized, long-running New York Energy $mart Program to continue public benefit research and development, energy services, and environmental programs that may not have otherwise happened as New York State moved to a competitive electric utility industry.

In the new millennium, NYSERDA became involved in green buildings while new kinds of energy crises made headlines. In 2000 and 2001, California's electricity crisis, rolling blackouts, and energy market manipulations in 2000 and 2001 highlighted how dependent the nation was on the electric grid. The 2002 New York State Energy Plan then noted possible consequences of New York State's heavy dependence on fossil fuel, which is largely imported from abroad or out-of-state. In response, NYSERDA took steps toward a proactive approach for New York State's energy future.

===Leading Change===
As renewable energy was becoming popular in other parts of the country, New York State wanted to make it attractive to the State's residents and businesses. Between 2004 and 2008, the Public Service Commission approved two new programs related to funding renewable energy and energy efficiency as NYSERDA pursued a market-driven approach to doing business including creating effective partnerships among private industry, government, and academia that benefit all New Yorkers. In 2004, the [http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Energy-Data-and-Prices-Planning-and-Policy/Program-Planning/Renewable-Portfolio-Standard.aspx Renewable Portfolio Standard] (RPS) was established with the goal of increasing the proportion of renewable energy used by New Yorkers. In 2008, the [http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/06F2FEE55575BD8A852576E4006F9AF7?OpenDocument Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard](EEPS) was created with a specific directive: reduce electricity usage in New York.

New York State also took pioneering steps in 2008 to address greenhouse gas emissions related to energy. New York became a charter member of a cooperative effort by nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states called the [http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Energy-and-the-Environment/Environmental-Research/Climate-Change/Policy/Existing-Regional-Initiatives/Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative.aspx Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative] (RGGI). RGGI is the first mandatory, market-based effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Proceeds from auction and trading of carbon dioxide allowances help fund some of NYSERDA's programs.

As the national economy began a downturn in 2008, New Yorkers struggled too. NYSERDA worked toward sustainability goals, supporting the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Frontier Research Centers Program and focusing on the 4 E's: energy, environment, economy, and education.

===Establishing a Clean Energy Economy===
[[File:NYSERDA Malta.jpg|thumb|NYSERDA Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP), [[Malta, New York]]]]
By 2010, NYSERDA programs focused on reducing energy use, increasing energy efficiency, creating jobs, "creating public-private partnerships to stimulate entrepreneurial spirit", and "preparing tomorrow's workforce to excel in the clean energy economy".{{cn|date=December 2017}} To reinforce this focus, the Public Service Commission approved funding for the Technology and Market Development Program in 2011. 

In 2014, NY Green Bank, a state-sponsored, specialized financial entity and a division of NYSERDA, opened for business to increase private investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, which have had difficulty accessing financing. Announced by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo in his 2013 State of the State address, the development of a [[Green Bank (financial institution)|Green Bank]] in New York aimed at facilitating more reliable, more efficient energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

The Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP) is a 280-acre site in Malta, New York focused on clean energy. The site is approved for 1.25 million square feet of office, research and development, and light manufacturing, along with 77% green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP®)|url=https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Partners-and-Investors/Saratoga-Technology-and-Energy-Park|website=NYSERDA|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:List of causes set down for trail in the Circuit Court of Mercer County, at September term, 1807.png|thumb|right|July 4, 1807 notice to persons for September circuit court session, [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania]]]]
'''Notice''' is the legal concept describing a requirement that a [[party (law)|party]] be aware of [[legal process]] affecting their rights, obligations or duties. There are several types of notice: [[public notice]] (or legal notice), [[actual notice]], [[constructive notice]], and [[implied notice]].

==Service of process==
At [[common law]], notice is the fundamental principle in [[service of process]]. In this case, the service of process puts the [[defendant]] "on notice" of the [[allegation]]s contained within the [[complaint]], or other such [[pleading]].  Since notice is fundamental, a court may rule a [[pleading]] defective if it does not put the defendant on notice.

In a [[civil action|civil case]], personal jurisdiction over a defendant is obtained by service of a [[summons]]. [[Service of process|Service]] can be accomplished by personal delivery of the summons or subpoena to the person or an authorized agent of the person.  Service may also be made by substituted means; for example, in many jurisdictions, service of a summons can be made on a person of suitable age and discretion at the residence or place of business of the defendant. Jurisdiction over corporations can often be obtained through a government body authorized to receive such process.

==Due process issues (United States)==
In the [[United States]], the right to receive notice before the government deprives an individual of a protected interest is guaranteed, along with the opportunity to be heard, by the [[Due Process Clause]]s in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] amendments.  The [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] also specifically guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to be notified of the charges and their grounds.

If a court bases [[personal jurisdiction]] over an out-of-state or foreign defendant on a [[long-arm statute]], the court must carefully select a means of notifying the defendant, to comply with the notice requirement of due process.  Sometimes this is done by serving agents of the defendant located within the state. Because out-of-state defendants can't always be located easily, some state or local laws may allow for service by publication. An example of this would be printing a notice of the lawsuit in a newspaper published where the defendant is believed to reside.  Because the failure of a defendant to appear in court results in a [[default (law)|default judgment]] against him, such measures must be sufficiently calculated to give actual notice to the defendant to satisfy due process. 

In ''[[Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.]]'', the core case setting forth constitutional notice requirements, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] held that notice must be "reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections." Moreover, defendants must be notified by the "best practical means" available.

==Notice and knowledge==
Many [[statutes]] include that the accused ''knowingly'' have acted in violation. When a party is "put on notice" that they are in violation, continued action in violation may be sufficient to evidence knowledge.

The '''Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography''' is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and requires parties to prohibit the [[trafficking of children|sale of children]], [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution]] and [[child pornography]].

The Protocol was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2000&lt;ref name="UN_ARES54263"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-54-263 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=54 |resolution_number=263 |date=25 March 2000|title=Optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered into force on 18 January 2002.&lt;ref name=Protocol2&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection: [http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?mtdsg_no=IV-11-c&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography]. Retrieved on 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, 175 states are party to the protocol and another nine states have signed but not ratified it.&lt;ref name=Protocol2/&gt;

According to the preamble, the protocol is intended to achieve the purposes of certain articles in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, where the rights are defined with the provision that parties should take "appropriate measures" to protect them. Article 1 of the protocol requires parties to protect the rights and interests of [[trafficking of children|child victims of trafficking]], child prostitution and child pornography, [[child labour]] and especially the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999|worst forms of child labour]].

The remaining articles in the protocol outline the standards for international law enforcement covering diverse issues such as jurisdictional factors, extradition, mutual assistance in investigations, criminal or extradition proceedings and seizure and confiscation of assets as well.

It also obliges parties to pass laws within their own territories against these practices "punishable by appropriate penalties that take into account their grave nature."

==Definitions==
The Protocol requires parties to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Article 2 defines the prohibition:
*'''Sale of children''' –  Any act or transaction whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons to another for remuneration or any other consideration.
*'''Child prostitution''' – Use of a child in sexual activities for remuneration or any other form of consideration.
*'''Child pornography''' – Any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes.

The Convention generally defines a child as any human being under the age of 18, unless an earlier age of majority is recognized by a country's law.

==Signatories and reservations==

===Qatar===
[[Qatar]] added in its signing statement that it was "subject to a general reservation regarding any provisions in the protocol that are in conflict with the [[Shariah Law|Islamic Shariah]]."&lt;ref name="opstatus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography - Status|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;id=136&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objections to this reservation were registered in the signing statements by [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]] and [[Sweden]]. Qatar withdrew the reservation on 18 June 2008, and currently has no reservations to the Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11-c&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|work=un.org|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[Sweden]] has clarified its interpretation of child pornography as applying only to the visual representation of sexual acts with a child or minor persons, and not applying to adults acting, posing, or dressing, as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-54-PV.97 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbotim Report |session=54 |meeting=97 |page=4 |anchor=pg004-bk02 |date=25 May 2000 |speakername=Mr. Hedman | speakernation=Sweden |accessdate=2008-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">'''Pereira accounting''' is one of the two manners in California [[community property]] law that explains how to deal with community funds and/or labor used to enhance the value of [[separate property]]. The method is named after a 1909 divorce case, ''Pereira v. Pereira''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Pereira v. Pereira |vol=103 |reporter=P. |opinion=488 |pinpoint= |court=Cal. |date=1909 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3303139/pereira-v-pereira/ |accessdate=2018-01-09 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate, courts will add the original principal amount of the business which is separate property to a reasonable rate of return expected from the nature of that business. The result is considered separate property. The remaining amount of the business is considered part of the community. This method is preferred when the management of the spouse was the primary cause of the growth or productivity of the business. In the case where the character of the business is the main reason for its growth and production, [[Van camp accounting]] should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first=David V. |last=Hanzich |title=Pereira/Van Camp: Applying "Old School Law" to Today's Economic Paradigm |publisher=Orange Cnty. Bar Ass'n |url=http://www.ocbar.org/AllNews/NewsView/tabid/66/ArticleId/1245/April-2014-Pereira-Van-Camp-Applying-Old-School-Law-to-Today-s-Economic-Paradigm.aspx |pin= |date=April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereira is used when the appreciation of the business is due to the skills, efforts or talents of the spouse who is working in the business. In that case, the separate property is awarded the initial investment plus a reasonable interest rate, as if the capital had been invested. The remainder of the profits are community property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first= |last= |title=Answers to Winter 2014 California Bar Exam Questions |publisher=Writing Edge |url=http://www.writingedge.com/california_bar_exam_q2.html |pin= |date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical businesses that would be considered for Pereira accounting: single person professions or very small businesses such as sole proprietorships, or businesses where the efforts of the owner-spouse comprise more than 50% of the labor to grow the company's value.

== Choosing the correct apportionment or accounting method == 
'''Pereira accounting''' is typically chosen when the business was spousal labor-intensive (typically smaller and/or labor-intensive businesses).

'''[[Van Camp accounting]]''' is typically chosen when the Business itself or economic factors produced the profits (typically larger and generally more capital intensive businesses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first=Thurman W. |last=Arnold III |title=How Are BUSINESSES Owned Before Marriage DIVIDED In Divorce? |publisher=Law Firm of Thurman W.

'''''Primal Fear''''' is a 1996 American [[neo-noir]] [[Crime film|crime]]-[[thriller film]], based on [[William Diehl]]'s 1993 novel of the [[Primal Fear (novel)|same name]] and directed by [[Gregory Hoblit]].

The film tells the story of a Chicago defense attorney who believes that his altar boy client is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop.

''Primal Fear'' was a box office success and earned mostly positive reviews, with [[Edward Norton]] making a strong showing in his film debut. He was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenglobes.com/film/primal-fear Golden Globe Awards for 'Primal Fear'] Retrieved 2017-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Martin Vail ([[Richard Gere]]) is a [[Chicago]] defense attorney who loves the spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler ([[Edward Norton]]), a 19-year-old [[Altar server|altar boy]] from [[Kentucky]] with a severe [[Stuttering|stutter]], who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved [[Archbishop]] Rushman ([[Stanley Anderson]]). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man, [[pro bono]].

During his meetings at the County jail with Stampler, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the [[prosecutor]] (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable ([[Laura Linney]]).

As the trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt [[state's attorney]] John Shaughnessy ([[John Mahoney]]), have recently lost millions of dollars in [[real estate]] investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church-owned lands. The Archbishop secretly received numerous death threats as a result. Following a tip from a former altar boy about a videotape involving Stampler, Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a [[VHS]] tape shot by Rushman which shows Stampler being forced to have sex with another teenage altar boy and a teenage girl named Linda Forbes. Vail is now in a dilemma: introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury; but it would also give him a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish.

When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent, foul-mouthed  [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] who calls himself "Roy" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop in which 'Roy' assaults and slightly wounds Vail. When this incident is over, Stampler once again becomes passive and shy, and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch - what he calls having "lost time." Molly Arrington ([[Frances McDormand]]), the [[psychiatrist]] examining Stampler and who witnessed the entire event, is convinced that he has [[dissociative identity disorder]] caused by years of [[child abuse|abuse]] at the hands of his father which resurfaced following the sexual abuse that Stamper received by Rushman. Vail does not want to hear this, because he knows that he cannot enter an [[Insanity defense|insanity plea]] during an ongoing trial.

Vail slowly sets up a confrontation in court by dropping hints about the Archbishop's [[abuse of power|abusive tendencies]], as well as Stampler's multiple personalities. He also has the sex tape delivered to Venable, knowing she will realize who sent it—since she is under intense pressure from both Shaughnessy and her boss Bud Yancy ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) to deliver a guilty verdict at any cost—will use it as proof of motive.

At the climax, Vail puts Stampler on the witness stand and gently questions him about the sexual abuse he suffered at the pedophile Archbishop's hands. After Venable questions him harshly during cross-examination, Stampler turns into "Roy" in open court and attacks her, threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. He is subdued by courthouse marshals and rushed back to his holding cell. The judge dismisses the jury in favor of a [[bench trial]] and then finds Stampler [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]], remanding him to a maximum security [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]]. Venable is fired for losing the case and allowing the Archbishop's crimes, which Shaughnessey, the mayor, the Catholic Church and the entire city council, had been trying to hide for the past ten years, to come to public light.

In the final scene, Vail visits Stampler in his cell to tell him of the dismissal. Stampler says he recalls nothing of what happened in the courtroom, having again "lost time". Just as Vail is leaving, Stampler asks him to "tell Miss Venable I hope her neck is okay", which he could not have been able to remember if he had "lost time". When Vail confronts him, Stampler reveals that he had [[Feigned madness|faked multiple personality disorder]]. No longer stuttering, he brags about having murdered Archbishop Rushman, as well as Linda. When Vail says "There never was a Roy", Stampler replies, "There never was an ''Aaron'', counselor"; revealing that Stampler never made up his persona 'Roy', but he actually made up his persona of 'Aaron' to play on his lawyer's sympathies. Stunned and disillusioned at how he was so easily fooled and manipulated by his own client, Vail walks away and leaves the courthouse as the murderous, but perfectly sane, Stampler taunts him from his cell.

==Reception==
''Primal Fear'' received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives it a 74% positive rating based on reviews from 43 critics, with an average score of 6.7 out of 10. The site's consensus states "A straightforward, entertaining thriller with a crackerjack performance by Edward Norton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1070992-primal_fear Primal Fear Movie Reviews, Pictures]. ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]''. Retrieved 2011-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Janet Maslin]], the film has a "good deal of surface charm", but "the story relies on an overload of tangential subplots to keep it looking busy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DEED81239F930A35757C0A960958260 | title= A Murdered Archbishop, Lawyers In Armani | date= April 3, 1996 | author= [[Janet Maslin]]| publisher= The New York Times | accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "the plot is as good as crime procedurals get, but the movie is really better than its plot because of the three-dimensional characters." Ebert awarded ''Primal Fear'' three-and-a-half stars out of a possible four, described Gere's performance as one of the best in his career, praised Linney for rising above what might have been a [[stock character]], and applauded Edward Norton for offering a "completely convincing" portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/primal-fear-1996 | title= Primal Fear 1996 | date= April 5, 1996 | author= [[Roger Ebert]]| publisher= Rogerebert.com | accessdate=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red Power movement''' was a social movement led by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youth to demand self-determination for Native Americans in the United States. Organizations that were part of Red Power Movement included [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) and [[National Indian Youth Council]] (NIYC).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/246350552|title=Red power : the Native Americans' fight for freedom|last=M.|first=Josephy, Alvin|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803276117|oclc=246350552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement sought the rights for Native Americans to make policies and programs for themselves while maintaining and controlling their own land and resources.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Red Power movement took a confrontational and civil disobedience approach to inciting change in United States to Native American affairs&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/909325616|title=Like a hurricane : the Native American movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee|last=Allen|first=Warrior, Robert|date=1996-01-01|publisher=New Press|isbn=9781565844025|oclc=909325616}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to using negotiations and settlements, which national Native American groups such as [[National Congress of American Indians]] had before.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Red Power centered around mass action, militant action, and unified action.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://redpowermedia.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/from-the-red-power-movement-to-idle-no-more/|title=From the Red Power Movement to Idle No More|last=Media|first=Red Power|last2=Staff|date=2014-01-03|website=RED POWER MEDIA|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''Red Power'''", attributed to the author [[Vine Deloria, Jr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vine Deloria Jr.|date=2018-06-29|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vine_Deloria_Jr.&amp;oldid=848033644|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly expressed a growing sense of pan-Indian identity in the late 1960s among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Events that were part of the movement include the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]], the [[Trail of Broken Treaties]], the [[Wounded Knee incident|Occupation of Wounded Knee]], along with intermittent protests and occupations throughout the era.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/alca/indian.html&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting impression of the Red Power movement was the resurrection of American Indian pride, action, and awareness.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Many bills and laws were also enacted in favor of American Indians in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most important being the reversal of tribe recognition termination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Background ==
From 1953 to 1964, the United States government terminated recognition of more than 100 tribes and bands as sovereign dependent nations with the [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108]]. This resolution stated that the tribes would be under US law and treated as American citizens instead of having the status as wards of the US.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0614.html|title=INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES. Vol. 6, Laws|last=Library|first=Oklahoma State University|website=digital.library.okstate.edu|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affected tribes were no longer protected by the government and stripped of their right to govern their own people.

[[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|The Relocation Act of 1956]] resulted in as many as 750,000 American Indians migrating to cities during the period from 1950-1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/indiancountry/history/relocate.html|title=Indian Country Diaries . History . 1950s Relocation Program {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act was implemented to encourage and provide support for American Indians to find jobs in cities and improve their lives from the poverty-ridden reservations. The government offered vocational training, housing, and financial support for those who chose to relocate. These promised amenities were often not provided or inadequately provided, resulting in American Indians distanced from their cultural lands and economically worse off than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=Melissa L.|last2=Whitbeck|first2=Les B.|title=The Intergenerational Effects of Relocation Policies on Indigenous Families|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0192513X12447178|journal=Journal of Family Issues|language=en|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1272–1293|doi=10.1177/0192513x12447178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Relocation and Termination era described above fueled the resistance of American Indians. The oldest recognized National American Indian group was [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI), established in 1944.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/163306494|title=Dictionary of American history / 10 Contributors, Learning Guide, and Index.|last=I.|first=Kutler, Stanley|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Scribner's Sons|isbn=0684805332|oclc=163306494}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCAI set a precedent by successfully being the first multi-tribal political organization run entirely by Indians. NCAI fought against voting discrimination, against the termination of [[Government-to-government|government to government]] relationship between the US and native tribes, and against US interference in tribal counsels. They aimed to close gaps between Indians who lived on reservations and those who had relocated to cities, elderly and Indian Youth, and different tribes from one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; NCAI was the main political organization that preceded the Red Power Movement.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

== Main organizations involved ==

=== [[American Indian Movement]] ===

At the forefront of the Red Power Movement was American Indian Movement(AIM), which was founded in 1968 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].  Its members belonged to and represented mainly urban Indian communities, and its leaders were young and militant.  Like the [[Black Panthers]] and [[Brown Berets]], AIM was initially organized to work for Indian civil rights in cities.  Its members monitored law enforcement practices, and worked to highlight and prevent police harassment and brutality.  AIM soon played a major role in building a network of [[urban Indian]] centers, churches and [[philanthropic organization]]s.  It helped establish the "[[powwow circuit]]," which publicized news of protest activities across the country.  Skillful in attracting attention from the news media, AIM inspired local chapters and writing about American Indian political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aimovement.org/ggc/history.html|title=A Brief Histry of AIM|website=www.aimovement.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[National Indian Youth Council]] ===

The National Indian Youth Council(NIYC) was founded in 1961 by young American Indians who were college students or recent college graduates.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/national-indian-youth-council|title=National Indian Youth Council - Dictionary definition of National Indian Youth Council {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the first militant Indian rights organizations following the conservative ways of the NCAI. NIYC were strong opponents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and got involved in many of the events in the Red Power Movement.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Like AIM, the council believed in and fought for the recognition of tribes federally and reinstating tribal governance.

=== [[Women of All Red Nations]] ===

Women of All Red Nations (WARN) emerged in 1974 from the main founders, [[Lorelei DeCora Means]], [[Madonna Thunder Hawk|Madonna Thunderhawk]], [[Phyllis Young]], [[Janet McCloud]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DreCFo6MrR8C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Red Power: The American Indians' Fight for Freedom|last=Josephy|first=Alvin M.|last2=Nagel|first2=Joane|last3=Johnson|first3=Troy R.|date=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803225873|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARN acted as a branch from AIM that focused on American Indian women's and family rights. Main issues that WARN fought against were the forced sterilization of Native women and the lack of adequate health services on the reservations.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://equalityarchive.com/issues/women-of-all-red-nations/|title=Women of All Red Nations {{!}} Equality Archive|date=2015-11-03|work=Equality Archive|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARN took action by becoming involved in Indian custody battles, protesting mining companies who were poisoning food and water sources, and collecting data on Indian women who had been sterilized without consent.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== [[International Indian Treaty Council]] ===

The International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) was founded in 1974 in Standing Rock, South Dakota. More than 98 Indigenous tribes were represented by over 5000 people at this first gathering. IITC grew into a voice for Indians internationally—covering North, Central, and South America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iitc.org/about-iitc/|title=About IITC / Acerca de CITI - iitc.org|website=www.iitc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; IITC focuses on the pursuit of sovereignty and self-determination for indigenous peoples through activism, training, and unified gatherings. As the first indigenous organization to be granted Consultive Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1977, IITC was able to represent the concerns and fight for the acknowledgement of indigenous rights to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimovement.org/iitc/|title=International Indian Treaty Council &amp; AIM Speakers Bureau|website=www.aimovement.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
From 1969 to the [[Longest Walk of 1978]], the Red Power Movement highlighted issues through social protest.  Its goals were for the federal government to honor treaty obligations and provide financial "resources, education, housing and healthcare to alleviate poverty."&lt;ref name="Alcatraz Is Not an Island"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/activism.html "Alcatraz Is Not an Island"], ''Indian Activism'', pbs.org, accessed 10 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The RPM wanted to gain Indian participation in social institutions; it was instrumental in supporting the founding of Indian colleges, as well as the creation of [[Indian studies]] programs at existing institutions, and the establishment of museums and cultural centers to celebrate Indian contributions.

The 1960s marked the beginning of a "[[Native American Renaissance]]" in literature.  New books such as [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]]'s ''[[Custer Died for Your Sins]]'' (1969) and the classic ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'' (1961), reprinted from the 1930s, reached millions of readers inside and outside Indian communities.  A wide variety of [[Native American writers|Indian writers]], [[Native American historians|historian]]s, and [[essayists]] gained publication following these successes and new authors were widely read.  [[N. Scott Momaday]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for one of his novels and [[Leslie Silko]] received acclaim.  Fiction and nonfiction works about Indian life and lore have continued to attract a large audience. Authors such as [[Louise Erdrich]] and [[Michael Dorris]] have earned continued recognition.  Since the late twentieth century, novels by [[Sherman Alexie]] have been adapted for film as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/223155553|title=Native American renaissance|last=Kenneth.|first=Lincoln,|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520054578|oclc=223155553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of Alcatraz  ===
The [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] began on November 20, 1969 when more than 80 young, mostly college aged American Indians, who identified themselves as [[United Indians of All Tribes|Indians of All Tribes (IAT)]]&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; boarded boats to approach and occupy [[Alcatraz Island]] overnight. The young American Indians settled with the legal backing of a [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Sioux Treaty]] that named any federal "out of use" land available for Indians. The US federal government had closed the Alcatraz federal prison and the island was no longer in use as of 1962. This treaty was used to send the message that treaties are still relevant and should be honored.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;  
[[File:Alcatraz Occupation "Welcome to Indian Land" graffiti.jpeg|thumb|352x352px|Sign in Alcatraz (1969)]]
The occupation had been planned ahead of time by [[Adam Nordwall]], a successful Indian businessman, and [[Richard Oakes (activist)|Richard Oakes]], a [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State]] student. The two agreed to and told sympathetic media outlets about their plan to take over Alcatraz at a dinner party hosted by ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reporter Tim Findley. They threatened that if there were any leaks of the story early, the plan to occupy Alcatraz would be called off.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Their first attempt, on November 9, 1969—the date the media had been told—resulted in circling the island in a boat with media coverage from all over the Bay Area. Although they did not begin the occupation that night, Oakes jumped off of the circling boat as others followed and swam to Alcatraz. After making it to Alcatraz, the young Indians were removed by Coast Guard that night but would be back in much larger numbers on November 20.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;{{Quote box

| quote = We feel that this so-called Alcatraz Island is more than suitable as an Indian Reservation, as determined by the white man's own standards. By this we mean that this place resembles most Indian reservations, in that:
1. It is isolated from modern facilities, and without adequate means of transportation.

2. It has no fresh running water.

3. The sanitation facilities are inadequate.

4. There are no oil or mineral rights.

5. There is no industry and so unemployment is very great.

6. There are no health care facilities.

7. The soil is rocky and non-productive and the land does not support game.

8. There are no educational facilities.

9. The population has always been held as prisoners and kept dependent upon others.

}}During the occupation, IAT released a statement called the [[Alcatraz Proclamation]] which explained that the Indians had the right to Alcatraz Island due to the right to discovery. The Proclamation continued onto describing the deserted prison island as comparable to the conditions of the Indian Reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=ALCATRAZ_Proclamation|title=ALCATRAZ Proclamation - FoundSF|website=www.foundsf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAT was also joined by National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) during the Alcatraz movement and the growing group of young, educated, and passionate American Indians made their presence known in the media.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Richard Oakes became the public figure for the occupation and participated in the press conferences for releases of documents such as the Alcatraz Proclamation and goals for the island which included building cultural centers, educational facilities, and recreational spaces for Indians to be together as Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Intelligent Channel|title=Richard Oakes delivering the Alcatraz Proclamation (1969) - from THE EDUCATION ARCHIVE|date=2013-03-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QNfUE7hBUc|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Occupation of Alcatraz ended after a series of disorienting events on the island. The January 1970 death of Richard Oakes' 13-year-old stepdaughter due to falling from a building brought Richard and his wife Anne back to the mainland.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Some of the student occupiers went back to school when the Oakes' left. A problem of drug and alcohol abuse also became prominent on the island, which affected the occupations reputation.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The remaining leaders were John Trudell, LaNada Means, and Stella Leach, who could not end up agreeing on a way to further develop the occupation. Electricity and water being cut off to the island by May, and a suspicious fire that burned three buildings were further factors that led to the dismantling of the occupation.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Protestors continued to depart from the island during the downward spiral. On June 11, 1971 a large amount of police officers used force to remove the remaining few protestors.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Although the protesters ultimately failed to achieve their specific goals, they helped catalyze  the Indian community.  With the occupation of Alcatraz, a participant said, "we got back our worth, our pride, our dignity, our humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2096434 |title=American Indian Ethnic Renewal: Politics and the Resurgence of Identity |first=Joane |last=Nagel |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=60 |number=6 |date=Dec 1995 |pages=947–965 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of D-Q University ===
With young, college aged students at the center of many Red Power movement protests, the pursuit of higher education, particularly for American Indians became a main initiative. In 1970, while the Alcatraz occupation was still occurring, a group of Indian youth took over US military surplus land near Davis, California. These youth had applied for the land but were denied access after [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] was granted access, regardless of UC Davis' legally incomplete application. In retaliation, the youth hopped the fences onto the property leading to the establishment and occupation of [[D–Q University|D-Q University]].&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AuOXYesYSn0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=DQ+university#v=onepage&amp;q=DQ%20university&amp;f=false|title=American Indian Activism: Alcatraz to the Longest Walk|last=Johnson|first=Troy R.|last2=Nagel|first2=Joane|last3=Champagne|first3=Duane|date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252066535|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Q University became the first tribal university that was established in California, and the first that was not affiliated with a single reservation. A deed was granted to the student occupation in April 1971.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Since then, D-Q University became part of the [[Tribal colleges and universities|Tribal Colleges and Universities]] and received accreditation in 1977. The curriculum of D-Q University included cultural and traditional focused education in order to educate Indians about Indians.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The university struggled to keep enrollment rates up and secure funding, which resulted in the ultimate loss of accreditation in 2005. However, the occupation that created D-Q University highlighted the importance of higher education for American Indians to the Red Power Movement.

=== Trail of Broken Treaties ===
[[File:Seal of the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs.svg|thumb|BIA seal]]
In August 1972, the Red Power movement continued under the direction of American Indian Movement(AIM) with the [[Trail of Broken Treaties|trail of broken treaties]]. The trail of broken treaties, a play on the "[[Trail of Tears]]," was the migration of seven caravans from areas across the west coast to the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.framingredpower.org/narrative/tbt/|title=Framing Red Power|last=Heppler|first=Jason A.|website=www.framingredpower.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIA had become widely associated with corruption and not acting in the best interest of the American Indians.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washingtonspark.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/native-americans-take-over-bureau-of-indian-affairs-1972/|title=Native Americans Take Over Bureau of Indian Affairs: 1972|date=2013-03-26|website=Washington Area Spark|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protestors started arriving in D.C. on November 1 with the intent of bringing a [[Twenty Points|list of twenty demands]] to the BIA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon arrival, the activists and GSA security had a misunderstanding about the activists being housed in the BIA building. This resulted in the activists overpowering the security and taking over the building. The American Indians then barricaded the doors, with furniture from the BIA they had broken apart, and the occupation began on November 2, 1972.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This occupation of the BIA had started the week before the presidential election, making a D.C. occupation the center of media attention. Threats of police force were used daily against the Indians if they did not come out. Supporters from outside of the occupation would come to the BIA to create a human barricade keeping the police from entering the occupied building.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On November 6, a judge had given an order for the occupiers to vacate the building before 6 pm that day or they would be forcibly evicted.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As the Indians braced for eviction, some exited the building to create a perimeter around it with clubs, spears and other weaponry to resist.  Others inside the building were rumored to have guns and explosives awaiting the invasion of GSA officials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The spokesman of the occupation, [[Russell Means|Russel Means]], spoke on the front stairs of the BIA explaining that the occupation would end when their demands had been met, and no time sooner. The deadline for the Indians to leave was pushed back yet again to November 8. Before this date, Indian lawyers had discovered evidence that would essentially abolish the BIA with exposure of corruption and misuse of the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On November 8, the protestors left the BIA building with paintings, artifacts, and $2 million worth of damage.

=== Wounded Knee ===
The [[Wounded Knee incident|Wounded Knee Incident]] started on February 27, 1973 and lasted 71 days. More than 200 Indians in support of the Oglala Sioux people of Pine Ridge Reservation took over the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota. The Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO), a group of mostly full-Indian women that lived on Pine Ridge Reservation had been unsuccessful in a trial to impeach Dick Wilson, who was the chairman of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OEzAiB8U6EC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Oglala+Sioux+Civil+Rights+Organization+(OSCRO)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rzJJ9pya80&amp;sig=T8lZELkugTlECAnYPEebKtE82EA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rOAJTsCJMsOssAKQnrSyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Oglala%20Sioux%20Civil%20Rights%20Organization%20(OSCRO)&amp;f=false|title=Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee|last=Reinhardt|first=Akim D.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=9780896726017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Wilson claimed he was too close to white people, too cozy with the government, and was disrespecting his Oglala Sioux culture.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/04/obituaries/richard-wilson-55-tribal-head-in-occupation-of-wounded-knee.html|title=Richard Wilson, 55, Tribal Head In Occupation of Wounded Knee|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|date=1990-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enraged that Wilson had not been impeached, OSCRO continued to gather and brainstorm a response. They decided to ask AIM for help in reacting to what they felt was an injustice. With AIM in the picture, occupying Wounded Knee was their final decision.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Wounded Knee was chosen as a tribute to the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] of 1890, where hundreds of Lakota Indians were killed by the 7th US Cavalry Regiment in reported efforts to disarm the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains {{!}} WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a historical remembrance of the massacre, the town had visitor trade posts dedicated to the grave sites of the Indians that many Indians thought were disrespectful and used for commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The owners of the trade posts would sell native Indian crafts for more than they had bought them and had a history of racism towards the local Indians. The occupiers attacked the trade posts first to accumulate the ammunitions and weaponry that were held there.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The occupation formed to deliver a message that American Indians would not sit around peacefully as treaties were broken, unfair trials were given, and their land was ceded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aics.org/WK/wk011.html|title=American Indian Movement Documents from MSU|last=Movement|first=Mike Wicks of American Indian|website=www.aics.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal agents gathered around Wounded Knee while the occupiers would host events for the media to cover in order to promote their message.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Throughout the occupation of Wounded Knee, the protestors and federal agents would often have shootouts at night. The Indians would be shooting from inside Wounded Knee and the federal agents from the outside perimeter they had formed.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/may-8-1973-standoff-at-wounded-knee-comes-to-an-end/comment-page-1/?_r=0|title=May 8, 1973 {{!}} Standoff at Wounded Knee Comes to an End|last=Network|first=The Learning|work=The Learning Network|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these shootouts, two Indians were killed and one federal agent was permanently paralyzed. The death of the second Indian, who was from the Pine Ridge Reservation and an Oglala Sioux, Buddy Lamont, led many Indians to seek an end to the violent occupation. On May 8, 1973 the American Indians surrendered to the surrounding federal agents after 10 weeks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Russell Means, one of the more recognized leaders of the AIM, negotiated with U.S. forces to release the hostages on the premises that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold hearings on the Indian treaties that were broken by the U.S. government as well as investigations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and its members' attention to the living conditions at Pine Ridge.

This event is not only significant because it was one of the first violent acts initiated first by the Natives, but it also led to generations of Indians getting involved in civil rights and tribal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landry|first1=Alysa|title=Wounded Knee is hailed as one of AIM's greatest successes|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/events/native-history-aim-occupation-of-wounded-knee-begins/|website=Indian Country Today|publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nixon administration]] had earlier declared that it had wanted to end the "revolutionary Indian element", but because so many Natives took notice and began to make changes in the local governments controlling their reservations, the administration failed to end their protests and stopped trying to interfere.

Russell Means and [[Dennis Banks]], the two AIM leaders mostly in charge of Wounded Knee II, were arrested immediately after the hostages were released. However, on September 16, 1973, the charges were dropped and they were dismissed on the account that the U.S. government had unlawfully influenced witnesses and tampered with evidence. The violence of these types of protests then continued through the rest of the 1970s.

== Legacy ==
The Red Power movement had accomplished many of its goals by the time direct social activism declined in the late 1970s. "By the early 1980s, over 100 Indian studies programs had been created in the United States. Tribal museums opened."&lt;ref name="Alcatraz Is Not an Island" /&gt; Among the most prominent of the cultural centers is the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (NMAI), which was sponsored by Hawaii's senator [[Daniel Inouye]] and authorized by the [[US Congress]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/alcatraz-occupation-four-decades-ago-led-to-many-benefits-for-american-indians/|title=Alcatraz Occupation Four Decades Ago Led to Many Benefits for American Indians - Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NMAI opened on [[National Mall|the Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]] in 2004. It also has a branch at the former US Customs House, on the Bowling Green in [[Lower Manhattan]].

Many laws were passed in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most notable being the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975|Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]] of 1975, which reversed the termination of federal tribe recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This act restored the recognition and government to government status to tribes, giving them control to govern their own tribes and reservations with funding provided by the government if they followed certain guidelines. Since the termination of Indian tribe recognition was a major catalyst to start the movement,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; regaining recognition was considered a huge success for RPM.

=== Laws passed in favor of American Indians during the Red Power movement ===
The following laws were passed during the movement:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''[[Indian Education Act]] of 1972''' provided additional funds to school districts with high populations of Indian children
* '''[[Indian Health Service]] budget doubled''' from 1970 to 1975, which provided funding for Indian hospitals and clinics.
* '''[[Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission]] (NWIFC)''' was established in 1975, as a result of fish-in protests. The NWIFC consists of members from 20 tribes who are recognized as natural resources co-managers with the State of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nwifc.org|title=Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission|website=Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''[[Indian Health Care Improvement Act]]''' of 1976 was passed by Congress to improve the health-care system for American Indians. This act includes scholarships for American Indians who are looking to pursue studies in medicine, dentistry, psychiatry, nursing and pharmacy. 
* '''[[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]]''' was passed in 1978 and terminated the outlaw of Indian religious practices such as sun dance, bear dance, and the use of sweat lodges.
* '''[[Branch of Acknowledgement and Research]] (BAR)''' was created by the BIA in 1978 to process applications from tribes for federal recognition. BAR was never federally approved, but still is in control of recognizing Indian tribes.
* '''[[Indian Child Welfare Act]]''' was passed by Congress in 1978. This act was in response to years of the BIA placing Indian children in boarding schools away from their reservations. It allows tribes to have some control over adoption and placement of Indian orphan children. 
* '''[[Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act]]'''  of 1978 authorized community colleges to exist on reservations

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4583">'''[[Pennsylvania]]''' approved a bill &lt;ref&gt;EERE News: [http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=8688 Pennsylvania Governor Approves Renewable Energy and Alt-Fuel Bills]&lt;/ref&gt; that establishes a $500 million fund to support '''[[renewable energy]]''' projects. Special Session [[House Bill]] 1 authorizes the [[Commonwealth Financing Authority]] to borrow $500 million, most of which will be split into six funding sources relating to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and renewable energy: $80 million in [[Grant (money)|grant]]s and [[loan]]s for [[solar energy]] projects; $100 million in grants, loans, and [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]]s for up to 35% of the cost of solar energy projects at residences and small businesses; $165 million in grants and loans for [[alternative energy]] projects, excluding solar energy, at businesses and local government facilities; $25 million for wind and geothermal energy projects; $40 million to help [[Startup company|start-up]] businesses involved in energy efficiency technologies; and $25 million in grants and loans to improve the energy efficiency of new and existing homes and small business buildings. An additional $65 million will go toward [[pollution control]] technologies and to help low-income families pay their energy bills.

In addition to the $500 million fund, the bill creates a Consumer Energy Program that is funded at $15 million for the next 3 fiscal years, then gradually decreases to $8 million by the 2015–2016 [[fiscal year]], for a total of $100 million. Of that, $92.5 million will support loans, grants, and rebates for up to 25% of the cost of energy efficiency improvements to homes and small businesses, while $5 million will support low-interest loans for energy efficiency improvements to homes. An additional $50 million will be available over the next 8 years to support tax credits for 15% of the cost of alternative energy projects, capped at $1 million per year for each project.

==Biofuels==
Governor [[Edward Rendell]] also approved two bills on July 10, 2008 that relate to [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Office of the Governor: [http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=2999&amp;PageID=431162&amp;mode=2&amp;contentid=http://pubcontent.state.pa.us/publishedcontent/publish/global/news_releases/governor_s_office/news_releases/governor_rendell_signs_biofuels_development_and_incentives_acts_to_strengthen_national_security__spur_economic_development.html Governor Rendell signs biofuels development and incentives acts to strengthen national security, spur economic development]&lt;/ref&gt;

House Bill 1202 &lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania General Assembly: [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=1202&amp;pn=4184 House Bill No. 1202, Session of 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; could add as much as {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}} of advanced biofuels to the state's fuel supply. It requires all retail diesel fuel sold in the state to contain 2% biodiesel, once the in-state production of biodiesel reaches {{convert|40|e6USgal|m3}} per year, increasing incrementally to a 20% biodiesel requirement, once the in-state production of biodiesel reaches {{convert|400|e6USgal|m3}} per year (but only if vehicle manufacturers approve the use of 20% biodiesel). Likewise, all retail gasoline sold in the state must contain 10% ethanol, once the in-state production of cellulosic ethanol reaches {{convert|350|e6USgal|m3}} per year. The state already has a biodiesel production capacity of {{convert|60|e6USgal|m3}} per year, so the 2% biodiesel requirement could go into effect soon, if production is high enough.

To encourage biodiesel production, Special Session Senate Bill 22 &lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania General Assembly: [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=1&amp;billBody=S&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0022&amp;pn=0057 Senate Bill No. 22, Special Session No. 1 of 2007-2008]&lt;/ref&gt; will offer a subsidy of 75 cents per gallon of biodiesel produced, capped at $1.9 million per year for each producer. The bill also expands a hybrid vehicle rebate program to include [[plug-in hybrid]]s and other alternative fuel vehicles.

A '''dictator''' was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] of the [[Roman Republic]], entrusted with the full authority of the state to deal with a military emergency or to undertake a specific duty.  All other magistrates were subordinate to his ''[[imperium]]'', and the right of the [[Tribune of the Plebs|plebeian tribunes]] to veto his actions or of the people to appeal from them was extremely limited.  However, in order to prevent the dictatorship from threatening the state itself, severe limitations were placed upon its powers: a dictator could only act within his intended sphere of authority; and he was obliged to resign his office once his appointed task had been accomplished, or at the expiration of six months.  Dictators were frequently appointed from the earliest period of the Republic down to the [[Second Punic War]], but the magistracy then went into abeyance for over a century, until it was revived in a significantly modified form, first by [[Sulla]], and then by [[Julius Caesar]].  The office was formally abolished after the death of Caesar, and not revived under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref name="Harper's"&gt;''Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', p. 339 ("Dictator").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lintott, pp. 109–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
With the abolition of the [[Roman Kingdom|Roman monarchy]] in 509 BC, the ''imperium'', or executive power, of the king was divided between two annually-elected magistrates, known as ''praetors''.  In time they would come to be known as ''[[Roman consul|consuls]]'', although probably not until the creation of a third, junior [[praetor]] in 367 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', p. 286 ("Consul").&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither consul was superior to the other, and the decisions of one could be appealed to the other (''provocatio'').  Their insignia were the ''[[toga#varieties|toga praetexta]]'' and the ''[[curule seat|sella curulis]]'', and each was attended by an escort of twelve [[lictor]]s, each of whom bore the ''[[fasces]]'', a bundle of rods topped by an axe; but by custom the lictors had to remove the axes from their fasces within the ''[[pomerium]]'', the sacred boundary of Rome, to signify that the ''people'', and not the consuls, were sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', pp. 429 ("Fasces"), 609 ("Lictores"), 639 ("Magistracy, Roman"), 1080 ("Toga").&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years,{{efn-lr|The exact date is uncertain, as are many of the details of this event, but 501 BC is the date generally favoured by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the fear of impending war with both the [[Sabines]] and the [[Latin League]], combined with widespread suspicion that one or both of the consuls favoured the restoration of the monarchy, led to the call for a ''praetor maximus'', or ''dictator'' ("one who gives orders"), akin to the supreme magistrate of other Latin towns.&lt;ref name="Livy ii 18"&gt;Livy, ii. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;  According to most authorities, the first dictator was [[Titus Lartius]] in 501 BC, who appointed [[Spurius Cassius Viscellinus|Spurius Cassius]] his ''[[magister equitum]]''.&lt;ref name="Livy ii 18"/&gt;{{efn-lr|An alternative tradition mentioned by Livy is that the first dictator was [[Manius Valerius Maximus]], although Livy thought this improbable, as dictators were supposed to be ''consulares'', that is, men who had already served as consul; and had a Valerius been desired, Manius' brother, Marcus (described by Livy as either the uncle or father of Manius), consul in 505 BC, would have been chosen instead.&lt;ref name="Livy ii 18"/&gt;  Modern historians generally share Livy's view, notwithstanding the fact that Manius Valerius was appointed dictator in BC 494, without having first held the consulship.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 9, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although there are indications that the term ''praetor maximus'' may have been used in the earliest period,{{efn-lr|Lintott considers the evidence for ''praetor maximus'' as the original name of the magistracy inconclusive, as it depends on the interpretation of an ancient law calling for an official of this title to drive a nail into the wall of the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]]; the law seems to have dated from the period of the monarchy, and under the Republic was interpreted to mean that this duty should be undertaken by a dictator, as the highest-ranking magistrate; but the first to perform it after the [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy|expulsion of the Tarquins]] was a consul, [[Marcus Horatius Pulvillus]].  Nevertheless, the law seems to confirm the existence of such a magistracy in the time of the kings, which might be considered the forerunner of the later ''magister populi''.&lt;ref&gt;Lintott, p. 104 (note 47).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Livy vii 3"&gt;Livy, vii. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the official title of the dictator throughout the history of the Republic was ''magister populi'', or "master of the infantry".   His lieutenant, the ''magister equitum'', was the "master of the horse" (that is, of the cavalry{{efn-lr|Literally, of the ''equites'', sometimes translated as "knights".}}).  However, the use of ''dictator'' to refer to the ''magister populi'' seems to have been widespread from a very early period.&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 110"&gt;Lintott, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination==
The appointment of a dictator involved three steps: first, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] would issue a decree known as a ''[[senatus consultum]]'', authorizing one of the consuls to nominate a dictator.  Technically, a ''senatus consultum'' was advisory, and did not have the force of law, but in practice it was nearly always followed.{{efn-lr|A notable exception occurred in BC 431, when the consuls Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus and [[Gaius Julius Mento]] were directed to nominate a dictator, probably after having been defeated in an attempt to dislodge the [[Aequi]] and [[Volsci]] from their fortifications on [[Mount Algidus]].  The consuls, who still felt themselves able to hold the military command, refused, until the tribunes of the plebs threatened to have them imprisoned if they did not nominate a dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, iv. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Either consul could nominate a dictator.  If both consuls were available, the dictator was chosen by agreement; if they could not agree, the consuls would draw lots for the responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, iv. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the ''[[Curiate Assembly|Comitia Curiata]]'' would be called upon to confer ''imperium'' on the dictator through the passage of a law known as a ''[[lex curiata de imperio]]''.&lt;ref name="Harper's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 110"/&gt;

A dictator could be nominated for different reasons, or ''causa''.  The three most common were ''rei gerundae causa'', "for the matter to be done", used in the case of dictators appointed to hold a military command against a specific enemy; ''comitiorum habendorum causa'', for holding the ''comitia'', or elections, when the consuls were unable to do so; and ''[[clavum fingere|clavi figendi causa]]'', an important religious rite involving the driving of a nail into the wall of the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]], as a protection against pestilence.{{efn-lr|As this was an annual ritual, it must generally have been observed by the consuls; but Livy mentions an ancient law calling for it to be performed by the ''praetor maximus'', apparently a magistrate in the time of the kings; and on at least one occasion when there was a dictator, it was interpreted to mean that the rite ''must'' be performed by the dictator, as the magistrate then holding the greatest ''imperium''.&lt;ref name="Livy vii 3"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 110"/&gt;  Other reasons included ''seditionis sedandae causa'' ("to quell sedition"); ''ferarium constituendarum causa'' (to establish a religious holiday in response to a dreadful portent{{efn-lr|In 344 BC, "a shower of stones rained down and darkness spread over the sky in the daytime."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vii. 28, Betty Radice, trans.&lt;/ref&gt;  This appeared to be a repetition of an omen that occurred during the reign of [[Tullus Hostilius]], the third King of Rome, when a shower of stones fell on the [[Monte Cavo|Alban Mount]] after the war in which Hostilius had destroyed the ancient Latin city of [[Alba Longa]], and transferred its people to Rome.  In a response, a nine-day religious festival was decreed, with the intention that it be repeated should such an omen occur again.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, i. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}); ''ludorum faciendorum causa'' (to hold the ''[[Ludi Romani]]'', or "Roman Games", an ancient religious festival); ''quaestionibus exercendis'', (to investigate certain actions);&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ix. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and in one extraordinary case, ''senatus legendi causa'', to fill up the ranks of the Senate after the [[Battle of Cannae]].&lt;ref name="Livy xxiii. 23."&gt;Livy, xxiii. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 112, 132, 150, 152, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  These reasons could be combined (''seditionis sedandae et rei gerundae causa''), but are not always recorded or clearly stated in ancient authorities, and must instead be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earlier period it was customary to nominate someone whom the consul considered the best available military commander; often this was a former consul, but this was never required.  However, from 360 BC onward, the dictators were usually ''consulares''.&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;{{efn-lr|The major exception was the ill-starred Marcus Claudius Glicia, freedman of [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]], who nominated him dictator in a fit of pique, when the Senate deprived him of his command after he had ignored ill omens and been defeated in the [[Battle of Drepana]].  The Senate compelled Glicia to abdicate the office, even before he could name a ''magister equitum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Normally there was only one dictator at a time, although a new dictator could be appointed following the resignation of another.{{efn-lr|The chief exception occurred in 216 BC, when [[Marcus Fabius Buteo]] was nominated dictator in order to fill up the ranks of the Senate following the Battle of Cannae, even as the dictator [[Marcus Junius Pera]] held the military command against [[Hannibal]].&lt;ref name="Livy xxiii. 23."/&gt;}}  A dictator could be compelled to resign his office without accomplishing his task or serving out his term if there were found to be a fault in the [[augury|auspices]] under which he had been nominated.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, viii. 15, 17, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 139, 140, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==
Like other curule magistrates, the dictator was entitled to the ''toga praetexta'' and the ''sella curulis''.  He received a ceremonial bodyguard that was unique in Roman tradition: "[t]wenty-four lictors indicated his quasi-regal power, which, however, was rather a concentration of the consular authority than a limited revival of the kingship."&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;{{efn-lr|Lintott suggests only twelve fasces were displayed when the dictator was within the city.&lt;ref name="Lintott 111"/&gt;}}

In a notable exception to the Roman reluctance to reconstitute the symbols of the kings, the lictors of the dictator never removed the axes from their fasces, even within the pomerium.  Symbolizing their power over life and death, the axes of a dictator's lictors set him apart from all other magistrates.&lt;ref name="Harper's"/&gt;  In an extraordinary sign of deference, the lictors of other magistrates could not bear fasces at all when appearing before the dictator.&lt;ref name="Lintott 111"/&gt;

As the kings had been accustomed to appear on horseback, this right was forbidden to the dictator, unless he first received permission from the ''comitia''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxiii. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, "Life of Fabius Maximus", 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 110"/&gt;

==Powers and limitations==
[[File:N26FabiusCunctator.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman Dictator [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]]]]

In addition to holding a military command and carrying out the actions decreed by the Senate, a dictator could summon the Senate or convene one of the legislative assemblies of the Roman people.  The full extent of the dictatorial power was considerable, but not unlimited.  It was circumscribed by the conditions of a dictator's appointment, as well as by the evolving traditions of [[Roman law]], and to a considerable degree depended on the dictator's ability to work together with other magistrates.  The precise limitations of this power were not sharply defined, but subject to debate, contention, and speculation throughout Roman history.&lt;ref name="Lintott 112"&gt;Lintott, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pursuit of his ''causa'', the dictator's authority was nearly absolute.  However, as a rule he could not exceed the mandate for which he was appointed; a dictator nominated to hold the ''comitia'' could not then take up a military command against the wishes of the Senate.{{efn-lr|For instance, Lucius Manlius Capitolinus was appointed ''clavi figendi causa'', but wished to lead an army against the [[Hernici]].  He proceeded to levy troops, but was compelled to resign before he could take the field, and was prosecuted the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vii. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn-lr|However, the Senate might request a dictator for a reason other than the one publicly announced; for example [[Gaius Julius Iulus (dictator 352 BC)|Gaius Julius Iulus]] was ostensibly nominated in BC 352 in order to carry on a war against the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], but in fact there was no threat from the Etruscans; he was appointed in order to procure the election of two patrician consuls, in violation of the ''[[lex Licinia Sextia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some dictators appointed to a military command also performed other duties, such as holding the ''comitia'', or driving a nail into the wall of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus; but presumably they did so with the Senate's consent.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxxiii. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''imperium'' of the other magistrates was not vacated by the nomination of a dictator.  They continued to perform the duties of their office, although subject to the dictator's authority, and continued in office until the expiration of their year, by which time the dictator had typically resigned.&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 111"&gt;Lintott, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is uncertain whether a dictator's ''imperium'' could extend beyond that of the consul by whom he was nominated; [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] believed that his ''imperium'' would cease together with that of the nominating magistrate, but others have suggested that it could continue beyond the end of the civil year; and in fact there are several examples in which a dictator appears to have entered a new year without any consuls at all, although some scholars doubt the authenticity of these ''dictator years''.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''Römisches Staatsrecht'', ii. 133–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broughton DY"&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 140, 141, 147–149, 162, 163, 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 110"/&gt;

Initially a dictator's power was not subject to either ''provocatio'', the right to appeal from the decision of a magistrate, or ''intercessio'', the veto of the tribunes of the plebs.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ii. 18, iii. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, vi. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 111"/&gt;  However, the ''[[Valerio-Horatian Laws|lex Valeria]]'', establishing the right of appeal, was not abrogated by the appointment of a dictator, and by 300 BC even the dictator was subject to ''provocatio'', at least within the city of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, viii. 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 111"/&gt;  There is also evidence that the power of the plebeian tribunes was not vitiated by the dictator's commands, and 210 BC, the tribunes threatened to prevent elections held by the dictator, [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 237 BC)|Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]], unless he agreed to withdraw his name from the list of candidates for the consulship.&lt;ref name="Livy xxvii 6"&gt;Livy, xxvii. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, "Life of Fabius Maximus", 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 111"/&gt;{{efn-lr|In this instance, the parties were deadlocked, and agreed to submit the matter to the Senate for resolution.  The Senate decided that it would be better to allow Fulvius to stand for election, given his vast experience (before his dictatorship, he had been consul three times, praetor, [[Roman censor|censor]], and magister equitum).&lt;ref name="Livy xxvii 6"/&gt;}}

A dictator was expected to resign his office upon the successful completion of the task for which he was appointed, or at the expiration of six months.&lt;ref name="Harper's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;  These sharp limitations were intended to prevent the dictatorship from too closely resembling the absolute power of the Roman kings.&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;  But the six month limitation may have been dispensed with when the Senate deemed it expedient; no consuls are known for the years 333, 324, 309, and 301, and it is reported that the dictator and magister equitum continued in office without any consuls.&lt;ref name="Broughton DY"/&gt;

Most authorities hold that a dictator could not be held to account for his actions after resigning his office, the prosecution of [[Marcus Furius Camillus]] for misappropriating the spoils of [[Veii]] being exceptional, as perhaps was that of Lucius Manlius Capitolinus in 362,{{efn-lr|The precise nature of the charges differs according to source; Broughton lists four reasons given by ancient authorities: "1. remaining Dictator when his religious duty was done; 2. remaining in office beyond his legal term; 3. raising a levy with too great severity; 4. mistreatment of his son, the future T. Manlius Torquatus..."&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;}} which was dropped only because his son, [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (consul 347 BC)|Titus]],{{efn-lr|The future Titus Manlius Torquatus would himself become dictator three times; in BC 353, 349, and 320, and consul twice, in 344 and 340.  This was the Manlius who won his surname from having defeated a giant Gaul in single combat, and taking his torque.  Despite his ill-treatment at the hands of his father, so powerful was his respect for paternal discipline, that when his eldest son disobeyed orders by engaging in single combat with the leader of the Latin cavalry (whom he defeated and slew), the consul commanded that his victorious son be scourged and beheaded.}} threatened the life of the tribune who had undertaken the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vii. 4, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper's"/&gt;  However, some scholars suggest that the dictator was only immune from prosecution during his term of office, and could theoretically be called to answer charges of corruption.&lt;ref name="Lintott 111"/&gt;

==Magister equitum==
{{main|magister equitum}}
The dictator's lieutenant was the magister equitum, or "master of the horse".  He would be nominated by the dictator immediately upon his own appointment, and unless the ''senatus consultum'' specified the name of the person to be appointed, the dictator was free to choose whomever he wished.&lt;ref name="Harper's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;  It was customary for the dictator to nominate a magister equitum even if he were appointed for a non-military reason.  Before the time of Caesar, the only dictator who refused to nominate a magister equitum was Marcus Fabius Buteo in 216 BC, and he strenuously objected to his own nomination, because there was already a dictator in the field.&lt;ref name="Livy xxiii. 23."/&gt;

Like the dictator, the magister equitum was a curule magistrate, entitled to the ''toga praetexta'' and the ''sella curulis''.  His ''imperium'' was equivalent to that of a praetor (in the later use of the term), in that he was accompanied by six lictors, half the number accorded to the consuls.  But like the dictator, he could summon the Senate, and probably also the popular assemblies.  His authority was not subject to recall, although if the dictator were compelled to resign due to a fault in the auspices, the magister equitum was also expected to resign, and when the dictator laid down his ''imperium'', so would the magister equitum.&lt;ref name="Lintott 112"/&gt;

In theory, the magister equitum was commander of the cavalry, but he was not limited to that role.  The dictator and magister equitum did not always take the field together; in some instances the magister equitum was assigned the defense of the city while the dictator took an army into the field, while on other occasions the dictator remained at Rome to see to some important duty, and entrusted the magister equitum with an army in the field.&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;  The magister equitum was necessarily subordinate to the dictator, although this did not always prevent the two from disagreeing.&lt;ref name="Lintott 112"/&gt;{{efn-lr|In 325 BC, the dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor was so furious when the magister equitum engaged the enemy in battle against his express orders, that he intended to have young [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus]] scourged and perhaps beheaded, notwithstanding the fact that Fabius had won a famous victory; he was restrained only when Fabius escaped and made his way to Rome, where the entire Roman people interceded on his behalf and begged the dictator to show mercy.  A century later, when Fabius' grandson, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] was dictator, his magister equitum, Marcus Minucius Rufus, defied him openly, and likewise fled to Rome in fear for his life, where he convinced the Senate to grant him ''imperium'' equal to that of the dictator's.  But in this case, it was the dictator who came to the rescue of his rebellious magister equitum, when Minucius improvidently offered battle and came near to destruction.&lt;ref name="Lintott 112"/&gt;}}

==Decline and disappearance==
During the first two centuries of the Republic, the dictatorship served as an expedient means by which a powerful magistracy could be created quickly in order to deal with extraordinary situations.&lt;ref name="Lintott 110"/&gt;  Created for military emergencies, the office could also be used to suppress sedition and prevent the growing number of plebeians from obtaining greater political power.&lt;ref name="Lintott 110"/&gt;  In the [[Conflict of the Orders]], the dictator could generally be counted upon to support the patrician aristocracy, since he was always a patrician, and was nominated by consuls who were exclusively patrician.  After the ''lex Licinia Sextia'' gave plebeians the right to hold one of the annual consulships, a series of dictators were appointed in order to hold elections, with the apparent goal of electing two patrician consuls, in violation of the Licinian law.&lt;ref name="Broughton 125"&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 125, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-lr|For example, in BC 352, the dictator [[Gaius Julius Iulus (dictator 352 BC)|Gaius Julius Iulus]] was nominated, ostensibly to fight a war against the Etruscans, although there was no actual threat from Etruria; however he failed to prevent the election of a plebeian consul.  Two years later, the dictator Lucius Furius Camillus succeeded in procuring the election of two patricians.&lt;ref name="Broughton 125"/&gt;}}

After the [[Samnite Wars#Second (or Great) Samnite War (326 to 304 BC)|Second Samnite War]], the dictatorship was relegated almost exclusively to domestic activities.  No dictator was nominated during the [[Samnite Wars#Third Samnite War (298 to 290 BC)|Third Samnite War]], and the six-month limitation on its powers made the dictatorship impractical for campaigns beyond the Italian peninsula.&lt;ref name="OCD2 Dictator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 112"/&gt;  In 249 BC, [[Aulus Atilius Calatinus]] became the only dictator to lead an army outside Italy, when he invaded [[Sicily]], and he was the only dictator to hold a military command during the [[First Punic War]].&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last dictators to lead an army in the field were [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] in 217, and Marcus Junius Pera the following year, during the early stages of the [[Second Punic War]].&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 243, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the other dictators appointed during that conflict remained at Rome in order to hold the ''comitia'';{{efn-lr|Titus Manlius Torquatus also held the Roman games in 208 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxvii. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the last dictator named in the traditional manner was Gaius Servilius Geminus, in 202 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxx. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-lr|Despite the impending end of the war, there was a series of unwelcome prodigies in Italy; in Cumae the skies darkened at mid-day, and a shower of stones fell there and on the [[Palatine Hill]] at Rome.  A similar omen in the time of Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome, had led to a nine-day religious festival, and in 344 BC, Publius Valerius Poplicola had been nominated dictator in response to a second occurrence; he also organized a religious festival.  For the third occurrence in 202, a nine-day religious festival was held before the dictator Servilius was nominated, since his chief purpose was to hold the ''comitia''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxx. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The dictatorship revived===
[[File:Sulla_Glyptothek_Munich_309.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust presumed to be that of Roman Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]

For the next century, Rome's ordinary magistrates and promagistrates successfully carried on all Roman campaigns, without the need for a dictator, and the office fell into abeyance.  Then, in 82 BC, the dictatorship was suddenly revived by [[Sulla]].  Sulla, already a successful general, had previously marched on Rome and taken the city from his political opponents six years earlier; but after he permitted the election of magistrates for 87, and departed to campaign in the east, his enemies returned.  In 83 he turned his attention to regaining Rome, and after defeating his opponents decisively the next year, the Senate and the people named him ''dictator legibus faciendis et rei publicae constituendae'', giving Sulla the power to rewrite the Roman constitution, without any time limit.&lt;ref name="OCD Sulla"&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', p. 1022 ("Sulla").&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-lr|The legislation was introduced by [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (princeps senatus 86 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]], who had been appointed [[interrex]] at Sulla's request, as both consuls were dead.  In turn, Sulla named Flaccus his magister equitum.&lt;ref name="OCD Sulla"/&gt;}}

[[Constitutional reforms of Sulla|Sulla's reforms of the constitution]] doubled the size of the Senate from 300 to 600, filling its ranks with his supporters.  He then placed severe limits on the [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunician power]], limiting the veto and forbidding ex-tribunes from holding higher magistracies.  Although he resigned the dictatorship in 81, and held the consulship in 80, before returning to private life, Sulla's actions had weakened the Roman state and set a precedent for the concentration of power without effective limitation.&lt;ref name="OCD Sulla"/&gt;

The dictatorial power was then granted to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] in 49 BC, when he returned to Rome from his campaigns in Gaul, and put the forces of [[Pompey|Pompeius]] ("Pompey the Great") to flight.  He resigned the dictatorship after only eleven days, having held the ''comitia'' at which he himself was elected consul for the following year.  Late in 48, Caesar was named dictator ''rei gerundae causa'' with a term of one year, and granted the tribunician power for an indefinite period.  He saw to the impeachment of two tribunes who had tried to obstruct him, and having been granted censorial powers, he filled the depleted numbers of the Senate with his supporters, raising the number of senators to 900.  In 47, he was named dictator for a term of ten years.  Shortly before his assassination in BC 44, Caesar was named ''dictator perpetuo rei publicae constituendae'', and given the power to appoint magistrates at will.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 139–155 ("Caesar", no. 18).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', pp. 189, 190 ("Caesar").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lintott, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition===
Caesar's murder came at the hands of conspirators who presented themselves as saviours of the Republic.  In order to maintain popular support, Caesar's followers took great care to show their own commitment to preserving the Roman state.  The month after the assassination, [[Mark Antony]], who had been Caesar's magister equitum in BC 47, proposed a series of laws, confirming Caesar's actions, but allowing appeals and formally abolishing the dictatorship.  These were passed, as the ''[[lex Antonia|leges Antoniae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', p. 601 ("Lex").&lt;/ref&gt;

In 23 BC, when Caesar's nephew and heir [[Augustus]] had attained full control of the state, the Senate offered to appoint him dictator, but he declined, while at the same time accepting proconsular ''imperium'' and the tribunician power for life.  Thus, Augustus preserved the appearance of respecting Republican forms, even as he arrogated most of the powers of the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, p. 428 ("Augustus").&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his example, none of the emperors who succeeded him ever adopted the title of ''dictator''.  When [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] chose to revive the ancient concept of the infantry commander, he pointedly gave the office the name of ''[[Magister militum#Establishment and development of the office|magister peditum]]'', "master of the foot", rather than ''magister populi'', the official style of a dictator.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', p. 638 ("Magister Militum").&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 3228 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 07-09-1993.jpg|thumb|300px|Residents and volunteers work to fill sandbags during the [[Great Flood of 1993|Mississippi and Missouri river floods of 1993]].]]
[[File:Georgia National Guard filling sandbags.jpg|thumb|300px|Members of the [[Georgia National Guard]] filling sandbags in preparation for floods.]]
A '''sandbag''' is a bag or sack made of [[Hessian (cloth)|hessian (burlap)]], [[polypropylene]] or other sturdy materials that is filled with [[sand]] or [[soil]] and used for such purposes as [[flood control]], military [[fortification]] in trenches and bunkers, shielding glass windows in war zones, [[buoyancy compensator (aviation)|ballast]], [[counterweight]], and in other applications requiring mobile fortification, such as adding improvised additional protection to armoured vehicles or tanks.

The advantages are that the bags and sand are inexpensive. When empty, the bags are compact and lightweight for easy storage and transportation. They can be brought to a site empty and filled with local sand or soil. Disadvantages are that filling bags is labor-intensive. Without proper training, sandbag walls can be constructed improperly causing them to fail at a lower height than expected, when used in flood-control purposes. They can degrade prematurely in the sun and elements once deployed. They can also become contaminated by sewage in flood waters making them difficult to deal with after flood waters recede.&lt;ref name="Leibenluft"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/06/the_25cent_flood_protection_device.html |title= The 25-Cent Flood Protection Device |website= Slate.com |first= Jacob |last= Leibenluft |date= 2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a military context, improvised up-armouring of tanks or armoured personnel carriers with sandbags is not effective against cannons (though it may offer protection against some [[small arms]]).

==Usage==
[[File:Troops from the Grenadier Guards constructing sandbag defences around government buildings in Birdcage Walk, London, May 1940. H1584.jpg|thumb|right|Troops from the Grenadier Guards constructing sandbag defences around government buildings in Birdcage Walk, London, May 1940.]]

===Flood control===
Properly stacked sandbags&lt;ref&gt;Moellman, Mark (2017). [https://interbulkexpress.quora.com/Sandbags-for-Flood-Control-8-Things-you-Need-To-Know Sandbags for Flood Control - 8 Things you Need To Know]&lt;/ref&gt; are an effective deterrent against damaging [[flood]] waters. Sandbags can be used to build [[levee]]s, [[barricade]]s, [[Ditch|dikes]] and [[berm]]s to limit erosion from flooding. Sandbags can also be used to fortify existing flood control structures and limit the effects of [[sand boil]]s. Sandbag structures do not prevent water seepage and therefore should be built with the central purpose of diverting flood water around or away from buildings.

Properly filled sandbags for flood control are filled 1/2 to 2/3 full with clean washed sand. In an emergency, if clean sand is in limited supply, gravel or dirt can also be used with less effective end results. When filled sandbags are stacked or laid in place, the contents need to settle flat to the ground. Sandbags filled over 2/3 full will not form an adequate seal to the ground or structure. Likewise sandbags filled under 1/2 will generally also form an inadequate seal to the ground when placed.

The best practices for filling sandbags require a three-person team. One team member will crouch down and hold open the bag to form a collar opening. The second team member place the tip of a pointed shovel with sand into the opened sandbag. A square shovel is not recommended as the blade of the shovel will not fit into the sandbag when filling. The third team member will transport and stockpile the filled sandbags.

Properly placed sandbags will be set lengthwise and parallel to the water flow with the folded or open end of the sandbag facing upstream. All loose debris should be removed from the placement surface and the lowest areas are the first spots to be filled in with sandbags. Each bag must be set consecutively with the tightly packed bottom slightly overlapping the previously placed sandbag. Subsequent layers of bags should be offset by 1/2 the length of a sandbag to eliminate voids and improve the wall seal. Each placed bag should be tamped and flattened to improve the seal.

The two primary methods for stacking sandbags to build flood control structures are the (1) Single Stack placement, and; (2) Pyramid Placement Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nws.usace.army.mil/Portals/27/docs/emergency/NWD_Sandbag_Pamphlet.pdf|title=US Army Corps of Engineers, Northwest Division|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortification===
The military uses sandbags for field [[fortification]]s and as a temporary measure to protect civilian structures. Because burlap and sand are inexpensive, large protective barriers can be erected cheaply. The friction created by moving soil or sand grains and tiny air gaps makes sandbags an efficient [[Dissipation|dissipator]] of [[explosion|explosive blast]].&lt;ref&gt;War Office. Military Training Pamphlet No 30, Part V: Protective Works. 1941. p. 39 specifies {{convert|20|in|mm}} of sand in bags as proof against armour piercing bullets and bomb fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common sizes for sandbags are {{convert|14|by|26|in|cm}} to  {{convert|17|by|32|in|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Williamson. [http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/natural-disasters/sandbag1.htm How Sandbags Work]. Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Hart. [http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/faqs/bags.htm Type of Earthbags to Use]. EarthbagBuilding.com.&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions, and the weight of sand a bag this size can hold, allow for the construction of an interlocking wall like [[brickwork]].

Individual filled bags are not too heavy to lift and move into place. They may be laid in excavated defences as [[revetment]], or as free-standing walls above ground where excavations are impractical. As plain burlap sandbags deteriorate fairly quickly, sandbag structures meant to remain in place for a long time may be painted with a [[portland cement]] [[slurry]] to reduce the effects of [[Decomposition|rot]] and abrasion. Cotton ducking sandbags last considerably longer than burlap and are hence preferable for long-term use. However, the vast majority of sandbags used by modern military and for flood prevention are made of circular woven [[polypropylene]]. Some of the WW1 memorial trenches were rebuilt with concrete sandbags after the First World War—although criticized as looking unnatural, they have lasted well. In WW2 in Great Britain, some aircraft revetments and pillboxes were made from concrete filled sandbags, again these have lasted well.

Sandbags have been used since at least the late 18th century. For example, British loyalists used sandbag and log fortifications in the 1781 [[Siege of Ninety-Six]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. [[Nathanael Greene]] was familiar enough with the fortification technique to equip his troops with hooks to pull down the sandbag and log walls when they stormed the Star [[Redoubt]] in [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WdKUoL7Z4nIC&amp;pg=PA319 |title= The American Revolution 100: The Battles, People, and Events of the American War for Independence, Ranked by Their Significance |first= Michael Lee |last= Lanning |page= 319 |publisher= Sourcebooks, Inc. |year= 2009 |ISBN= 9781402247309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandbags have traditionally been filled manually using [[shovel]]s. Since the 1990s, machine filling has become more common, allowing the work to be done more quickly and efficiently.

==Bulk bags==
[[Flexible intermediate bulk container|Bulk bags]], also known as big bags, are much larger than traditional sandbags. Moving a bag of this size typically requires a [[forklift truck]]. Thailand utilized bulk bags filled with sand to erect temporary walls to protect against the [[2011 Thailand floods]].

[[File:FEMA - 40429 - Mennonite volunteers fill sand bags in Minnesota in Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Sandbags being filled using a ladder on sawhorses with [[traffic cone]]s as [[Chute (gravity)|chutes]] or [[funnel]]s, [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], 2009.]]
Sandbags are also used for disposable ballast in [[gas balloon]]s, and as [[counterweight]]s for [[set construction|theatre sets]]. Some temporary construction signs or advertising signs are held in place and secured against being blown over with sandbags.

During [[World War II]], sandbags were also used as extemporized "soft armor" on American tanks, with the goal of protecting the tanks from German anti-tank rounds,&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicut, R.P. "Sherman: A History of the American Medium Tank" {{ISBN|0-89141-080-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were ineffective.

Sandbags can also be carried within vehicles to provide improved traction during inclement weather (typically stored above the drive wheels where the increased weight improves traction). If ever stuck, sand can be removed and placed directly onto the slippery surface thereby providing greatly improved traction.  Sandbags are also used by off-road enthusiasts instead of sand plates or sand ladders to assist the vehicle to get traction and momentum after being stuck in soft sand. The same sandbags can be used to bridge deep holes or ditches. Apart from being very light and taking very little space (when empty), the sandbags are a much cheaper option than any of the other options (sand plates, sand ladders, multipurpose bags, etc.).

Sandbags are often used to temporarily stabilize soil from erosion, such as oceanfront structures whose foundations have been undermined by heavy waves. Sandbags are also used in [[earthbag construction]] to make inexpensive, environmentally [[sustainable]] homes. In addition, sandbags are often used when shooting a long gun, specifically a rifle or sniper rifle, from a rest, as it provides support for the weapon, allowing for less movement during shooting.

Sandbags of various sizes and weights can be used for exercise or [[strength training|resistance training]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/add-sandbag-training-your-workout |title= Add Sandbag Training to Your Workout |publisher= Muscle and Fitness|journal= Muscle and Fitness Magazine May, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figurative use==
In games and various kinds of adversarial settings, the term [[sandbagging (disambiguation)|sandbagging]] refers to the practice of purposely placing oneself in a weaker position so as to give the deceptive impression that one is less skilled than one truly is.

==In slang==
The word can also refer to a simple weapon consisting of a small bag filled with sand for use as a [[cudgel]] typically by criminals, or to the act of striking a person on the head with such a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sandbag |title= Sandbag |website= Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate= 2014-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is obsolescent in normal speech, appearing mainly in legal codes. However the verb form is extended metaphorically in several slang expressions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

'''United States environmental law''' concerns legal standards to protect human health and improve the natural [[environment of the United States]]. While subject to criticism at home and abroad on issues of protection, enforcement, and over-regulation, the country remains an important source of environmental legal expertise and experience.
== Scope ==
{{Main|Environmental law}}
{{See also|List of United States federal environmental statutes}}
{{#section:Environmental law|scope}}
The [[United States Congress]] has enacted federal statutes intended to address pollution control and remediation, including for example the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] ([[air pollution]]), the [[Clean Water Act]] ([[water pollution]]), and the [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA, or Superfund) (contaminated site cleanup). There are also federal laws governing natural resources use and biodiversity which are strongly influenced by environmental principles, including the [[Endangered Species Act]], [[National Forest Management Act of 1976|National Forest Management Act]], and [[Coastal Zone Management Act]]. The [[National Environmental Policy Act]], governing [[environmental impact review]] in actions undertaken or approved by the U.S. federal government, may implicate all of these areas. 

[[Federalism in the United States]] has played a role in the shape of national environmental legislation. Many federal environmental laws employ [[cooperative federalism]] mechanisms - many federal regulatory programs are administered in coordination with the [[U.S. state]]s. Furthermore, the states generally have enacted their own laws to cover areas not [[Federal preemption|preempted]] by federal law. This includes areas where Congress had acted in limited fashion (e.g., state site cleanup laws to handle sites outside [[Superfund]]) and where Congress has left regulation primarily to the states (e.g., [[Water law|water resources law]]).

==History==
{{See also|Environmental movement in the US|Environmental policy of the US}}
The history of environmental law in the US can be traced back to early roots in [[common law]] doctrines, for example, the law of [[nuisance]] and the [[public trust doctrine]]. The first environmental statute was the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], which has been largely superseded by the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA). However, most current major environmental statutes, such as the federal statutes listed above, were passed in the time spanning the late 1960s through the early 1980s.  Prior to the passage of these statutes, most federal environmental laws were not nearly as comprehensive.  

''[[Silent Spring]],'' a 1962 book by [[Rachel Carson]], is frequently credited as launching the environmental movement in the United States.  The book documented the effects of [[pesticides]], especially [[DDT]], on birds and other wildlife.&lt;ref name=Carson&gt;
{{cite book |last=Carson |first=Rachel |date=2002 |title=Silent Spring |url= |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |page= |isbn=9780618249060 |edition=40th anniversary |orig-year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=H. Patricia |title=The Recurring Silent Spring |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=0-08-037117-5 |series=Athene series |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNjaAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most significant environmental disasters of the 1960s was the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], which generated considerable public outrage as [[United States Congress|Congress]] was considering several major pieces of environmental legislation. (''See'' [[Environmental movement in the United States]].)

One lawsuit that has been widely recognized as one of the earliest environmental cases is ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission,'' decided in 1965 by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], prior to passage of the major federal environmental statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/354/f2d/608 ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission,''] 354 F.2d 608, December 29, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The case helped halt the construction of a [[power plant]] on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] in New York State.  The case has been described as giving birth to environmental litigation and helping create the legal doctrine of [[standing (law)|standing]] to bring environmental claims.&lt;ref&gt;Scenic Hudson, Inc. [http://library.marist.edu/archives/ScenicHudson_Aid.html "Scenic Hudson Collection: Records Relating to the Storm King Case, 1963-1981."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218193129/http://library.marist.edu/archives/ScenicHudson_Aid.html |date=2005-12-18 }} Archives and Special Collections, Marist College, Poughkeepsie, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scenic Hudson case also is said to have helped inspire the passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), and the creation of such environmental advocacy groups as the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]].

== Legal sources ==
Laws from every stratum of the [[laws of the United States]] pertain to environmental issues.  Congress has passed a number of landmark environmental regulatory regimes, but many other federal laws are equally important, if less comprehensive. Concurrently, the legislatures of the fifty states have passed innumerable comparable sets of laws.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/SUBJECT/LEGSREGS/laws.htm Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt;  These state and federal systems are foliated with layer upon layer of administrative regulation. Meanwhile, the US judicial system [[Judicial review|reviews]] not only the legislative enactments, but also the administrative decisions of the many agencies dealing with environmental issues.  Where the statutes and regulations end, the common law begins.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://blog.sprlaw.com/2010/03/second-circuit-clarifies-superfund-cost-recovery-and-liability-issues/ Second Circuit Clarifies Superfund Cost Recovery and Liability Issues] (analyzing court application of statutory provisions of CERCLA, also known as [[Superfund]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Federal statutes ===
{{Main|List of United States Federal Environmental Statutes}}
{{See also|Environmental policy of the United States}}

=== Federal regulation ===
Consistent with the federal statutes that they administer, US federal agencies promulgate regulations in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] that fill out the broad programs enacted by Congress.  Primary among these is [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations]], containing the regulations of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Other important CFR sections include Title 10 (energy), Title 18 (Conservation of Power and Water Resources), Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Title 33 (Navigable Waters), Title 36 (Parks, Forests and Public Property), Title 43 (Public Lands: Interior) and Title 50 (Wildlife and Fisheries).

=== Judicial decisions ===
{{See also|List of environmental lawsuits}}
The federal and state judiciaries have played an important role in the development of environmental law in the United States, in many cases resolving significant controversy regarding the application of federal environmental laws in favor of environmental interests.  The decisions of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in cases such as ''Calvert Cliffs Coordinating Committee v. U.S. Atomic Energy Commission'' (broadly reading the procedural requirements of NEPA), ''[[Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill]]'' (broadly reading the [[Endangered Species Act]]), and, much more recently, ''[[Massachusetts v. EPA]]'' (requiring EPA to reconsider [[regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]]) have had policy impacts far beyond the facts of the particular case.

=== Common law ===
The common law of [[tort]] is an important tool for the resolution of environmental disputes that fall beyond the confines of regulated activity.  Prior to the modern proliferation of environmental regulation, the doctrines of [[nuisance]] (public or private), [[trespass]], [[negligence]], and [[strict liability]] apportioned harm and assigned liability for activities that today would be considered pollution and likely governed by regulatory regimes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.answers.com/topic/environmental-law West's Encyclopedia of American Law, Environmental Law].&lt;/ref&gt;  These doctrines remain relevant, and most recently have been used by plaintiffs seeking to impose liability for the consequences of global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Cases collected at [http://www.climatecasechart.com/ Climatecasechart.com (Common Law Claims)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law also continues to play a leading role in American [[water law]], in the doctrines of [[Riparian water rights|riparian rights]] and [[Prior appropriation water rights|prior appropriation]].

== Administration ==
{{See also|List of environmental organizations#Government organizations}}

In the United States, responsibilities for the administration of environmental laws are divided between numerous federal and state agencies with varying, overlapping and sometimes conflicting missions.  EPA is the most well-known federal agency, with jurisdiction over many of the country's national air, water and waste and hazardous substance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations |title=Laws and Regulations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-09-13 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic |title=Regulatory Information By Topic |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-05 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal agencies, such as the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] and [[National Park Service]] pursue primarily conservation missions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/ |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=U.S. National Park Service |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/help/about_us.html |title=About the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-03-24 |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still others, such as the [[United States Forest Service]] and the [[Bureau of Land Management]], tend to focus more on beneficial use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency |title=About the Agency |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=U.S. Forest Service |location=Washington, D.C.|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blm.gov/about |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Land Management |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal agencies operate within the limits of [[Federal jurisdiction (United States)|federal jurisdiction]]. For example, EPA's jurisdiction under the [[Clean Water Act]] is limited to "[[Clean Water Act#Waters protected under the CWA|waters of the United States]]". In many cases federal laws allow for more stringent regulation by states, and of transfer of certain federally mandated responsibilities from federal to state control. US state governments, therefore, administering state law adopted under state [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]s or federal law by delegation, uniformly include environmental agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/home/health-and-environmental-agencies-us-states-and-territories |title=Health and Environmental Agencies of U.S. States and Territories |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which state environmental laws are based on or depart from federal law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Thus, while a permit to fill non-federal [[wetland]]s might require a permit from a single state agency, larger and more complex endeavors—for example, the construction of a [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plant]]—might require approvals from numerous federal and state agencies.

=== Enforcement ===
In the United States, violations of environmental laws are generally [[Civil law (common law)|civil offenses]], resulting in monetary penalties and, perhaps, civil sanctions such as [[injunction]]. Many environmental laws also provide for [[Criminal punishment|criminal penalties]] for egregious violations. Some federal laws, such as the Clean Water Act, also allow a U.S. citizen to file a [[citizen suit|lawsuit]] against a violator, if the government has failed to take enforcement action.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 505, {{USC|33|1365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental agencies often include separate enforcement offices, with duties including monitoring permitted activities, performing compliance inspections, issuing citations and prosecuting wrongdoing (civilly or criminally, depending on the violation). EPA's [[Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance]] is one such agency. Others, such as the [[United States Park Police]], carry out more traditional law enforcement activities.

Adjudicatory proceedings for environmental violations are often handled by the agencies themselves under the structures of [[administrative law]]. In some cases, appeals are also handled internally (for example, EPA's Environmental Appeals Board).  Generally, final agency determinations may subsequently be appealed to the appropriate court.

=== Education and training ===
Environmental law courses are offered as elective courses in the second and third years of [[juris doctor|JD]] study at many American [[law school]]s.  Curricula vary: an introductory course might focus on the "big five" federal statutes—[[National Environmental Policy Act|NEPA]], [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act|CWA]], [[CERCLA|CERCLA (Superfund)]] and [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (or, alternatively, the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]])—and may be offered in conjunction with a natural resources law course.  Smaller seminars may be offered on more focused topics.  Some US law schools also offer an [[LLM]] or [[Doctor of laws|JSD]] specialization in environmental law. Additionally, several law schools host [[legal clinics]] that focus on environmental law, providing students with an opportunity to learn about environmental law in the context of real world disputes involving actual clients.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Adam Babich, The Apolitical Law School Clinic, 11 Clinical L. Rev. 447 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] has consistently ranked [[Vermont Law School]], [[Lewis &amp; Clark Law School]], and [[Pace University School of Law]] as the top three Environmental Law programs in the [[United States]], with Lewis &amp; Clark and Vermont frequently trading the top spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/law/environ |title=US News &amp; World Report |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many American law schools host student-published [[Law review|law journals]].  The environmental law reviews at [[Yale Law School|Yale]], [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], [[Stanford Law School|Stanford]], [[Columbia Law School|Columbia]], [[NYU Law School|NYU]] and [[Lewis &amp; Clark Law School]] are regularly the most-cited such publications.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://lawlib.wlu.edu/lj/index.aspx Washington and Lee University School of Law, Law Journal Rankings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307221833/http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx |date=2006-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International environmental lawyers often receive specialized training in the form of an LL.M. degree at US institutions, after having a first law degree{{spaced ndash}}often in another country from where they got their first law degree.

'''World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC)''' was an international [[Advocacy group|advocacy]] organization, created in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424602884.html]&lt;/ref&gt; representing [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish refugees from Arab countries]]. The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries was created to make certain that any "just settlement of the refugee problem" recognizes those Jews who were forced to flee from lands where they had lived for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm THE OTHER REFUGEES: JEWS OF THE ARAB WORLD]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WOJAC functioned for approximately 25 years (from 1975 until 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Yehouda Shenhav. ''Ethnicity and National Memory: The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) in the Context of the Palestinian National Struggle''. British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 27 - 56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2016}} WOJAC's aspiration was to operate in the national arena, to counterbalance the claims of the Palestinian leadership on the right to the land and on the refugee question.
