      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1766">An experimental broadcast, and a proposal by [[Philips]] of the [[Netherlands]], was a 567 line television
system for Europe, running at 50 fields (25 frames) per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/forum/philips_netherland_567_line_tv_standard.html |title=Philips Netherland 567 line TV Standard |language=de |publisher=Radiomuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the technology was to be borrowed from [[NTSC]], the difference from NTSC being the
reducing of the horizontal scan frequency from   15750  to  14175&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scheida.at/scheida/Televisionen_Netherlands.htm |title=Philips 567 Zeilen Standard - The Philips 576 line TV system |publisher=Scheida.at |date=1951-10-02 |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This would have meant that the NTSC sound carrier frequency of 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz above the picture carrier, would have also been the standard for Europe, and hence been a lot more common world wide.

The proposal was defeated as Russian engineers had already shown how NTSC could be easily adapted to a higher resolution by breaking with NTSC bandwidth restrictions, and moving the sound carrier up 2&amp;nbsp;MHz from 4.5 to 6.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, along with 625 line scanning.

'''''A Dark Room''''' is an [[open-source software]] [[Online text-based role-playing game|role-playing text-based game]] originally published in mid-2013 for [[web browsers]] by Canadian indie studio Doublespeak Games. Later that year, it was released in the [[IOS App Store|App Store]] for [[iOS]] devices. In 2014, a prequel entitled ''[[The Ensign (video game)|The Ensign]]'', which provided more insight into the world and its characters, was released for iOS.

==Production==
''A Dark Room'' was created by Michael Townsend and released for [[Web browser|browsers]] on June 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dark Room released|url=http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/games/a-dark-room-released/|publisher=Doublespeak Games|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Townsend, the game was designed to tell its story entirely through environmental cues, rather than relying on exposition and dialogue.&lt;ref name="newyorker1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomsen |first=Michael |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/06/a-dark-room-the-best-selling-game-that-no-one-can-explain.html |title=A Dark Room: The Best-Selling Game That No One Can Explain |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14 |quote=''Townsend was happy to share his work with Rajan. "I want to kindle the creative spirit in others," Townsend told me over e-mail. "My games are open-source because I want people to learn from them, or use them to build their own things."''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, Townsend released  the [[source code]] of the game on [[GitHub]] under the [[open source license]] [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]] 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dark Room goes open source|url=http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/|publisher=Doublespeak Games|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon, Townsend was contacted by developer [[Amirali Rajan|Amir Rajan]], who asked for permission to adapt the game for [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dark Room on iOS|url=http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/games/a-dark-room-on-ios/|publisher=Doublespeak Games|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir ported the game to iOS using the [[RubyMotion]] mobile toolchain,&lt;ref name="rubymotion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubymotion.com/references/success-stories/a-dark-room |title=RubyMotion Success Story: A Dark Room |publisher=RubyMotion Blog |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released it on the App Store in late 2013.&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt; From 2014 onwards an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Porting|port]] of ''A Dark Room'' was being worked on, which was finally released in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-android-entering-private-beta/ a-dark-room-android-entering-private-beta]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/games/a-dark-room-is-now-on-android/ |title=A Dark Room is now on Android! |publisher=Blog.doublespeakgames.com |date=2016-07-11 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game begins with the player awakening in a cold, dark room after a mysterious event.&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt; Initially, the player can only light and tend a fire in the room. As the game progresses, the player gains the abilities to collect resources, interact with strangers, start a village, and explore the world. As the game progresses, the type and quantity of resources and exploration available increases.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Leigh|title=A Dark Room's unique journey from the web to iOS|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/212230/A_Dark_Rooms_unique_journey_from_the_web_to_iOS.php|website=Gamasutra|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "What follows is a strange hybrid, part mystery story and part smartphone productivity software...the game evokes the simplest text-based computer games of the nineteen-seventies while stimulating a very modern impulse to constantly check and recheck one's phone. It's like a puzzle composed of deconstructed to-do lists."&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt; The site added, "You can begin to see a structure emerge from the fragments, but where that structure will lead you remains impossible to predict, and so the compulsion to keep pressing little word buttons grows stronger."&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Video game reviews

}}

''[[TouchArcade]]'' gave the game a rating of 4 out of 5, writing, "It's a strange little thing, to be sure, but I'd definitely recommend A Dark Room to people who appreciate off-beat RPGs, fans of experience-driven games, or really anyone looking for something a little bit different from usual."&lt;ref name="TouchArcade" /&gt; Slide to Play rated it 3 out of 4, commenting, "It may not seem like much at first, but if you stick around long enough, it's easy to fall under A Dark Room's spell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slidetoplay.com/review/a-dark-room-review/ |title=A Dark Room Review |publisher=Slide to Play |date=2016-04-15 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 148Apps gave the game 3 out of 5, writing, "''A Dark Room'' may have plenty of longevity and may be genuinely intriguing, but its interface feels undeveloped in its iOS iteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Our Review by Lee Hamlet on March 31st, 2014 |url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/dark-room-review/ |title=A Dark Room Review |publisher=148Apps |date=2014-03-31 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Yorker]]'' explained, "When ''A Dark Room'' was first released on [[iPhone]], at the end of 2013, the game was listed in a number of Best of the Year lists, including those published by [[Forbes]], [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]], and the gaming site, [[Giant Bomb]]."&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt; The app "rocketed to the most-downloaded spot in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]'s games section in April and stayed there throughout the month".&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;

[[Engadget]] praised the game's surprise ending, writing that "...it's definitely worth the time it takes to find it."&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wehner|first1=Mike|title=You should spend some serious time in A Dark Room|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/28/you-should-spend-some-serious-time-in-a-dark-room/ |website=Engadget |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born '''Abraham Finkelstein''' in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], but grew up mainly in [[Utica, New York]]. He became a professional singer as a youngster. Around 1908, he toured with [[Guy Brother]]'s [[Minstrel Show]], and helped form a [[vaudeville]] act "Weston, Fields and Carroll".

His first hit as a songwriter was "On the Mississippi" (1912), which he wrote the music for with [[Harry Carroll]] and [[Ballard MacDonald]] supplied the lyrics. In 1914 he wrote the lyrics to "[[Aba Daba Honeymoon]]", which was revived for the 1950 M.G.M. film ''[[Two Weeks With Love]]'' and thus got a renewed popularity which brought Fields large royalty incomes during his last two years.

From 1914 onward, he recorded with many bands and for many labels and had a varied career in the recording industry. In 1918, he was popular for his performance of his "[[Hunting the Hun]]" war song. His 1919 recordings with bandleader [[Ford Dabney]] may be the very first recordings of a white singer backed by a black band. For a period Fields also formed a vocal trio with brothers [[Jack Kaufman|Jack]] and [[Irving Kaufman (singer)|Irving Kaufman]], billing themselves as "The Three Kaufields". Fields also often appeared on records under [[pseudonym]]s, for example as "Mr X." on [[Grey Gull Records]] and related labels. In 1926 he recorded with [[Oreste Migliaccio]] &amp; His Queensland Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/fields_BA.html|title=Edison Blue Amberol Cylinder Records - Arthur Fields Cylindeography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last records were made in the early 1940s.

Among Field's most prolific partnerships was the one with band leader and pianist [[Fred Hall (musician)|Fred Hall]], with whom Fields made plenty of records and co-wrote several songs, often with comic titles like "The Shoes We Have Left Are All Right", "You're My Little Rhapsody in Blue", and "I Can't Sleep in the Movies Anymore". Hall and Fields also [[broadcasting|broadcast]] together as [[Rex Cole's Mountaineers]].

Retiring to [[Florida]] in 1946 he also worked in radio on [[WQVN|WKAT]] [[Miami]]. He suffered a stroke early in 1953 and was killed in a fire at Littlefield Nursing Home in [[Largo, Florida]] a little later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phonostalgia.com/death/fields.html Arthur Fields's death certificate].

== Personal life ==

He has one brother advocate Anil Gaur and three sisters: Shashi Prabha, late Mithlesh and Dr. Anita Gaur. His wife Dr. Sangeeta Gaur.

== Theatre career ==
After completing his schooling from Model School, Vivek Vihar in Delhi, he decided to study engineering in Electronic Communication. Later, he joined the Delhi Public Library drama group.&lt;ref name=treat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livehindustan.com/news/lifestyle/lifestylenews/article1-story-50-50-220628.html|title= जीवन का हर रंग है दिल्ली में-संस्कृति और तहजीब से लबरेज:अरविंद गौड़ |author= सत्यसिंधु|date= 2 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-07-12 |publisher=[livehindustan.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DPL He acted in and directed plays. Then he worked with slum kids and industrial labourers for some time and conducted workshops for them. His first street play was with Zakir Hussein College, called ''Videshi Aya''. It became very popular and he staged it around 200 schools. After this, his desire to express led him to journalism. He worked with the ''[[Navbharat Times]]'' newspaper as culture columnist for about four years.&lt;ref name=treat/&gt;

Watching plays, reading about them and writing about them is how his training in theatre started. He then shifted to [[Press Trust of India]] (PTI-TV). He was associated with TV serial ''Tana-Bana''. He was in charge of the research and programming there. All through his years with street theatre, print and television, Gaur had developed keen interest in direction. Finally, after devoting two years to PTI-TV, he felt the urge to switch to theatre completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theatrepasta.com/?p=113|title=Nalina Mittra catches up with Arvind Gaur to find out more about his journey|author=Theatre Pasta|date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-24 |publisher=Theatre Magazine| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081227202855/http://theatrepasta.com/?p=113| archivedate= 27 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre journey ===

He performed [[Girish Karnad]]'s ''[[Tughlaq]]'' in a small basement theatre (SRC). It was a huge success. His ''[[Tughlaq]]'' was selected as "the best play of the year 1994" by [[Sahitya Kala Parishad]]. He achieved greater heights during a decade in theatre. He trained actors in his own style. He trained them as a complete theatre person. Arvind Gaur also collaborated with theatre artists and groups specially in exploring a new language for solo performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.google.com/site/asmitatheatre/Home/about-director|title=About Director-Arvind Gaur|author=Sites.google.com|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Street plays ===
Gaur directed more than 40 [[street theatre]] performances on socio-political issues. He has always raised voice against any socio-political issue that effects the common public. He directed street plays like ''Corruption'', ''Garbage'', ''Road Rage'', and ''Dastak'' which is against the issue of eve teasing. His street plays are always thought-provoking and leave a huge mark on the mindset. He and his team performs socio-political street plays all across Delhi/NCR and the country. He is regarded as a man with a message who believes that change can start from society, if we wish to start the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newslaundry.com/2018/03/04/delhi-natak-alchemist-live-theatre-festival-nsd-mandi-house|title=Delhi,a Natak hub|author=Sashikala VP and Mihir Srivastava |publisher= News Laundry|accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
On May 2nd 2017, Theatre and film actor Shilpi Marwaha broke her 11-year long association with Asmita Theatre Group, alleging that Arun Gaur made "advances" towards her. He made advances, and the moment it happened, I said no and left. It started in February 2016 in Varanasi, when we were rehearsing for a play late at night. We were discussing a script when he tried to hold my hand and made advances towards me. I left immediately and thought he would not repeat this. But it happened again after five-six months. He would say, 'Yeh toh normal cheez hai, ismein galat kya hai?' After it happened for the first time, I did not go to Asmita for many days," she says[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/actor-shilpi-marwaha-alleges-she-quit-asmita-theatre-group-after-founder-arvind-gaurs-advances-gaur-denies-charge/articleshow/58461003.cms]

'''''Big Apple Comix''''' is an early independent comic book published by [[Flo Steinberg]] in 1975. A historically important link between [[underground comix]] and what would later be called [[alternative comics]], this 36-page, 6{{fraction|3|4}}" × 9{{fraction|3|4}}" hybrid with glossy color covers and black-and-white interiors contains 11 sometimes sexually frank stories by such mainstream creators as [[Neal Adams]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Denny O'Neil]], [[Herb Trimpe]], [[Al Williamson]], and [[Wally Wood]]. Most of its stories revolve around [[New York City]] (colloquially known as "[[The Big Apple]]") during a particularly low ebb in the city's finances, crime situation, race relations, and infrastructure.

==Publication history==
The [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book was among a handful of 1960s-1970s precursors of the independently produced comics that first proliferated with the 1980s rise of "[[direct market]]" comic-book stores. Other such early links between [[underground comix]] and modern independents include [[Mike Friedrich]]'s ''[[Star Reach|Star*Reach]]'' and Wood's own ''[[witzend]]''. Critic Ken Jones, in a 1986 retrospective review, suggested  that ''Big Apple Comix'' and [[Mark Evanier]]'s ''High Adventure'' may have been "the first true alternative comics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Jones|first=Ken|title=(review)|work= [[Amazing Heroes]]| number=89|date= February 15, 1986}} Cited in {{cite web|last=Dunchak |first=Lee |url=http://www.cosmiccomix.com/comics/Amazing%20heroes/b_index.htm |title=Buried Treasures of the Month |publisher=The Back Issue Bin (column), CosmicComix.con |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029033126/http://www.cosmiccomix.com/comics/Amazing%20heroes/b_index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic featured writer-editor Goodwin displaying his [[cartoonist]] abilities; Adams and a fledgling [[Larry Hama]] sharing vertically split pages to parallel a street [[prostitute]] with a [[corporation|corporate]] [[secretary]] using sex to further her career; and Wood's story "My Word",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Early%20Independents.htm | first=Richard J.|last=Arndt| title=''Big Apple Comix''|publisher= (entry), ''The Early Independents''|date=August 20, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140648/http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Early%20Independents.htm | archivedate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bitter parody of the [[Al Feldstein]]-scripted "My World" that Wood illustrated in [[EC Comics]]' ''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' #22 (Dec. 1953). [[Linda Fite]] and [[John Verpoorten]] handled production work for the comic,{{cn|date=July 2017}} released with an [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] date of September 1975.

Steinberg printed 20,000 copies. [[Warren Publishing]], for which she ran its mail-order Captain Company division, allowed her to store inventory in the company's storage space. She recalled in 1984 that, "I did make my expenses and a little besides." Afterward, the men's magazine ''Cheri'' and the French magazine ''L'Echo'' each reprinted "My Word" and "Over &amp; Under", with Steinberg passing along the reprint fees to the creators.&lt;ref name=CI59&gt;Steinberg in {{cite news| authorlink1=Jim Salicrup |first1=Jim|last1=Salicrup|first2=Dwight Jon|last2=Zimmerman| title=Fabulous Flo Steinberg| work=[[Comics Interview]] | issue=17 | date=November 1984|page=73|publisher=[[Fictioneer Books]]| location= New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Broadcast engineering''' is the field of [[electrical engineering]], and now to some extent [[computer engineering]] and [[information technology]], which deals with [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcasting]].  [[Audio engineering]] and [[RF engineering]] are also essential parts of broadcast engineering, being their own [[subset]]s of electrical engineering.

Broadcast engineering involves both the [[Television studio|studio]] and [[transmitter]] aspects (the entire [[airchain]]), as well as [[remote broadcast]]s.  Every [[Broadcast network|station]] has a broadcast [[engineer]], though one may now serve an entire station group in a city. In small [[media market]]s the engineer may work on a [[contract]] basis for one or more stations as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careerplanning.about.com/cs/occupations/p/broadcst_sound.htm |title=about.com - Broadcast Technician or Sound Engineering Technician: Career Information |publisher=Careerplanning.about.com |date=2010-11-08 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==

Modern duties of a broadcast engineer include maintaining [[broadcast automation]] systems for the studio and [[automatic transmission system]]s for the transmitter [[physical plant|plant]].  There are also important duties regarding [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]]s, which must be [[Preventive maintenance|maintain]]ed with proper [[lighting]] and [[painting]].  Occasionally a station's engineer must deal with [[complaint]]s of [[RF interference]], particularly after a station has made changes to its transmission facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos109.htm |title=U.S. Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics - Broadcast and Sound Engineering Technicians and Radio Operators |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skillset.org/tv/jobs/Studio_Broadcast/article_5477_1.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508172948/http://www.skillset.org/tv/jobs/Studio_Broadcast/article_5477_1.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-08 |title=Transmission Engineer - TV |publisher=skillset |date=2012-07-25 |accessdate=2013-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles==

Broadcast engineers may have varying titles depending on their level of [[expert]]ise and field specialty. Some widely used titles include:
* Broadcast [[design engineer]]
* Broadcast Integration Engineer
* Broadcast [[systems engineering|systems engineer]]
* Broadcast [[information technology|IT]] engineer
* Broadcast [[information technology|IT]] [[systems engineering|systems engineer]]
* Broadcast [[network engineer]]
* Broadcast [[maintenance engineering|maintenance engineer]]
* [[Video]] broadcast engineer
* [[Television studio|TV studio]] broadcast engineer
* [[Outside broadcasting|Outside broadcast]] engineer
* [[Remote broadcast]] engineer

==Qualifications==

Broadcast engineers may need to possess some or all of the following [[degree (education)|degree]]s, depending on the broadcast technical environment. If one of the formal qualifications is not present, a related degree or equivalent professional experience is desirable.
* Degree in [[electrical engineering]]
* Degree in [[electronic engineering]]
* Degree in [[telecommunications engineering]]
* Degree in [[computer engineering]]
* Degree in [[management information system]]
* Degree in broadcast technology

===Knowledge===

Broadcast engineers are generally required to have knowledge in the following areas, from conventional video broadcast systems to modern Information Technology:

* Conventional broadcast
** Audio/Video [[instrumentation]] [[measurement]]
** [[Baseband]] [[video]] – standard / [[high-definition video|high-definition]]
** Broadcast studio [[acoustics]]
** [[Television studio]]s - broadcast [[video camera]]s and [[camera lens]]es
** [[Vision mixer|Production switcher]] (Video mixer)
** [[Mixing console|Audio mixer]]
* Broadcast IT
** [[Video compression]] - [[DV25]], [[MPEG]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] or [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] (or [[ISDB]])
** Digital server [[playout]] technologies. - [[VDCP]], Louth, [[Harris Corporation|Harris]], control protocols
** [[Broadcast automation]]
** [[Disk storage]] – [[RAID]] / [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] / [[Storage area network|SAN]] technologies.
** Archives – [[Tape archive]]s or [[grid storage]] technologies.
** [[Computer networking]]
** [[Operating system]]s – [[Microsoft Windows]] / [[macOS]] / [[Linux]] / [[real-time operating system|RTOS]]
** [[Post production]] – [[video capture]] and [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLEs).
*RF
** RF [[satellite uplink]]ing – High-powered amplifiers (HPA)
** RF [[communications satellite]] [[downlink]]ing – Band detection, [[carrier wave|carrier]] detection and [[integrated receiver/decoder|IRD]] tuning, etc.
**  RF transmitter maintenance - IOT UHF transmitters, solid state VHF transmitters, solid state MF transmitters (AM radio), tube type VHF and MF transmitters. antennas, transmission line, high power filters, digital modulators, towers, tower lighting systems, backup generators.
*Health and safety
** [[Occupational safety and health]]
** [[Firefighting|Fire suppression]] systems like [[1,1,1,2,3,3,3-Heptafluoropropane|FM 200]].
** Basic [[structural engineering]]
** [[Radio frequency|RF]] hazard mitigation

Above mentioned requirements vary from station to station.

==Digital engineering==

The conversion to [[Digital data|digital]] broadcasting means broadcast engineers must now be well-versed in [[digital television]] and [[digital radio]], in addition to [[analog signal|analogue]] principles. New equipment from the transmitter to the [[radio antenna]] to the receiver may be encountered by engineers new to the field.  Furthermore, modern techniques place a greater demand on an engineer's expertise, such as [[sharing]] [[broadcast tower]]s or [[radio antenna]]s among different stations ([[diplexing]]).

[[Digital audio]] and [[digital video]] have revolutionized broadcast engineering in many respects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhp-interactive.org/tutorial/dtv-intro/dtv-transmission.shtml Interactive TV Web. ''Broadcast Engineering Basics''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505004655/http://mhp-interactive.org/tutorial/dtv-intro/dtv-transmission.shtml |date=May 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast [[studio]]s and [[control room]]s are now already digital in large part, using [[non-linear editing]] and [[digital signal processing]] for what used to take a great deal of time or money, if it was even possible at all.  [[Mixing console]]s for both [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]] are continuing to become more digital in the 2000s, as is the [[computer storage]] used to keep digital media [[libraries]].  [[Effects processing]] and [[TV graphics]] can now be realized much more easily and professionally as well.

With the broadcast industry's shift to IP-based production and content delivery technology (sometimes referred as [[Broadcast 3.0]]) not only the production technology and workflows are changing, but also the requirements for broadcast engineers, which now include [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP-networking]] knowhow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tony|first1=Orme|title=Understanding IP Networks|url=https://www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/6303/understanding-ip-networks-introduction|website=thebroadcastbridge.com|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other devices used in broadcast engineering are [[telephone hybrid]]s, [[broadcast delay]]s, and [[dead air]] [[alarm]]s.  See the [[glossary of broadcast engineering terms]] for further explanations.

==Engineering services==

Broadcast stations often call upon outside engineering services for certain needs.  For example, because [[structural engineering]] is generally not a direct part of broadcast engineering, [[tower]] companies usually [[design]] broadcast towers.

Other companies specialize in both broadcast engineering and [[broadcast law]], which are both essential when making an application to a national [[broadcasting authority]] for a [[construction permit]] or [[broadcast license]].  This is especially critical in [[North America]], where stations bear the entire burden of proving that their proposed facilities will not cause interference and are the best use of the [[radio spectrum]].  Such companies now have special [[software]] that can map projected [[radio propagation]] and [[terrain shielding]], as well as [[lawyer]]s that will [[legal defense|defend]] the applications before the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), or the equivalent authorities in some other countries.

'''Cálico Electrónico: La Serie Flash''' was a series of Flash animations created by Nikodemo Animation in 2004.

Set in 'Electronic City', its protagonist is a superhero far from the 'classic' hero profile: a short, chubby and not-powered Spanish man ('aspañol' as is called in the series). He risks his life time and again to save the city, using gadgets picked up at the Electronicaweb store.

A chapter usually develops this way: a monster or a criminal attacks the city, Cálico tries to stop it (always unsuccessfully), goes to Electronicaweb, gets a new gadget and saves the day. Some "[[bloopers]]" are displayed during the credits, at the end of the episode.

Although the series displays many humorous events, the episodes include much Spanish foul language, so viewer discretion is advised.

Even though Cálico is the main character, many side series have run with it, featuring many characters from the original series.

On June 4, 2009 Nikodemo Animation was shut down completely by its owners due to bankruptcy, which meant the cancellation of all in-progress Cálico Electrónico series' related content, including, but not limited to Rumbarola and animation series.

'''''Datastorm''''' is a {{vgy|1989}} [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] game for the [[Amiga]]. Written by Søren Grønbech, it was inspired by the ''[[Defender (arcade game)|Defender]]'' arcade game and the ''Defender''-like ''[[Dropzone]]'' for the [[Commodore 64]].&lt;ref name="sodan"/&gt; The gameplay deviates from ''Defender'' in that the task on each level is to carry the 8 pods through a portal, with points upon completing a level for each one saved. The points increase for each level: on levels 5, 9, 13 and so on, the player gets a new set of eight and the scoring resets.

The number of [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] moving smoothly around the screen is noteworthy.{{cn|date=July 2016}} Some, including the Datastorm itself, cover almost the entire length of the screen.

==Reception==
Julian Rignall, writing for ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' in 1989, called ''Datastorm'' "the best shoot 'em up yet seen out of a coin-op cabinet."&lt;ref name="cvg"/&gt; The overall review score was 95%.

'''''Dragons et princesses''''' (''Dragons and Princesses'') is a [[2010 in television|2010]] [[Television in France|French]] [[computer animation]] [[television program]] [[Screenwriter|written]], [[storyboard]]ed and [[Television director|directed]] by [[Michel Ocelot]] and produced at Studio O for [[Canal+]]. It is a [[fairy tale]] [[anthology series]] of ten further 13-minute episodes in the format established in ''[[Ciné si]]''. Five of the episodes are edited, with a feature-exclusive sixth, into the 2011 [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[compilation movie]] ''[[Tales of the Night (2011 film)|Tales of the Night]]''.

==Production==
The series, which Ocelot also [[Voice acting|voice acted]] in, co-[[Television producer|produced]], [[art director|art directed]] and [[Graphic design|designed]],&lt;ref name="Nord" /&gt; returns to the format of short [[silhouette animation]] [[fairy tale]]s established by 1989's ''[[Ciné si]]'' and continued in 1992's ''[[Tales of the Night]]'' to produce further stories originally conceived for the then-unsuccessful ''Ciné si'', episodes of which have since enjoyed popularity in the form of the compilation movie ''Princes and Princesses''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Silhouette Film|last=Jouvanceau|first=Pierre|others=Trans. Kitson |year=2004|series=Pagine di Chiavari|publisher=Le Mani|location=[[Genoa]]|isbn=88-8012-299-1|page=54|quote=[…] episodes of the series ''Ciné si'' […] were re-edited as a feature film, given the title ''Princes et princesses'' and distributed by Gébéka Films […], enjoying a resounding success in the cinema.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least as early as September 2006, when ''[[Azur &amp; Asmar: The Princes' Quest]]'' was previewing in France, Ocelot was mentioning in interviews that he was planning to return to silhouettes and the anthology format with a project then planned to be titled ''Bergères et Dragons'' (''Shepherdesses and Dragons'') and released in 2008 but wavered on whether it would it take the format of a feature film or television series and if it would consist of a combination of existing and new or all-new footage (the title suggests the inclusion of the "Bergère qui danse" segment of the earlier ''Tales of the Night'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nardoux|first=Rémy|title=''Azur et Asmar''|url=http://www.fousdanim.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=40086&amp;sid=ff5636a972a7073f30016b9d794d071e#p40086|work=Fous d'anim|accessdate=11 May 2011|date=13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, 2008 saw the inclusion of these earlier silhouette films in the ''Les Trésors cachés de Michel Ocelot'' short film collection and the new project, set back by production of several others, was announced in June 2010 as taking its eventual form of both a television series of ten new silhouette films and a new ''Tales of the Night'' for movie theaters drawn from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=StudioCanal backs 3D Ocelot pic|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020349?refCatId=3599|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|accessdate=11 May 2011|author2=Elsa Keslassy |date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dragons'' also notably sees him return to working with once-regular composer Christian Maire,&lt;ref name="Annecy" /&gt; who had last scored ''Ciné si'' for him two decades ago, and is the first production animated by his own Studio O in [[Paris]], which previously had covered only [[pre-production]] for projects animated at larger [[animation studio]]s. A total of over 300 characters and 800 sets were designed for the project,&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt; which was animated by a team of five&lt;ref name="Nord" /&gt; in [[Autodesk Maya]].&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt;

==Release==
At least two of the episodes had pre-television [[premiere]]s, with "L'Élue de la Ville d'or" ("The Electress of the City of Gold") screening at the ''Festival international de cinéma d'animation de [[Meknes|Meknès]]'' in May 2010 and "Le Garçon qui ne mentait jamais" ("The Boy Who Never Lied") in competition for the ''Cristal'' for best TV production at the [[Annecy International Animation Film Festival]] in June, for which it lost out to [[Studio Soi]]'s "Der Kleine und das Biest" ("The Little Boy and the Beast") but was instead given a special award for a television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 34th International Animation Film Festival Awards|url=http://www.annecy.org/the-event/archives/awards-2010|publisher=Cité de l'image en mouvement|accessdate=October 24, 2010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series then began its run on the [[Satellite television|satellite]] and [[Cable television|cable]] channel [[Canal+]] Family with the first episode, "La Maîtresse des monstres" ("The Mistress of Monsters"), on October 25 at 20:25, being broadcast in the same time slot each weekday until all ten episodes had been aired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grille TV|url=http://www.canalplus.fr/pid3246-grille-tv.html|publisher=Canal+|accessdate=24 October 2010|language=French|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last on November 5.&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt;

Two picture books drawn from two other episodes, "Le Loup-garou" ("The [[Werewolf]]") and "Ti Jean et la belle-sans-connaître" ("[[Loa|Ti Jean]] and the Beauty-That-Didn't-Know-It"), have been published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recueil ''Dragons et princesses''|url=http://www.nathan.fr/_includes/catalogue_detail_familles.asp?ean13=9782092528990|publisher=Nathan|accessdate=October 24, 2010|language=French|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[DVD-Video]] of the series was released in France on November 30, 2010. It is [[DVD region code|region 2]]-locked and the only subtitles are French-language [[Closed captioning|caption]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Dragons et princesses''|url=http://www.dvdfr.com/dvd/f50158-dragons-et-princesses.html|publisher=DVDFr|accessdate=October 24, 2010|year=2010|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dream Boy''''' is a 2008 gay-themed [[Southern Gothic]] [[drama film]] written and directed by James Bolton and based on [[Jim Grimsley]]'s 1995 [[Dream Boy|novel of the same name]] about two gay teenagers who fall in love in the rural South during the late 1970s. It stars [[Stephan Bender]] and Max Roeg.

==Plot==
Fifteen-year-old Nathan Davies ([[Stephan Bender]]) moves to [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], a small Southern town with his parents ([[Thomas Jay Ryan]] and [[Diana Scarwid]]) and starts to befriend the older boy next door, Roy (Maximillian Roeg), fellow high school student and bus driver, who is in a relationship with Evelyn ([[Rooney Mara]]). Nathan and Roy start to develop their relationship by helping each other with school work at Nathan's house. While Roy is teaching Nathan how to solve an algebra problem, Nathan touches his hand. Roy pulls away at first, but then takes hold of Nathan's hand.

After they finish their work, the boys go for a walk in the woods, finding an old cemetery, where they stop and start kissing. They undress down to everything but socks and underwear, and lie in an embrace together. The relationship between Nathan and his father is revealed to be a little strange and full of tension. One morning Roy pulls the bus into a part in the woods and they kiss and Nathan touches Roy. Roy asks if Nathan has ever done this with anyone before, and he promises he never has. Roy takes Nathan swimming with Burke and Randy, but Nathan admits he can't swim. While watching Roy, Burke threatens to throw him in the water, but Roy stops him. While Roy is driving them home, he pulls onto the side of the road and they start kissing. When Nathan starts to have sex with Roy, Roy angrily stops him, asking "who taught [him] to screw like that". Nathan swears "no one".

When Nathan gets home that night, his father wants to know if he had a good time. Nathan is on the brink of tears as he answers his father. He ties a string up to his dresser drawer and bedpost, tucks his pillows under his sheets, and moves to the floor to sleep. In the night he hears a thud and runs from his room, because it's his father sneaking in. It is later revealed that his father had touched him in the past inappropriately. Nathan sleeps outside and comes home only for meals, but returns to his tree outside after eating.

Roy finds him and offers him a place to sleep in his family's barn. The next morning, Nathan goes home for breakfast and his father catches him, yelling at him to not run from him, but Nathan's mother interrupts and he runs to the school bus. Later, Roy tells Nathan they're going camping with Burke and Randy that weekend. That night, Roy tells ghost stories around the campfire, and in their tent, Nathan gives Roy a [[blowjob]], and Roy asks him if he minds when Roy doesn't do those things back to him, and Nathan says he doesn't mind. Hiking through the woods, the boys find an old plantation house. They go inside to investigate, and Nathan hears a voice call his name, resembling his father's. They then find cloth with what looks like to be blood on it, and they smell sulfur (which Nathan says is the smell of the Devil), and the boys see a shadow move up the stairs.

Burke takes the flashlight from Roy and goes to investigate with Randy. Roy and Nathan go into a bedroom and talk, and Nathan says he feels as if he'll never leave that house. He hears the voice again and Roy goes to see if the guys are back. Nathan sees his father and closes his eyes tight, when Roy enters the room again. He tells Nathan not to look at whatever he's seeing anymore and kisses him. Roy gets down on his knees and proceeds to [[Fellatio|fellate]] Nathan, when Burke and Randy find them. Roy storms out of the room, and Nathan hears the voice again, and is suddenly knocked unconscious. A shadow of a person carries him up the stairs.

In the attic, Burke rapes Nathan, and realizing what he's done, disgusted with himself, he breaks an arm off a rocking chair and knocks Nathan over the head with it. Blood starts pooling on the floor beneath Nathan's head, and Burke leaves him in the attic. When Roy and Randy find Nathan early the next morning, he appears to be dead. Roy tells Randy to go on and find Burke, whom he says he doesn't believe at this point about what happened. Roy cries once Randy leaves, then Roy leaves too. The police arrive, bringing Nathan's father who tearfully covers Nathan's face with a blanket.

Nathan awakens from a coma, or resurrected if he died, gets up and leaves the plantation house. He wanders for a long time still dazed from the blow to his head. Finally he sees Roy coming out of Sunday evening church, but Roy is with his family, so Nathan wanders around some more waiting for Roy to get home. Nathan's mother leaves his father, and Nathan, his head now clear, finds Roy crying in the barn where Nathan slept while hiding from his father. As Roy looks up, he sees Nathan and hugs him.

At the end of the story, Roy is driving the bus and looks in the mirror to an empty seat, but when he looks a second time, Nathan is there smiling at him.

The movie departs from the novel and leaves the impression that Nathan is truly dead, and that the previous scenes were a wishful dream sequence of one of the two boy lovers, presumably Roy. In the book this scene does not take place. The book has the boys meeting in the yard of Roy's church, running together into the woods to talk things over, and deciding to run away together since Roy has been seen sucking Nathan by both Burke and Randy, and both boys will surely will be outed to their families and the whole community. The book ends with: "They hear the voices of people searching for them in the woods. They stand and go. They never look back."

The '''Eurovision Choir of the Year''' is a biennial [[choir|choral]] competition, inspired by the [[World Choir Games]] and  organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and the [[Interkultur Foundation]]. It is open to broadcasters that are [[European Broadcasting Union#Members|members of the EBU]]. The inaugural competition took place on 22 July 2017, in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]].

== Origins ==
The Eurovision Choir of the Year is a new event being launched by the EBU, and the latest event to be launched since the [[Eurovision Magic Circus Show 2010]]. The event will consist of non-professional choirs who are members of the EBU, with the inaugural contest scheduled to take place on 22 July 2017, hosted by the Latvian broadcaster [[Latvijas Televīzija]] (LTV), and to coincide with the closing ceremony of the European Choir Games 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=EBU to launch "Choir of the Year" contest|url=http://eurovoix.com/2016/08/08/ebu-launch-choir-year/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was officially confirmed on 30 November 2016 depending on a reasonable amount of interest from active members of the European Broadcasting Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trustram|first1=Matthew|title=Choir of the Year 2017|url=http://www.ebu.ch/contents/projects/tv/music/choir-of-the-year-1.html|website=ebu.ch|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July 2017, it was announced that the Eurovision Choir of the Year would be a biennial contest unless viewing figures were higher than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/07/21/eurovision-choir-year-scheduled-biennial-contest/|title=Eurovision Choir of the Year Scheduled to be a Biennial Contest|date=21 July 2017|first=Anthony|last=Granger|website=eurovoix.com|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the Eurovision Choir of the Year was first discussed in 2014 as a contest organized by the Latvian national broadcaster, [[Latvijas Televizija]] (LTV), and the network [[Arte]], following the positive reception of "Born in Riga", a concert organized by LTV. LTV approached multiple broadcasters including the EBU and Interkultur regarding the organization of a new contest reaching a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/07/19/concept-eurovision-choir-year-first-discussed-2014/|title=Concept for Eurovision Choir of the Year Was First Discussed in 2014|date=19 July 2017|website=eurovoix.com|first=Anthony|last=Granger|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The choir members of the EBU will compete for the title of the Eurovision Choir of the Year, with prizes including a recording contract for the winning choir. Each choir performs an unaccompanied ensemble of six minutes in any genre and is judged by a high-level jury who decide the winner.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

'''''Exalted''''' is a [[comic book]] title produced by [[UDON]] Entertainment Corporation, based on the [[role-playing game]] [[Exalted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Exalted Comic Book Series Coming from UDON Entertainment (press release) | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=5035 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 17, 2005 | accessdate=2009-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UDON published six issues of ''Exalted'' between 2005 and 2007.

The series follows a newly exalted Solar named Kidale, and includes in its cast several characters who had previously appeared in other works, such as Demetheus (from Castebook: Dawn) and Faka Kun (from Castebook: Night).  The brief storyline covers events from Kidale's Exaltation to his eventual death during a Wyld Hunt; while the story itself stops there, the events of it are occasionally referenced through the pre-chapter comics of the second edition of the RPG by the same name, until ''Return of the Scarlet Empress.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29009">[[Combinatorial game theory]] has several ways of [[Computational complexity theory|measuring]] '''game [[complexity]]'''. This article describes five of them: state-space complexity, game tree size, decision complexity, game-tree complexity, and computational complexity.

==Measures of game complexity==

=== State-space complexity ===
The '''state-space complexity''' of a game is the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game.&lt;ref name="Allis1994"/&gt;

When this is too hard to calculate, an [[upper bound]] can often be computed by including illegal positions or positions that can never arise in the course of a game.

=== Game tree size ===
The '''game tree size''' is the total number of possible games that can be played: the number of leaf nodes in the [[game tree]] rooted at the game's initial position.

The game tree is typically vastly larger than the state space because the same positions can occur in many games by making moves in a different order (for example, in a [[tic-tac-toe]] game with two X and one O on the board, this position could have been reached in two different ways depending on where the first X was placed). An upper bound for the size of the game tree can sometimes be computed by simplifying the game in a way that only increases the size of the game tree (for example, by allowing illegal moves) until it becomes tractable.

However, for games where the number of moves is not limited (for example by the size of the board, or by a rule about repetition of position) the game tree is infinite.

=== Decision trees ===
The next two measures use the idea of a ''[[decision tree]]'', which is a subtree of the game tree, with each position labelled with "player A wins", "player B wins" or "drawn", if that position can be proved to have that value (assuming best play by both sides) by examining only other positions in the graph.  (Terminal positions can be labelled directly; a position with player A to move can be labelled "player A wins" if any successor position is a win for A, or labelled "player B wins" if all successor positions are wins for B, or labelled "draw" if all successor positions are either drawn or wins for B.  And correspondingly for positions with B to move.)

==== Decision complexity ====
'''Decision complexity''' of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.

==== Game-tree complexity ====
The '''game-tree complexity''' of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest ''full-width'' decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.&lt;ref name="Allis1994"/&gt; A full-width tree includes all nodes at each depth.

This is an estimate of the number of positions one would have to evaluate in a [[minimax]] search to determine the value of the initial position.

It is hard even to estimate the game-tree complexity, but for some games a reasonable lower bound can be given by raising the game's average [[branching factor]] to the power of the number of [[Ply (chess)|plies]] in an average game, or:

&lt;math&gt;GTC \geq b^d&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Computational complexity ===
The '''[[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]''' of a game describes the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] difficulty of a game as it grows arbitrarily large, expressed in [[big O notation]] or as membership in a [[complexity class]]. This concept doesn't apply to particular games, but rather to games that have been [[generalized game|generalized]] so they can be made arbitrarily large, typically by playing them on an ''n''-by-''n'' board. (From the point of view of computational complexity a game on a fixed size of board is a finite problem that can be solved in O(1), for example by a look-up table from positions to the best move in each position.)

The asymptotic complexity is defined by the most efficient (in terms of whatever [[computational resource]] one is considering) algorithm for solving the game; the most common complexity measure ([[computation time]]) is always lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity, since a solution algorithm must work for every possible state of the game. It will be upper-bounded by the complexities of each individual algorithm for the family of games. Similar remarks apply to the second-most commonly used complexity measure, the amount of [[DSPACE|space]] or [[computer memory]] used by the computation. It is not obvious that there is any lower bound on the space complexity for a typical game, because the algorithm need not store game states; however many games of interest are known to be [[PSPACE-hard]], and it follows that their space complexity will be lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity as well (technically the bound is only a polynomial in this quantity; but it is usually known to be linear).
* The [[depth-first search|depth-first]] [[minimax strategy]] will use [[computation time]] proportional to game's tree-complexity, since it must explore the whole tree, and an amount of memory polynomial in the logarithm of the tree-complexity, since the algorithm must always store one node of the tree at each possible move-depth, and the number of nodes at the highest move-depth is precisely the tree-complexity.
* [[Backward induction]] will use both memory and time proportional to the state-space complexity as it must compute and record the correct move for each possible position.

==Example: tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses)==
For [[tic-tac-toe]], a simple upper bound for the size of the state space is 3&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 19,683. (There are three states for each cell and nine cells.) This count includes many illegal positions, such as a position with five crosses and no noughts, or a position in which both players have a row of three. A more careful count, removing these illegal positions, gives 5,478. And when rotations and reflections of positions are considered identical, there are only 765 essentially different positions.

A simple upper bound for the size of the game tree is 9! = 362,880. (There are nine positions for the first move, eight for the second, and so on.) This includes illegal games that continue after one side has won. A more careful count gives 255,168 possible games. When rotations and reflections of positions are considered the same, there are only 26,830 possible games.

The computational complexity of tic-tac-toe depends on how it is [[generalized game|generalized]]. A natural generalization is to [[m,n,k-game|''m'',''n'',''k''-games]]: played on an ''m'' by ''n'' board with winner being the first player to get ''k'' in a row. It is immediately clear that this game can be solved in [[DSPACE]](''mn'') by searching the entire game tree. This places it in the important complexity class [[PSPACE]]. With some more work it can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]].&lt;ref name="Reisch1980"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stefan Reisch | title = Gobang ist PSPACE-vollständig (Gobang is PSPACE-complete) | journal = Acta Informatica | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | year = 1980 | doi=10.1007/bf00288536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complexities of some well-known games==
Due to the large size of game complexities, this table gives the ceiling of their [[logarithm]] to base 10.  (In other words, the number of digits).  All of the following numbers should be considered with caution: seemingly-minor changes to the rules of a game can change the numbers (which are often rough estimates anyway) by tremendous factors, which might easily be much greater than the numbers shown.

'''Harold Arlen''' (born '''Hyman Arluck'''; February 15, 1905 – April 23, 1986) was an American [[composer]] of popular music who composed over 500 songs, a number of which have become known worldwide. In addition to composing the songs for the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (lyrics by [[Yip Harburg|E.Y. Harburg]]), including the classic "[[Over the Rainbow]]", Arlen is a highly regarded contributor to the [[Great American Songbook]]. "Over the Rainbow" was voted the 20th century's No. 1 song by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haroldarlen.com/honors.html |title=Honors &amp; Awards|publisher=Haroldarlen.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/07/365.songs/index.html |title=New song list puts 'Rainbow' way up high – CNN |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date=2001-03-07 |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707102641/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/07/365.songs/index.html |archivedate=2009-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Arlen was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], United States, the child of a [[hazzan|cantor]]. His twin brother died the next day. He learned to play the [[piano]] as a youth, and formed a band as a young man. He achieved some local success as a pianist and singer before moving to [[New York City]] in his early twenties, where he worked as an accompanist in vaudeville&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurie |first=Joe, Jr. |authorlink=Joe Laurie, Jr. |title=Vaudeville: From the Honky Tonks to the Palace |location=New York |publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt]] |year=1953 |page=328 |asin=B000NRYS3A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changed his name to Harold Arlen. Between 1926 and about 1934, Arlen appeared occasionally as a band vocalist on records by [[The Buffalodians]], [[Red Nichols]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Leo Reisman]], and [[Eddie Duchin]], usually singing his own compositions.

In 1929, Arlen composed his first well-known song: "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" (with lyrics by [[Ted Koehler]]). Throughout the early and mid-1930s, Arlen and Koehler wrote shows for the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]], a popular [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] night club, as well as for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musicals]] and [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] [[musical film|films]]. Arlen and Koehler's partnership resulted in a number of hit songs, including the familiar standards "[[Let's Fall in Love]]" and "[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]".  Arlen continued to perform as a pianist and vocalist with some success, most notably on records with [[Leo Reisman]]'s society dance orchestra.

Arlen's compositions have always been popular with [[jazz]] musicians because of his facility at incorporating a [[blues]] feeling into the idiom of the  American popular song.

In the mid-1930s, Arlen married, and spent increasing time in California, writing for movie musicals. It was at this time that he began working with lyricist [[Yip Harburg|E. Y. "Yip" Harburg]]. In 1938, the team was hired by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to compose songs for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', the most famous of which is "[[Over the Rainbow]]", for which they won the [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song]]. They also wrote "[[Down with Love (song)|Down with Love]]" (featured in the 1937 Broadway show ''[[Hooray for What!]]''), "[[Lydia the Tattooed Lady]]", for Groucho Marx in ''[[At the Circus]]'' in 1939, and "[[Happiness is a Thing Called Joe]]", for [[Ethel Waters]] in the 1943 movie ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]''.

Arlen was a longtime friend and onetime roommate of actor [[Ray Bolger]], who starred in ''The Wizard of Oz''.

In the 1940s, he teamed up with lyricist [[Johnny Mercer]], and continued to write hit songs like "[[Blues in the Night]]", "[[Out of This World (Johnny Mercer song)|Out of this World]]", "[[That Old Black Magic]]", "[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive]]", "[[Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home]]", "[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]" and "[[One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)]]".

Arlen composed two defining tunes which bookend [[Judy Garland]]'s musical persona: as a yearning, innocent girl in "Over the Rainbow" and a world-weary, "chic chanteuse" with "[[The Man That Got Away]]", the last written for the 1954 version of the film ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]''.

Arlen died of cancer at his Manhattan apartment at the age of eighty-one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/24/obituaries/harold-arlen-composer-of-song-standards.html |title=Harold Arlen, Composer of Song Standards |first=Eric |last=Pace |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 24, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/19/come-rain-or-come-shine |title=Come Rain or Come Shine |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=September 19, 2005 |issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 2009, Flair returned to the ring as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] on the Hulkamania: Let the Battle Begin tour of Australia, losing to Hulk Hogan in the main event of the first show by brassknuckles.&lt;ref name=OWOW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/ric-flair.html|accessdate=August 29, 2008|title=OWOW profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan defeated Flair again on November 24 in Perth, Australia, after both men bled heavily.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Flair also lost to Hogan on the two remaining matches on the tour.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_36909.shtml|title=11/21 Hulkamania Tour in Melbourne: Very detailed report on Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair's first matches back, Hogan and Flair bleed heavily, Undercard matches re-create Attitude Era|last=Pilone|first=Antonio|date=November 21, 2009|work=PWTorch|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21 [[Lacey Von Erich]] won a bikini contest, which also included Koa Marie Turner, Stephanie Pietz and Kiara Dillon. She also interfered in the main event between Hogan and [[Ric Flair]], on Flair's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_36909.shtml|title=11/21 Hulkamania Tour in Melbourne: Very detailed report on Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair's first matches back, Hogan and Flair bleed heavily, Undercard matches re-create Attitude Era|last=Pilone|first=Antonio|date=2009-11-21|accessdate=2009-11-21|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other matches on the tour she was used as Flair's manager.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

There was talk of another tour in China and other parts of Asia, however after the unsuccessful Australian tour, those plans fell through.

==Home Release==
Despite having television cameras present, this event has never been released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2010/0225/526053/hulkamania-tour-company-bankrupt/|title='Hulkamania Tour' Company Bankrupt|last=|first=|date=2010-10-25|accessdate=2010-10-25|publisher=Wrestling Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company behind the tour filed for bankruptcy shortly after the final event and the advertised DVD of the tour is not expected to be released. Hogan reportedly wouldn't allow them to market the DVD until the promoters paid him money he was still owed for the tour. The show was scheduled to air in Australia not long after the events took place but they were also cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sescoops.com/hulkamania-tour-company-bankrupt-orlando-jordan-storyline/|title=Hulkamania Tour Company Bankrupt, Orlando Jordan Storyline|last=|first=|date=2010-10-25|accessdate=2010-10-25|publisher=SE Scoops.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish Film Classification Office''' ('''IFCO''') ({{lang-ga|Oifig Aicmithe Scannán na hÉireann, OASÉ}}) is the organisation responsible for films, television programmes, and some video game classification and censorship within [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Where restrictions are placed by the IFCO, they are legally binding.

Prior to 21 July 2008, the office was branded as the ''Irish Film Censor's Office'', and was previously known as simply the ''Film Censor's Office'', or, in legal references, the office of the ''Official Censor of Films'', which was the official title of the head of the office prior to that date. The head of the office is the '''Director of Film Classification'''.

==Background==
[[Image:IFCO 1962cover.jpg|thumb|1965 [[Cover (philately)|envelope]] sent to local office of [[20th Century Fox]] with '''certifying cachet''' of the Film Censor's Office]]
The Irish Film Censor's Office was set up in 1923, in accordance with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051205061510/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1923_23.html Censorship of Films Act, 1923]. This law was amended in [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1925/en/act/pub/0021/index.html 1925], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0013/index.html 1930], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0007/index.html 1970], and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0029/index.html 1992]; and a substantial revision of the law occurred in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051206051939/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989_22.html Video Recordings Act, 1989] which extended the remit of the office to the regulation of the video importation and supply industry. On 21 July 2008 the ''Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008'' came into force. Section 70 changes some of the provisions with regard censorship of films in the State. Section 71 renames the Film Censor as the Director of Film Classification and consequent to this, the Irish Film Censor's Office became the Irish Film Classification Office.

==Staff==
The office consists of 21 staff members:
*Acting Director of Film Classification – Ger Connolly
*Deputy Director – Vacant
*10 Assistant Classifiers
*Office Manager
*6 [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|Civil Servants]] from the [[Department of Justice and Equality]]
*2 Projectionists

The 10 assistant classifiers are paid €168 per day and are entitled to claim expenses on top of this. According to a [[Freedom of information legislation#Ireland|freedom of information]] request granted to the [[The Sunday Times#Irish edition|Irish edition of the ''Sunday Times'']] the assistant classifiers claimed €306,683 in fees and €52,569 of expenses in 2007; €339,608 in fees and €49,898 of expenses in 2008; and €162,263 in fees and €21,401 of expenses for the first half of 2009. This equates to a payment of approximately €60 per film rated.&lt;ref name="IST IFCO info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6982430.ece|title=Ex-politicians paid €40,000 to watch films|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]|first=Colin|last=Coyle|date=10 January 2010|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certificates==
===Introduction and early history===
Before 1965, there were no certificates and all films were tailored for a general audience, resulting in several bans and cuts (no doubt also due to extremely conservative societal standards). As of 2004, 2,500 theatrical films had been banned and about 11,000 cut, largely from before the overhaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rockett|first1=Kevin|title=Irish film censorship - an outline account|url=http://www.ifco.ie/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/lookupreports2/AA073005F7A0F95780256F020055DD28/$File/a+history.pdf?openelement|website=Irish Film Classification Office|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public controversy over the office's harsh methods came to a head in late 1964 - in 1963 alone, 31 films were rejected and 156 were cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Censorship of films|work=The Irish Times|date=11 February 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critically acclaimed hits were no exception - [[Dr. Strangelove]] was cut, including Ripper's reference to Communists trying to "sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids" with fluoridated water, and Irish-shot medical drama [[Of Human Bondage (1964 film)|Of Human Bondage]] was banned due to the heroine dying of syphilis.&lt;ref name=censor21111964&gt;{{cite news|title=End of "thaw" in film censorship?

The appointment of a new Justice Minister, [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]], in October 1964 coincided with this outrage. He met with the Cinema and Theatre Association in November to consider their views&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest over severe film censorship|work=The Irish Times|date=28 November 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even proposed to view recently banned films, including ''Of Human Bondage''.&lt;ref name=lenihan30111964&gt;{{cite news|title=Lenihan intervenes in film censorship: Will see banned films|work=The Irish Times|date=30 November 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister to see banned film|work=The Irish Times|date=4 December 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November, Lenihan announced he'd be appointing a new Film Appeals Board and would be able to reform censorship without changing existing legislation.&lt;ref name=lenihan30111964 /&gt; - film correspondent Fergus Linehan pointed out that the 1923 Act explicitly supported age certification:&lt;ref name=censor21111964 /&gt;

Lenihan announced the new Appeals board in January 1965, which came into effect on 18 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Films appeal board announced|work=The Irish Times|date=9 January 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their main task was to begin enforcing limited certificates (alongside the general certificate)&lt;ref name=historicaldocumentbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flynn|first1=Roderick|last2=Brereton|first2=Patrick|title=Historical Dictionary of Irish Cinema|date=30 July 2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810855577|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, which were as follows, according to the Appeals Board chairman:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maguire|first1=Conor P.|title=Film censorship in Ireland: Appeals chairman's views|work=The Irish Times|date=12 October 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Over 18'''
* '''Young persons under 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult'''
* '''Educational'''

All bar the last are still enforced today under different names.

===Cinematic certificates===
The current cinematic certificates were announced on December 2004 at the European Conference of Film Classifiers in [[Paris]] and introduced on 1 January 2005:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/news/censor-s-changes-to-film-certs-1.1169376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home video certificates ===
These were introduced on 1 September 1994:

* '''G''' – Fit for viewing by persons generally
* '''12RA''' – Fit for viewing by persons generally, but in the case of a child under 12 years, only in the company of a responsible adult.
* '''15''' – Fit for viewing by persons aged 15 or more.
* '''18''' – Fit for viewing by persons aged 18 or more.

From that date it was an offence to trade uncertified videos, which carried fines of up to £1000 and a maximum sentence of three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New labels to show video's suitability|work=The Irish Times|date=31 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Additional rates came in at £180 per rental title, £80 per sale title and £20 per advert/trailer. This limited the market, especially for London distributors whose releases previously went to Ireland automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foley|first1=Michael|title=Additional cost limits Ireland's video choice|work=The Irish Times|date=27 February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current certificates for home video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray that are issued are:

* '''G''' – General: Suitable for all
* '''PG''' – Suitable for general viewing, but parents are advised to watch with children younger than 12 years old.
* '''12''' – Suitable for people aged 12 and over, and not to be supplied to someone below that age.
* '''15''' – Suitable for people aged 15 and over, and not to be supplied to someone below that age.
* '''18''' – Suitable for people aged 18 and over, and not to be supplied to someone below that age.

A retired certificate only used on home video is:

* '''12RA''' (no longer issued) Not suitable for people aged younger than 12 unless they view with an adult, and not to be supplied to someone below that age. The "RA" stands for "Responsible Adult". Retired around 2003.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160315120336/http://www.ifco.ie/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/lookupreports2/1C09242E19D2559D80256EC1005CC251/$File/Film+Censors+Report+.pdf?openelement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.filmo.gs/release/42578-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard cinematic-home video certification crossover ===
This is the crossover, or change, in a certificate that will happen when a film which has been shown in cinemas, is released on home video, but this only applies if:

* There is no extra material (bonuses, trailers, etc.) which is not appropriate to the main feature, and would cause it to receive a higher certificate.
* The film has not been edited (material taken out, etc.) in a way which would cause the main feature to receive a lower certificate.

Examples of the former include [[Bullet to the Head]], [[Get Hard]] and the 40th anniversary edition of [[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]], which all received 15 certificates individually but whose overall releases are 18's due to additional material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewVideo/FA4F0012DE422F0980257B45007370B7?OpenDocument&amp;OpenUp=True&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bullet-Head-Blu-ray-Sylvester-Stallone/dp/B007433WLU/ref=ice_ac_b_dpb_twi_blu_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538828396&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bullet+to+the+head&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/web/SearchResults?opendocument&amp;Start=1&amp;Type=by%2Bvideo&amp;Query=get+hard*&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://i.postimg.cc/NMVsJf6G/s-l1600.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewVideo/9C409328C8580EC4802582E300735EB2?OpenDocument&amp;OpenUp=True&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Halloween-UHD-Blu-ray-Jamie-Curtis/dp/B07GRP8C3B/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538828463&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=halloween&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard crossovers are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Cinema certificate
!Home video certificate
|-
| G || G
|-
| PG || PG
|-
| 12A || 12
|-
| 15A || 15
|-
| 16 || 15/18
|-
| 18 || 18
|}
Note: The certificate "12RA" did not have a corresponding cinematic certificate, and thus, did not have a standard crossover (certain 12A films received the certificate before it was withdrawn in the mid 2000s).

If the two rules above apply to a film's home video release, then, generally, it will be re-rated completely, ''but'' this does not mean certificates will always coincide for all formats, as occasionally (usually the DVD or Blu-ray) one edition will contain extra features while the other does not, causing one to be re-rated, and the other to take a Standard Crossover (for instance, a film which received a 15A certificate in cinemas may have received a 15 certificate on VHS but an 18 certificate on DVD; usually DVDs in these circumstances would carry a label on the reverse, informing viewers of this).

====Home video====
[[Image:Irish film censor dvd stamp.jpg|thumb|right|A censor's stamp on a 2004 DVD]]
Until February 2009, the home video certificates were always the certificate surrounded by an octagon, followed by the words "FILM CENSOR'S OFFICE" and "OIFIG SCRÚDÓIR NA SCANNÁN", which were then surrounded by another, larger, octagon. The colours were cyan and white, but the order they appear in varied. Although the Office was renamed in July 2008, these continued to bear the old name until February 2009, when they were altered to read "IRISH FILM CLASSIFICATION OFFICE" and its Irish equivalent.

===Video games===
Unlike the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] in the UK, which prior to PEGI ratings becoming legally enforceable in the UK on 30 July 2012 rated video games that met certain criteria (such as very graphic violence), the Irish Film Censor's Office does not usually rate video games, leaving ratings to [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]], unless the game's content is deemed prohibitable under section 3 (1) of the Act.

IFCO ratings for video games were introduced in 2001 and retired in 2003. Although the Silent Hill Collection was released in 2006, it contained re-releases of the [[Silent Hill 2|second]] and [[Silent Hill 3|third]] games, which were rated and released in 2001 and 2003 respectively.

Only 9 games have ever been submitted to and rated by the IFCO:

Despite the lack of legally binding ratings, most (if not all) video game retailers attempt to prohibit the sale of PEGI 18+ rated games to people under the age of 18, and prior to PEGI ratings the same was done with BBFC 18 ratings on games (the same packaging is usually used in games sold in Ireland as in the UK).

The only prohibition notice for a video game was issued for ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/web/news?opendocument&amp;news=yes&amp;type=graphic&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeals ==
All decisions made with regard to certification, may be appealed for up to 6 months after the certificate is initially issued. An appeal is issued to the Classification of Films Appeal Board.

Works may also be submitted for re-classification after seven years since the original certification have passed ('''not''' an appeal ''per se'', but rather seen as an update of classification based on current standards).

The most recent example of a (failed) appeal is [[The First Purge]], which received an 18 certificate for ''strong bloody violence, sustained threat and disturbing scenes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewFilm/671B1E91BB983227802582C100301FF2?OpenDocument&amp;OpenUp=True&lt;/ref&gt; The distributor ([[Universal Pictures]]) argued the case for a 16 certificate:
{{Quote box
 |quote  = We would contend that the last two films in the franchise, in particular, are similar in tone and viscerality to the current film.{{ref|firsttwo|A}}

The First Purge is a thematic continuation of how a group of people must fight to survive a night of government-sanctioned mayhem. Similar to Anarchy and Election Year, The First Purge features intensely depicted violence and some gory imagery but has contextual justification. There are sustained scenes of threat in which the characters are terrorised by masked killers but the guidelines for a 16 classification on the IFCO suggest that strong horror and sustained threat may be acceptable in this category.

The violence is presented in an extremely stylised way in an equivalent manner to the earlier films in the franchise as well as similar titles like Atomic Blonde (16) John Wick (16) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (16).

}}

:A.{{Note|firsttwo}} ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]'' and ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' both received 16 certificates, for "''frequent strong bloody violence, disturbing sequences, strong threat of sexual violence''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewFilm/22C5B19D8795AF0180257D0A004CFC3F?OpenDocument&amp;OpenUp=True&lt;/ref&gt; and "''strong bloody violence throughout''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewFilm/0CF88647F7AE23F680257FE700504C41?OpenDocument&amp;OpenUp=True&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. The distributor also mentioned the film's 15 certificate in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/first-purge-2018&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent throughout the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;http://bbfc.co.uk/search/releases/purge&lt;/ref&gt;

After first being viewed on 15 June, it was re-viewed on 21 June when the Appeal Board stuck by the original decision.

Ger Connolly wrote back, explaining the decision in greater detail:
{{Quote box
 |quote  = This is the fourth film of this particular franchise. As can sometimes be the case with long-running horror franchises, in evolution they become more violent and explicit to maintain the interest of their audience. This is, in my opinion, the case with 'The Purge' series of films. The first instalment, essentially a 'home invasion' thriller, was classified 15A. The next two ('The Purge: Anarchy' and 'The Purge': Election Year) broadened out the story and intensified in terms of body count and the graphic way in which some of the violence was depicted. Both were classified 16 on cinema release. 'The Purge: Election Year' was classified 18 on DVD release. In most cases films classified 16 theatrically are classified 15 on DVD release. This classification is more restrictive than 15A. In rarer cases the DVD classification is increased to 18 to reflect the level of content.

The First Purge intensifies the extremely graphic violence   - the violence here is brutal and sustained. It also contained a scene of sexual assault as well as scenes of very overt brutal racist violence against African Americans with the attackers in full Ku Klux Klan regalia. These were not present in the other instalments.

I suggest that the context here is not sufficient to warrant a 16 classification due to the extremely brutal and frenzied acts of violence combined with racial hatred and that ‘The First Purge’ is appropriately classified at 18.

==Refusals and bans==
Films may be refused a certificate, e.g. on grounds of obscenity. Such films may not be shown in public cinemas or sold in shops, but are not ''ipso facto'' banned and have been shown at film festivals and [[art film|art house]] clubs such as the [[Irish Film Theatre]] and [[Irish Film Institute]]. These may also show films which have not been submitted for certification, as the submission fee may be prohibitive if a film is screened only a few times at a small venue.

Prohibitions and revocations, with justification, are listed in the official gazette, [[Iris Oifigiúil]], under the headings of '''PROHIBITION ORDER''' and '''REVOCATION ORDER'''.

Despite the recommendations in the 2000 review of certification that no further films be banned, bans are still occasionally issued, although usually overturned on appeal. ''[[Boy Eats Girl]]'', a 2005 movie, was initially banned, with the option of a cut being provided to the producers. On appeal, the film was passed uncut, and granted a 15A rating,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/boy-will-get-to-eat-girl-after-all-1.476854&lt;/ref&gt; although the video certificate was raised to 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifco.ie/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/lookupreports2/D2E379DFC484D98E802571AB0039E72B/$File/2005%20Annual%20Report.pdf?openelement&lt;/ref&gt;

Movies which are never submitted for cinema release in Ireland are occasionally banned on attempted video releases, although only one such order was made in 2004, banning the pornographic ''Anabolic Initiations 5'' ([http://imdb.com/title/tt0272670/ IMDb link]), with the appeals board upholding the censor's order. One order was issued in 2005, reiterating the ban on ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. The only order in 2006 banned the pornographic film ''Steal Runaway''.

== Criticism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Like many systems of entertainment classification, the IFCO has received criticism for several decisions they have made in the past. The board has been described as too zealous and conservative. Many titles that receive 15 certificates from the BBFC are rated 18 by the IFCO. DVD examples include ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'' and ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''. Rarer cinema examples (which bypass the 16 rating) include ''[[Free Fire]]'' and ''[[You Were Never Really Here]]''.

However, the IFCO are more lenient with strong language than the BBFC are, especially with very strong language (e.g. 'cunt'). Examples include ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' and ''[[The Visitor (2007 drama film)|The Visitor]]'' receiving 15 certificates in the UK but PG's in Ireland despite the use of the stronger term '[[motherfucker]]', and ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' receiving an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18]] in the UK but a 15 (on DVD) in Ireland despite four aggressive uses of 'cunt'. The 2014 documentary ''[[Red Army (film)|Red Army]]'' received a 12A in Ireland but a 15 in the UK for a single use of 'cocksucker' (although the video rating was upgraded to 15).

Three titles in particular drew criticism of the board: ''Election'', ''[[But I'm a Cheerleader]]'' and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. All three were rated 18 in Ireland and 15 in the UK, although ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' was rated 16 for cinema release because the system is different than for video releases (it was an 18 on video).

The IFCO is established on a statutory basis and thus the appeals procedure is final. Thus, when a film or video game is banned, there can be no further appeal, but the work may be resubmitted after seven years.

'''''Life Is Strange''''' is an episodic [[graphic adventure]] video game developed by [[Dontnod Entertainment]] and published by [[Square Enix]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The game was released in five episodes periodically throughout 2015. The game's plot focuses on Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old photography student who discovers that she has the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the [[butterfly effect]]. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. [[Quest (video gaming)#Gather quests|Fetch quests]] and making environmental changes represent the forms of [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]] in addition to using [[Dialog tree|branching choices]] for conversation.

Development of ''Life Is Strange'' began in April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both financial and creative. The developers conducted field research on the setting by travelling to the [[Pacific Northwest]], and subverted known [[archetype]]s to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and [[character arc]] serve as the central point in the game. During its release, ''Life Is Strange'' received generally favourable reviews commending the character development, rewind game mechanic and tackling of [[taboo]] subjects. Common criticisms included the [[slang]] that was used, poor [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] in earlier episodes, and [[Tone (literature)|tonal]] inconsistencies in the story. It received over 75 Game of the Year awards and listings. It has sold over three million copies as of May 2017. A sequel, ''[[Life Is Strange 2]]'', was released in September 2018.

==Plot==
''Life Is Strange'' is set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, [[Oregon]], and is told from the perspective of Maxine "Max" Caulfield (Hannah Telle), a twelfth grade student attending Blackwell Academy during October 2013. During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson ([[Derek Phillips (actor)|Derek Phillips]]), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling [[tornado]]. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) kill a woman in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] and rescues the girl, revealed to be her childhood friend Chloe Price ([[Ashly Burch]]). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=30 January 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chrysalis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a [[viral video]] depicting her kissing several students at a party.&lt;ref name="chrysal15"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=24 March 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Out of Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting Chloe at the diner where her mother Joyce ([[Cissy Jones]]) works, they decide to experiment with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off the roof of the girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber.&lt;ref name="chrysal15" /&gt; Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the [[motorhome]] of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William ([[Joe Ochman]]) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an [[Multiverse|alternative reality]] where William is alive but Chloe has been [[Paralysis|paralysed from the neck down]] as a result of a collision in her own car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=19 May 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chaos Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max uses the photo to undo her decision and return to the present day, restoring Chloe's health. Continuing their investigation, Max and Chloe obtain clues leading them to an abandoned barn owned by the influential Prescott family. They discover a hidden bunker containing pictures of Kate and Rachel tied up and intoxicated, with Rachel being buried at Chloe's secret hideout. They hurry back to the scrapyard and find Rachel's grave, much to Chloe's despair. Max follows Chloe at the school party to confront Nathan, believing he will target fellow student Victoria Chase (Dani Knights). They receive a text from Nathan threatening to destroy the evidence, returning them to the scrapyard. All of a sudden, the two are ambushed by Jefferson, who [[Anesthesia|anaesthetises]] Max and kills Chloe with a shot to the head. Max is kidnapped and held captive in the "[[Darkroom|Dark Room]]", a place Jefferson has been drugging and photographing young girls to capture their innocence. Jefferson also reveals that he took Nathan on as a personal student, but killed him before abducting Max due to him giving Rachel an overdose when he tried to mimic Jefferson's work, and intends to do the same to Max after he has the photos he wants.  Max escapes into a photograph and emerges back at the beginning in Jefferson's class. She alerts David, getting Jefferson (and Nathan) arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=28 July 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Dark Room}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max is given the opportunity to go to [[San Francisco]] and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realizing that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a [[dream]]scape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by saving Chloe from being shot by Nathan earlier in the week. The only way to prevent it is for Max to go back to that moment via a photo she took and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay to spare Chloe.&lt;ref name="Life Is Strange"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=20 October 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Polarized}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After ''Life Is Strange'' achieved financial and commercial success, Dontnod Entertainment started to become more prominent in the video game industry; publishers pursued the studio for the first time, whereas they previously had to pursue publishers themselves. CEO Oskar Guilbert said that the game saved his company financially after the mediocre sales of ''[[Remember Me (video game)|Remember Me]]''.&lt;ref name="solicited success"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/how-life-is-strange-changed-dontnod/0174354 |title=How Life is Strange changed Dontnod |first=Christopher |last=Dring |date=25 October 2016 |website=[[The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games|MCV]] |accessdate=25 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026080029/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/how-life-is-strange-changed-dontnod/0174354 |archivedate=26 October 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprint history==

The first three Shadow novels were issued in small hardcover versions in 1935 by the Ideal Library.

The next reprints of the original pulp stories did not appear until after the original stories ended in 1949: ''The Weird Adventures of The Shadow'' was published in 1966 by Grosset and Dunlop.  This anthology, however, considerably edited the three stories contained therein.  Grosset also published one story, "The Grove of Doom" as a Tempo paperback [[5320]], crediting Walter GIbson as author.

From 1969 to 1970, [[Bantam Books]] published seven reprints of early Shadow stories. The stories contained minor edits.

In 1974, [[Pyramid Books]] began reprinting early Shadow stories. The series, which consisted of 23 volumes, lasted through 1978.  None of the reprints followed the original sequence of the pulp series.

In 1975, two Shadow stories were published in a facsimile magazine published by Dover.

Eight Shadow stories were reissued in hardcover anthologies by the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] [[The Crime Club|Crime Club]] in the 1970s. These reprints give sole credit to Walter Gibson as the author, rather than using the Maxwell Grant pseudonym on the cover.

In 1984, Mysterious Press published ''The Shadow and the Golden Master'', a hardcover anthology that reprinted "[[The Golden Master]]" and "Shiwan Khan Returns". Dover Books would later reprint this in paperback.

In 2006, Sanctum Books in association with Nostalgia Ventures began reprinting the original pulps in near-replica editions. Each issue reprints two stories (sometimes 3) and contains the original interior illustrations from the pulps as well as the original covers on the front and back. In late 2008, Nostalgia Ventures chose to end their association. Sanctum Books is continuing it on their own. As of November 2018, 136 volumes including 2 annuals have been published.  Each Nostaligia Ventures and Sanctum volumes reprint two novels each except for volumes 50, 60, 75, 86, 100, 136 and Annual 2 which reprint three novels each.{{The Shadow}}

[[File:Mark Sheridan (comedian).jpg|thumb|right|270px|&lt;center&gt;Mark Sheridan&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Mark Sheridan''' (11 September 1864 – 15 January 1918), born '''Frederick Shaw''', was an English [[music hall]] comedian and singer. He became a popular performer of lusty seaside songs and originated the J. Glover-Kind classic, "[[I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside]]" in 1909. He recorded over fifty songs during a ten-year period, including "One of the Bhoys" (1910), "[[Belgium Put the Kibosh on the Kaiser]]" (1914) and "I'd Like to Shake Shakespeare" (1915).  He was also a major presence in [[pantomime]] productions throughout the British Isles during his later career.

Born in [[Hendon]], County Durham, he initially worked on the [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] docks before being employed at the [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] Theatre, where he took up amateur dramatics. To progress his stage career, he secured engagements in Europe and South Africa in 1890, and performed in Australia two years later.  In 1895 he returned to London and entered the vibrant scene of English music hall and became a leading performer on the circuit.  In 1909 he first performed what was to become his most famous song "I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside", which he later recorded.

In 1917 Sheridan wrote and composed the [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], ''Gay Paree'', which he performed with a London theatre company and later toured the northern provinces including Scotland.  His career took a decline in later years and he suffered severe depression, as a result.  He committed suicide in [[Kelvingrove Park]], Glasgow in 1918 aged 53.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
[[File:Mark Sheridan on stage 1907.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sheridan on stage in 1907]]
Sheridan was born '''Frederick Shaw''' to Scottish-Irish parents in [[Hendon]], County Durham&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office, ''England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes'', volume 10a, p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; and began working with his father, a sail maker, on the [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] docks. He progressed from there to working in the back offices of the [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] Theatre for four years between 1877–1881.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; There, he became interested in performing and took up amateur dramatics. Sheridan decided to shorten his name to Fred as was a popular name on the music hall circuit.&lt;ref name=Sheridan&gt;[http://entertainment.caledonianmercury.com/2010/03/20/day-the-laughter-stopped-in-a-cold-glasgow-park/00309 Mark Sheridan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708112053/http://entertainment.caledonianmercury.com/2010/03/20/day-the-laughter-stopped-in-a-cold-glasgow-park/00309 |date=8 July 2011 }} Laing, Allan ''The Caledonian Mercury'', The Caledonian Press online edition, 20 March 2010, accessed 12 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He later changed his name again when he moved from amateur dramatics to the professional theatre and decided upon Mark Sheridan.  He took the first name from the American writer and humorist [[Mark Twain]] and used his Irish mother's maiden surname, Sheridan.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mark Sheridan's Military Songs", ''The Era'', 14 October 1914, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

His early experiences in variety shows were mainly in Europe, followed by performances in South Africa in 1890,&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt; where he went after his marriage to Ethel Maude Davenport. Two years later, he travelled to Australia&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt; and appeared on the Harry Rickards circuit, where he started a double act with his wife called "The Sheridans". He arrived back in London with his wife in 1895 but dissolved the double act with her.  He was engaged to appear at the Standard Music Hall, [[Pimlico]], the same year.  From there he became a regular on the London [[music hall]] circuit, and quickly built up a reputation as one of the most popular music hall comedians of the time.  Sheridan made frequent appearances on the same bill as [[Marie Lloyd]], [[Little Tich]], [[Dan Leno]] and [[George Robey]]. As well as his comedy sketches, he became a successful singer and enjoyed his biggest success in 1909 with "[[I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside]]". This led to performances as a [[principal boy]] in countless [[pantomime]]s across the country and further recordings, including "One of the Bhoys" (1910), "[[Belgium Put the Kibosh on the Kaiser]]" (1914), "Here We Are Again" (1914) and  "I'd Like to Shake Shakespeare" (1915).

===Later career and death===
In 1915, Sheridan starred in the comic [[revue]] ''Winkles'',&lt;ref&gt;"Mark Sheridan in his Latest Success", ''Western Daily Press'', 18 October 1915, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; which later toured the northern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Bristol Hippodrome Twice Nightly", ''Western Daily Press'', 15 September 1916, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; As music hall was on the decline with audiences, Sheridan concentrated on revue.  During his later years, he believed that his popularity was waning and was plagued by deep insecurities and depression.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;

In 1917, Sheridan returned to [[Glasgow]] where he had enjoyed some of his earliest successes. He wrote and personally financed  ''Gay Paree'', a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] show based on [[W. G. Wills]] West End favourite, ''A Royal Divorce''.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt; It cost Sheridan £2,000 and had a London company of 40 people, including two of his children, Billy and Fred.&lt;ref name=ERA1&gt;"Mark Sheridan's Obituary", ''The Era'', 23 January 1918, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 1918, ''Gay Paree'' opened at the Coliseum in Glasgow, in which Sheridan played the part of [[Napoleon]]. ''Gay Paree'' received negative reviews from both its audiences and newspaper critics. Sheridan's performance was considered by critics to be less successful than his earlier music hall performances.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;

Devastated by the critics' reviews, Sheridan walked out of the theatre and the following day, was found dead in nearby [[Kelvingrove Park]], from a single gunshot wound to the head.&lt;ref name=Western1&gt;"Mark Sheridan Found Shot at Glasgow", ''Western Times'', 16 January 1918, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide, since the gun found had belonged to Sheridan.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Mark Sheridan's Death", ''The Glasgow Herald'', 22 November 1918, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[Cathcart Cemetery]] on 18 January 1918, leaving his wife Maude, their three sons Billy, Fred and Jack, and two daughters Francis and Freda.&lt;ref name=ERA1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Western1/&gt;

'''Thomas "Papa Mutt" Carey''' (September 17, 1891 – September 3, 1948) was a [[New Orleans]] [[jazz]] [[trumpeter]].

==Biography==
[[File:All-Star-Jazz-Band-1944.jpg|right|thumb|260px|The All Star Jazz Group, left to right: [[Ed Garland]] (bass), [[Buster Wilson]] (piano), Marili Morden (proprietor, [[Jazz Man Records]]), [[Jimmie Noone]] (clarinet), Mutt Carey (trumpet), [[Zutty Singleton]] (drums), [[Kid Ory]] (trombone), [[Bud Scott]] (guitar)]]

Carey was born in [[Hahnville, Louisiana]], in 1891,&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Ian Fairweather Digby, and Priestley, Brian. ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'', Third Edition. Rough Guides Ltd., 2004. p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kernfedl, Barry, ed. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz''. Macmillan, 1994. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to New Orleans with his family in his youth. His older brother Jack Carey was a [[trombone]] player and bandleader; Mutt was playing [[cornet]] in his brother's band by about 1912. Carey toured the [[vaudeville]] circuits in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Zieff, Bob and Howard Rye. ''Mutt Carey.'' in Kernfeld, Barry. ed. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1.'' London: MacMillan, 2002. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with [[Kid Ory]] on and off through the 1910s, and went to [[California]] with Ory in late 1919, making his first recordings there about 1921.

When Ory moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], Carey took over leadership of the band which was based in [[Los Angeles, California]] through the 1930s.

In March 1944 Carey rejoined Ory in an all-star band that was a leader of the West Coast revival of traditional New Orleans jazz, put together for the [[CBS Radio]] series ''[[The Orson Welles Almanac]]''. The All Star Jazz Group also included [[Ed Garland]], [[Jimmie Noone]] (succeeded by [[Barney Bigard]]), [[Bud Scott]], [[Zutty Singleton]] and [[Buster Wilson]].&lt;ref name="Goldin Almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=Radio%20Almanac |title=Radio Almanac |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almanac Part 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1944OrsonWellesRadioAlmanacpart1 |title=Orson Welles Almanac—Part 1 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almanac Part 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1944OrsonWellesRadioAlmanacpart2 |title=Orson Welles Almanac—Part 2 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renamed Kid Ory's Creole Jazz Band, the group then made a significant series of recordings on the [[Crescent Records]] label.&lt;ref name="Ertegun"&gt;[[Nesuhi Ertegun|Ertegun, Nesuhi]]. Liner notes for ''Tailgate! Kid Ory's Creole Jazz Band''. [[Good Time Jazz Records]] L-10 and L-11, 1953, also used for Good Time Jazz Records L-12022, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey left Ory's band in 1947 to lead a group under his own name. He died in [[Lake Elsinore, California]], on September 3, 1948, aged 56.

'''''NCIS''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[action (fiction)|action]] [[police procedural]] television series, revolving around a fictional team of [[special agent]]s from the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], which investigates crimes involving the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The concept and characters were initially introduced in two episodes of the [[CBS]] series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' ([[JAG (season 8)|season eight]] episodes 20 and 21: "[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]" and "[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]"). The show, a spin-off from ''JAG'', premiered on September 23, 2003, on CBS. To date it has aired fifteen full seasons and has gone into [[broadcast syndication]] on the [[USA Network]]. [[Donald P. Bellisario]] and [[Don McGill]] are co-creators and executive producers of the premiere member of the [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'' franchise]]. It is the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|second-longest-running scripted, non-animated U.S. primetime TV series]] currently airing, surpassed only by ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999–present), and is the 7th-longest-running scripted U.S. primetime TV series overall.

''NCIS'' was originally referred to as '''''Navy NCIS''''' during season one; "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant (the "N" in "NCIS" stands for "Naval"). In season six, a [[NCIS (season 6)#ep135|two-part episode]] led to a spin-off series, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. A [[NCIS (season 11)#ep252|two-part episode]] during the eleventh season led to a second spin-off series, ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''. While initially slow in the ratings, barely cracking the Top 30 in the first two seasons, the third season showed progress, consistently ranking in the top 20, and by its sixth season, it became a top five hit, having remained there since. In 2011, ''NCIS'' was voted America's favorite television show in an online [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Poll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/05/ncis-voted-americas-all-time-favorite-tv-show-two-and-a-half-men-bones-house-several-current-shows-rank/91686|title='NCIS' Voted America's All-Time Favorite TV Show; 'Two and a Half Men,' 'Bones,' 'House,' Several Current Shows Rank|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=May 5, 2011|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media|Tribune Digital Ventures]]|location=[[Chicago]]|accessdate=May 5, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508213936/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/05/ncis-voted-americas-all-time-favorite-tv-show-two-and-a-half-men-bones-house-several-current-shows-rank/91686|archivedate=May 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series finished its tenth season as the most-watched television series in the U.S. during the 2012–13 TV season.&lt;ref name="rating2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patten|first=Dominic|title=Full 2012–2013 TV Season Series Rankings|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/tv-season-series-rankings-2013-full-list/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=May 23, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628235235/http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/tv-season-series-rankings-2013-full-list/|archivedate=June 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, 2018, ''NCIS'' was renewed for a sixteenth season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/04/13/ncis-renewed-season-16-mark-harmon-returning-cbs/|title=NCIS Renewed for Season 16 as Star Mark Harmon Signs New Deal|first=Ryan|last=Schwartz|date=April 13, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that premiered on September 25, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.econotimes.com/NCIS-Season-16-Air-Date-Spoilers-Director-Leon-Vances-Life-Depends-on-Special-Agent-Leroy-Gibbs-1400910/|title='NCIS' Season 16 Air Date, Spoilers: Director Leon Vance's Life Depends on Special Agent Leroy Gibbs|date=July 10, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diona Reasonover]] joined the main cast in [[NCIS (season 16)#Episodes|Season 16]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/ncis-diona-reasonover-promoted-series-regular-season-16-kasie-abbys-replacement-1202428696/|title=‘NCIS’: Diona Reasonover Promoted To Series Regular For Season 16|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=July 18, 2018|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the departures of [[Duane Henry]] and [[Pauley Perrette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/05/08/ncis-pauley-perrette-last-episode/|title=How 'NCIS' said goodbye to Pauley Perrette|last=Rice|first=Lynette|date=May 15, 2018|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is described by the actors and producers (on special features on DVD releases in the United States) as being distinguished by its comedic elements, ensemble acting, and character-driven plots. The NCIS is the primary law enforcement and [[counterintelligence]] arm of the [[United States Department of the Navy]], which includes the [[United States Marine Corps]]. NCIS investigates all major criminal offenses (felonies)—for example, crimes punishable under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] by confinement of more than one year—within the Department of the Navy.

==Plot==
Whenever a crime is committed involving Navy or Marine personnel, the Washington-based Major Case Response Team — an elite arm of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service — spearheads the investigation. The team, led by laconic investigator Leroy Jethro Gibbs ([[Mark Harmon]]), has included Caitlin Todd ([[Sasha Alexander]]), Anthony DiNozzo ([[Michael Weatherly]]), Timothy McGee ([[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]]), Ziva David ([[Cote de Pablo]]), Eleanor Bishop ([[Emily Wickersham]]), Alexandra Quinn ([[Jennifer Esposito]]), and Nicholas Torres ([[Wilmer Valderrama]]). Over the course of the series, they are further assisted by allies both foreign and domestic, including Dr. Donald Mallard ([[David McCallum]]), Dr. Jimmy Palmer ([[Brian Dietzen]]), forensic specialists Abby Sciuto ([[Pauley Perrette]]) and Kasie Hines ([[Diona Reasonover]]), British intelligence officer Clayton Reeves ([[Duane Henry]]), operational psychologist and senior special agent Dr. Jacqueline Sloane ([[Maria Bello]]), and successive NCIS Directors Jennifer Shepard ([[Lauren Holly]]) and Leon Vance ([[Rocky Carroll]]).

===Name===
Prior to the launch of the first season, advertisements on CBS identified the show as "Naval CIS". By the time of the launch of the first episode, ''NCIS'' was airing under the name ''Navy NCIS'', the name it held for the entire first season. Since the "N" in NCIS stands for "Naval", the name "Navy NCIS" was redundant. The decision to use this name was reportedly made by CBS, over the objections of Bellisario,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Behind a Quiet Little Hit, a Reliable Hit Maker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/arts/television/25ncis.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2005|accessdate=June 7, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112210215/https://tv.yahoo.com/news/cbs-renews-madam-secretary-scorpion-ncis-orleans-170824469.html|archivedate=January 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to:
* Attract new viewers (particularly those of ''JAG''), who might not know the NCIS abbreviation
* Distinguish between NCIS and the similarly themed and similarly spelled CBS series ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' and its spinoffs. (The original title, for instance, was often misquoted and parodied as "Navy CSI", something the show itself referenced in the first episode.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Yankee White|episodelink=Yankee White (NCIS)|series=NCIS|airdate=August 23, 2003|season=1|number=1|minutes=4:53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flair ===
From the season-two episode "Lt. Jane Doe" onwards, the series began showing two-second-long black-and-white clips. These clips are shown at the beginning of every segment depicting the last two seconds of that segment, a segment being the five or six portions of the show meant to be separated by [[commercials]]. In the season-three premiere, "Kill Ari (Part I)", a [[freeze-frame shot]] was also used with the very end of most episodes turned into a freeze frame, as well.

===Crew changes===
It was reported in May 2007 that Donald Bellisario would be stepping down from the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2007/05/07/ncis-loses-producer/|title='NCIS' Loses Producer|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=May 7, 2007|accessdate=August 17, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085247/http://nypost.com/2007/05/07/ncis-loses-producer/|archivedate=August 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon, Bellisario's duties as [[showrunner]]/[[head writer]] were to be given to long-time show collaborators, including co-executive producer Chas.

''NCIS'' star Mark Harmon and showrunner Gary Glasberg are the executive producers, and CBS Studios produces the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ANDREEVA|first=NELLIE|title=CBS Prepping Planted 'NCIS' Spinoff Produced By Mark Harmon &amp; Gary Glasberg|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/ncis-spinoff-cbs-mark-harmon-new-orleans/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|accessdate=September 28, 2013|date=September 23, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927054336/http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/ncis-spinoff-cbs-mark-harmon-new-orleans/|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Crescent City", the two-part backdoor-pilot episode was initially "supposed to be just an idea for an episode".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5740">[[File:They All Look Alike cover.jpg|thumb|Individual numbers from musicals were often published separately as sheet music as in this example, "They All Look Alike" from [[Jerome Kern]]'s ''Have a Heart'']] 
In [[music]], '''number'''  refers to an individual song, dance, or instrumental piece which is part of a larger work of [[musical theatre]], [[opera]], or [[oratorio]]. It can also refer either to an individual song in a published collection or an individual song or dance in a performance of several unrelated musical pieces as in concerts and [[revues]]. Both meanings of the term have been used in American English since the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition  (1970). "Number". Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A now archaic use of the term in the plural was as a synonym for musical sounds or notes. See ''[[Webster's_Dictionary#Webster.27s_Third_New_International_Dictionary_.281961.29|Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged]]'' (1970). "Number". Merriam-Webster&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical theatre and related genres==
In musical theatre, the lyrics of the individual song numbers are integrated with the narrative of the [[libretto]] (or "book"). As early as 1917, [[Jerome Kern]] wrote that "musical numbers should carry on the action of the play, and should be representative of the personalities of the characters who sing them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in McMillin, Scott (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs5lPAiL-OgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=music+numbers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J_AZUef0EofB0gWpw4GQDQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20numbers&amp;f=false ''The Musical as Drama: A Study of the Principles and Conventions Behind Musical Shows from Kern To Sondheim''], p. 2. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The lyricist [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], another proponent of this view, even refused to list the numbers in ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' because he thought it would detract from what he viewed as the close integration between the book and the lyrics. However, both David Horn and Scott McMillin have proposed that full integration is not completely possible. For McMillin, the start of a musical number creates a noticeably different "feel" in which the singer becomes a "performer" not simply a character.&lt;ref&gt;McMillin (2006) pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;  For Horn, the individual numbers can serve not only to advance the narrative but also to directly address and engage the audience in an experience which stands apart from the dramatic context of the work., and this latter function had its roots in [[vaudeville]] entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, David (2003). "Book (1)" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&amp;pg=PA633&amp;dq=music+numbers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dO4ZUfLNIumc0QXs4YDwDw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20numbers&amp;f=false ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Part 1 Performance and Production'']. Continuum International Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; In revues, a type of multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music, dance and sketches, there is no overall narrative, but rather a sequence of unrelated (often lavish) musical numbers. However, as Rick Altman points out, some of the numbers in these types of shows such "This Heart of Mine" in the film ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' can be narratives in miniature. That number, according to Altman, "is not just musical—its dream-like dance grows out of the Bremer/Astaire &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Lucille Bremer]] and [[Fred Astaire]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; mimed narrative which opens the selection."&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Rick (1987). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yXPN0ZkkJuUC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=music+numbers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O-8ZUavJM42Y1AWFlIGQDw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=numbers&amp;f=false ''The American Film Musical''], p. 102. Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera and oratorio==
Opera numbers may be [[aria]]s, but also  [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] pieces, such as [[Duet (music)|duet]]s, [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, [[quartet]]s, [[quintet]]s, [[sextet]]s or [[Choir|chorus]]es. They may also be [[ballet]]s and [[instrumental]] pieces, such as [[March (music)|march]]es, [[sinfonia]]s, or [[intermezzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi, ed. (1969). ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', Second Edition, p. 582. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-19th century most operas  were structured as a series of discrete numbers connected by [[recitative]] or spoken dialogue. Oratorios followed a similar model. However, as the century progressed, numbers were increasingly unified into larger musical segments with no clear break between them. Early examples of this trend include [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s opera ''[[Euryanthe]]'' and [[Robert Schumann]]'s secular oratorio ''[[Das Paradies und die Peri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie, Stanley and Macy, Laura eds. (2006).

'''Patrick Moutal''' is a French [[sitarist]] and [[musicologist]]. He has been teaching north Indian classical music at the [[Paris Conservatoire]] (CNSMDP) since 1984 (Jazz &amp; Improvised Musics and Pedagogy dpts).

== Biography ==
Born in Lyon in 1951, he went to India at age 18 in order to study [[Hindustani classical music]]. He learned Hindi and settled in Banaras (Varanasi), where he stayed for 14 years. 
In 1970, he was admitted as a [[sitar]] student at the Faculty of Performing Arts of [[Banaras Hindu University]]. Under the guidance of Dr K.C. Gangrade and Pt [[Lalmani Misra]], he completed the following degrees :&lt;br /&gt;
- Diploma 1973&lt;br /&gt;
- Bachelor's Degree with Gold Medal in 1976&lt;br /&gt;
- Master's Degree with Omkarnath Thakur Prize in 1978&lt;br /&gt;
- Master's Degree in French language in 1979&lt;br /&gt;
- Doctorate of Performance &amp; Compositions in 1983&lt;br /&gt;
The year of his doctorate, he wrote two books in English about [[ragas]] (cf Bibliography).

From 1977 to 1983, he performed regularly at All India Radio.

On [[Maurice Fleuret]]'s initiative, he went back to France in 1983 and started teaching at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris the following year. Since then, he has been dedicated to promoting Indian musical culture.

In 2000, he developed a website, [http://moutal.eu/indian-music.html Hindustani Raga Sangeet Online], devoted to Indian vocalists and instrumentalists through rare archives (cylinders, 78t, etc.).

== Honour ==
In 1983, Patrick Moutal was honored with the award of [[Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the Government of France.

{{hatnote|This article is about television services in which rely on a subscription fee in order to be viewed. For the forms of subscription TV services in which "pay television" is also sometimes used as a generalized term, see [[Multichannel television]].}}
'''Pay television''' or '''subscription television''' are [[Subscription business model|subscription]]-based [[television]] services, usually provided by both [[Analog transmission|analog]] and [[digital cable|digital]] [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]], but also increasingly via [[Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial]] and [[internet television]]. Subscription television began in the [[multi-channel transition]] and transitioned into the [[post-network era]].&lt;ref name=Lotz&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=8|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of the world, notably in [[France]] and the [[United States]], have also offered encrypted analog terrestrial signals available for subscription.

==Programming==
Subscription-based or pay [[television]] has resulted in a change in what type of content is broadcast by these networks. This model has led to networks creating much more specialized types of shows to get viewers to subscribe.&lt;ref name=Lotz160&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=160|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription networks are most concerned with providing content that will make people want to subscribe as well as renew subscriptions rather than who is watching and when this viewing is taking place.&lt;ref name=Lotz216&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=216|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the unedited nature of premium services, it is typical for them to showcase programming that includes large amounts of [[profanity]], [[sexual activity]], [[nudity]], [[graphic violence]] and other adult content (the inclusion of any such content depends on the program, as services may also include content that is at least partially, if not entirely, devoid of material that may be inappropriate for some viewers). To notify viewers of program content, most premium channels air advisory [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] immediately before each program, mentioning the program's rating (this typically does not apply to live sporting events) and program content information. Since the 1990s, premium channels in the United States use [[Pay television content descriptors|content descriptors]] that describe potentially objectionable content included in the program, such as mild violence (identified as "MV") or strong sexual content (identified as "SSC"); additional features included in the [[television program]] such as [[closed captioning]] and [[stereo|surround sound]] functions, and alternate-language audio tracks via [[Second audio program|secondary audio program]] feeds may also be mentioned.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

[[Film|Movies]] comprise much of the programming content seen on most pay television services, particularly those with a general entertainment format and those that [[movie channels|focus exclusively on films]]; films that are broadcast on most premium channels air in their original theatrically-released (and in some cases, unrated [[home video]] or [[DVD]]) versions; this is in comparison to films aired on terrestrial television or basic cable, which may be subject to edits for time and/or content, depending on what content a jurisdiction allows to be shown over-the-air or on basic cable. Many pay television services obtain rights to films through exclusive agreements with film distributors (this did not become the norm in the U.S. until the mid-1980s, as it would be common for the same film to be broadcast on unrelated pay services during its term of license); films acquired during the original term of license agreements with a distributor may also be broadcast as "sub-runs," in which a service holds rights to film long after the conclusion of a distribution agreement (under this arrangement, the pay service that originally licensed the rights to a particular film title, or one other than that which had held rights, may hold the broadcast rights through a library content deal).

Many general interest premium channels also produce original [[television series]], which feature content that in some jurisdictions may be edgier – and therefore, often more risque – than such programs seen on broadcast networks; many of these series (such as [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[Sex and the City]]'', and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'') have gone on to achieve viewer, [[critic]]al and [[award|accolade]] success, though they are subject to a lower audience ratings threshold to be considered a hit than programs on broadcast television because these channels are subscription-based and therefore only appear in a fraction of homes with at least one television set. Some premium channels also broadcast [[television special]]s, which most commonly consist of [[concert]] events, [[documentary film]]s and [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedy acts]], and in the past, have also included [[theatrical play]]s.

[[Sports television|Sports programming]] is also featured on some premium services, in particular HBO and Showtime in the [[United States]] are both notable for their carriage of [[boxing]] events, while Showtime and [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] also carry [[mixed martial arts]] events; some general interest premium channels have aired other professional sporting events in the past: HBO for example, has carried games from the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) in its early years, and from 1975 to 1999 aired the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tennis tournament. Specialty pay [[List of sports television channels|sports channels]] such as [[Setanta Sports]] and [[Fox Soccer Plus]] exist, and are typically sold at a higher expense than traditional premium services; [[out-of-market sports package]]s in [[North America]] are multi-channel pay services carrying professional or collegiate sporting events which are sold in a seasonal package – these are typically the most expensive type of pay services, generally running in the range of $35 to $50 per month.

Some pay services also offer [[pornography|pornographic films]]; a few mainstream services (such as [[Cinemax]] in the U.S. and [[The Movie Network]]'s MExcess in [[Canada]]) carry a limited amount of [[softcore pornography|softcore content]] during late night time periods. Specialized channels dedicated to [[pornographic film]]s also exist that carry either softcore adult programs (such as [[Playboy TV]]) or more [[hardcore pornography|hardcore content]] (such as [[The Erotic Network]] and [[Hustler TV (US)|Hustler TV]]), these channels are often sold on a night-by-night basis similar to the [[pay-per-view]] model, even though they commonly operate as 24-hour channels.

Premium television services are commonly devoid of traditional commercial advertising, therefore programs on most pay television channels are uninterrupted by [[television commercial]]s within the broadcast; instead, breaks are inserted between programs, which typically advertise [[Promo (media)|promotions for upcoming programs]] and feature special behind-the-scenes [[interstitial programming|interstitials]] (this is the main reason why most subscription television channels are able to run programs without any editing, as they are not subject to pressure from [[Sponsor (commercial)|advertisers]] to tone down content); some sports-based pay services, however, may feature some commercial advertising, particularly if they simulcast sporting events that are broadcast by advertiser-supported television networks. In addition, most general interest or movie-based pay services do not adhere to the common top and bottom of the hour scheduling of other cable channels and terrestrial broadcasters. As such, programs often air using either conventional scheduling or have airtimes in five-minute increments (for example, 7:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. or 4:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.); since such channels broadcast content without in-program break interruptions, this sometimes leads to extended or abbreviated breaks between programs, depending on when the previous program concludes and when the start time of the next program is. The only universal variation to this is [[prime time]], where the main channel in each pay service's suite usually schedules films to start at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. ET/PT on the hour.

==Pricing and packaging==
Pay television channels come in different price ranges. Many channels carrying advertising combine this income with a lower subscription fee. These are called "mini-pay" channels (a term also used for smaller scale commercial-free pay television services) and are often sold as a part of a package with numerous similarly priced channels. Usually, however, the regular pricing for premium channels ranges from just under $10 to near $25 per month per suite, with lower prices available via [[Triple play (telecommunications)|bundling]] options with cable or satellite providers, or special limited offers which are available during [[free preview]] periods or before the launch of a network's prestige series. However, some other channels, such as sports and adult networks may ask for monthly pricing that may go as high as near $50 a month. There are also premium television services which are priced significantly higher than the mini-pay channels, but they compensate for their higher price by carrying little or no advertising and also providing a higher quality program output. As advertising sales are sensitive to the [[business cycle]], some broadcasters try to balance them with more stable income from subscriptions.

Some providers offer channels owned by the same company in a single package. For example, American satellite provider [[DirecTV]] offers the [[Encore (TV channel)|Encore]] channels along with the [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] multiplex (both owned by [[Starz Inc.]]) in its "Starz Super Pack";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV Official Site – Starz Super Pack Information|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/packProg/channelChart2.jsp?assetId=1200079|work=DirecTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Movie Channel]], [[Flix (TV network)|Flix]] and [[SundanceTV]] (the latter of which continues to be sold in the DirecTV package despite [[Showtime Networks]] no longer owning Sundance, that channel is now owned by [[AMC Networks]]) along with [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] in its "Showtime Unlimited" package;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV Official Site – Showtime Unlimited Package Information|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/packProg/channelChart2.jsp?assetId=1200080&amp;footernavtype=-1|work=DirecTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinemax]] and its multiplex networks, in turn, are almost always packaged with [[HBO]] (both owned by [[Time Warner]]). Many pay television services offer [[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] services that are also sold with the main channel, which broadcast a different schedule from that of the service's main channel and often use separate formats focused on genre-based programming (for example; one channel may feature family-oriented programming, another may feature [[action film]]s) or programming aimed at a specific target audience. In [[Canada]], [[HBO Canada]] is packaged with two separate pay services: [[The Movie Network]] and [[Movie Central]] (as the two services are territorially restricted by choice to respectively serve [[Eastern Canada]] and [[Western Canada]]; the owners of both channels, [[Bell Media]] and [[Corus Entertainment]], each own the territorial rights to HBO Canada in their respective areas).

Though selling premium services that are related by ownership as a package is common, that may not always be the situation: for example, Canada's [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]] was generally sold independently from The Movie Network and [[The Movie Network Encore]] while all were under common ownership (all three networks were owned by [[Astral Media]] until that company's 2013 merger with Bell Media; Family – which unlike the TMN channels, is distributed throughout the country – is now owned by [[DHX Media]]); The Movie Network Encore is also sold separately from The Movie Network (which spun off the channel in 1994 as TMN Moviepix) by some cable and satellite providers in Eastern Canada, though other providers offer both networks and their multiplex channels as a package. In the United States, Cinemax and [[Encore (TV channel)|Encore]] are optionally sold separately from or in a single package with their respective parent networks HBO and Starz, depending on the service provider. The Movie Channel and Flix meanwhile, are usually sold together with Showtime (all three channels are owned by [[CBS Corporation]]); though subscribers are required to purchase Showtime in order to receive Flix, The Movie Channel does not have such a restriction as a few providers optionally sell that service without requiring a Showtime subscription.

Unlike other cable networks, premium services are almost always subscribed to ''[[a la carte cable television]]'', meaning that one can, for example, subscribe to HBO without subscribing to Showtime (in Canada, there are slight modifications, as most providers include U.S. [[superstation]]s – such as [[WGN-TV]], [[KTLA]] and [[WPCH-TV]] – with their main premium package by default). However, subscribing to an "individual" service automatically includes access to all of that service's available multiplex channels and, in some cases, access to content via [[video on demand|video-on-demand]] (in the form of a conventional VOD television service, and in some cases, a companion on-demand [[online streaming|streaming]] service as well). Most pay television providers also offer a selection of premium services (for example, the HBO, Showtime and Starz packages) in one [[Product bundling|bundle]] at a greatly reduced price than it would cost to purchase each service separately, as an inducement for subscribers to remain with their service provider or for others to induce subscribers into using their service. Similarly, many television providers offer general interest or movie-based premium channels at no additional charge for a [[Evaluation|trial period]] (loften one to three months, though there have been rare instances of free trials for pay services that last up to one year limited Tv for newer subscribers to that provider's television service.

==Distribution==
Pay television has become popular with [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]]. Pay television services often, at least two to three times per year, provide free previews of their services, in order to court potential subscribers by allowing this wider audience to sample the service for a period of days or weeks; these are typically scheduled to showcase major special event programming, such as the pay cable premiere of a blockbuster feature film, the premiere (either a [[series premiere|series]] or [[season premiere]]) of a widely anticipated or critically acclaimed original series or occasionally, a high-profile special (such as a concert).

Subscription services transmitted via analogue terrestrial television have also existed, to varying degrees of success. [[Canal+]] operated a national analogue terrestrial pay channel in [[France]] from 1984 until the 2011 closedown of analogue television, when it transitioned to digital with the other terrestrial analogue channels. Its [[Spain|Spanish]] counterpart, [[Canal+ Spain]], also broadcast nationally between 1990 and 2005. Some U.S. television stations launched pay services (known simply as "subscription television" services) such as [[SuperTV]], [[Wometco Home Theater]], [[PRISM (TV channel)|PRISM]] (which principally operated as a cable service, only being simultaneously carried over-the-air for a short time during the 1980s, and unlike other general-interest pay services accepted outside advertising for broadcast during its sports telecasts), [[Preview (subscription service)|Preview]], [[SelecTV USA|SelecTV]] and [[ONTV (pay TV)|ONTV]] in the late 1970s, but those services disappeared as competition from cable television expanded during the 1980s.

In some countries, the launch of [[digital terrestrial television]] has meant that pay television has become increasingly popular in countries with regular antennas. Conversely, even as [[Cord-cutting|cordcutting]] by pay television subscribers due to price increases resulting from rising carriage fees and as the use of [[digital subchannel|digital multicasting]] by terrestrial broadcasters has increased since the late 2000s, there have not been any attempts to launch new over-the-air pay services in North America.

In [[Australia]], [[Foxtel]], [[Optus Television]] and [[TransACT]] are the major pay television distributors, all of which provide cable services in some [[metropolitan area]]s, with Foxtel providing satellite service for all other areas where cable is not available. [[Austar]] formerly operated as a satellite pay service, until it merged with Foxtel and [[SelecTV (Australian television)|SelecTV]]. The major distributors of pay television in New Zealand are [[Sky Network Television]] on satellite and [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone]] on cable.

Since the late 2000s, [[internet video]] services which distribute original and acquired movies and television shows (including [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]] and [[Hulu|Hulu Plus]]) have become major competitors to pay television channels, offering very similar programming content.

==Ambiguities==

===Pay-per-view===
{{Main|Pay-per-view}}

[[Pay-per-view]] (PPV) services are similar to subscription-based pay television services in that customers must pay to have the broadcast decrypted for viewing, but usually only entail a one-time payment for a single or time-limited viewing. Programs offered via pay-per-view are most often movies or sporting events, but may also include other events, such as concerts and even softcore adult programs. In the U.S., the initial concept and technology for pay-per-view for broadcast television was first developed in the early 1950s, including a crude decrypting of the over-the-air television signal and a decoding box, but never caught on for use at that time. It took another four decades when cable broadcasters started using pay-per-view on a widespread basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oiEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dsv2TtD8G83qggfXlYCwAg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCDhu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Will You Pay for TV Shows?"] ''Popular Science'', April 1952, pp. 124–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free-to-view===
{{Main|Free-to-view|Free-to-air}}

"Free" variants are [[free-to-air]] (FTA) and [[free-to-view]] (FTV); however, FTV services are normally encrypted and decryption cards either come as part of an initial subscription to a pay television bouquet – in other words, an offer of pay-TV channels – or can be purchased for a one-time cost. FTA and FTV systems may still have selective access. [[Australia Plus]] is one example, as much of its programming content is free-to-air except for [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) games, which are encrypted.

'''''Phone Story''''' is a satirical [[mobile game|mobile]] video game conceived by Yes Lab activist Michael Pineschi and designed by Paolo Pedercini for [[Molleindustria]] with the stated aim of demonstrating what the developers refer to as "the dark side of your favorite smart phone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://phonestory.org/index.html Official ''Phone Story'' website]&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of four minigames which require the player to complete activities such as forcing children in the [[Third World]] to mine [[coltan]] and preventing [[Foxconn suicides|suicides at a Foxconn factory]].

The creators of the game stated the main purpose was to elicit a response from people who "fail to realize how their fashionable consumption can have negative effects on people in the globalized world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/09/15/infamous-anti-iphone-game-goes-to-android/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Phone Story'' was released on the [[iOS]] platform on September 9, 2011, though it was [[Censorship by Apple|banned by Apple]] after only four days.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;Brown, Mark (September 14, 2011) [https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/09/phone-story/ "Apple Bans ''Phone Story'' Game That Exposes Seedy Side of Smartphone Creation], [[Wired (website)|Wired]], accessed December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Doug (September 14, 2011), [http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/14/tech/mobile/apple-bans-app/ "Apple bans app that shows ugly side of electronics"], ''[[CNN]]'', accessed December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Apple cited violations of their developer guidelines as the reason for removing the game,&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Jenna (September 13, 2011) [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/game-that-critiques-apple-vanishes-from-app-store/ "Game That Critiques Apple Vanishes From App Store"], ''[[New York Times]]'', accessed December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; though an article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' questioned the validity of their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Dredge, Stuart (September 14, 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/sep/14/apple-phone-story-rejection "Apple bans satirical iPhone game Phone Story from its App Store"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed December 20, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the removal of the game, it was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones, and a free playable [[Adobe Flash]] version was made available on the developer's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phonestory.org/game.html Playable Flash version of ''Phone Story'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Phone Story'' website contains extensive information about the topics touched on by the game, and all profits from the sale of the app go to charities which work in the areas described,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yeslab.org/project/phone-story ''Phone Story'' at YesLab.com]&lt;/ref&gt; including a donation of over $6000 to a girl injured in a suicide attempt at a Foxconn factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phonestory.org/index.html ''Phone Story'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is offered as [[freeware]] under a [[Creative Commons license]] [[CC BY-NC-SA]].

==Gameplay==
''Phone Story'' consists of four self-contained minigames, each featuring narration by a voice which represents the user's phone, detailing the real world conditions which the minigames represent.&lt;ref name="pocketgamer"/&gt; The first game deals with the mining of coltan in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and has the player controlling guards to ensure that labourers are not allowed to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phone Story Censored, Apple Needs New Definition of Objectionable Content|url=http://www.148apps.com/news/phone-story-censored-apple-definition-objectionable-content/|first=Rob|last=LeFebvre|date=Sep 16, 2011|work=148apps|accessdate=Dec 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second takes place at a factory, in which the player must move a net back and forth in order to catch workers who are attempting suicide.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; The third is set in a phone store, in which the player must slingshot phones into the hands of consumers. The final minigame concerns the recycling of discarded phones in [[Ghana]], tasking the player with dividing components from the phone among workers that are salvaging the parts in unsafe ways.&lt;ref name="pocketgamer"/&gt; Each minigame requires the player to complete the relevant action successfully a certain number of times before a timer runs out;&lt;ref name="pocketgamer"/&gt; if they do not, the narrator admonishes them, saying "do not pretend that you are not complicit."

==Reception==
''Phone Story'' has received mixed reviews. ''Android Rundown'' said that it was "not that entertaining or enlightening", criticising the game's short length and repetitive gameplay and awarding it 5 points out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;Nitz, Chris, [http://www.androidrundown.com/app-rundown/phone-story-review/ "''Phone Story'' Review"], ''Android Rundown'', accessed December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' were more positive in reference to the game's educational content, stating that it encouraged them to read up on the issues raised, but were similarly critical with the game's simplistic gameplay and short length.&lt;ref name="pocketgamer"&gt;Rose, Mike (September 15, 2011) [http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Phone+Story/feature.asp?c=33383&amp;srch=phone+story "Hands-on with controversial indie tite Phone Story"], ''Pocket Gamer'', accessed December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pionerskaya Pravda''''' (Пионе́рская Пра́вда) is an all-Russian newspaper. Initially it was an [[all-Union]] newspaper of the [[Soviet Union]]. Its name may be translated as "Truth for [[Pioneer movement|Young Pioneers]]".

The newspaper has been founded March 6, 1925 in [[Moscow]]. In the 1970s and 1980s its circulation approached 10,000,000 (almost every child in the Soviet Union had a subscription). Its title followed the name of the main Soviet newspaper of the time, ''[[Pravda]]'', as did multiple other newspapers.

The newspaper continues to exist today, but now it is not associated with [[Pioneer movement|Young Pioneers]], and the circulation is greatly reduced.

Similar newspapers were published in other [[languages of the USSR]]: as of 1974, six newspapers in Russian and 22 in other languages.

A '''pitch''' is a concise verbal (and sometimes visual) presentation of an idea for a [[film]] or TV series generally made by a [[screenwriter]] or [[film director]] to a [[film producer]] or [[studio executive]] in the hope of attracting [[development (film)|development]] finance to pay for the writing of  a [[screenplay]].&lt;ref name="p58"/&gt;

"Pitch" is a contraction of the phrase "[[sales pitch]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; A pitch is used throughout different stages of production, such as casting and distribution, as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project.&lt;ref name="p58"&gt;Steiff, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package, which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch. The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker's project, such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values.&lt;ref&gt;Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, filmmakers will produce an independent [[pitch trailer]] as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker's vision.

Though pitches are usually made on the basis of a full [[Script (recorded media)|script]] or [[teleplay]], [[animated cartoon|animated]] productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of [[storyboard]]s alone. For example, the animated television show ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' was pitched from a storyboard. Co-founders of the project, [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]], needed to convince overseas executives for [[The Walt Disney Company]] to [[greenlight]] the series, so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel. They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects, voices, and narrative, then sent the recording to the executives, who accepted it.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite video|title="Original Pitch" featurette, from Volume 1: "The Fast and the Phineas"|medium=DVD|date=2008|people=Povenmire, Dan|publisher=[[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program.&lt;ref name="raise"/&gt; Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings. Such pitches have been used with "Oliver" in ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and "Luke" on ''[[Growing Pains]]''.&lt;ref name="Alberti, p. 144"&gt;Alberti, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Networks also try to force their ideas on series' producers through their pitches, though their approach is business-oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Alberti, pp. 145&amp;ndash;147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the crew of the animated series ''[[Rugrats]]'' was approached by [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], which pitched the idea of a ''Rugrats'' [[Hanukkah]] special. [[Paul Germain]], co-creator of the series, responded by suggesting a [[passover]] special, which he dubbed a "funny idea."&lt;ref name="raise"&gt;{{cite news|title=How raising the Rugrats children became as difficult as the real thing|author=Swartz, Mimi|date=1998-10-30|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they closed production for [[A Rugrats Passover|that special]], they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in 1996 as the episode "[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]."&lt;ref name="raise"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rites of Chanukah reach many|author=Ribadeneira, Diego|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]]|date=1996-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is played by two teams of four or more players. One member of each team takes a wooden baseball-sized ball and kicks the ball ahead.  The members of that team then chase after the ball, pick it up then kick it again. This is usually done for several miles in the casual games. However, in the serious inter-village contests, held after all-night parties, during which much of the Tarahumara corn beer, [[Tejuino o Tesgüino]], is enjoyed by all, the games will often go on for thirty or forty miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/running/running-for-their-lives/|title=Running For Their Lives|date=2010-05-27|work=Blue Ridge Outdoors Magazine|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Once the game starts, one runner on each team usually pulls into the front and always takes care of the ball. However, after a few miles or after the ball rolls under an outcrop of rock in the canyons, the rest of the team is able to catch up and the front runner is able to fall back into the main group and rest. The game ends when one team finishes the distance agreed upon by both teams prior to the start of the race.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Roboboa.jpg|thumb|right|256px|Roboboa]] --&gt;
'''Roboboa''' is a [[robotic]] snake produced by [[Wow Wee|WowWee]]. Roboboa has 4 angled body sections, allowing Roboboa to coil by rotating adjacent sections. A motorized tail roller and casters on the midsection allow Roboboa to move in a straight line.

== Hardware ==
*4 motorized sections
*IR ([[Infrared|infrafred]]) sensor
*Light sensor
*Speaker
*Remote control

Roboboa requires 4 x D cell batteries, and 4 x AAA batteries for the remote control.

== Functions ==

The remote control has 7 action buttons, an 8-way directional pad, and 2 mode buttons. The remote also functions as a [[flashlight]]. 
The Strafe/Lazer/Cannon functions allow Roboboa to send commands to other WowWee robots such as other Roboboas, [[Robosapien]], [[Robosapien v2]], [[Roboreptile]], [[Roboraptor]], [[Robopet]], or [[Roboquad]].

== Action buttons==

Roboboa operates in distinct modes, accessed by pressing one of the action buttons. Secondary options are selectable by holding the action button down for 2 seconds, or by pressing a Mode button followed by an action button. Roboboa also has a Lighting Mode button on his head, which converts him into an area light After 1 hour, Roboboa will revert from Lighting Mode to Aware mode. In Aware Mode, Roboboa remains in place but will track movement and emit various sounds.
* Tail/Head:Reset:Strafe action button: Tail/Head toggles the 8-way directional pad to control either the head end or tail end of the Roboboa. Reset will clear all alarms, programs, and volume settings, and return Roboboa to the default position. Strafe sends IR command signals that are recognized by [[Robopet]], [[Roboquad]], and other Roboboas.
* Track:Scan:Lazer action button: In Track mode (as in Aware mode), Roboboa remains in place but will turn his light on and track nearby objects that are detected by IR. In Scan mode, Roboboa moves his head from left to right until an object is detected. Lazer sends IR command signals that are recognized by [[Roboreptile]] and [[Roboraptor]].
* Explore:Sleep:Cannon action button: In Explore mode, Roboboa will wander in search of objects. Sleep causes Roboboa to curl up and suspend; programs and alarms are remembered, and alarm events will cause Roboboa to wake up. If no event occur within 24 hours of entering Sleep mode, Roboboa will enter Shutdown mode. Cannon sends IR command signals that are recognized by [[Robosapien]] and [[Robosapien v2|Robosapien V2]].
* Alarm:Daily:Test action button: Selects one of three alarm modes. Pressing the Alarm button multiple times will set Roboboa to wake up and play an alarm that many hours in the future, i.e. two presses sets the Alarm for 2 hours. The maximum setting is 16 hours. Five seconds after the last press of Alarm, Roboboa will enter Sleep mode until the alarm time elapses. After setting an Alarm, it can be flagged as a daily recurring Alarm by holding the Alarm button for 2 seconds to activate Daily alarm mode. Test will demonstrate Roboboa's alarm sounds, lights and actions.
* Guard:Sentry:Patrol action button: Guard mode causes Roboboa to scan for objects within a range of several feet. Guard mode times out after 2 hours and Roboboa enters Aware mode. Sentry mode causes Roboboa to spin while scanning. If an object is detected, Roboboa will flash and then spin the opposite direction. Sentry mode times out after 20 minutes, followed by Aware mode. Patrol mode causes Roboboa to move randomly. After detecting an object, Roboboa will flash and then move in a new direction. Patrol mode times out after 10 minutes, followed by Aware mode.
* Demo:Party:Volume action button: Demo causes Roboboa to show his movement, sound and light capabilities. Party causes Roboboa to act as a disco light. Volume cycles through preset options of Loud, Medium, Soft and Off. Volume setting is lost after Reset.
* Execute:Program:Back action button: Execute will start a stored program of up to 40 commands. Program mode allows storing of commands, while Back removes the last command entered. The program is stored and played back by pressing the Execute button again.
Sleep mode: If Roboboa is not disturbed for 2 hours, he will curl up and enter sleep mode. If no alarms are set, Roboboa will enter Shutdown after 24 hours in Sleep mode.

== Programming ==
Roboboa can be '[[Computer program|programmed]]' by entering commands with the remote; up to 40 commands can be recorded and played back in sequence. Two conditional steps can pause the playback until either the light level changes, or an object passes in front of the IR sensor. Playback resumes after the event.

'''Russian Serf Theatre''' refers to theatrical productions performed by [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]] for their owners.
 
Russian serf theaters dates back from the early to mid eighteenth century when the nobility began organizing their serfs to put on shows for each other. In 1795 the Russian population was 37 million, of whom the vast majority were serfs, owned by a mere 360,000 male nobles. The average aristocrat owned just 60 serfs and only 11 per cent owned more than 1000 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3554946/The-serf-who-married-her-owner.html|publisher=The Telegraph|location=London|title=The Serf who Married her Owner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth century it became popular to employ serfs to mount productions of operas, ballets or plays. More than 2,000 of these slave-artists performed in more than 170 noble theaters and were bought and sold wholesale while at the same time becoming stars. For example, Prince Potemkin bought the whole serf orchestra of Count Kyril Razumovsky for 40,000 rubles. As the popularity of drama grew in Russia, competition developed between the nobles as to who could host the most impressive performances.

While the majority of nobles owned less than a thousand serfs, the wealthiest individuals owned  many more. [[Nicholai Sheremetev]], for instance, owned 210,000 serfs. His son, Peter Sheremetev, was fascinated by the theater and invested in his company. Upon gaining control of the estate, Peter Sheremetev built a theatre company widely recognized during Russia’s golden age of nobility. Sheremetev  fell in love with his star singer and actress whose stage name was “Pearl.”  In 1801 Count Nicholas Sheremetev, aged 50 and the richest man in Russia, secretly married 32-year-old [[Praskovia Kovalyova]] in a ceremony that shocked the Tsar and all of the nation's aristocrats. Sheremetev’s love for theatre was exhibited by his long-term relationship with Kovalyova as well as the high professional quality of his theatre. By the early nineteenth century, there 170 serf theatres  varying greatly in size and quality.

Serf theatre companies provided the basis of public theatres in several Russian towns.&lt;ref&gt;Leach and Borovsky, p.64-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sandra and Woo''''' is a [[comedy]] [[webcomic]] written by a [[Germany|German]] author, Oliver Knörzer, and drawn by an [[Indonesia]]n artist, Puri "Powree" Andini. It is published in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. The first strip was put online on 19 October 2008 and the black-and-white [[comic strip]] has been updated twice a week since then. As of 6 November 2018, 1031 strips have been published. From strip #307, published on 12 September 2011, to strip #398, published on 30 July 2012, the [[comic]] was [[Colorist|colored]] by the [[United States|American]] artist Lisa Moore. She also colored selected strips from the strip archive during this time. The 1000th ''Sandra and Woo'' strip was posted on 1 July 2018. A [[Kickstarter]] was announced on 7 November 2018 for a printed anthology of the first 1031 strips published already, and a second book containing art based on the comic.

==Characters==

The main characters of the comic strip are the 13-year-old girl Sandra North and her pet [[raccoon]] Woo. Sandra lives together with her [[Single parent|single father]] Richard in an unnamed town in the north of the United States. Woo is able to [[Talking animal|speak]], but only talks with Sandra since he’s afraid to end up in a laboratory otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2008/11/17/negotiating-methods/ | title = [0008] Negotiating Methods | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2008-11-17 | work = Sandra and Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo is a quite mischievous raccoon, so Sandra occasionally gets in trouble as a result of Woo’s misbehavior.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/about/ | title = About / FAQ | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2012-05-30 | work = Sandra and Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandra's boyfriend Cloud Williams and Sandra's best friend Larisa Korolev have appeared almost as often as Woo in the webcomic since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2012/01/01/character-appearance-2008-to-2011/ | title = Character appearance 2008 to 2011 | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2012-01-01 | work = Sandra and Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud is the son of two fanatic ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' fans, David and Ye Thuza, who named him after ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''’s hero [[Cloud Strife]]. They also have a younger daughter, named Yuna after the ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|protagonist]]. Cloud gets trained in sword-fighting and combat by his [[Burma|Burmese]] mother Ye Thuza, who was a [[Rebellion|rebel]] in her home country before coming to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2010/04/15/0155-rebel-heart/ | title = [0155] Rebel Heart | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2010-04-15 | work = Sandra and Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larisa is a free spirit who doesn’t think too much about the consequences of her actions. She’s a casual [[pyromania]]c and the only thing she loves more than fire is probably smooching with boys.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; In strip #718 it was revealed that she was born with [[Wolfram syndrome]], which means she has a lifespan of about 30 years, giving us some insight of her aggressive determination to live while she can.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2015/09/14/0718-corrupting-the-youth/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recurring characters include Woo's love interest Lily, the [[Red fox|fox]] Shadow and the [[red squirrel]] Sid, who live in the large forest near Sandra’s house. Shadow and Sid met as kits when they were raised by the same [[Wildlife rehabilitation|wildlife rehabber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2011/01/24/0239-runaway/ | title = [0239] Runaway | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2011-01-24 | work = Sandra and Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt; As indicated by the webcomic's [[tagline]], "a webcomic about friendship, life and the art of (not) eating squirrels", it is a [[running gag]] in the webcomic that Woo, Shadow and other [[carnivore]]s regularly try to eat Sid, but fail in the end.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Reception==

''Sandra and Woo'' received positive reviews from most critics.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Brigid Alverson from ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' noted that "it includes a bit of bad language and a few references to serious subjects, but the cute animals and the clean artwork have plenty of kid-appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2009/06/unbound-hey-kids-comics/ | title = Unbound: Hey, kids' comics! | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Alverson | first = Brigid | date = 2009-06-23 | work = Robot 6 @ Comic Book Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; In issue 06/2010 of the Russian [[Video game journalism|game magazine]] ''[[Game Land]]'', the reviewer pointed out that comic readers would enjoy the references to other comics found in ''Sandra and Woo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sandra and Woo | journal = Game Land | year = 2010 | issue = 6 | pages = 98| id = | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/misc/game-land-06-2010-page-98.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaron Hataway of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''' ''Pop Culture Blog'' found that Andini's art style makes it easy to understand the course of action and that Knörzer understands the "interwoven feelings of tween-aged girls." Criticising that the dialog "can sometimes be a little off," he gave it a rating of 9/10 and concluded that "the characters are wonderfully crafted and the art is delightful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2012/06/webcomics-are-awesome.html/#more-3805 | title = Webcomics Are Awesome | accessdate = 2013-08-10 | last = Hataway | first = Jaron | date = 2012-06-18 | work = Pop Culture Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics were reminded of [[Bill Watterson]]’s ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', which is also given as the main influence by the webcomic author, because of the similar style of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://luprand.com/2009/08/review-sandra-and-woo/ | title = Review: Sandra and Woo | last = Shepherd | first = Simon | date = 2009-08-17 | work = Comical Musings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sandra and Woo'' was nominated three times for the category "Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip" at the 2010, 2011, and 2012 Ursa Major Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ursamajorawards.org/UMA_2010.htm | title = Award Winners 2010 | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | date = 2011-05-13 | work = Ursa Major Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ursamajorawards.org/UMA_2011.htm | title = Award Winners 2011 | accessdate = 2013-03-30 | date = 2012-06-04 | work = Ursa Major Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ursamajorawards.org/UMA_2012.htm | title = Award Winners 2012| accessdate = 2013-08-10 | date = 2013-06-04 | work = Ursa Major Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the category “Best Black and White Art” at ''The Webcomic List Awards'' 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://2010.thewebcomiclistawards.com/index.php/Welcome/awards/3 | title = Best Black and White | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Wood | first = Wendy |author2=Jessica Ottowell  | year = 2011 | work = The Webcomic List Awards 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given a ''Webcomic Beaky Award'' as one of the three best new webcomics of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webcastbeacon.com/webcomic-70-the-2008-beaky-webcomic-awards/ | title = The 2008 Beaky Awards! | accessdate = 2012-05-30 | last = Works | first = Fes | date = 2009-04-01 | work = The Webcast Beacon Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, ''Sandra and Woo'' reached the final round of the ''ComicMix Webcomic Tournament 2013'', a [[single-elimination tournament]] based on votes and donations between 128 of the most popular webcomics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comicmix.com/mix-march-madness-webcomics-tournament/2013/03/28/the-2013-mix-march-madness-webcomics-tournament-finals-sandra-and-woo-vs-bittersweet-candy-bowl/ | title = The 2013 Mix March Madness Webcomics Tournament Finals: Sandra and Woo vs. Bittersweet Candy Bowl! | accessdate = 2013-08-10 | last = Hauman | first = Glenn | date = 2013-03-28 | work = ComicMix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sandra and Woo'' was also the topic of two journal articles by linguist Jun.-Prof. Dr. Ulrike Preußer from the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] published in German teaching magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Preußer|first1=Ulrike|title=Literarisches Lernen am Comic – Zur Visualisierung literarischer Verfahren|journal=kjl&amp;m forschung.schule.bibliothek|date=2013|issue=3|publisher=kopaed verlagsgmbh|location=München|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Preußer|first1=Ulrike|title=Das war ein Schock, das mit der Schlange!|journal=Grundschulunterricht Deutsch|date=2014|issue=2|pages=16–22|publisher=Oldenbourg Schulbuchverlag|location=München}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an in-depth look at the German versions of the strips ''A Sly Raccoon''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/woode/2008/10/19/ein-ausgefuchster-waschbar/ | title = [0001] Ein ausgefuchster Waschbär | accessdate = 2014-06-27 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2008-10-19 | work = Sandra und Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Forbidden Fruit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/woode/2008/12/18/0017-die-verbotene-frucht/ | title = [0017] Die verbotene Frucht | accessdate = 2014-06-27 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2008-12-18 | work = Sandra und Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preußer discusses how teachers can use comic strips such as those to generate literary interest in grade schoolers. The German version of the strip ''Test Of Friendship''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sandraandwoo.com/woode/2012/11/22/0431-test-der-freundschaft/|title=Sandra und Woo auf Deutsch » [0431] Test der Freundschaft|last=Knörzer|first=Oliver|website=www.sandraandwoo.com|language=de|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was included in ''Freiräume – Evangelisches Religionsbuch für Mittelschulen'', a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Religious studies|religious schoolbook]] for German [[Middle school|middle schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/964675740|title=Freiräume 5 Evangelisches Religionsbuch für Mittelschulen|others=Steinkühler, Martina, Claudius-Verlag München|isbn=9783532701607|edition=1. Auflage|location=München|oclc=964675740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sandra and Woo'' was also featured in two scientific papers written by the computer scientists Philip Buchanan, Bachelor of Engineering at the [[University of Canterbury]], Michael Doggett, Associate Professor at [[Lund University]], and Ramakrishnan Mukundan, Associate Professor at the [[University of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Philip|author2=Michael Dogget|title=Transferring Characteristic Proportions to Modify the Artistic Style of Cartoons|journal=Proc.

For the 500th strip, entitled ''The Book of Woo'' and published on 29 July 2013, Knörzer and Andini created four illustrated pages inspired by the [[Voynich manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2013/07/29/0500-the-book-of-woo/ | title = [500] The Book Of Woo | accessdate = 2013-08-10 | last = Knörzer | first = Oliver | date = 2013-07-29 | work = Sandra and Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four pages show strange illustrations next to a cipher text.

== ''Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure'' ==
In summer 2012, the German [[Video game developer|PC game developer]] [[Feline Fuelled Games]] began the development of an [[adventure game]] called '''''Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure''''' featuring all the main characters from ''Sandra and Woo''. On 30 April 2015, the first screenshots of the game were uploaded to the webcomic's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2015/04/30/first-screenshots-from-the-sandra-and-woo-adventure-game/|title=First screenshots from the Sandra and Woo adventure game|date=2015-04-30|work=Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was eventually released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on 5 May 2017 to mixed reviews from [[Video Game Criticism|video game critics]]. In his review for ''[[Adventure Gamers]]'' (3.5/5 stars), Peter Mattsson was fond of the likeable characters and the interesting story, but criticized the design of some of the puzzles and [[Minigame|minigames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adventuregamers.com/articles/view/32915|title=Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure Review|website=Adventure Gamers|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanne Lang-Vorhofer from the German website ''Adventure Corner'' also liked the characters and the story, but had a very negative opinion about the German [[voice-over]], giving the game a score of 68% in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adventurecorner.de/reviews/677/sandra-and-woo-in-the-cursed-adventure|title=Sandra and Woo in The Cursed Adventure - Adventure Corner|website=www.adventurecorner.de|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Gaia'' ==

Since 19 November 2011, the ''Sandra and Woo'' website also hosts Knörzer and Andini's [[Fantasy comics|fantasy webcomic]] '''''Gaia''''', which follows the adventures of several graduates of an elite academy after a deadly attack during graduation ball. ''Gaia'' is based on a story which was originally developed by Feline Fuelled Games for a cancelled campaign [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for the [[PC game]] ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]''. ''Gaia'' is updated twice a week with full color pages. As of 12 July 2018, 673 pages have been published, including 7 [[Book cover|cover]] pages.

'''''Shangani Patrol''''' is a war film based upon the non-fiction book ''A Time to Die'' by Robert Cary (1968), and the historical accounts of the [[Shangani Patrol]], with [[Brian O'Shaughnessy (actor)|Brian O'Shaughnessy]] as Major [[Allan Wilson (army officer)|Allan Wilson]] and [[Will Hutchins]] as the lead Scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]].&lt;ref&gt;Shangani Patrol soundtrack album cover, RPM 1053-S, RPM Film Studios, South Africa, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Also includes the song "Shangani Patrol" by Nick Taylor (1966 recording).

Under the command of Major Wilson, the patrol tracks the fleeing [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] King [[Lobengula]] across the Shangani River. Cut off from the main force, they are ambushed by the Ndebele [[impi]] and, except for the few men sent as reinforcements, all are killed.  Such was the bravery of the Shangani Patrol that the victorious Ndebele said, "They were men of men and their fathers were men before them." Depending on one's viewpoint, this event was one of the great mistakes and military blunders of this time in history, or the last heroic stand of a gallant few.  The incident had lasting significance in England, South Africa, and Rhodesia as the equivalent of '[[Custer's Last Stand]]'.  This is their story, told in a 1970 film shot on location in Matabeleland, [[Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe).

==Plot==
Locale, Mashonaland, [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Southern Rhodesia]], 1893. The [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) (later to become the  British South African Police - BSAP) is based in the encampment of Fort Salisbury (now the capital of [[Zimbabwe]], [[Harare]]). The film starts with a sepia toned trial of two AWOL volunteers and later deserters who were eventually court martialed by the army for stealing gold which was given to them by Matabele warriors on behalf of King Lobengula as a peace offering to end the war. In this trial (which is solely represented by archive drawings and voice-overs) the voice of TV anchor man/journalist Adrian Steed is heard as the judge (later to be seen as Major Forbes) and that of Stuart Brown playing Dr [[Leander Starr Jameson]].  

The film then cuts to a glorious sunset shot of Southern Rhodesia where the camp is situated. After a sentimental encounter between the leader Allan Wilson and his wife May, in which Wilson professes the fervent wish to procreate with his wife in order to produce pioneer Rhodesians, it cuts to the titles of the film, all based on scenes from the film.  The horrific and ultimately unavoidable slaughter of the Patrol is included. Fort Salisbury has a serious problem; it is surrounded by hordes of menacing Matabele warriors, one of whom demands the release of the [[Shona people|Shona]] people under the protection of the BSAC and promises that his warriors will kill them in the bush and not in the [[Shangani River]] so as not to dirty the water. 

The BSAC re-group and under orders from Dr. Jameson, are to pursue King Lobengula’s troops all the way down from Fort Salisbury to the south of Rhodesia, at that time the kingdom of Lobengula, to capture King Lobengula and hold him to ransom.  Wilson leads his troops on what has become a heroic but ultimately futile quest to capture the King in the hope that his troops will surrender. One by one, the volunteers begin showing signs of their inexperience and sometimes lack of courage. One even loses his nerve, runs away and is shot while fleeing. Eventually, with ammunition and morale running low, Wilson dispatches Burnham back to the fort to alert Major Forbes that reinforcements are required. After much argument, Burnham complies and the Shangani Patrol is minus another volunteer. 

Burnham alerts Major Forbes to the peril that the Patrol is in. Forbes refuses to back his troops up. The Patrol is eliminated by the Ndebele after Wilson fires his remaining bullet. He and the party are killed by the Matabele, who then praise the 34 men of the Shangani Patrol as being "men of men". 

The final slaughter of the vanquished is shown in quick fire frame flashes (almost like still pictures) and with no sound, right up until the moment when the Matabele induna screams "Touch not their bodies! They were men of men and their fathers were men before them!" The last scene is of Burnham visiting the burial and monument to the Shangani Patrol at [[Matopo Hills]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8773">A '''soubrette''' is a type of [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] voice [[fach]], often cast as a female [[stock character]] in [[opera]] and theatre. The term arrived in English from [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] via French, and means "conceited" or "coy". A soubrette is also defined as a young woman regarded as flirtatious or frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/soubrette soubrette – definition of soubrette by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
In theatre, a soubrette is a comedy character who is vain and girlish, mischievous, lighthearted, coquettish and gossipy—often a chambermaid or confidante of the [[ingénue]], she often displays a flirtatious or even sexually aggressive nature. The soubrette appeared in [[commedia dell'arte]] scenarios, often in the role of [[Columbina]], where the actress would provide the details of her behavior and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delpiano.com/carnival/html/servetta.html Italian Comedy | Commedia dell'Arte | Servetta | Soubrette | Colombina&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From there, she moved to the works of [[Molière]], which were influenced by the Commedia; the role of Dorine in ''[[Tartuffe]]'' (1664) fits the description. A famous example, though a hundred years later, is Suzanne in [[Beaumarchais]]' ''[[Le Mariage de Figaro]]'' (1784).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068785/soubrette Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
In [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[opera]], the term ''soubrette'' refers to both a [[soprano]] [[voice type]] and a type of opera role. A soubrette voice is light with a bright, sweet [[timbre]], a [[tessitura]] in the mid-range, and with no extensive [[coloratura]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/concertopera/voicetype.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+17:50:42 voicetype&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A soubrette's [[vocal range]] extends approximately from middle C ([[scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) to "high D" (D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolmetsch.com/defsv2.htm Music Dictionary Vm–Vz: Voice (s.), Voices (pl.) – coloratura-soubrette or soprano lirico leggiero], [[Dolmetsch]]&lt;/ref&gt; The voice has a lighter [[vocal weight]] than other soprano voices with a brighter timbre. Many young singers start out as soubrettes but as they grow older and the voice matures more physically they may be reclassified as another voice type, usually either a [[light lyric soprano]], a [[lyric coloratura soprano]], or a [[coloratura mezzo-soprano]]. Rarely does a singer remain a soubrette throughout her entire career.{{sfn|Stark|2003}} The tessitura of the soubrette tends to lie a bit lower than the lyric soprano and [[spinto soprano]].{{sfn|Boldrey|1994}}

The soubrette roles are typically found in comic operas or operettas and they usually portray good-looking, youthful girls who are flirtatious, saucy, and street-wise. Typically these roles are sung by younger singers and both [[sopranos]] and [[mezzo-soprano]]s are cast in them.{{sfn|Boldrey|1992}} Many soubrette roles have a considerable amount of spoken German dialogue, and therefore the soubrette singer must possess both an excellent comprehension of the German language and considerable acting skills. It is rare today to find true soubrettes singing in major opera houses as their voices are typically unable to carry over larger orchestras in larger halls. Often lyric, coloratura, and mezzo-sopranos are cast in soubrette roles, especially in the early part of their singing careers. This does not mean that these singers are soubrette sopranos but it does mean they can play soubrette roles.{{sfn|Boldrey|1992}} The [[coloratura soprano]] has a higher range, can sing more dexterous vocal passages and has a somewhat brighter sound than the soubrette. The [[lyric soprano]] has a richer voice and higher range than the soubrette soprano. The mezzo-soprano can sing as high as a soubrette but with a darker timbre and heavier weight in the voice. Mezzos also have a much more extensive range in the lower register.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipasource.com/soprano#KOLORATURSOPRAN/KOLORATUR_SOUBRETTE_(c_to_f) IPA Source – Soprano&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the beautiful light voice of the soubrette is ideal for [[baroque music]], [[early music]] and [[baroque opera]], as well as many [[art songs]]. However, the soubrette soprano voice is limited even in this repertoire by its lack of coloratura skill and relatively limited range.{{sfn|Boldrey|1992}} Many operettas and musicals include soubrette characters, such as Valencienne in ''[[The Merry Widow]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vlog.org/merrywidow2006/widow_auditions.htm The Merry Widow – VLOG Spring 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820025214/http://www.vlog.org/merrywidow2006/widow_auditions.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], the [[Jessie Bond]] mezzo-soprano roles such as Cousin Hebe (''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'') and Lady Angela ([[Patience (opera)|''Patience'']]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/B/BondJessie.htm Jessie Bond&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the character Ellie Mae Chipley, who sings "Life Upon the Wicked Stage" in Kern and Hammerstein's ''[[Show Boat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_s/show_boat.htm ''Showboat'' – Kern/Hammerstein&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Superstars''''' is an all-around sports competition that pits elite athletes from different sports against one another in a series of athletic events resembling a [[decathlon]]. Points are awarded for the position in which the competitor places in each event. The competitor with the most points at the end of all ten events is declared the champion.

On the original ABC version, an athlete could compete in up to seven events, but no athlete was permitted to compete in the sport(s) of his or her profession. In the World, International, European and British versions of the contest, athletes would compete in 8 out of 10 events, with no one generally allowed to take part in their own sport, although some handicapping rules did apply.

The idea was developed by 1948 and 1952 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion [[Dick Button]]. He shopped the idea to all three U.S. television networks, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] bought it as a special for the winter of 1973. The first Superstars competition was held in [[Rotonda West, Florida]] in March 1973 and was won by pole vaulter [[Bob Seagren]]. The [[BBC]] covered the competition and aired their own programme, featuring British athletes on 31 December 1973, which was won by 400 metre hurdles Olympic champion [[David Hemery]]. Television broadcasts of the competitions were popular both in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Further events featuring European athletes started from 1975, with six World Superstars championships taking place from 1977 to 1982.

Competitors participate in a range of different sporting events, including a [[100-yard dash]]/[[100m sprint]], [[800 metres|half mile (800 m)]] run, [[obstacle course]] or [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], weightlifting, [[soccer]] skills, [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[tennis]], [[basketball]], [[bicycle racing]], [[Shooting sports|shooting]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. The sports have varied over time and between the various national and international competitions; in the first competition there was no obstacle course, but [[table tennis]] and [[baseball]] hitting were included, while the European versions featured a 600m Steeplechase, indoor cycling on a highly banked velodrome, and the infamous 'Gym Tests'.

Canadian [[soccer]] player [[Brian Budd]] was unbeaten in Superstars contests, winning the World Championship three times from 1978 to 1980, making him the most successful Superstar of all time.

==British, European and International Superstars==

===1973===
[[File:Dick Button at 1980 Winter Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|Dick Button, the creator of the US version of ''Superstars'']]Originally aired in the US by ABC in March 1973, Superstars was first broadcast in Britain on 31 December 1973 as "Britain's Sporting Superstars", closely following the American format.  [[David Vine]], who was the main presenter of the BBC programme from 1973 to 1985, said "in 1972, [[Ron Pickering]], myself, [[Don Revie]], [[Billy Bremner]] and TV producer [[Barney Colehan]] sat in a hotel in [[Leeds]] and formulated Superstars but the BBC dismissed the idea. Then Dick Button started it in the States and the BBC bought the rights".&lt;ref&gt;"Superstars: Best of the Best" BBC DVD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Recorded at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] in August and promoted as a challenge between Britain's seven best sportsmen, the contest was won by [[David Hemery]], the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic champion]] in the 400 metres hurdles, defeating [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Bobby Moore]], [[Joe Bugner]], [[Roger Taylor (tennis)|Roger Taylor]], [[Tony Jacklin]] and [[Barry John]]. Featuring the first ever gym test (devised by Pickering, and comprising circuit running, a medicine ball throw, parallel bar dips and squat thrusts) the event came down to the final steeplechase, where Hemery overcame a 100m handicap to pass Barry John with 60 metres left. Shown on New Year's Eve, the programme was a major success and was repeated the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/355940|title=– Britain's Sporting Superstars BFI Page|work=BFI|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1974===
In the second event in 1974, World Light-Heavyweight boxing champion [[John Conteh]] comfortably beat an ill Hemery and [[Colin Bell]] to win the title, again at Crystal Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/725131|title=The Sporting Superstars|work=BFI|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conteh credited the highly competitive nature of the competition with increasing his abilities as a boxer, the inception of this cross-sport contest quickly encouraged many top athletes to push themselves further, introducing the idea that the winner could claim to be the country's "top sportsman" and also provided an arena where recently retired champions (such as Hemery and [[Lynn Davies]]) could extend their careers.&lt;ref&gt;"Superstars: Best of the Best" BBC DVD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975===
Following the success of the first two standalone UK competitions, in 1975 the British national Superstars contest was suspended, and the event was widened to include participants from continental [[Europe]]. Five preliminary heats were held, followed by a final at the [[Ahoy Rotterdam|Ahoy]] indoor arena in Rotterdam, famous for its banked, wooden cycling track. This proved to make Superstars a major hit, achieving large audiences across the continent and paving the way for the International and World Superstars editions to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuperstars.org/comp/75eurofinal.html|title=1975 EUROPEAN FINAL|publisher=Thesuperstars.org|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorable events in the first year of European Superstars included [[Malcolm Macdonald]] winning the 100m sprint in a Superstars record time of 10.9 seconds (after being made to run the race twice following the false start of another competitor), David Hemery being beaten by Dutch field hockey player [[Ties Kruize]] following a fall in the 600m [[Steeplechase (athletics)|Steeplechase]], Swedish Discus thrower [[Ricky Bruch]] setting records in the weight lifting and medicine ball throw section of the gym tests and the first appearance of pole vaulter [[Kjell Isaksson]], who dominated the final heat in Sweden, scoring a then record 69 (out of a possible 80) points.&lt;ref&gt;"Superstars: Best of the Best" BBC DVD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the final in Rotterdam, Kruize was badly injured in a car accident and was replaced by Hemery, who finished second. Kjell Isaksson dominated the event again, winning four of his eight events and finished second or third in three others, winning the title with an event to spare.

The rules for European Superstars allowed athletes to compete in "near specialist" events with a handicap, meaning that both Hemery and Isaksson were allowed to run in the 100m and Steeplechase, but only after giving the other finalists a head start. In the final 600m Steeplechase event Hemery made up a 100m handicap on his rivals in order to finish in overall second, after again falling badly at the water jump and running the last 100m with badly torn ankle ligaments.&lt;ref&gt;Superstars:1975 EUROPEAN FINAL, BBC TV, 31 December 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976===
In 1976 national competitions were resumed and Hemery again became UK Superstar, beating Conteh and [[Formula 1]] World Champion [[James Hunt]] easily. By now Hemery was a "professional Superstar", competing in Britain, Europe and the US, and devising his own training regime. His performances duly improved, and even though [[Judo at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympic Judoka]] [[David Starbrook]] took his parallel bar dips record in the gym tests, Hemery had become Britain's top competitor.

[[File:Bjorn Borg (1979).jpg|thumb|right| Björn Borg won his heat in European Superstars at Vichy, but was unable to compete again because of scheduling conflicts with his tennis career.]] In European Superstars, Isaksson beat Hemery in a heat held in Sweden. Two of the highest profile heat winners, [[Björn Borg]] and [[Kevin Keegan]], were not able to compete in the Rotterdam final due to scheduling conflicts. Keegan's victory produced a memorable moment when he crashed during the cycle racing in his heat. With deep cuts and abrasions to his arm, shoulder and back, the [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] footballer was expected to withdraw, but with a large crowd present to watch him he said "These people here in the stands have come here to see me make a fool of myself and they've got a right to it!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/oliver-brown/9679031/London-2012-Olympic-heroes-make-a-fitting-cast-of-Superstars.html|title=London 2012 Olympic heroes make a fitting cast of Superstars|publisher=Telegraph|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=21 June 2015|first=Oliver|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; got back on his bike and won the re-ride.  Keegan then easily won the steeplechase, but like many of the highest profile performers, his schedule was too full to allow him to compete as regularly as the Superstars format demanded. Partly because of this, less renowned athletes like Isaksson came to dominate and be recognised outside their specialisms.

In the Ahoy final, Isaksson won five events and finished 20 points ahead of his nearest rival. The top eight finishers were also guaranteed a place at the inaugural World Superstars competition, to be held in the US the following year.

===1977===
1977 provided two new champions, with Isaksson taking part only in the World contest and David Hemery competing in American Superstars. In the UK national Superstars, rower [[Tim Crooks]] beat future [[1983 World's Strongest Man|World's Strongest Man]] [[Geoff Capes]] in a tight contest, but failed to qualify for the European final, losing by one point to [[François Tracanelli]] in the Spanish heat. Representing Great Britain instead at the Ahoy final was [[Rugby League]] player [[Keith Fielding]], who finished a close second, matching Hemery's best ever performance by a British Superstar.

The winner of 1977 European Superstars was the returning Ties Kruize, who was now fully recovered from his car crash. With just the indoor steeplechase left, Kruize was one point behind [[Jean-Paul Coche]] but five ahead of Fielding. With Coche having completed his events Fielding needed to win the final race, with Kruize finishing no better than third. With Fielding already finished (and celebrating) Kruize passed [[Speed Skating|speed skater]] [[Hans van Helden]] on the final straight to win by 2.5 points. An exhausted Fielding then told BBC TV that the loss was "a damn, bloody shame", but both qualified for the 1978 World Championship.

===1979===
There was no UK national or European Superstars contest in 1978, but both events returned in 1979, along with a new "Past Masters" event for competitors over 35, which was won by [[Lynn Davies]], the [[Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Men's long jump|1964 Olympic Long Jump]] champion. 1979 saw the first appearances of judoka [[Brian Jacks]], who became Britain's most famous Superstar. Jacks had enormous upper body strength and quickly came to dominate the gym tests, setting records in squat thrusts and, in particular, the parallel bar dips. In the 1979 UK national final Jacks comprehensively beat the field, and then went on to compete in Rotterdam for the European title.

No Briton had ever won this title, but Jacks was a strong favourite against defending champion Ties Kruize. Jacks won the gym tests and set a new record time in the cycling. At start of the final event, the  steeplechase, Jacks had a small lead, but was out of events. Kruize accumulated enough points in the steeplechase to join Jacks in a tie for first place. With no tie-breaking system in operation both men were crowned European Superstar, making Jacks the most successful British Superstar ever. Jacks succumbed to [[shingles]] in late 1979 so was unable to travel to [[The Bahamas]] for the World Championship.

===1980===
Superstars regularly attracted over 10 million TV viewers in the UK and Jacks became a household name, appearing on children's TV shows and picking up endorsements usually beyond the reach of a minority sport participant. Superstars also expanded again in 1980, adding International Superstars to its list of programmes, though this was as a direct replacement for the European event. Although popular in the UK, US, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Australia, Superstars reached its peak at the turn of the decade, and one by one (starting in Europe) the participating nations fell away.

Against Jacks in 1980 was [[Daley Thompson]], globally recognised as the top multi-sports athlete after his victory in the [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics – Men's decathlon|1980 Olympic Games decathlon]] competition. With Brian Budd in attendance for the UK National final, Brian Jacks took on Thompson, [[Steve Assinder]] from Basketball, [[Modern Pentathlon|pentathlete]] [[Danny Nightingale]] and the new "Past Master", former 400m hurdler [[John Sherwood (athlete)|John Sherwood]], who won all his events in the heats, setting a new record.

In the gym tests Jacks scored 80 in the dips and 73 in the squat thrusts, and finished 18 points ahead of Sherwood in second place. Thompson finished third. John Sherwood in finishing in second place gained a place in the World Championships and with it the possibility of big prize money. To ensure that he was able to finish second Sherwood had to turn professional part-way through the competition in order to compete in the 100m (as his status as an amateur track and field athlete would normally have barred him from competing in this event). Although many amateur athletes (most notably Kjell Isaksson) had competed in Superstars since its inception, they had never been able to retain any prize money, with this instead going to their sport. In winning three World Superstar titles, Brian Budd won over $130,000, while [[Bob Seagren]] (the first World Champion) won over $200,000.

In International Superstars in Israel Jacks defeated both of the other European Superstars champions Ties Kruize and Kjell Isaksson, as well as [[1980 Tour de France]] winner [[Joop Zoetemelk]] to claim the new title.

For Sherwood – a PE teacher from [[Sheffield]] at this time, and not a full-time sportsman – the World Championship proved to be a success, but not for Jacks, aiming to become the first European to win the title. In The Bahamas both Britons won events: Jacks in the weightlifting and the gym tests&amp;mdash;after an epic struggle against Brian Budd&amp;mdash;and Sherwood in the cycle race. However, it was Sherwood's two second-places in the football and 800 metres that propelled him into second place, with the cycling coming at Jacks' expense, and winning him $15,000 in the process. He was officially now Britain's best ever Superstar, although he had still finished 26 points behind Budd.

===1981===

To start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off "Challenge of the Champions" programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two "Past Masters" and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.

This was arguably the strongest ever UK Superstars contest, and with so many competitive sportsmen present it was no surprise that records tumbled. Jacks was the heavy favourite, and duly won his 'banker' events, but his inability to compete in the running tests left him facing huge obstacles.
His performance in the gym tests was simply astonishing, smashing his own parallel bars record in the starkly lit  Wycombe sports centre with an awesome 100 in 54 seconds; had he pushed himself all the way to the minute he could easily have added more. His innovative 'rocking' technique (like Budd's sliding squat thrusts) was widely copied, but none of his rivals could get anywhere near him, and though Sherwood again pushed him close in the squats section, in reality Jacks was in a class of one here.

The key to winning Superstars had become to gain maximum points in your best events and then to place as highly in the others – simple in theory, but appallingly hard in practice. Jacks usually dominated in the gym and weightlifting, and almost always also won the cycling and canoeing. That gave him a nominal 40 point head start on his rivals, but if this sequence could be disrupted, then Jacks was relying on picking up more points elsewhere. He never competed in the two running events and was a weaker shot that his rivals, so he was then faced with winning the basketball or swimming which were much more equal events. And in the Challenge of the Champions Keith Fielding was able to disrupt Jacks' strategy by enough to beat him.

Early on Jacks was looking good, beating Fielding in a record time to win the canoeing, but once Fielding had won the cycling Jacks was beaten. Fielding had entered the event hoping to take the Superstars 100m record first and foremost, and then to put up a good showing against Jacks. Now he was the ultimate champion.

The key had been his ability to score well throughout – he was second in the steeplechase for instance – and even losing his 'banker' (the 100m to David Hemery) was not a problem. By winning the steeplechase in the final event, Lynn Davies was able to push Jacks down into third place, and with injuries forcing the judoka to miss the 1981 British final later that season, this would be an ignominious end to his Superstars story. For Fielding, the forgotten man of 1978, this was a new dawn that he followed up by a second convincing win in the UK final.

[[File:Scheckter Monza 1979.jpg|thumb|right| Jody Scheckter famously won the 1981 World Superstars Championship after applying motor oil to his training shoes to help him slide faster during the squat thrusts contest.]] Here, in a new venue [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], the Rugby League winger reached his Superstars highpoint, dominating Davies, pentathlete [[Jim Fox (pentathlete)|Jim Fox]] and new challenger [[Andy Ripley]] from Rugby Union with a strong all-round performance. He had his share of luck (water skier [[Mike Hazelwood (water skier)|Mike Hazelwood]] was tied in first place in the shooting when he mis-fired the decisive shot, gifting 10 points to Fielding) but he was on top form this season. He had every reason to believe he had a strong chance in both International and World Superstars later that year, but, as so often in Superstars, he could not hold his form; the ever-increasing levels of competition saw him lose, first to a resurgent Ripley in the second International, then to a motor-oil powered [[Jody Schekter]] in the 1981 World Final. Again, Fielding would never win another Superstars event. The curse of the European champions seemed to be holding strong.

===1982: A British World Champion===

Since 1978, the BBC had also produced an equally popular British Superteams event, which was dominated from the start by the "Athletes" – a team of [[Track and Field]] stars, who won every series but the final one in 1985. From 1979 a stand-out performer in this team was [[Brian Hooper]], a pole-vaulter with an immense will to win. He first came to prominence in the 1979 Superteams final, failing to be able to jump onto a [[balance beam]] in the [[obstacle course]] event, and by 1982 he had blossomed into a fine, all-round performer.

Leading the 1982 Athletes team to Superteams victory, Hooper was trailed by the BBC as the new challenger to watch in that season's UK final. He was a strong swimmer, almost unbeatable in the canoeing and gym tests, and competitive in all his other events. And then he lost in his heat, to [[Karate]] fighter [[Vic Charles]], and his promise seemed lost. However, Charles was unable to compete in the 1982 final, and Hooper was his replacement. He would go on to win his next five straight Superstars events, becoming two time British Superstar, three-time International Superstar, and the 1982 World Superstar Champion. Only Brian Budd has a better record in the competition.

Hooper's victory in the 1982 World Championship came at the expense of defending World Champion [[Jody Scheckter]], and [[American football|American Footballers]] [[James Lofton]], [[Cris Collinsworth]] and [[Mark Gastineau]]. Hooper later stated that he felt pressured by the aggressive nature of the US challengers, which came to a head in the final of the bike race, where he found himself boxed in by several rivals all seemingly working in concert to hold him back. Charging through powerfully and fairly, Hooper finished comfortably in the lead, but was then faced with official protests, claiming he either took a short-cut off the track or otherwise acted illegally. He clearly had not, and was quickly declared the legitimate winner. Victories in the rowing and second place in the gym test and swimming saw him win by just 3/4 of a point from talented runner Lofton. He was however 10 3/4 points clear entering the final event (and thus guaranteed to win the title) and coasted through his obstacle course heat. As only the two fastest heat winners ran in the final, Hooper could not add to his tally. Lofton on the other hand had $10000 to fight for, and bested [[Renaldo Nehemiah]] in the final event, and duly took second place, something again he was virtually guaranteed before the event.

By now a professional Superstar (he won $37000 for the 1982 World Championship), Brian Hooper dominated British and International Superstars until he retired in 1984. He beat all of the major British Superstars of his era except Brian Jacks, who had previously retired through injury. Returning to the event age 50 in 2004, Hooper competed ably despite a torn pectoral muscle, finishing fourth against rivals at least 15 years younger than himself. Even now he still won the [[kayaking]] and came second in [[golf]], almost making the final, beaten only in the end by an agonising uphill bike race.

===1983 to 1985: End of the first era===
Though Brian Hooper continued to compete in (and dominate) Superstars events until he retired in 1984, he stopped competing in the UK national contest after 1983, and he was succeeded as national champion in 1984 by athlete [[Garry Cook]]. The 1983 championship was also notable for the record breaking performances of [[Des Drummond]] in the 100m, with the agile [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh Rugby League]] player managing to lower the mark down to only 10.85 seconds, in itself a time comparable with many full-time track and field athletes who would compete in the [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|1984 Summer Olympics]]. The final also saw Hooper beat Vic Charles (the only man ever to finish above him in any Superstars competition at that point).

In the 1984 final Garry Cook was pushed very close by professional [[stunt performer]] and [[motorcycle]] racer, [[Eddie Kidd]], but he held on against a weaker field than usual to become champion. Cook also competed in the now more popular ''Superteams'' series, as part of the never-defeated 'Athletes' team, who were only finally beaten during the last season of the show in 1985. By now the BBC had decided that the programme was in need of 'freshening up' and had altered the format several times, changing the format of the gym tests to include bar jumps and adding computerised scoring to stop the trend of sliding squat thrusts. The programme was also moved to [[Portsmouth]] and took on a naval theme, adding a [[field gun competition]] in a bid to boost flagging ratings. The final series of ''Superteams'' was duly won by 'Watersports' (a team representing swimming, water-skiing and diving) which was led by Olympic swimmer [[Robin Brew]] who excelled at running events and also in the gym tests, where the bar jump became his speciality.

Continuing this success, Brew reached the final of the 1985 UK national championship where he narrowly beat a strong field, including [[Rugby League]] player [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]], Olympic silver medallist [[Judoka]] [[Neil Adams (judoka)|Neil Adams]] and then only a one-time Olympic gold medal winning rower, [[Steve Redgrave]]. The RAF officer then completed a successful first year in Superstars by becoming the last ever International champion, this time much more comfortably.

A new period of Superstars dominance could have evolved for Brew, but with the UK version being the only surviving national championship outside the United States, and no prospect of World Superstars being revived, once TWI decided to halt production of International Superstars the BBC version was soon cancelled as well. With viewing figures falling, and potential participants ever more pressurised into not entering by scheduling conflicts and insurance demands the BBC's decision to end the show was neither unexpected or mourned, and although David Vine, Ron Pickering and executive producer Peter Hylton Cleaver did fight to keep the show on air, it was all to no avail.

Over the next fifteen years, though the US version continued unabated, Superstars in the UK existed solely as a nostalgic memory for sporting clip shows, usually focussing on Kevin Keegan falling off his bike, [[Stan Bowles]] shooting the table instead of a target, or Brian Jacks eating oranges. During the 1990s BBC programmes (such as ''[[Fantasy Football League]]'') regularly made use of this footage – and kept the show in the public spotlight – while [[Sky Sports]] began to show full-length programmes on its ''Sky Sports Classic'' channel. This, together with a new generation of television executives and sports presenters who grew up as fans of the show created interest in a revival, which finally happened as part of the 2002 [[Sport Relief]] charity event.

=== 2002 to 2004: Sport Relief and a new era ===

In 2002, the BBC held a one-off, but truncated, UK Championship as a major feature of its biannual [[Sport Relief]] charity telethon. Featuring a field including [[Steve Redgrave|Sir Steve Redgrave]], [[Martin Offiah]], [[John Regis (athlete)|John Regis]], [[Austin Healey]] and [[Chris Boardman]], the event was a first for a British Superstars event in that it featured both non-British competitors ([[Dwight Yorke]] and [[Gianluca Vialli]]) and also female participants ([[Alex Coomber]] and [[Stephanie Cook]]). With only seven events (as opposed to the usual eight or ten) and being only part of a larger event instead of being a stand-alone series, the contest was different from those of the earlier era.

While the participants were no less able, the event was less 'competitive', with no prize money at stake and no European, World or International contest to qualify for. It was dominated by Healey, who won four of his five events, and came runner-up in the other. Stephanie Cook was the other stand-out performer, finishing joint second with Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman, and finishing runner-up in two events.

The event was an overwhelming success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sport_relief/2126921.stm|title=BBC SPORT  - Special Events - Sport Relief  - Sport Relief as it happened|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it inspired the BBC to create a new UK Championship series in 2003. Produced by [[Trans World International|TWI]] and held in [[La Manga Club]] in Spain, this time it was a full event with heats and a final, something that had not been part of the series since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SGVU6qe5iacJ:www.broadcastnow.co.uk/bbc-brings-back-70s-superstars/1110368.article+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|title=BBC brings back 70s Superstars|publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008: Revival on Five===
On 29 April 2008, it was announced that the show would be returning on [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] for the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athletics-weekly.com/newsarticle.php?id=530 Athletes feature in new Superstars TV series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522101402/http://www.athletics-weekly.com/newsarticle.php?id=530 |date=May 22, 2009 }} Athletics Weekly. Retrieved 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by TWI with eight one-hour shows. In a change of format, the competitors were split into four teams, captained by [[Kelly Holmes]], [[Steve Redgrave]], [[Roger Black]] and [[Mike Catt]].

===2012: Olympic Superstars===

Following the success of [[Team GB]] at the [[2012 London Olympics]], the BBC revived ''Superstars'' for a single special edition that aired on Saturday 29 December at 6.45pm, comprising a men's and women's UK championship.  Presented by [[Gabby Logan]], [[Iwan Thomas]] and [[Denise Lewis]], the event was held on 24 &amp; 25 November 2012, at the sports facilities of the [[University of Bath#Sports and TeamBath|University of Bath]].

The show featured Olympic medallists who were coached for swimming by [[Rebecca Adlington]], and the competitors were: [[Alistair Brownlee]], [[Jonathan Brownlee]], [[Mo Farah]], [[Robbie Grabarz]], [[Michael Jamieson]], [[Anthony Joshua]], [[Andrew Triggs Hodge]], [[Peter Wilson (sport shooter)|Peter Wilson]], [[Nicola Adams]], [[Lizzie Armitstead]], [[Laura Bechtolsheimer]], [[Gemma Gibbons]], [[Helen Glover (rower)|Helen Glover]], [[Katherine Grainger]], [[Jade Jones (taekwondo)|Jade Jones]], [[Christine Ohuruogu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/superstars-2012.html|title=BBC - BBC One to broadcast Superstars 2012 with Team GB athletes - Media centre|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Men's Championship was won comfortably by Olympic Super-heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua, while the Women's Championship was won even more convincingly by women's [[coxless pair]] Olympic champion Helen Glover. Joshua won with an event to spare, while Glover won her final event (the Gym Tests) to win the Women's Superstars title by 14 points.

* In 1979 Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks finished as joint-winners of the European Championship.

===Miscellany and Records===

* Three men each won two European or International Superstars championships: Swedish pole vaulter [[Kjell Isaksson]], Dutch field hockey player [[Ties Kruize]] and British judoka [[Brian Jacks]]. [[Brian Hooper]] won three, and one World championship.
* One of the European competitors was [[Ivo Van Damme]], a middle-distance runner who was killed in a road accident in 1976.
*For most of the duration of the run of this programme on BBC TV, the programmes' producer was [[Peter Hylton Cleaver]].
* Brian Jacks had a computer game based on the competition, ''Brian Jacks Superstar Challenge'', named after him.
* In 1982, electronic scoring systems were introduced, with pressure pads for the [[squat thrust]]s. These originally ran on the [[Commodore VIC-20]], and later on the [[BBC Micro]]. The programs were developed and the system operated by [[Simon Taylor (photographer / author)|Simon Taylor]].
* In the spin-off called ''The Superteams'' a memorable moment was when British athlete [[Garry Cook]] played goalkeeper in the six-a-side hockey contest without wearing a helmet, running out of the [[D circle]] and tackling an opponent.
* The BBC ''Superstars'' used a musical theme composed by [[Johnny Pearson]] titled "[[Heavy Action]]". This piece of music later became familiar to Americans as the theme music for ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.
*After each event, the competitor who is ranked first gains 10 points, the next best ranked gets 7, then 4, 2 and then finally 1 point. These points are then totalled up to give a total out of 80 (from a maximum of eight events). Lynn Davies won seven of his eight events in the 1979 UK Past Masters contest and scored 70 points (a record).

''The Superstars'' was first broadcast by [[ABC Sports]] as a two-hour special in 1973. [[Bob Seagren]], an Olympic [[pole vault]] gold medalist, was the first winner. However, it was [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] boxer [[Joe Frazier]] who nearly stole the show. In the very first event, the 50 meter swimming heats, Frazier nearly drowned, and only after he was retrieved from the pool did he admit to commentators that he didn't know how to swim. When a reporter asked him why he tried the race, Frazier replied, "How was I to know I couldn't unless I tried it?". He also famously opined, "That [[Mark Spitz]]," (who had won several gold medals for swimming at the 1972 Olympics) "is a tough muthafucker!"{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Spin-offs included a women's version of the show, and a ''Superteams'' version, where the two World Series and Super Bowl teams each faced off (except that the owner of the [[New York Yankees]] at the time, [[George Steinbrenner]] prohibited his players from competing, so in years where the Yankees were in the World Series, their league's runner-up competed instead), with the winners competing in the finals. There were also brief runs of versions for celebrities and for juniors, where each state's Department of Education was asked to nominate one [[high school]], and those schools each sent one boy and one girl to qualifying rounds, with the final aired on TV.

The show remained popular in the 1970s, but ratings declined and the last edition produced by ABC came in 1984. [[NBC Sports]] picked up the program the next year and carried it from 1985 to 1990. ABC took the show back in 1991, and broadcast it through 1994. During a three-year period (1991–1993) the event was held in [[Cancun, Mexico]]. The competitions were held in different areas of Cancun Palace and Melia Cancun hotels. During that period former great NFL players [[Frank Gifford]], [[Dan Dierdorf]] and [[Lynn Swann]] worked as commentators of the Superstars Tournament.

There was no American version for three years (1995–1997) then ABC revived the show in 1998 and broadcast it through 2002. [[CBS Sports]] picked up the show the next year.

Several athletes won the event two or more times. Among them:
* [[Kyle Rote, Jr.]], Soccer, 1974, 1976, 1977
* [[Renaldo Nehemiah]], [[track and field athletics|track and field]]/[[American football]], 1981–83, 1986
* [[Herschel Walker]], American football, 1987–88
* [[Willie Gault]], American football, 1989–90
* [[Dave Johnson (decathlete)|Dave Johnson]], decathlon, 1993–94
* [[Jason Sehorn]], American football, 1998–2000

[[Speed skating|Speed skater]] [[Anne Henning]] won three straight women's competitions (1976–78). [[Basketball]] player [[Ann Meyers]] matched that feat in 1981 through 1983. [[Volleyball]] player [[Linda Fernandez]] won two straight events in 1979 and 1980.

===2009 edition===
In 2009 the franchise was revived for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. [[The Superstars (2009 edition)|''The Superstars'']] paired athletes and celebrities to compete as a team. [[Kristi Leskinen]] ([[Freestyle Skiing]]) and [[Maksim Chmerkovskiy]] ([[Ballroom Dancing]]) won the competition.

===Obstacle Course variations===
The popular obstacle course was the final event of the original ''Superstars'' to determine the overall winner. The ''Superteams'' version featured the obstacle course as an earlier event. The original course had the contestants climb a 12' rope wall, run through a tubular tunnel, push a blocking sled (or traverse across monkey bars in the Women's and ''Superteams'' versions), cleanly step through a dozen tires (2 rows of 6), jump over a water hazard (rectangular pool of water), clear a 4'6" high bar, jump two sets of hurdles and cross the FINISH line. Penalty seconds were added for missing tires, stepping in the water hazard and knocking down the high bar and/or hurdles. Some athletes have shown super skills on this course by climbing the wall without using the rope and clearing the high bar like a hurdle.

For the 2009 "elimination event" version, contestants have to climb a rope wall, duck under four rope hurdles (2 sets side-by-side) (this was changed mid-season to a balance beam just over 3-inches wide), cleanly step through a bungee grid, ascend and descend a large ramp, push through a large door-like block, jump two sets of hurdles, run through a [[cargo net]] and cross the FINISH line.

===SuperTeams===
A companion competition, this event would pit the two World Series teams and the two Super Bowl teams in a playoff-type match using all the Superstars events, with some team events added such as Hawaiian rowing and the Tug-of-War. The running, swimming, and cycling events were relays, with the cycling done on tandem bikes; the obstacle course (which had its blocking sleds replaced by monkey bars similar to those used in the women's competition, as it was felt that the football teams would have too much of an advantage over the baseball teams) was decided by best combined time. The team that won the most events in each semi-final advanced to the SuperTeams finals where an ultimate champions would be crowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuperstars.org|title='The Superstars': a page describing the Superstars competitions over the years.|publisher=Thesuperstars.org|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Yankees advanced to the World Series in 1977, 1978, and 1981, and was eligible to participate in these events held the early in the following year, however Yankees owner George Steinbrenner refused to allow his players to compete, as he had several of his top players under lucrative long term guaranteed contracts that required players to get ownership permission to participate in outside athletic activities, which in this case Steinbrenner refused to grant. In those years, loser of the ALCS in those years took the Yankees place, and in all three years that team ultimately won the competition.

In the 1978 final, the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Kansas City Royals]] split the first six events, so the tug-of-war would decide the winner. However, while there was a time limit in the preliminary rounds, there was none in the final, and after 75 minutes in which neither team came particularly close to winning, the organizers declared the event (and, as a result, the competition) a tie.

=== SuperTeams Winners ===
*1975 – [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]
*1976 – [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]
*1977 – [[Cincinnati Reds]]
*1978 – (tie) [[Dallas Cowboys]] &amp; [[Kansas City Royals]]
*1979 – [[Kansas City Royals]]

[[File:BobSeagren.jpg|thumb|right| Bob Seagren won the inaugural World Superstars Championship at Callaway Gardens in Georgia in 1977]]

In 1976, following the success of the ''Superstars'' programme in the US, Britain and mainland Europe, [[Dick Button]] and American host broadcaster [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] decided to organise a World Superstars Final, to be held the following March at [[Callaway Gardens]] in Georgia.

The participants in the inaugural "World Superstars Championship" were to be the competitors from across the various national and continental versions of the show with the best records in the previous years, and as such the US was to be represented by its previous national champions [[Bob Seagren]], [[O. J. Simpson]], and three time reigning current champion [[Kyle Rote, Jr.|Kyle Rote, Jr]]. The rest of the participants were to be drawn from the top six finishers from the 1976 European Superstars final, the top six from the US version in 1977, and the winner of the 1976 Canadian Superstars event. In reality, as was always an issue for Superstars, several competitors withdrew in the weeks before the contest, with Rote and Simpson pulling out just a week before taping, leaving a slightly weakened field headed by Seagren, double European champion [[Kjell Isaksson]], Canadian champion [[Tony Gabriel]] and the joint runners-up from the US final [[Guy Drut]] and [[Dave Casper]].

Aside from the withdrawals of Rote and Simpson the other major omission from the field was the double British champion and 1975 European runner-up [[David Hemery]] who was studying at university in the US, and had failed to qualify for the 1976 European final after finishing a narrow third in his heat. Had he paddled his Kayak 0.4 seconds faster or scored two more points in the pistol shooting he would have made the final, and with other strong European challengers (like [[Ties Kruize]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Björn Borg]]) also absent, the European challenge was significantly poorer.

The contest started with [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]], where [[Peter Snell]] capitalised on a mistake from fellow athlete [[Frank Nusse]] to win the first ten points, then the penalty shoot-out. Here [[Gareth Edwards]] was one kick away from winning nearly $5000, but he fluffed his final shot and had to settle for a five-way tie for second place, while Guy Drut easily won the play-off, and took the money. After this it became a two-way contest between the two pole-vaulters, Isaksson and Seagren.

Controversially, Seagren (by nature of being retired from [[IAAF]] competition) was allowed to run in the track and field events, while Isaksson was not. Seagren later admitted that this gave him a major advantage over his younger, Swedish rival, as running was a fundamental part of any pole-vaulter's training regime, and thus they had to be favoured in such events. While Seagren was unable to win the 100 yard sprint, he did score two points, and his win in the half-mile race gave him a further ten. Isaksson countered with a win in the gym tests and two second-place finishes in the bike race and weightlifting. Seagren however kept competing strongly and his victory in the swimming and second place in the gym tests saw him take a 33 points to 30 lead over Snell and Isaksson into the final event: the obstacle course.

This event was not held in Europe, and therefore Isaksson was attempting it for the first time. In the heats Isaksson ran a time of 25.81 seconds, while Snell was far behind with 29.2 seconds. Seagren however, with much more experience in the event, ran 0.8 seconds faster than the Swede, finishing in 24.64 seconds. His loss in the final to record holder [[Lynn Swann]] was irrelevant; the seven points for second place made him the first World Superstars Champion, and won him $37,000 in the process.

With the Superstars franchise nearing its zenith of popularity, the World Championship returned in 1978 with a 12-man field consisting of the national champions from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the top three finishers from the 1977 European Superstars final, and the top five from the 1978 US National Championship.  Completing the line-up was the returning champion, Bob Seagren.

Though the 1977 runner-up Kjell Isaksson was missing (he would not compete in Superstars again until 1980), Europe was strongly represented by [[Jean-Paul Coche]], [[Keith Fielding]] and [[Ties Kruize]], while [[Wayne Grimditch]], [[Greg Pruitt]] and [[Dwight Stones]] (who could famously jump up the 10-feet high obstacle course wall in one stride) represented the US.  It was the Canadian champion however, [[Brian Budd]], who would completely dominate the contest, and World Superstars for the next three years.

Budd was a strong all-round athlete, his soccer training covering swimming, running, bike racing and gym work.  He also understood that the key to winning Superstars was to win as many points as possible in the events you were good at, and to hold on for as many points as possible in the others.  He turned out to be nearly unbeatable in the gym, half-mile race and the swimming, and more than competent in cycling and rowing.  In 1978 he won 44 points from these five events alone, ten points more than he needed to become World Champion.

In the 100-yard dash, joint favourites Greg Pruitt and Keith Fielding were both unbeaten in the 100 yards/metres, and a fabulous race was in prospect. Budd got off to a blistering start – according to the UK commentator Ron Pickering it was 'a flyer'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxCUOB_m8Cs|title=The Superstars - 1978 World Final - 100 Yards|work=YouTube|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and led in the first 30 yards, but Pruitt, then Fielding accelerated, and the two had a large lead over the rest of the field. As they approached the finish line, Fielding pulled onto Pruitt's shoulder, then leaned as the two crossed the line together.  Without photo-finish equipment the result had to be called from hand-timing only. Fielding was given a time of 9.97 seconds; Pruitt had officially run 9.96. Fielding believed he had won, as did the BBC commentators covering the final. Fielding's challenge was teetering, and in the half-mile run the searing Caribbean heat and a crazy pace he had attempted to catch up with Budd cost him physically; he collapsed of heat exhaustion and had to receive first aid and oxygen from [[Ron Pickering]] at track-side.

Fielding eventually battled on bravely to finish fifth (and top European), but it was Bob Seagren who again gave the strongest challenge.  His consistent performances won him a clear second place, but he was still 14 points behind Budd.  The Canadian had joked and fooled his way through the contest, but it was all a very good act.  He was far and away the best multi-disciplined athlete in the field, and he would prove just as unbeatable in the following two years.

The third World Championship was held in March 1979, again in the sweltering heat of [[Freeport, Bahamas]].  Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion.  The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors: UK runner-ups [[Lynn Davies]] and [[Dave Boy Green]] and Irish Superstars champion [[Pat Spillane]].  The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with [[Ties Kruize]] and [[Brian Jacks]] joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury.  If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, [[Wayne Grimditch]], [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]] and [[Joe Theismann]] all qualifying.  Completing the line-up were two invited challengers – not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though.  Instead the organisers had asked both [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and [[Rafael Septién]] to 'make up the numbers', even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success.  They did however represent [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]] respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in [[Latin America]].  They would have little impact on the final.

That was not the case for Budd, who dominated again, winning three events comprehensively, setting new records in the swimming and half-mile run in the process.  He also finished third in every other event he competed in, winning the title by thirteen points this time.  While Grimditch and Pruitt won multiple events, they could not match Budd's consistency.  Neither could the best European, Lynn Davies, who finished second in four events but disappointed in the weightlifting and gym tests.  In the end only two points separated second to fourth, with Grimditch beating Pruitt for second on count-back, and Davies two points back in fourth.

Budd had set new standards, and most viewers thought him unbeatable.  There was only one caveat to this victory.  The top Europeans Kruize and Jacks were not present, and with Jacks in particular even more dominant in the gym tests than Budd there were questions asked about what he could have achieved.  They would meet a year later.

==Music==
For the British, European and International version of the show, and in all episodes broadcast in the UK (regardless of where the episode originated) the theme music is "[[Heavy Action]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/06/johnny-pearson-obituary|title=Johnny Pearson obituary|author=Dave Laing|work=the Guardian|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Johnny Pearson]].  The strong association of the theme music to Superstars has led to the music being frequently misidentified as "Superstars",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/johnny-pearson-composer-pianist-and-arranger-who-worked-on-lsquotop-of-the-popsrsquo-during-three-decades-2249980.html|title=Johnny Pearson: Composer, pianist and arranger who worked on &amp;lsquo;Top of the Pops&amp;rsquo; during three decades - Obituaries - News - The Independent|work=The Independent|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it is used in other countries as the theme to other sports events (such as in the United States, where versions of the piece have served as the long-time theme music of the [[NFL]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcasts on ABC and later [[ESPN]]).

While not necessarily written specifically for the UK version of Superstars (with Heavy Action instead being written by Pearson for the BBC music library in 1970 while he was working on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''), the music has now become synonymous with both Superstars in the UK, and indeed sport in general, still regularly used by the BBC on sports shows, such as during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

The ABC version in the 1970s and 1980s also used an instrumental version of ''[[Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Superstar]]'' from ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' as its theme.

All variations center on the theme of [[Judaism|Jewish]] children feeling alienated during the [[Christmas]] season, and Sandler's listing of Jewish celebrities (both real and fictional) as a way of sympathizing with their situation.

*All of [[The Three Stooges]] (brothers [[Moe Howard|Moe]], [[Shemp Howard|Shemp]] and [[Curly Howard]]; [[Larry Fine]]; and [[Joe Besser]]) 
*[[Tom Cruise]], a [[Church of Scientology|Scientologist]], is mentioned in the song as not Jewish (Sandler jokes during the song that he “hear(s) his [[Talent agent|agent]] is” Jewish).

Sandler also makes reference to the [[Carnegie Deli]], a famed Jewish restaurant in New York City (it closed in 2016), and mentions that "you don't need" two [[Christmas music|holiday songs]] that do not mention Christmas: "[[Deck the Halls]]," a celebration of the Pagan holiday of [[Yule]]; and "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]," a [[rockabilly]] winter song.

During the final verse, performed originally on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and on a [[Radio edit|radio cut]], Sandler sings the line "Drink your [[Gin and tonic|gin and tonic-ah]], but don't smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuan-icah]]". On the uncut album version, and during various concert appearances, the line was changed to "Drink your [[Gin and tonic|gin and tonic-ah]], and smoke your [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuan-icah]]". The uncut version, despite the reference to marijuana, receives most radio airplay today; another radio edit skips completely over the gin and tonic/marijuana line altogether.

==Part III (2002)==
Included on the ''[[Eight Crazy Nights]]'' soundtrack featuring vocals from actor [[Rob Schneider]] and the children's choir The Drei-Dels.

Persons referenced in "The Chanukah Song, Part III":
*[[Ross Geller|Ross]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) and [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] ([[Lisa Kudrow]]) from ''[[Friends]]''
*[[David Lander]] (Squiggy) of ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]''
*[[Debra Messing]]
*[[Melissa Gilbert]] (was adopted by a Jewish mother and raised in her faith)
*[[Michael Landon]] (Landon, whose father was Jewish, grew up practicing Conservative Judaism and is buried in a Jewish cemetery.)
*[[Jerry Lewis]]
*[[Ben Stiller]] (Stiller's dad [[Jerry Stiller]] is Jewish, and mom [[Anne Meara]], who was of [[Irish Catholic]] background, converted to [[Judaism]]).
*[[Jack Black]] (dad converted to Judaism, mom was born Jewish.)
*[[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] ("converted to Judaism, but you guys can have him back!")

*[[Lou Reed]]
*[[Perry Farrell]]
*[[Beck]] (maternal great-grandmother was Jewish)
*[[Paula Abdul]]
*[[Joey Ramone]]
*[[Natalie Portman]] (as "Natalie Portmanika")

Also, in an unedited version that Sandler sings at some of his comedy shows, he replaces the lyric "As for half-Jewish actors/[[Sean Penn]] is quite the great one/And [[Marlon Brando]]'s not a Jew at all/But it looks to me like he ate one" with "Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish/But a full-time [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winner/Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish, too/And I'd like to put some more in her". While this version is not played on [[radio stations]], the [[music video]] shows a background screen showing a picture of Sandler licking his lips as the Jennifer Connelly lyric is sung, with shocked laughter coming from the audience. This version is hidden about four minutes after the edited version on the ''Eight Crazy Nights'' soundtrack.

Although Sandler does not actually mention Schneider by name as part of the song, he mentions [[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo|Deuce Bigalow]], a character played by Schneider, in the lyric, "but we can do it all night long, with [[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo|Deuce Bigalow]]" (the "you can do it" line is also a reference to Schneider's recurring "townie" character that originally appeared in ''[[The Waterboy]]''). As Sandler mentions Bigelow, Schneider walks on stage, yells, "I'm Jewish!", and joins in for an abbreviated chorus. After the chorus, he sings a Jewish reference for the song (Mickey Raphael, see above), using an Elvis-esque vocal tic, to which Sandler seemingly ad libs "tiny Elvis, ladies and gentlemen, tiny Elvis!" (a reference to a Saturday Night Live skit Schneider performed with [[Nicolas Cage]]; and possibly also to [[Elvis Presley]], who was halakhically Jewish on account of his maternal great-great-grandmother&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Adam (August 16, 2012). [http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/109613 "Elvis Presley: Jewish King of Rock"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054632/http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/109613 |date=2013-12-03 }}. ''[[Tablet Magazine|Tablet]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) In the rehearsal version, Sandler then gives an aside of, "Schneider, I did not even know you were Jewish," to which Schneider replies, "I'm a Filipino Jew, in fact, I've gotta run home and light the first pig!" In the aired version, Schneider states, "I'm a Filipino Jew." When Sandler muses, "Filipino Jew?" Schneider responds, "There are four of us." He then puts on a blonde wig and joins the "Drei-dels," the backing chorus of children, to whom he is already similarly dressed.

==Part IV (2015)==
Sandler first performed this version at a live Judd Apatow &amp; Friends event, part of the New York Comedy Festival, in November 2015. Lyrics can be found at the Huffington Post link [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-sandler-chanukah-hanukkah-song-part-4_56572747e4b079b2818a510d here].

==Covers and spoofs==
[[Jimmy Fallon]] impersonated [[Adam Sandler]] during a ''[[Celebrity Jeopardy! (Saturday Night Live)|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]'' sketch on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on October 24, 1998. In the sketch, Fallon, as Sandler, interrupts [[Will Ferrell]]'s [[Alex Trebek]] by playing guitar and singing (to the tune of the song's chorus and first few verses), "[[Robert De Niro]], [[Bela Lugosi]], [[Snuffleupagus]], and [[Parker Posey]]!" (Actually, De Niro, Lugosi and Posey were all raised [[Roman Catholic]]; [[Jerry Nelson]], the puppeteer who performed Snuffleupagus, was likewise not Jewish.)

In 2004, Jewish-Australian hardcore punk band [[Yidcore]] covered it as "The Punk Rock Chanukah Song" in which they list Jews involved with punk music.

This song was covered on two different occasions for the Broadway charity albums "Carols for a Cure." In 2006, the cast of Broadway's ''[[The Wedding Singer (musical)|The Wedding Singer]]'' sang the first installment of the song, led by [[Constantine Maroulis]], and featuring help from violinist [[Alicia Svigals]]. In 2013, the song was covered once again by the cast of ''[[Soul Doctor]]'', however this time, the lyrics covered Jewish Broadway personalities, including [[Mandy Patinkin]], [[Andrew Lippa]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Harold Prince]] and others. These lyrics were written by the show's Shlomo actor Eric Anderson, who himself has been pointed out in the song as "not a Jew."

In the season 3 ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]'' episode "[[Diwali (The Office)|Diwali]]", Michael Scott ([[Steve Carell]]) parodies Sandler by performing "The Diwali Song" during a Hindu [[Diwali]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr25k3Dy7EU|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Unitarian-Universalist]] Evan Austin performed a parody of this song called "[[The Chalica Song]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5zoFZ0rNSE The Chalica Song], Youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt; about the Unitarian-Universalist holiday of [[Chalica]]. Austin lists celebrities and historical persons who are "Unitarian-Universalists. Or Unitarians. Or Universalists. Or people with similar ideas." In 2009, Austin recorded "[[The (Second) Chalica Song]]" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb8FFCa6b4I The (Second) Chalica Song], Youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt; with the same tune, but a new list of names.

In 2009, a cover of the song by [[Neil Diamond]] was released on ''[[A Cherry Cherry Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spinner.com/2009/09/29/neil-diamond-covers-adam-sandlers-chanukah-song/ Neil Diamond Covers Adam Sandler's 'Chanukah Song'], Steve Baltin, [[Spinner.com]], September 29th 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This version featured several changes in lyrics, including the change from "Tom Cruise isn't but I heard his agent is" to "Tom Cruise isn't, but [[Jesus Christ]] is".

On a 2014 episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', Sandler appears in a sketch on how to spell "Chanukah", singing a brief snippet of the song describing how [[Angelina Jolie]] is not a Jew.

==Plot==
''The Delta'' tells the story of 18-year-old Lincoln Bloom ([[Shayne Gray]]), who, after leading a relatively straight teenage life, is slowly drawn into the [[LGBT]] world and discovers he is [[Homosexual|gay]]. After visiting various shady establishments (including gay bars, video arcades, etc.) and engaging in sexual acts with "men he didn't know," Lincoln meets Minh Nguyen ([[Thang Chan]]), a Vietnamese immigrant, and travels down river with him in a cabin cruiser. In a doomed relationship, the two bond with each other, Lincoln neglecting to tell his girlfriend and leading two parallel lives. At the end of the film, Minh and Lincoln take a boat out on the [[Mississippi River]] to set off fireworks and this is where the film dramatically concludes.

'''''The X-Files''''' is an American [[science fiction]]–[[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[media franchise]] created by [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]. The franchise generally focused on [[paranormal]] or unexplained happenings. The first franchise release—simply titled ''[[The X-Files]]''—debuted in September 1993 and ended in May 2002. The show was a hit for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and its characters and slogans (e.g., "The Truth Is Out There", "Trust No One", "I Want to Believe") became [[pop culture]] touchstones in the 1990s. 1996 saw the premiere of a second series set in the same universe but covering a storyline independent of the [[Mythology of The X-Files|X-Files mythology]], titled ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]''. In 1998, the first ''X-Files'' [[feature film]] titled ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'' was released, eventually grossing over $180 million. A spin-off—''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]''—was released in 2001 and abruptly canceled. Six years after the initial television series was canceled, another film—''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]''—was released. In January 2016, a [[The X-Files (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''The X-Files'' aired, featuring Carter as executive producer and writer, and starring [[David Duchovny]] and [[Gillian Anderson]].&lt;ref name="revival"&gt;{{cite web |title=‘The X-Files’ Returns As Fox Event Series With Creator Chris Carter And Stars David Duchovny &amp; Gillian Anderson |url=http://deadline.com/2015/03/x-files-returns-fox-event-series-david-duchovny-gillian-anderson-chris-carter-1201397721/ |publisher=Deadline.com |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=March 24, 2015 |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh season]] premiered in January 2018.

In addition to film and television, ''The X-Files'' franchise has expanded into other media, including [[The X-Files literature|books]], [[video game]]s, and [[The X-Files (comics)|comic books]]. These supplements to the film and television series have resulted in significant development of the show's fictional universe and mythology. By May 2002, the franchise generated {{US$|1 billion|long=no}} in total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland|first=Melanie|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85995347.html|title=Moody, mysterious `X-Files' gave us memorable moments.(The Seattle Times)|subscription=yes|publisher=[[Knight Ridder]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=May 17, 2002|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The X-Files]]'', starring [[David Duchovny]] and [[Gillian Anderson]], first aired on September 10, 1993. Originally following the work of Special Agent [[Fox Mulder]], an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigator assigned to the [[X-files unit|X-Files]], a division tasked with the solving of cases for which there are no explanation. Special Agent [[Dana Scully]], a shrewd medical doctor, is assigned to debunk Mulder's work, though as the two continue to investigate the unexplained and the paranormal, her own faith is also tested. Scully later works alongside both [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]). ''The X-Files'' is generally divided into two classes of episodes, the first, "monster-of-the-week", or stand-alone episodes, and the second, [[Mythology of The X-Files|X-Files mythology]], which follows a [[Conspiracy (crime)|government conspiracy]] to hide the truth about the existence of [[Colonist (The X-Files)|extraterrestrial life]]. The series also stars [[Mitch Pileggi]] as Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]], [[William B. Davis]] as [[The Smoking Man]] and [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as [[Well-Manicured Man]].

''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', aired from 1996 to 1999, stars [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[Frank Black (character)|Frank Black]], a skilled criminal psychologist who could predict the actions of [[murderer]]s and [[serial killer]]s. Investigating the [[Crime|horrific crimes]], Black eventually became a [[consultant]] for the [[Millennium Group]], which believed that the world as we know it would come to an end at the beginning of the new millennium; a job which eventually leads to the demise of his wife, [[List of Millennium characters#Catherine Black|Catherine]] ([[Megan Gallagher]]). In the [[Millennium (season 3)|third season]], Black turns on the group and rejoins the FBI as a [[special agent]], working alongside Special Agent [[Emma Hollis]] ([[Klea Scott]]) to solve brutal crimes within the FBI's jurisdiction.

''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'', the third series in the ''X-Files'' franchise, follows the established characters of [[The Lone Gunmen#Richard Langly|Richard Langly]], [[The Lone Gunmen#Melvin Frohike|Melvin Frohike]] and [[The Lone Gunmen#John Fitzgerald Byers|John Fitzgerald Byers]] ([[Bruce Harwood]], [[Tom Braidwood]], and [[Dean Haglund]]), in their attempts to compile conspiracy-theorist magazine. Far more light-hearted than its predecessors, this series also stars [[Stephen Snedden]] as [[Jimmy Bond]], and [[Zuleikha Robinson]] as Yves Harlow.

''The X-Files'' has crossed over with both ''Millennium'' and ''The Lone Gunmen'', as well as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (in the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season 8]] episode "[[The Springfield Files]]").

==Feature films==
The first feature film, ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', was released in 1998 in between the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth]] and [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]]. It was intended to be a continuation of the season five finale "[[The End (The X-Files)|The End]]", but also be able to stand on its own. Season six opener "[[The Beginning (The X-Files)|The Beginning]]" picked up where the film left off. The majority of the film was shot in the break between the series' fourth and fifth seasons.&lt;ref name="fightthefuture"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] and [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Bowman, Rob]] |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for The X-Files: Fight the Future |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows the actions of [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) after their dismissal from the [[X-files unit|X-Files]] division.

Unlike the first film, the plot of ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'' does not focus on the series' ongoing extraterrestrial-based "[[The X-Files#Mytharc episodes|mytharc]]" and instead works as a standalone [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]–[[horror fiction|horror]] story. The film details ex-agents Mulder and Scully's search for a missing [[FBI agent]]. While [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) makes a notable appearance, [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) are absent from the film. During a July 2013 panel discussion at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] hosted by ''TV Guide'', both Anderson and Duchovny expressed willingness to do a third feature film, but Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, "You need a reason to get excited about going on and doing it again."&lt;ref name=TVGuide20thAnniversary&gt;{{cite news|title=A Very Special ''X-Files'' Reunion|newspaper=[[TV Guide]]|author=Keck, William|date=July 29, 2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zielony Balonik''' (literally, ''the Green Balloon'') was a popular [[literary]] [[cabaret]] founded in [[Kraków]] by the local poets, writers and artists during the final years of the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] of [[Poland]]. The venue was a gourmet restaurant of Apolinary J. Michalik called the ''Michalik's Den'' ([[Jama Michalika]]). The cabaret was founded in 1905 and ran regularly until 1912 (staged occasionally until 1915).&lt;ref name="PWN"&gt;[http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/4001441/zielony-balonik.html  Zielony Balonik.] ''[[Wielka Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN|PWN]] Encyclopedia.''

[[Onet.pl]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The grand opening of the ''Green Balloon'' cabaret took place on October 7, 1905 in a {{nowrap|restaurant-bakery}} located in the heart of [[Kraków Old Town]], not far from the [[History of Poland in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[St. Florian's Gate]]. It was an ''art cabaret'', meant only for the cultural elite. The organizers made sure that the guests show enthusiasm; those who didn't, were no longer invited. As a result the audience consisted of a closed group of regulars, whose composition didn't change. Soon, rumors began to spread among the local [[bourgeoisie]] that the ''Green Balloon'' stage was a place of ''orgies, nude dancing and all manner of dissipation''.&lt;ref name="Segel"&gt;[[Harold B. Segel]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=tw36Yi7vrOAC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22orgies,+nude+dancing+and+all+manner+of+dissipation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2pOlTue8CqWPigKx7KA3&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22orgies%2C%20nude%20dancing%20and%20all%20manner%20of%20dissipation%22&amp;f=false  ''Turn-of-the-century cabaret: Paris, Barcelona, Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Cracow, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Zurich.''] Page 233. ''[[Columbia University Press]]'', 1987. {{ISBN|0-231-05128-X}}. ''Google Books preview.'' Retrieved October 20, 2011. The full title of poem by Boy-Żeleński, written in response to rumors, read: "Co mówili w Kościele u Kapucynów. Pieśń dziadkowa." However, the translation of title is not unequivocal, because in Polish, the words: "dziad" and "dziadek" have different meanings. The former referres to a poor beggar, but the latter, more to an old grandpa.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński|Boy-Żeleński]] responded on behalf of ''Zielony Balonik'' by writing a bawdy, humorous poem "Pieśń dziadkowa" (Grandpas Song)&lt;ref name="Pieśń"&gt;Full text of [http://www.binek.pl/boy/b1.html  "Pieśń dziadkowa"] by [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]] in [[Polish language|Polish]].

Retrieved October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; confirming that indeed, it is a [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], synonymous with impenitent sin.&lt;ref name="Segel" /&gt; However, the elitist treatment carried with it a major drawback. Gradually the ground breaking stage performances became depleted of fresh new topics and captivating lyrics for the songs, and the intervention of preventive censorship in the cabaret's [[Play (theatre)|scripted dialogues]] by Austrian authorities resulted in further avoidance of any pressing political issues stemming from the foreign occupation of the country.

Over time even the regulars began to miss Balonik's earlier ''green humor''. One additional reason for its slow but relentless disintegration was that the living conditions of contributing artists began to deteriorate under the repressive [[Austrian partition|Austrian rule]]. The patrons turned reluctant to dig further into the mine field of [[political satire]] concerned with the suppression of freedoms. It was one of the main distinguishing features of ''Zielony Balonik'' from the French and German cabarets of the time.&lt;ref name="APZ"&gt;[http://www.apz.org.pl/pokaz/op_14  The Little Green Balloon (Zielony Balonik).] ''Akademia Pełni Życia,'' Kraków. {{En icon}} {{Pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;[http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,78,1326.php  Zielony Balonik.] 2011 ''Instytut Książki'', Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contributors included two [[Master of Ceremonies|Masters of Ceremonies]]: [[Jan August Kisielewski]], and Stanisław Sierosławski; the slew of writers such as: Witold Noskowski, Tadeusz Zakrzewski, [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]] (from 1906), Adolf Nowaczyński, Edward Leszczyński, [[Leon Schiller]], and Juliusz Osterwa; as well as a group of visual artists in charge of set-design and exhibits, including: [[Witold Wojtkiewicz]], Kazimierz Sichulski, Karol Frycz, Henryk Szczygliński, [[Alfons Karpiński]], Stanisław Kamocki, [[Stanisław Kuczborski (painter)|Stanisław Kuczborski]], [[Stefan Filipkiewicz]], Henryk Uziembło, Fryderyk Pautsch, married couple [[Tadeusz Rychter]] and his wife [[Bronisława Janowska]] who designed political [[puppet]]s (1868–1953), Ludwik Puget and Ignacy Blaschke.&lt;ref name="APZ" /&gt;
