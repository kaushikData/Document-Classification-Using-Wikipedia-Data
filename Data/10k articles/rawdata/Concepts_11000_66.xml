The '''affect heuristic''' is a  [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristic]], a mental shortcut that allows people to make decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently, in which current [[emotion]]—[[fear]], [[pleasure]], [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], etc.—influences decisions. In other words, it is a type of heuristic in which emotional response, or "[[Affect (psychology)|affect]]" in psychological terms, plays a lead role.  It is a subconscious process that shortens the decision-making process and allows people to function without having to complete an extensive search for information. It is shorter in duration than a [[Emotional mood|mood]], occurring rapidly and involuntarily in response to a [[Stimulation|stimulus]]. Reading the words "lung cancer" usually generates an affect of [[dread (fear)|dread]], while reading the words "mother's love" usually generates a feeling of [[affection]] and comfort.  The affect heuristic is typically used while judging the risks and benefits of something, depending on the positive or negative feelings that people associate with a stimulus. It is the equivalent of "going with your gut". If their feelings towards an activity are positive, then people are more likely to judge the risks as low and the benefits high. On the other hand, if their feelings towards an activity are negative, they are more likely to perceive the risks as high and benefits low.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finucane|first=M.L.|author2=Alhakami, A.|author3=Slovic, P.|author4=Johnson, S.M.|title=The Affect Heuristic in Judgment of Risks and Benefits|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=January 2000|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(200001/03)13:1&lt;1::AID-BDM333&gt;3.0.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The [[theory]] of affect heuristic is that a human being's affect can influence how he or she makes decisions. Research has shown that risk and benefits are negatively correlated in people's minds. This was found after researchers found that the inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity was linked to the strength of positive or negative affect associated with the activity as measured by rating the activity on bipolar scales (e.g. good/bad). This implies that people base their judgements of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it, but also on how they feel about it.  The affect heuristic gained early attention in 1980 when Robert B. Zajonc argued that affective reactions to stimuli are often the first reaction which occur automatically and subsequently influencing the way in which we process and judge information.&lt;ref name=zajoncarticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=R. B.|title=Feeling and thinking: Preferences need no inferences|journal=American Psychologist|date=February 1980|volume=35|issue=2|pages=151–175|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.35.2.151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affect heuristic received more recent attention when it was used to explain the unexpected negative correlation between benefit and [[risk perception]]. Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson theorized in 2000 that a good feeling towards a situation (i.e., positive affect) would lead to a lower risk perception and a higher benefit perception, even when this is logically not warranted for that situation.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle/&gt; This implies that a strong emotional response to a word or other stimulus might alter a person's [[judgment]]. He or she might make different decisions based on the same set of facts and might thus make an [[illogical]] decision. Overall, the affect heuristic is of influence in nearly every decision-making arena.

===Theoretical accounts of affect===
An alternative thought to the “gut feeling” response is [[Antonio Damasio]]'s [[somatic marker hypothesis]]. It is the opinion that thought is made largely from images which include perceptual and symbolic representations. These images then become “marked” by positive or negative feelings linked directly or indirectly to somatic states. When a negative somatic marker is linked to an image of a future outcome, it sounds an alarm in the brain. When a positive marker is linked to an image, it becomes a signal of incentive. He hypothesized that somatic markers increase the accuracy of the decision process and the absence of these markers, mostly seen in people with certain types of brain damage, degrades the ability to make good decisions. This hypothesis arose when observing patients with damage to their prefrontal cortex who had severe impairments in personal and social decision-making despite their other abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damasio|first=A.R.|title=The Somatic Marker Hypothesis and the Possible Functions of the Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=October 1996|volume=351|issue=1346|pages=1413–1420|doi=10.1098/rstb.1996.0125|pmid=8941953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought and feeling==
It has been argued by researchers that people use affect heuristics as a first response to an issue, they rely on spontaneous affective reactions which make it more efficient than having to research and analyze external information. Slovic, Finucane, Peters and MacGregor (2005) contrast two modes of thinking: the analytic system and the experiential system.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle/&gt;&lt;ref name=macgregorarticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slovic|first=P|author2=Finucane, M.|author3=Peters, E.|author4=MacGregor, D.|title=Risk as Analysis and Risk as Feelings: Some Thoughts about Affect, Reason, Risk, and Rationality|journal=Risk Analysis|volume=24|issue=2|pages=311–322|date=13 April 2004|doi=10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00433.x|pmid=15078302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analytic system, also referred to as the rational system, is thought that is considered to be slow and requires effort; it requires consciousness, probabilities, logical reasoning, and substantial evidence. The experiential system is the exact opposite. It is intuitive and mostly automatic which makes it more convenient for people because it does not require effort or consciousness. It relies on images, metaphors, and narratives which are then used to estimate the probability of a hazard.&lt;ref name=kellerarticle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Carmen|author2=Siegrist, Michael|author3=Gutscher, Heinz|title=The Role of Affect and Availability Heuristics in Risk Analysis|journal=Risk Analysis|date=June 2006|volume=26|issue=3|pages=631–639|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00773.x|pmid=16834623}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the experience of affect, in other words, a “gut feeling.” Affective reactions that accompany judgements are not necessarily voluntary, but are automatic responses. Zajonc states that “one might be able to control the expression of emotion, but not the experience of it itself.”  However, he also clarifies that feelings are not free of thought and that thoughts are not free of feeling.&lt;ref name=zajoncarticle/&gt; The experiential system also takes past experiences into account. In other words, if a person has already experienced a certain issue, he or she is more likely to take more precautions towards the issue.

==Experimental findings==
Many studies have been done to further look into affect heuristics and many have found that these heuristics shape our attitudes and opinions towards our decisions, especially risk perception. These studies demonstrate how affect is an important characteristic of the decision-making process in many different domains and aspects as well as how it can lead to a strong conditioner of preference. As demonstrated below, affect is independent of cognition which indicate that there are conditions where affect does not require cognition.

===Subliminal affective response===
The cause of affect does not necessarily have to be consciously perceived. A study conducted by Winkielman, Zajonc and Schwarz (1997) demonstrated the speed at which an affective reaction can influence judgements. To do this they used a subliminal priming paradigm where participants were "primed" through exposure to either a smiling face, a frowning face, or a neutral polygon presented at about {{frac|1|250}}  of a second. This was considered an amount of time where the nature of the stimuli could not be recalled. Participants were then exposed to an ideograph (e.g. a Chinese character) for two seconds and asked to rate the ideograph on a scale of liking. Researchers found that participants preferred the ideograph preceded with a smiling face as opposed to those preceded by a frowning face or neutral polygon despite the fact that the smiling face was only shown for {{frac|1|250}} of a second.

The same experiment demonstrated the persistence of initial affect. During a second session, participations were primed with the same characters, but these characters were preceded by a different face that they were not previously exposed to (e.g. those previously exposed to the smiling face were now exposed to the neutral polygon). Participants continued to show preference for the characters based on the first association, even though the second exposure was preceded by a different affective stimulus.  In other words, the second priming was ineffective because the effects of the first priming still remained. If the participant liked a character following exposure to a smiling face, they would continue to like the character even when it was preceded by a frowning face during the second exposure. (The experimental outcome was statistically significant and adjusted for variables such as non-affective preference for certain characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkielman|first=P|author2=Zajonc, R.B.|author3=Schwarz, N.|title=Subliminal affective priming effects resists attributional interventions|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=1997|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–465|doi=10.1080/026999397379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insensitivity to numbers===
Sometimes affective responses to certain stimuli are a result of a lack of sensitivity to other factors, for example, numbers. Slovic and Peters (2006) did a study on psychophysical numbing, the inability to discriminate change in a physical stimulus as the magnitude of the stimulus increases, and found that students more strongly supported an airport-safety measure that was expected to save a  high percentage of 150 lives at risk as opposed to a measure that was expected to save 150 lives. This is thought to have occurred because although saving 150 lives is good, it is somewhat harder to comprehend and thus the decision comes from the positive feeling associated with the higher percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slovic|first=P|author2=Peters, E.|title=Risk Perception and Affect|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=322–325|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00461.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of time===
Research has been conducted in the influence that time plays in decision-making. In two experiments, Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson (2000) studied the affect heuristic under time pressure and the influence that providing risk and benefit information has on the affect heuristic. The researchers compared individuals under no time pressure and those with time pressure. They predicted that individuals under time pressure would rely more heavily on their affect in order to be more efficient in their responses whereas those under no time pressure would use more logic in their decision-making. To do this, university students were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (time pressure or no time pressure) and one of the two counterbalancing orders (risk judgements followed by benefit judgements or vice versa). They were then given a task in which they had to make judgements about the risk or benefit of certain activities and technologies. As predicted, individuals in the time-pressure condition took less time to make risk judgements than did individuals in the no time pressure condition. In the second experiment, students again had to make judgements about certain activities, but this time were given additional information about the risk and benefits. Information was framed as being high risk, low risk, high benefit or low benefit. The researchers found that this additional information did in fact influence their judgements.&lt;ref name=finucanearticle/&gt;

Two similar studies were conducted by Wilson and Arvai in 2006, in which they also looked at the affect heuristic affects high and low risk options.{{clarify|date=June 2012|reason=This is not a real sentence in English.}} These experiments examine the affect heuristic and the “evaluability hypothesis”, the joint evaluation when options are evaluated in a side-by-side comparison and separate evaluation where options are evaluated on their own. They take this concept and discuss how it relates to the affect heuristic by specifically looking at making traits of an option more or less meaningful in terms of the context of choice, more specifically, affect. To examine this relationship more closely, they conducted two experiments where participants received quantitative information about the nature of risks and were placed in one of two groups: ''affect-poor'' combined with high risks and ''affect-rich'' combined with low risks. In their first study, they looked how the influence of affect on evaluability in joint evaluations as compared to separate evaluations. To this, participants were asked to make choices about the ''affect-rich'' problem of crime and the ''affect-poor'' problem of deer overpopulation. Participants were asked to rate how they perceived crime and deer overpopulation by rating  on a scale from "very good" to "very bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Robyn S.|author2=Arvai, Joseph L.|title=When Less Is More: How Affect Influences Preferences When Comparing Low and High-risk Options|journal=Journal of Risk Research|date=March 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=165–178|doi=10.1080/13669870500419503}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that participants ignored the quantitative information and focused on the affect characteristics.

===Fear appeals===
Health campaigns often use “fear appeals” to grab the attention of their audience.  Fear appeals are a type of advertising that specifically uses methods of creating anxiety in the consumer which results in the consumer wanting to cure this fear by purchasing the product. In a study by Averbeck, Jones, and Robertson (2011), researchers look at how prior knowledge influences one's response to fear appeals. Surveys were distributed which manipulated prior knowledge as low or high and two different topics: sleep deprivation or spinal meningitis. Various scale were used to test how prior knowledge affects certain health-related issues. Researchers found that individuals who had prior knowledge in a certain subject exhibited less fear and were least likely to fall prey to the affect heuristic as opposed to individuals that did not have prior knowledge who exhibited more fear and were more likely to fall prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Averbeck|first=J|author2=Jones, A.|author3=Robertson, K.|title=Prior Knowledge and Health Messages: An Examination of Affect as Heuristics and Information as Systematic Processing for Fear Appeals|journal=Southern Communication Journal|year=2011|volume=76|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/10417940902951824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
Research has shown that Americans are aware of climate change, but do not consider it to be a serious problem due to the lack of an affective response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=A.|author2=Morgan, M. G.|author3=Fischhoff, B.|author4=Read, D.|title=What Do People Know About Global Climate Change?|journal=Risk Analysis|year=1994|volume=14|issue=6|pages=959–970|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1994.tb00065.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people report as not having experienced the consequences of climate change or that it is a long-term consequence that will not happen in the near future. Therefore, it is considered to be of lower priority and not much is done as a solution to global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kempton, W. |author2=Boster, J. S. |author3=Hartley, J. A. |title=Environmental Values in American Culture|year=1995|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-262-61123-7|pages=1–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk communication===
Research on the affect heuristic had its origin in risk perception. Communicating risk is meant to improve the correspondence between the magnitude of the risk of an issue and the magnitude to which people respond to that risk. Affect, specifically negative affect, is an important method for increasing perceived risk considering its influences on perceived risk and thus has been utilized as essential for communicating risk to the public.

Raising risk awareness is thought to be increased when risk information is presented in the form of frequences (e.g. “Within 40 years there is a 33% probability of flood”) or probabilities (e.g. “Each year there is a 1% probability of flood). This method is thought to evoke an affective response which then increases the availability of risk which results in greater perceived risk.&lt;ref name=kellerarticle/&gt; This demonstrates how the way in which information is presented influences the way in which people interpret the information, more specifically, potential risks. Research also shows that people's financial risk taking is affected by their emotional state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(83)90120-4|title=The effect of positive feelings on risk taking: When the chips are down|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|volume=31|issue=2|pages=194–202|year=1983|last1=Isen|first1=Alice M.|last2=Patrick|first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 12781345 |year= 2003 |author1= Yuen |first1= K. S. |title= Could mood state affect risk-taking decisions? |journal= Journal of Affective Disorders |volume= 75 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–18 |last2= Lee |first2= T. M. |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00022-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cancer====
Researchers have looked at the affective and experiential modes of thinking in terms of cancer prevention. Research has shown that affect plays a significant role in whether people choose to get screened for certain types of cancer. Current research is now looking into how to communicate the risks and benefits of cancer prevention and treatment options. So far research has shown that the way in which information is framed does play a role in the way in which the information is interpreted. Research has also shown that treatment options may not have significant meaning to patients unless it has an affective connection. It is for this reason that researchers are looking into using affective coding such as icon arrays to make numerical information easier to understand and process.&lt;ref name=kellerarticle/&gt;

===Smiling===
Research has been done on how smiling can cause affective responses and thus influence our opinions of others. An experiment by LaFrance and Hecht (1995) investigated  whether a smiling target would elicit more leniency than those that do not. Participants judged a case of potential academic misconduct and were asked to rate a list of subjects. Materials included photos of a female target either showing a neutral expression, felt smile, false smile, or miserable smile. Researchers found that the student pictured as smiling received less punishment than did the student who did not smile despite the fact that the smiling student was not seen as less guilty. They did not find a significant difference between the different smiles. Smiling students were also rated as more trustworthy, honest, genuine, good, obedient, sincere, and admirable compared to the student that did not smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaFrance|first=M.|author2=Hecht, M.A.|title=Why Smiles Generate Leniency|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=March 1995|volume=21|issue=3|pages=207–214|doi=10.1177/0146167295213002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory load===
Researchers have studied how one's memory load increases one's chances of using the affect heuristic. In a study by Stiv and Fedorikhin (1999), participants were asked to either memorize a two-digit number (low cognitive demand) or a seven-digit number (high cognitive demand). Participants were then asked to enter another room where they would report their number. On the way there, they were asked for their preference for two snacks: chocolate cake (more favorable affect, less favorable cognition) or fruit salad (less favorable affect, more favorable cognition). Researchers predicted that participants given the seven-digits to remember (high cognitive load) would reduce their deliberation process due to having to remember a large amount of information. This would increase the chances of these participants choosing the cake over the fruit salad due to it being the more affectively favorable option. This hypothesis proved true with participants choosing the chocolate cake 63% of the time when given a high cognitive load and only 41% when given a low cognitive load. In the same study they also tested the impulsiveness of the participants in moderating the effects of processing-resources of choice and at the time they were asked for their preference for the two snacks high cognitive demand chose the chocolate cake 84.2%. This provides evidence that people's decisions  can be influenced by affect heuristic in a relatively spontaneous manner from the stimulus, with little involvement of higher-order cognitive demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shiv|first=B.|author2=Fedorikin, A.|title=Heart and Mind in Conflict: The Interplay of Affect and Cognition in Consumer Decision Making|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=December 1999|volume=26|issue=3|pages=278–292|doi=10.1086/209563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
Another common situation involving affect heuristic is where a strong, emotional first impression can inform a decision, even if subsequent evidence weight cognitively against the original decision made. In a study by Sherman, Kim and Zajonc (1998), they investigated how long the induced effects of an affective response could last. Participants were asked to study Chinese characters and their English meanings. Half of the meanings were positive (e.g. beauty) and the other half negative (e.g. disease). Participants were then tested on these meanings, which was followed by a task in which they were given pairs of characters and asked to choose which character they preferred. Researchers found that participants preferred the character with a positive meaning.

In the same experiment, participants were given a new task where the characters were presented with a neutral meaning (e.g. linen) and participants were told that these were the true meanings of the character. The testing procedure was the same and despite exposing participants with the new meanings, their preferences in characters remained the same. Characters that were paired with positive meanings continued to be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Affective Perseverance: The Resistance of Affect to Cognitive Invalidation|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=February 2002|volume=28|issue=2|pages=224–237|doi=10.1177/0146167202282008|last1=Sherman|first1=D. K.|last2=Kim|first2=H. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
While heuristics can be helpful in many situations, it can also lead to biases which can result in poor decision-making habits. Like other heuristics, it{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} can provide efficient and adaptive responses, but relying on affect can also cause decisions to be misleading.

===Smoking===
Studies have looked at how the affect influences smoking behavior. Smokers tend to act experientially in the sense that they give little conscious thought to the risks before they start. It is usually as a result of affective responses in the moment that occur when seeing others partake in the behavior. Epstein (1995) found that there has been quite a bit of manipulation of consumers when it comes to packaging and marketing products. This is especially the case with tobacco companies. Research has shown that cigarette advertisements were designed to increase the positive affect associated with smoking and decrease the perceptions of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=S|title=Integration of the cognitive and psychodynamic unconscious|journal=American Psychologist|date=August 1994|volume=49|issue=8|pages=709–724|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.49.8.709|pmid=8092614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10558427|ssrn=1286703|year=1999|author1=Hanson|first1=J. D.|title=Taking behavioralism seriously: Some evidence of market manipulation|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=112|issue=7|pages=1420–1572|last2=Kysar|first2=D. A.|doi=10.2307/1342413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, seeing this advertisement could lead people astray to start smoking because of its induced appeal. In a study by Slovic et al. (2005), he released a survey to smokers in which he asked “If you had it to do all over again, would you start smoking?” and more than 85% of adult smokers and about 80% of young smokers (between the ages of 14-22) answered “No.” He found that most smokers, especially those that start at a younger age, do not take the time and think about how their future selves will perceive the risks associated with smoking. Essentially, smokers give little conscious thought to smoking before they start and it is usually after they have started smoking and have become addicted that they learn new information about health risk.&lt;ref name=macgregorarticle/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2545">In mathematics and more precisely in [[functional analysis]], the '''Aluthge transformation''' is an operation defined on the set of [[bounded operators]] of a [[Hilbert space]]. It was introduced by [[Ariyadasa Aluthge]] to study [[P-hyponormal operators|p-hyponormal]] [[linear operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aluthge|first=Ariyadasa|date=1990|title=On p-hyponormal operators for 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1|url=|journal=Integral Equations Operator Theory|volume=13|pages=307–315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Let  &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Hilbert space]] and let  &lt;math&gt;B(H)&lt;/math&gt; be the algebra of linear operators from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[polar decomposition]] theorem, there exists an unique [[partial isometry]]  &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;T=U|T|&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\ker(U)\supset\ker(T)&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;|T|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Square root of a matrix|square root of the operator]]  &lt;math&gt; T^*T&lt;/math&gt;.  If  &lt;math&gt;T\in B(H)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; T=U|T|&lt;/math&gt; is its polar decomposition, the Aluthge transform of  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta(T)&lt;/math&gt; defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(T)=|T|^{\frac12}U|T|^{\frac12}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for any real number &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-Aluthge transformation is defined as 
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\lambda(T):=|T|^{\lambda}U|T|^{1-\lambda}\in B(H).&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
For vectors &lt;math&gt;x,y \in H&lt;/math&gt;, let  &lt;math&gt;x\otimes y&lt;/math&gt; denote the operator defined as 
: &lt;math&gt;\forall z\in H\quad x\otimes y(z)=\langle z,y\rangle x.&lt;/math&gt;

An elementary calculation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chabbabi |first1=Fadil |last2=Mbekhta |first2=Mostafa |title=Jordan product maps commuting with the λ-Aluthge transform |journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications |date=June 2017 |volume=450 |issue=1 |pages=293–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that if &lt;math&gt;y\ne0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\lambda(x\otimes y)=\Delta(x\otimes y)=\frac{\langle x,y\rangle}{\lVert y \rVert^2} y\otimes y.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Edvard Munch - The Scream - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Edvard Munch]] tried to represent "an infinite scream passing through nature" in ''[[The Scream]]'' (1893).]]

'''Angst''' means [[fear]] or [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] (''[[anguish]]'' is its [[Romance languages|Latinate]] [[cognate|equivalent]], and ''anxious,'' ''anxiety'' are of similar origin). The word ''angst'' was introduced into English from the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''angst'' and the [[German language|German]] word ''Angst''. It is attested since the 19th century in English translations of the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angst|title=Angst - Definition of Angst by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/angst|title=Angst - Define Angst at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=angst&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil.

In other languages, having the meaning of the Latin word ''pavor'' for "fear", the derived words differ in meaning; for example, as in the French ''anxiété'' and ''peur''. The word ''angst'' has existed since the 8th century, from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] ''*anghu-'', "restraint" from which [[Old High German]] ''angust'' developed.&lt;ref name=Collins &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/angst|title=Angst - definition of angst by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is pre-cognate with the Latin ''[[wikt:angustia#Latin|angustia]]'', "tensity, tightness" and ''[[wikt:angor#Latin|angor]]'', "choking, clogging"; compare to the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:ἄγχω|ἄγχω]] (''ankho'') "strangle".

== Existentialist angst ==
{{See also|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Dread or anxiety}}
In [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] [[philosophy]], the term ''angst'' carries a specific conceptual meaning. The use of the term was first attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813&amp;ndash;1855). In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (also known as ''The Concept of Dread'', depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word ''Angest'' (in common Danish, ''angst'', meaning "dread" or "anxiety") to describe a profound and deep-seated condition. Where non-human animals are guided solely by [[instinct]], said Kierkegaard, human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Marino|title=The Danish Doctor of Dread|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/the-danish-doctor-of-dread/|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date=March 17, 2012|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of one's life and one's power of choice over them.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Backhouse|first1=Stephen|title=Kierkegaard: A Single Life|date=2016|publisher=HarperCollins Christian Publishing|isbn=9780310520894|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=MLTxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176|accessdate=17 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist [[philosopher]]s who followed, such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. While Kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a [[religion|religious personal belief system]], later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and [[existential despair]].

== Music ==
Existential angst makes its appearance in classical [[musical composition]] in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. Notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] (operas ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''), [[Claude-Achille Debussy]] (opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelleas et Melisande]]'', ballet ''[[Jeux]]'', other works), [[Jean Sibelius]] (especially the Fourth Symphony), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] ''([[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', other works), [[Alban Berg]], [[Francis Poulenc]] (opera ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]''), [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', symphonies and chamber music), [[Béla Bartók]] (opera ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', other works), and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (especially ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'').
 
Angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over [[Cold War|international tensions]] and [[nuclear proliferation]]. [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s book ''[[Bomb Culture]]'' (1968) traced angst in popular culture to [[Hiroshima]]. Dread was expressed in works of [[folk rock]] such as [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Masters of War]]'' (1963) and ''[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]''. The term often makes an appearance in reference to [[punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[nu metal]], and works of [[emo]] where expressions of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[existential despair]], or [[nihilism]] predominate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6867">:''Not to be confused with the [[Born rule]], which relates to the probability of the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system.''

In physics, '''Born reciprocity''', also called '''reciprocal relativity''' or '''Born–Green reciprocity''', is a [[principle]] set up by theoretical physicist [[Max Born]] that calls for a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]]-[[symmetry]] among [[space]] and [[momentum]]. Born and his co-workers expanded his principle to a framework that is also known as '''reciprocity theory'''.&lt;ref name="born-1938"&gt;M. Born, A suggestion for unifying quantum theory and relativity, Proceedings of the Royal Society London A (1938), vol.&amp;nbsp;165, pp.&amp;nbsp;291–303, {{DOI|10.1098/rspa.1938.0060}} [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/165/921/291.full.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="born-1949"&gt;M. Born (1949), Reciprocity Theory of Elementary Particles, Review of Modern Physics vol.&amp;nbsp;21, no.&amp;nbsp;3, pp.&amp;nbsp;463–473 {{DOI|10.1103/RevModPhys.21.463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born noticed a symmetry among [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] and [[momentum space]] representations of a [[free particle]], in that its wave function description is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] to a change of variables ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''p'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x''. (It can also be worded such as to include [[scale factor]]s, e.g. invariance to ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''ap'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''bx'' where ''a'', ''b'' are constants.) Born hypothesized that such symmetry should apply to the [[four-vector]]s of [[special relativity]], that is, to the four-vector space coordinates
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} = X^{\mu} := \left(X^0, X^1, X^2, X^3 \right) = \left(ct, x, y, z \right) &lt;/math&gt;

and the four-vector momentum ([[four-momentum]]) coordinates
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P} = P^{\nu} := \left(P^0, P^1, P^2, P^3 \right) = \left(\frac{E}{c}, p_x, p_y, p_z \right) &lt;/math&gt;
Both in classical and in quantum mechanics, the Born reciprocity conjecture postulates that the transformation ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''p'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x'' leaves invariant the [[Hamilton equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i = \partial H / \partial p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_i = - \partial H / \partial x_i&lt;/math&gt;

From his reciprocity approach, Max Born conjectured the invariance of a space-time-momentum-energy [[line element]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Born, Reciprocity theory of elementary particles, Reviews of Modern Physics, vol.&amp;nbsp;21, no.&amp;nbsp;3 (1949), pp.&amp;nbsp;463–473 ([https://archive.is/20120711213744/http://rmp.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v21/i3/p463_1 abstract], [https://archive.is/20130223114859/http://rmp.aps.org/pdf/RMP/v21/i3/p463_1 full text])&lt;/ref&gt; Born and H.S. Green similarly introduced the notion an invariant (quantum) metric operator &lt;math&gt;x_k x^k + p_k p^k&lt;/math&gt; as extension of the [[Minkowski metric]] of special relativity to an invariant metric on [[phase space]] coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the introductory sections of: Jan Govaerts et al: World-line Quantisation of a Reciprocally Invariant System, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3736v1 arXiv:0706.3736v1] (submitted 26 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The metric is invariant under the group of [[quaplectic transformation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Morgan: [http://eprints.utas.edu.au/10689/ A Modern Approach to Born Reciprocity], PhD Thesis, University of Tasmania, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Govaerts, [[Peter D. Jarvis]], Stuart O. Morgan, Stephen G. Low, World-line quantization of a reciprocally invariant system, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, vol.&amp;nbsp;40 (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;12095–12111, {{DOI|10.1088/1751-8113/40/40/006}} ([http://eprints.utas.edu.au/4450/1/4450.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a reciprocity as called for by Born can be observed in much, but not all, of the formalism of classical and quantum physics. Born's reciprocity theory was not developed much further for reason of difficulties in the mathematical foundations of the theory.

However Born's idea of a quantum metric operator was later taken up by [[Hideki Yukawa]] when developing his nonlocal quantum theory in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Prugovečki]]: Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1984, {{ISBN|978-9027716170}}, ''Section 4.5 Reciprocity Theory and Born's Quantum Metric Operator'', pp.&amp;nbsp;199 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.

Caianiello]] proposed a "maximal acceleration", similarly as there is a [[Planck Length|minimal length at Planck scale]], and this concept of maximal acceleration has been expanded upon by others.&lt;ref&gt;Is there a maximal acceleration? Lettere al Nuovo Cimento, vol.&amp;nbsp;32, no.&amp;nbsp;3 (1981), pp.&amp;nbsp;65–70, {{DOI|10.1007/BF02745135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Castro: Maximal-acceleration phase space relativity from Clifford algebras, [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208138v2 arXiv:hep-th/0208138v2] (submitted 20 August 2002, version of 8 September 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that Born reciprocity may be the underlying physical reason for the [[T-duality]] symmetry in string theory,&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Castro (2008) [http://www.rxiv.org/pdf/0908.0094v1.pdf On Born's deformed reciprocal complex gravitational theory and noncommutative geometry]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Born reciprocity may be of relevance to developing a [[quantum geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Prugovečki]]: Principles of Quantum General Relativity, World Scientific Pub. Co., 1995, {{ISBN|978-9810221386}}, ''Section 3.8 Fundamental Special-Relativistic Quantum Lorentz Frames'', pp.&amp;nbsp;106–111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Amelino-Camelia, Laurent Friedel, Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman, [[Lee Smolin]]: Relative locality: A deepening of the relativity principle [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.0313.pdf arXiv 1106.0313], 1 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Born chose the term "reciprocity" for the reason that in a [[Crystal structure|crystal]] [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]], the motion of a particle can be described in ''p''-space by means of the [[reciprocal lattice]].&lt;ref name="born-1938"/&gt;

The term may also be used more broadly to refer to the duty to supervise subordinates, and liability for the failure to do so, both in [[government]], [[military law]], and with regard to [[corporation]]s and [[trusts]].

The doctrine of "command responsibility" was established by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], partly based on the American [[Lieber code]], a war manual for the Union forces signed by President Abraham Lincoln 1863, and was applied for the first time by the German Supreme Court at the [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials]] after [[World War I]], in the 1921 trial of [[Emil Müller (German officer)|Emil Müller]].&lt;ref name="Analysis"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.hlc.org.yu/english/War_Crimes_Trials_Before_National_Courts/Serbia/index.php?file=729.html |date=* |title=Command Responsibility: The Contemporary Law }} by Iavor Rangelov and Jovan Nicic, [[Humanitarian Law Center]], February 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bantekas"&gt;[http://www.torturers.net/analysis/bantekas.html The Contemporary Law of Superior Responsibility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223171950/http://www.torturers.net/analysis/bantekas.html |date=2006-02-23 }} by Ilias Bantekas [[American Journal of International Law]], No 3 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kai Ambos"&gt;[http://jicj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/mql045?ijkey=Wi1pSylVtrzfXqp&amp;keytype=ref Joint Criminal Enterprise and Command Responsibility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610231642/http://jicj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/mql045?ijkey=Wi1pSylVtrzfXqp&amp;keytype=ref |date=2007-06-10 }} by Kai Ambos, Professor of Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure, Comparative Law and International Criminal Law at the [[University of Göttingen]]; Judge at the State Court (Landgericht) [[Göttingen]], [[Journal of International Criminal Justice]], originally published online on January 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States of America confirmed and incorporated the mentioned 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on "command responsibility" into United States federal law through the precedent set by the [[United States Supreme Court]] (called the "Yamashita standard") in the case of Japanese General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]. He was prosecuted in 1945 for atrocities committed by troops under his command in the [[Philippines]], in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]]. Yamashita was charged with "unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes."&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"&gt;[http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v10n1/hendin101_text.html Command Responsibility and Superior Orders in the Twentieth Century - A Century of Evolution] by, Stuart E Hendin, [[Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Yamashita standard

Furthermore, the so-called "Medina standard" clarified the U.S. law to clearly also encompass U.S officers, so that those as well as foreign officers such as General Yamashita can be prosecuted in the United States. The "Medina standard" is based upon the 1971 prosecution of [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Ernest Medina]] in connection with the [[My Lai Massacre]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mylai/MYL_LAW3.HTM |title=Excerpt of the Prosecution Brief on the Law of Principals in ''United States v.

===Developing accountability===
[[Image:Deutsche Geschichte5-310.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hagenbach on trial, from [[Bern]]er Chronik des Diebold Schilling dem Älteren]]

In ''[[The Art of War]]'', written during the 6th century BC, [[Sun Tzu]] argued that it was a commander's duty to ensure that his subordinates conducted themselves in a civilised manner during an armed conflict. Similarly, in the Bible (Kings 1: Chapter 21), within the story of [[Ahab]] and the killing of Naboth, King Ahab was blamed for the killing of [[Naboth]] on orders from [[Jezebel|Queen Jezebel]], because Ahab (as king) is responsible for everyone in his kingdom.

The trial of [[Peter von Hagenbach]] by an ad hoc tribunal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1474, was the first "international" recognition of commanders' obligations to act lawfully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.ch/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQ2X The evolution of individual criminal responsibility under international law] By Edoardo Greppi, Associate Professor of International Law at the [[University of Turin]], [[Italy]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] No. 835, p.&amp;nbsp;531–553, October 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/alumni/bulletin/2006/spring/gallery.php Exhibit highlights the first international war crimes tribunal] by Linda Grant, Harvard Law Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbach was put on trial for atrocities committed during the occupation of [[Breisach]], found guilty of war crimes and beheaded.&lt;ref name="Schabas"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/81258/excerpt/9780521881258_excerpt.pdf An Introduction to the International Criminal Court] William A.

Miller Distinguished Lecture]], [[Georgia State University College of Law]], and to appear in the [[Georgia State University Law Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact there was no explicit use of a doctrine of "command responsibility" it is seen as the first trial based on this principle.&lt;ref name="Schabas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/general/2005/command.htm Command Responsibility] The Mens Rea Requirement, By Eugenia Levine, [[Global Policy Forum]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], the concept developed further, as is seen in the "[[Lieber Code]]". This regulated accountability by imposing criminal responsibility on commanders for ordering or encouraging soldiers to wound or kill already disabled enemies.&lt;ref name="Greppi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt; Article 71 of the Lieber Code provided that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whoever intentionally inflicts additional wounds on an enemy already wholly disabled, or kills such an enemy, or ''who orders or encourages soldiers to do so'', shall suffer death, if duly convicted, whether he belongs to the Army of the United States, or is an enemy captured after having committed his misdeed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/lieber.asp INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIELD]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Criminal Law |author=Antonio Cassese |date=April 30, 2008 |page=184 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-920310-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1899]] was the first attempt at codifying the principle of command responsibility on a multinational level and was reaffirmed and updated entirely by the Hague Convention of 1907. The doctrine was specifically found within "Laws and Customs of War on Land" (Hague IV); October 18, 1907: "Section I on Belligerents: Chapter I The Qualifications of Belligerents", "Section III Military Authority over the territory of the hostile State",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/1d1726425f6955aec125641e0038bfd6?OpenDocument |title=Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land. The Hague, 18 October 1907. |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the [[Geneva Convention]]" (Hague X); October 18, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Treaty.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=E5397A0FB560D0A9C12563CD002D6832 |title=Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention (Hague X); October 18, 1907 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of Section I of the 1907 Hague IV stated that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The laws, rights, and duties of war apply not only to armies, but also to militia and volunteer corps fulfilling the following conditions: 
* ''To be commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates'';
* To have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance;
* To carry arms openly; and
* To conduct their operations in accordance with the [[laws and customs of war]]. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example of command responsibility is shown in Article 43 of Section III of the same convention which stipulated that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention" (Hague X), Article 19 stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commanders in chief of the belligerent fleets must arrange for the details of carrying out the preceding articles, as well as for cases not covered thereby, in accordance with the instructions of their respective Governments and in conformity with the general principles of the present Convention.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 does not explicitly create a doctrine of command responsibility, it does uphold a notion that a superior must account for their actions of his subordinates. It also suggests that military superiors have a duty to ensure that their troops act in accordance with [[international law]] and if they fail to command them lawfully, their respective states may be held criminally liable. In turn, those states may choose to punish their commanders. At such, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 has been viewed as a foundational root of modern doctrine of command responsibility.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Crime and Punishment: Selected Issues, Volume 1 |editor=Sienho Yee |year=2003 |page=117 |publisher=[[University Press of America]] |isbn=0-7618-2570-3 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Power]]s' [[Commission of Responsibilities|Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on the Enforcement of Penalties]] recommended the establishment of an international tribunal, which would try individuals for "order[ing], or, with knowledge thereof and with power to intervene, abstain[ing] from preventing or taking measures to prevent, putting an end to or repressing, violations of the laws or customs of war."&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], private contractors have become more prevalent in zones of conflict.  Both political and legal scholars highlight the multiple challenges this has introduced when tracing the responsibility of crimes in the field.  Some, such as Martha Lizabeth Phelps, go as far to claim that if hired contractors are indistinguishable from national troops, the contractors borrow the state's legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics &amp; Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824–849|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12100/abstract|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The command responsibility of actions in warfare become increasingly unclear when actors are viewed as being part of a state's force, but are, in truth, private actors.

===Introducing responsibility for an omission===
[[File:YamashitaTomoyukiOsaka.jpg|165px|thumb|right|[[Tomoyuki Yamashita]], 1945]]

Command responsibility is an [[Omission (criminal law)|omission mode]] of individual criminal liability: the superior is responsible for crimes committed by his subordinates and for failing to prevent or punish (as opposed to crimes he ordered). ''[[In re]] Yamashita'' before a United States [[military justice|military commission]] in 1945, General Yamashita became the first to be charged solely on the basis of responsibility for an omission. He was commanding the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army|14th Area Army of Japan]] in the Philippines during the Pacific Theater of World War II when some of the Japanese troops engaged in atrocities against thousands of [[civilians]] and [[prisoners of war]]. As commanding officer, he was charged with "unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes."

By finding Yamashita guilty, the Commission adopted a new standard, stating that where "vengeful actions are widespread offenses and there is no effective attempt by a commander to discover and control the criminal acts, such a commander may be held responsible, even criminally liable." However, the ambiguous wording resulted in a long-standing debate about the amount of knowledge required to establish command responsibility. The matter was appealed, and was affirmed by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=327&amp;invol=1 | title = APPLICATION OF YAMASHITA, 327 U.S. 1 (1946) [Full text of the opinion] | author = U.S. Supreme Court | date = 4 February 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sentencing, Yamashita was [[executed]].

Following ''In re Yamashita'', courts clearly accepted that a commander's actual knowledge of unlawful actions is sufficient to impose individual criminal responsibility.&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

In the ''[[High Command Case]]'' (1947–8), the U.S. military tribunal argued that in order for a commander to be criminally liable for the actions of his subordinates "there must be a personal dereliction" which "can only occur where the act is directly traceable to him or where his failure to properly supervise his subordinates constitutes criminal negligence on his part" based upon "a wanton, immoral disregard of the action of his subordinates amounting to acquiescence".&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

In the ''[[Hostage Case]]'' (1947–8), the U.S. military tribunal seemed to limit the situations where a commander has a duty to know to instances where he has already had some information regarding subordinates' unlawful actions.&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

After World War&amp;nbsp;II, the parameters of command responsibility were thus increased, imposing liability on commanders for their failure to prevent the commission of crimes by their subordinates. These cases – the latter two part of the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials|Nürnberg tribunals]] – discussed explicitly the requisite standard of ''[[mens rea]]'', and were unanimous in finding that a lesser level of knowledge than actual knowledge may be sufficient.&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

===Codification===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Captain Ernest Medina.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Captain [[Ernest Medina]]]] --&gt;
The first international treaty to comprehensively codify the doctrine of command responsibility was the [[Additional Protocol&amp;nbsp;I]] ("AP&amp;nbsp;I") of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949.&lt;ref name="Analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kai Ambos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt; Article 86(2) states that:

{{quote|the fact that a breach of the Conventions or of this Protocol was committed by a subordinate does not absolve his superiors from&amp;nbsp;... responsibility&amp;nbsp;... if they knew, or had information which should have enabled them to conclude in the circumstances at the time, that he was committing or about to commit such a breach and if they did not take all feasible measures within their power to prevent or repress the breach.}}

Article 87 obliges a commander to "prevent and, where necessary, to suppress and report to competent authorities" any violation of the Conventions and of AP&amp;nbsp;I.

In Article 86(2) for the first time a provision would "explicitly address the knowledge factor of command responsibility".&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

===Definitions===
In the discussion regarding "command responsibility" the term "command" can be defined as

'''A.''' [[De jure]] (legal) command, which can be [[civilian control of the military|both military and civilian]]. The determining factor here is not rank but subordination. Four structures are identified:&lt;ref name="Analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;
#''Policy command:'' [[heads of state]], high-ranking government officials, monarchs
#''Strategic command:'' [[War Cabinet]], [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]
#''Operational command:'' military leadership. In Yamashita it was established that operational command responsibility cannot be ceded for the purpose of the doctrine of command responsibility; operational commanders must exercise the full potential of their authority to prevent war crimes – failure to supervise subordinates or non-assertive orders does not exonerate the commander.
#''Tactical command:'' direct command over troops on the ground
International [[case law]] has developed two special types of "de jure commanders."
#''Prisoners-of-war (POW) camp commanders:'' the ICTY established in Aleksovski that POW camp commanders are entrusted with the welfare of all prisoners, and subordination in this case is irrelevant.
#''Executive commanders:'' supreme governing authority in the occupied territory. Subordination is again irrelevant – their responsibility is the welfare of the population in the territory under their control, as established in the High Command and Hostages cases after World War II.

'''B.''' [[De facto]] (factual) command, which specifies effective control, as opposed to formal rank. This needs a superior-subordinate relationship. Indicia are:&lt;ref name="Analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;
#''Capacity to issue orders.''
#''Power of influence:'' influence is recognized as a source of authority in the [[Ministries case]] before the US military Tribunal after World War II.
#''Evidence stemming from distribution of tasks:'' the ICTY has established the [[Nikolic test]] – superior status is deduced from analyzing distribution of tasks within the unit, and the test applies both to operational and POW camp commanders.

Additional Protocol I and the Statutes of the ICTY, the ICTR, and the ICC makes prevention or prosecution of crimes mandatory.&lt;ref name="Analysis"/&gt;

==Application==

===Nuremberg Tribunal===
{{Main|Nuremberg trials|Subsequent Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg defense}}

Following World War&amp;nbsp;II, [[communis opinio]] was that the atrocities committed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] were so severe a special tribunal had to be held. However, contemporary jurists such as [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] criticized the [[Nuremberg Trials]] as [[victor's justice]]. The [[Nuremberg Charter]] determined the basis to prosecute people for:&lt;ref name="Greppi"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!Crime
!Description
|-
|[[Crimes against peace]]
|the planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a [[war of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing.
|-
|[[War crimes]]
|violations of the laws and customs of war. A list follows with, [[inter alia]], [[murder]], ill-treatment or [[deportation]] into [[slave labour]] or for any other purpose of the civilian population of or in [[occupied territory]], murder or ill-treatment of [[prisoners of war]] or [[shipwreck|persons on the seas]], the killing of [[hostage]]s, the [[plunder]] of [[Public property|public]] or [[private property]], the wanton destruction of [[cities]], [[town]]s or [[villages]], or devastation not justified by [[military necessity]].

|}

The [[jurisdiction ratione personae]] is considered to apply to "leaders, organisers, instigators and accomplices" involved in planning and committing those crimes.&lt;ref name="Greppi"/&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia===
{{Main|International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}

The ICTY statute article 7 (3) establishes that the fact that crimes "were committed by a subordinate does not relieve his superior of criminal responsibility if he knew or had reason to know that the subordinate was about to commit such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

In The Prosecutor v. [[Zejnil Delalić|Delalić]] et al. ("the Čelebići case") first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that "had reason to know" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have "had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of&amp;nbsp;... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether&amp;nbsp;... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates."&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

In The Prosecutor v. [[Tihomir Blaškić|Blaškić]] ("the Blaškić case") this view was corroborated. However, it differed regarding ''mens rea'' required by AP I. The Blaškić Trial Chamber concluded that "had reason to know", as defined by the ICTY Statute, also imposes a stricter "should have known" standard of ''mens rea''.&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

The conflicting views of both cases were addressed by the Appeals Chambers in Čelebići and in a separate decision in Blaškić. Both rulings hold that some information of unlawfal acts by subordinates must be available to the commander following which he did not, or inadequately, discipline the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="Analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

The concept of command responsibility has developed significantly in the jurisprudence of the ICTY. One of the most recent judgements that extensively deals with the subject is the Halilović judgement&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/icty/halilovic/trialc/judgement/tcj051116e.htm#IIIB]&lt;/ref&gt; of 16 November 2005 (para. 22-100).

===International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda===
{{Main|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}}

The [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 955|Resolution 955]] (1994) set up an international criminal tribunal to judge people responsible for the [[Rwandan Genocide]] and other serious violations of [[international law]] in [[Rwanda]], or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between 1 January and 31 December 1994;&lt;ref name="UN_SRES9551994"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-955(1994) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1994 |resolution_number=955 |accessdate=2008-07-23|date=8 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional later resolutions expanded the scope and timeline of the tribunal. The tribunal has jurisdiction over [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crimes]].

The judgement against [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]] established [[rape]] as a war crime. Rape was placed in line with "other acts of serious bodily and mental harm"&lt;ref&gt;''The Prosecutor v.

Another case prosecuted persons in charge of a radio station and a newspaper that incited and then encouraged the Rwandan genocide. The defendants were charged with genocide, incitement to genocide, and crimes against humanity for their positions of control and command in the "[[Hate Media|hate media]]," although they physically had not committed the acts.

===International Criminal Court===
[[Image:Building of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The International Criminal Court in The Hague]]
{{Main|International Criminal Court}}

Following several [[ad hoc]] tribunals, the international community decided on a comprehensive court of justice for future crimes against humanity. This resulted in the International Criminal Court, which identified four categories.&lt;ref name="Greppi"/&gt;
#[[Genocide]]
#[[Crimes against humanity]]
#[[War crimes]]
#[[Crime of aggression|Crimes of aggression]]

Article 28 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] codified the doctrine of command responsibility.&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt; With Article 28(a) military commanders are imposed with individual responsibility for crimes committed by forces under their effective command and control if they:

{{quote|either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time, should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes.&lt;ref name="Kai Ambos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StuartEHendin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;}}

It uses the stricter "should have known" standard of mens rea, instead of "had reason to know," as defined by the ICTY Statute.&lt;ref name="Bantekas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"/&gt;

The Bush administration has adopted the [[American Servicemembers' Protection Act]] and entered in [[United States and the International Criminal Court#Article 98 Agreements|Article 98 agreements]] in an attempt to protect any US citizen from appearing before this court. As such it interferes with implementing the command responsibility principle when applicable to US citizens.&lt;ref name="American Servicemembers' Protection Act"&gt;American Servicemembers' Protection Act

'''Digital materialization''' (DM) &lt;ref&gt;T. Vilbrandt, A. Pasko, C. Vilbrandt, Fabricating Nature, Technoetic Arts, Vol. 7, Issue 2, {{ISSN|1477-965X}}, Intellect, UK, 2009, pp. 165-174&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;R. Armstrong, [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl.2009.16.1.16101 Systems architecture: a new model for sustainability and the built environment using nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science with living technology], ''Artificial Life'', MIT Press, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2010, pp. 73-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
can loosely be defined as two-way direct communication or conversion between matter and information that enables people to exactly describe, monitor, manipulate and create any arbitrary real object. DM is a general [[paradigm]] alongside a specified framework that is suitable for computer processing and includes: holistic, coherent, volumetric modeling systems; symbolic languages that are able to handle infinite degrees of freedom and detail in a compact format; and the direct interaction and/or fabrication of any object at any spatial resolution without the need for “lossy” or intermediate formats.

''DM'' systems possess the following attributes:

* realistic - correct spatial mapping of matter to information
* exact - exact language and/or methods for input from and output to matter
* infinite - ability to operate at any scale and define infinite detail
* symbolic - accessible to individuals for design, creation and modification

Such an approach can not only be applied to tangible objects but can include the conversion of things such as light and sound to/from information and matter. Systems to digitally materialize light and sound already largely exist now (e.g. photo editing, audio mixing, etc.) and have been quite effective - but the representation, control and creation of tangible matter is poorly support by computational and digital systems.

Commonplace computer-aided design and manufacturing systems currently represent real objects as "2.5 dimensional" shells. In contrast, DM proposes a deeper understanding and sophisticated manipulation of matter by directly using rigorous mathematics as complete volumetric descriptions of real objects. By utilizing technologies such as [[Function representation]] (FRep) it becomes possible to compactly describe and understand the surface and internal structures or properties of an object at an infinite resolution. Thus models can accurately represent matter across all scales making it possible to capture the complexity and quality of natural and real objects and ideally suited for digital fabrication and other kinds of real world interactions. DM surpasses the previous limitations of static disassociated languages and simple human-made objects, to propose systems that are heterogeneous, interacting directly and more naturally with the complex world.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vilbrandt, E. Malone, H. Lipson, A. Pasko, Universal Desktop Fabrication, in ''Heterogeneous Objects Modelling and Applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', vol. 4889, Springer Verlag, 2008, pp. 259-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital and computer-based languages and processes, unlike the analogue counterparts, can computationally and spatially describe and control matter in an exact, constructive and accessible manner. However, this requires approaches that can handle the complexity of natural objects and materials.

{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

'''Endogamy''' is the practice of marrying within a specific [[social group]], [[caste]] or [[ethnic group]], rejecting those from others as unsuitable for marriage or other close personal relationships.

Endogamy is common in many cultures and ethnic groups. Several [[religious]] and [[Ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] groups are traditionally more endogamous, although sometimes with the added dimension of requiring [[Marital conversion|marital religious conversion]]. This permits an [[Exogamy|exogamous]] marriage, as the convert, by accepting the partner's religion, becomes accepted within the endogamous rules. The effects of endogamy, separate from [[consanguinity]], are transmission of genetic disorders, the so called [[Founder effect]].

==Adherence==
{{Further|Population genetics|inbreeding}}
Endogamy can serve as a form of [[Auto-segregation|self-segregation]]; a community can use it to resist integrating and completely merging with surrounding populations. Minorities can use it to stay ethnically homogeneous over a long time as distinct communities within societies with other practices and beliefs.

The [[Isolationism|isolationist]] practices of endogamy may lead to a group's extinction, as genetic diseases may develop that can affect a larger percentage of the population. However, this disease effect would tend to be small unless there is a high degree of close inbreeding, or if the endogamous population becomes very small in size.

==Social dynamics==
The [[Urapmin people|Urapmin]], a small tribe in Papua New Guinea, practice strict endogamy. The Urapmin also have a system of kinship classes known as ''tanum miit''. Since the classes are inherited [[Cognatic kinship|cognatically]], most Urapmin belong to all of the major classes, creating great fluidity and doing little to differentiate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The small community on the [[South Atlantic]] island of [[Tristan da Cunha]] are, because of their geographical isolation, an almost endogamic society. There are instances of health problems attributed to endogamy on the island, including [[glaucoma]] and [[asthma]] as research by the [[University of Toronto]] has demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7766656.stm |work=BBC News |title=Worldwide search for asthma clue |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123092415/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7766656.stm |archivedate=23 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Other examples of ethnic and religious groups that practice endogamy include:
*[[Amish]]
*[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], indigenous Christian people of northern [[Mesopotamia]]&lt;ref name="Awoyemi2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Joseph Adebayo Awoyemi|title=Pre-marital Counselling In a Multicultural Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm1LCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75|date=14 September 2014|isbn=978-1-291-83577-9|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dailamites]], an ethnic group living in south of Caspian Sea in ancient and medieval Persia
*[[Druze]] of the Levant.
*[[Iranian Turkmen]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sid.ir/En/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=196840|title=THE FUNCTION OF MARRIAGE CUSTOMARY LAW AMONG TURKMEN OF IRAN|first=Maghsudi|last=Manijeh|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|volume=2|issue=4|pages=25–39|accessdate=9 May 2018|via=en.journals.sid.ir|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509003600/http://www.sid.ir/En/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=196840|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mashhadi Jews|Jews of Mashhad, Iran]]
*[[Judaism]] traditionally mandates religious endogamy, requiring that both marriage partners be Jewish, while allowing for marriage to converts. [[Orthodox Judaism]] maintains the traditional requirement for [[endogamy in Judaism]] as a binding, inherent part of Judaism's religious beliefs and traditions, while the more liberal [[Jewish religious movements]] are far more permissive with regard to interfaith marriage and conversion requirements. 
*[[Yazidis]], an ethnically Kurdish religious community or an ethno-religious group indigenous to northern Mesopotamia

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6133">An '''exclusion zone''' is a territorial division established for various case specific purposes. 

Per the [[United States Department of Defense]], an exclusion zone is a territory where sanctioning body prohibits specific activities in a specific geographic area (see [[Military exclusion zone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url   = http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/data/e/9463.html | title = exclusion zone | work  = [[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]] | publisher  = [[United States Department of Defense]] | accessdate = February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These zones are created for control of populations for safety, crowd control, or military purposes, or as a [[border zone]], and they may be temporary or permanent.

==Nuclear disaster exclusion zones==

Large-scale geographic exclusion zones have been established after major disasters in which nuclear power plants went into meltdown:

*[[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] &amp;ndash; [[Ukraine]], established 1986.
*[[Fukushima Exclusion Zone]] &amp;ndash; [[Japan]], established 2011.
*[[East Ural Radioactive Trace]] &amp;ndash; [[Russia]], established 1958.

== Border zones ==
[[Border zone]]s are areas where movement, property ownership or other activity is prohibited or restricted by legislation. Unlike regular territory, border zones are under administrative control of the border authorities. Entrance is generally only with an individual permit. Entering a border zone without authorization is a crime or misdemeanor and grounds for arrest. Border zones are instituted to pinpoint illegal intruders, conceal and obscure and prevent interference with border security procedures and equipment, and thus aid border guards with their work. For example, Russia maintains [[Border Security Zone of Russia|sizable border zones]].

==Natural disaster exclusion zones==

Similarly, exclusion zones have been established due to natural disasters. There is an exclusion zone on the island of [[Montserrat]], where the long-dormant [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano started erupting in 1995 and has continued erupting since. It encompasses the south part of the island, accounting for over half of its land mass and most areas of the island which were populated before the volcano erupted. The volcano destroyed the island's urban center and capital [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]], as well as many other villages and neighborhoods. The zone is now strictly enforced; entry into most of the destroyed areas is prohibited, while some areas are subject to restrictions during volcanic activity or open only as a "daytime entry zone".

==  Construction  ==
Exclusion zones are commonly used in the construction industry worldwide. For this purpose they are defined locations to prohibit the entry of personnel in to danger areas, established through the risk assessment process for a construction activity. Typically, exclusion zones are set up and maintained around plant and below work at height.

==  Protesting  ==

With regard to protesting, an exclusion zone is an area that protesters are legally prohibited from protesting in.

Exclusion zones often exist around [[seat of government|seats of government]] and [[abortion clinic]]s. As a result of protests by the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] at the funerals of soldiers killed in the [[Iraq War]], 29 states and the US Congress created exclusion zones around soldiers' funerals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-13-funeral-protests_x.htm Funeral protesters say laws can't silence them]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] created a one kilometre exclusion zone around itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-19308982-details/Exclusion+zone+to+Parliament+protests/article.do;jsessionid=b2CbHmRGGmsFm9NhLKCv5fGLGpxxFGZXRqsXSdpTnmFjyLM2ptL1!-1339398235!-1407319225!7001!-1 Exclusion Zone to Parliament Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that "Congress shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." The existence of exclusion zones is based on court rulings that allow the government to regulate the time, place, and manner of protests.

An exclusion zone is related to a [[free speech zone]]. Protesters are required to picket in a free speech zone, thus rendering the area around the free speech zone to be an exclusion zone.

== Restraining orders ==

When a [[restraining order]] is issued, an exclusion zone is an area that the respondent is prohibited from entering—often an area surrounding the petitioner's residence or workplace.  For example, if a [[Wisconsin]] [[Harassment Restraining Order|harassment restraining order]] or [[Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|domestic abuse restraining order]] is violated, the court may order [[GPS]] monitoring of the respondent.&lt;ref name="wislegis2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 813.129|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/129|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=5 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegisexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 301.49|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/301/49|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the exclusion zone is entered, in violation of the order, the GPS technology is used to notify law enforcement and the petitioner.&lt;ref name="gpsexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases for Wisconsin Civil and Criminal Information|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ii-bciv-d_ro_civil_criminal_databases_wi.pdf|publisher=End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin - Legal Department|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extinction''' is observed in both [[operant conditioning|operantly conditioned]] and [[classical conditioning|classically conditioned]] behavior. When operant behavior that has been previously reinforced no longer produces reinforcing consequences the behavior gradually stops occurring.&lt;ref name="milten"&gt;Miltenberger, R. (2012). ''Behavior modification, principles and procedures''. (5th ed., pp. 87-99). Wadsworth Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In classical conditioning, when a conditioned stimulus is presented alone, so that it no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually stops. For example, after [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov's]] dog was conditioned to salivate at the sound of a metronome, it eventually stopped salivating to the metronome after the metronome had been sounded repeatedly but no food came. Many [[anxiety disorders]] such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorder]] are believed to reflect, at least in part, a failure to extinguish conditioned fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = VanElzakker | first1 = M. B. | last2 = Dahlgren | first2 = M. K. | last3 = Davis | first3 = F. C. | last4 = Dubois | first4 = S. | last5 = Shin | first5 = L.

==Theories==
The dominant account of extinction involves associative models. However, there is debate over whether extinction involves simply "unlearning" the unconditional stimulus (US) – Conditional stimulus (CS) association (e.g., the [[Rescorla–Wagner model|Rescorla–Wagner account]]) or, alternatively, a "new learning" of an inhibitory association that masks the original excitatory association (e.g., Konorski, Pearce and Hall account). A third account concerns non-associative mechanisms such as habituation, modulation and response fatigue. Myers and Davis laboratory work with fear extinction in rodents has suggested that multiple mechanisms may be at work depending on the timing and circumstances in which the extinction occurs.&lt;ref name="Myers &amp; Davis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 =  | last2 = Davis | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = Mechanisms of Fear Extinction | url = | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 120–150 | doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001939 | pmid=17160066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the competing views and difficult observations for the various accounts researchers have turned to investigations at the cellular level (most often in rodents) to tease apart the specific brain mechanisms of extinction, in particular the role of the brain structures (amygdala, hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex), and specific neurotransmitter systems (e.g., [[GABA]], [[NMDA]]).&lt;ref name="Myers &amp; Davis 2007"/&gt; A recent study in rodents by Amano, Unal and Paré published in ''Nature Neuroscience'' found that extinction of a conditioned fear response is correlated with [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|synaptic inhibition]] in the [[fear]] output [[neuron]]s of the central [[amygdala]] that project to the [[periaqueductal gray]] that controls [[freezing behavior]]. They infer that inhibition derives from the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and suggest promising targets at the cellular level for new treatments of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amano | first1 = T | last2 = Unal | first2 = CT | last3 = Paré | first3 = D | year = 2010 | title = Synaptic correlates of fear extinction in the amygdala | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 489–494 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2499 | pmid = 20208529 | pmc=2847017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operant conditioning==
In the [[operant conditioning]] paradigm, extinction refers to the process of no longer providing the reinforcement that has been maintaining a behavior. '''Operant extinction''' &lt;!--bolded per MOS:BOLD - this term redirects here--&gt; differs from forgetting in that the latter refers to a decrease in the strength of a behavior over time when it has not been emitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Julie S.|title=Behavior Analysis for effective Teaching|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=52|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a child who climbs under his desk, a response which has been reinforced by [[attention]], is subsequently ignored until the [[attention-seeking]] behavior no longer occurs. In his autobiography, [[B.F. Skinner]] noted how he accidentally discovered the extinction of an operant response due to the malfunction of his laboratory equipment:
{{quote|My first extinction curve showed up by accident. A rat was pressing the lever in an experiment on satiation when the pellet dispenser jammed. I was not there at the time, and when I returned I found a beautiful curve. The rat had gone on pressing although no pellets were received. ... The change was more orderly than the extinction of a salivary reflex in Pavlov's setting, and I was terribly excited. It was a Friday afternoon and there was no one in the laboratory who I could tell. All that weekend I crossed streets with particular care and avoided all unnecessary risks to protect my discovery from loss through my accidental death.&lt;ref&gt;[[B.F. Skinner]] (1979). ''The Shaping of a Behaviorist: Part Two of an Autobiography'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the extinction of a response has occurred, the discriminative stimulus is then known as an extinction stimulus (SΔ&lt;!--was SÉ¢, assuming supposed to be a delta, not sure if it is uppercase delta or lowercase delta, fix if lowercase by lowercasing the delta--&gt; or ''S-delta''). When an S-delta is present, the reinforcing consequence which characteristically follows a behavior does not occur. This is the opposite of a [[discriminative stimulus]] which is a signal that reinforcement will occur. For instance, in an [[operant chamber]], if food pellets are only delivered when a response is emitted in the presence of a green light, the green light is a discriminative stimulus. If when a red light is present food will not be delivered, then the red light is an extinction stimulus (food here is used as an example of a [[reinforcer]]).
However, some make the distinction between extinction stimuli and "S-Delta" due to the behavior not having a reinforcement history, i.e. in an array of three items (phone, pen, paper) "Which one is the phone" the "pen" and "paper" will not produce a response in the teacher but is not technically extinction on the first trial due to selecting "pen" or "paper" missing a reinforcement history. This still would be considered as S-Delta. 

===Successful extinction procedures===
In order for extinction to work effectively, it must be done consistently. Extinction is considered successful when responding in the presence of an extinction stimulus (a red light or a teacher not giving a bad student attention, for instance) is zero. When a behavior reappears again after it has gone through extinction, it is called [[spontaneous recovery|resurgence]].

===Burst===
While extinction, when implemented consistently over time, results in the eventual decrease of the undesired behavior, in the short term the subject might exhibit what is called an ''extinction burst''. An extinction burst will often occur when the extinction procedure has just begun. This usually consists of a sudden and temporary ''increase'' in the response's frequency, followed by the eventual decline and extinction of the behavior targeted for elimination. Novel behavior, or emotional responses or aggressive behavior, may also occur.&lt;ref name="milten" /&gt;

Take, as an example, a pigeon that has been reinforced to peck an electronic button. During its training history, every time the pigeon pecked the button, it will have received a small amount of bird seed as a reinforcer. So, whenever the bird is hungry, it will peck the button to receive food. However, if the button were to be turned off, the hungry pigeon will first try pecking the button just as it has in the past. When no food is forthcoming, the bird will likely try again ... and again, and again. After a period of frantic activity, in which their pecking behavior yields no result, the pigeon's pecking will decrease in frequency.

Although not explained by [[reinforcement theory]], the extinction burst can be understood using control theory. In [[perceptual control theory]], the degree of output involved in any action is proportional to the discrepancy between the reference value (desired rate of reward in the operant paradigm) and the current input. Thus, when reward is removed, the discrepancy increases, and the output is increased. In the long term, 'reorganisation', the learning algorithm of control theory, would adapt the control system such that output is reduced.

The evolutionary advantage of this extinction burst is clear. In a natural environment, an animal that persists in a learned behavior, despite not resulting in immediate reinforcement, might still have a chance of producing reinforcing consequences if the animal tries again. This animal would be at an advantage over another animal that gives up too easily.

Despite the name, however, not every explosive reaction to adverse stimuli subsides to extinction. Indeed, a small minority of individuals persist in their reaction indefinitely.

===Extinction-induced variability===
Extinction-induced variability serves an adaptive role similar to the extinction burst. When extinction begins, subjects can exhibit variations in response topography (the movements involved in the response).  Response topography is always somewhat variable due to differences in environment or idiosyncratic causes but normally a subject's history of reinforcement keeps slight variations stable by maintaining successful variations over less successful variations. Extinction can increase these variations significantly as the subject attempts to acquire the reinforcement that previous behaviors produced. If a person attempts to open a door by turning the knob, but is unsuccessful, they may next try jiggling the knob, pushing on the frame, knocking on the door or other behaviors to get the door to open. Extinction-induced variability can be used in [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] to reduce problematic behaviors by reinforcing desirable behaviors produced by extinction-induced variability.

== Classical conditioning ==
Extinction learning can also occur in a [[classical conditioning]] paradigm. In this model, a neutral cue or context can come to elicit a conditioned response when it is paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An unconditioned stimulus is one that naturally and automatically triggers a certain behavioral response. A certain stimulus or environment can become a conditioned cue or a conditioned context, respectively, when paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An example of this process is a [[fear conditioning]] paradigm using a mouse. In this instance, a tone paired with a mild footshock can become a conditioned cue, eliciting a fear response when presented alone in the future. In the same way, the context in which a footshock is received such as a chamber with certain dimensions and a certain odor can elicit the same fear response when the mouse is placed back in that chamber in the absence of the footshock.

In this paradigm, extinction occurs when the animal is re-exposed to the conditioned cue or conditioned context in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. As the animal learns that the cue or context no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually decreases, or extinguishes.

== Neurobiology ==

===Glutamate===
[[Glutamate receptor|Glutamate]] is a neurotransmitter that has been extensively implicated in the neural basis of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Glutamate receptor function in learning and memory|journal = Behavioural Brain Research|date = 2003-03-18|issn = 0166-4328|pmid = 12644276|pages = 1–47|volume = 140|issue = 1–2|first = Gernot|last = Riedel|first2 = Bettina|last2 = Platt|first3 = Jacques|last3 = Micheau|doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(02)00272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-[[Cycloserine]] (DCS) is an [[agonist]] for the glutamate receptor [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]], and has been trialed as an adjunct to conventional [[exposure-based treatment]]s based on the principle of cue extinction.

A role for glutamate has also been identified in the extinction of a cocaine-associated environmental stimuli through testing in rats. Specifically, the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGlu5) is important for the extinction of a cocaine-associated context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extinction of a cocaine-taking context that protects against drug-primed reinstatement is dependent on the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/adb.12142/abstract|journal = Addiction Biology|date = 2015-05-01|issn = 1369-1600|pages = 482–489|volume = 20|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/adb.12142|first = Jee Hyun|last = Kim|first2 = Christina|last2 = Perry|first3 = Sophia|last3 = Luikinga|first4 = Isabel|last4 = Zbukvic|first5 = Robyn M.|last5 = Brown|first6 = Andrew J.|last6 = Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a cocaine-associated cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor is necessary for extinction of cocaine associated cues|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.13437/abstract|journal = British Journal of Pharmacology|date = 2016-01-01|issn = 1476-5381|pages = 1085–1094|doi = 10.1111/bph.13437|first = Christina J|last = Perry|first2 = Felicia|last2 = Reed|first3 = Isabel C|last3 = Zbukvic|first4 = Jee Hyun|last4 = Kim|first5 = Andrew J|last5 = Lawrence|volume=173|pmid=26784278|pmc = 5341241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dopamine ===
[[Dopamine]] is another neurotransmitter recently implicated in extinction learning across both appetitive and aversive domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Antony D.|last2=Neve|first2=Kim A.|last3=Lattal|first3=K.

=== Circuitry ===

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=States of matter}}
An ideal '''Fermi gas''' is a [[phase of matter]] which is an ensemble of a large number of non-interacting [[fermion]]s. Fermions are [[subatomic particle|particles]] that obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], like [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, and in general, particles with half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]. These statistics determine the energy distribution of fermions in a Fermi gas in [[thermal equilibrium]], and is characterized by their [[number density]], [[temperature]], and the set of available energy states. The model is named after the Italian physicist [[Enrico Fermi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fermi|first=E.|author-link=Enrico Fermi|date=1926-11-01|title=Zur Quantelung des idealen einatomigen Gases|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01400221|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|language=de|volume=36|issue=11-12|pages=902–912|doi=10.1007/BF01400221|issn=0044-3328|bibcode=1926ZPhy...36..902F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This physical model can be accurately applied to many systems with a large number of fermions. Some key examples are the behaviour of [[Free electron model|charge carriers in a metal]], [[nucleon]]s in an [[atomic nucleus]], neutrons in a [[neutron star]], and electrons in a [[white dwarf]].

==  Description ==
[[File:FermiZustaendeA.png|left|thumb|350x350px|Illustration of the energy states: Energy-occupation diagram for a system with 7 energy levels, the energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is degenerate ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' times and has an occupancy given by ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', with ''i''=1,2,3,4,5,6,7. By the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], up to ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' fermions can occupy a level of energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''  of the system.]]

An ideal Fermi gas or free Fermi gas is a [[mathematical model|physical model]] assuming a collection of non-interacting fermions in a constant [[potential well]]. It is the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] version of an [[ideal gas]], for the case of fermionic particles.

By the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no [[quantum state]] can be occupied by more than one fermion with an identical set of [[quantum number]]s. Thus a non-interacting Fermi gas, unlike a [[Bose gas]], concentrates a small number of particles per energy. Thus a Fermi gas is prohibited from condensing into a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], although weakly-interacting Fermi gases might.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regal|first=C. A.|last2=Greiner|first2=M.|last3=Jin|first3=D. S.|date=2004-01-28|title=Observation of Resonance Condensation of Fermionic Atom Pairs|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.040403|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=92|issue=4|pages=040403|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.040403|arxiv=cond-mat/0401554|bibcode=2004PhRvL..92d0403R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total energy of the Fermi gas at [[absolute zero]] is larger than the sum of the single-particle [[ground state]]s because the Pauli principle implies a sort of interaction or pressure that keeps fermions separated and moving. For this reason, the [[pressure]] of a Fermi gas is non-zero even at zero temperature, in contrast to that of a classical ideal gas.  For example, this so-called [[degeneracy pressure]] stabilizes a [[neutron star]] (a Fermi gas of neutrons) or a [[white dwarf]] star (a Fermi gas of electrons) against the inward pull of [[gravity]], which would ostensibly collapse the star into a [[black hole]]. Only when a star is sufficiently massive to overcome the degeneracy pressure can it collapse into a singularity.

It is possible to define a Fermi temperature below which the gas can be considered degenerate (its pressure derives almost exclusively from the Pauli principle). This temperature depends on the mass of the fermions and the [[density of states|density of energy states]].

The main assumption of the [[free electron model]] to describe the delocalized electrons in a metal can be derived from the Fermi gas. Since interactions are neglected due to [[screening effect]], the problem of treating the equilibrium properties and dynamics of an ideal Fermi gas reduces to the study of the behaviour of single independent particles. In these systems the Fermi temperature is generally many thousands of [[kelvin]]s, so in human applications the electron gas can be considered degenerate. The maximum energy of the fermions at zero temperature is called the '''Fermi energy'''. The Fermi energy surface in [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]] is known as the [[Fermi surface]].

The [[nearly free electron model]] adapts the Fermi gas model to consider the [[crystal structure]] of [[metal]]s and [[semiconductor]]s. Where electrons in a crystal lattice are substituted by [[Bloch wave]]s with a corresponding [[crystal momentum]]. As such, periodic systems are still relatively tractable and the model forms the starting point for more advanced theories that deal with interactions, e.g., using the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]].

==Illustration of the Fermi energy for a one-dimensional well==
The one-dimensional [[Particle in a box|infinite square well]] of length ''L'' is a model for a one-dimensional box. It is a standard model-system in quantum mechanics for which the solution for a single particle is well known. The levels are labelled by a single quantum number ''n'' and the energies are given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_n = E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2 m L^2} n^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the potential energy level inside the box, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass of a single fermion, and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]].

Suppose now that instead of one particle in this box we have ''N'' particles in the box and that these particles are fermions with [[spin-½]]. Then not more than two particles can have the same energy, i.e., two particles can have the energy of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, two other particles can have energy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; and so forth. The reason that two particles can have the same energy is that a  particle can have a spin of ½ (spin up) or a spin of −½ (spin down), leading to two states for each energy level. In the configuration for which the total energy is lowest (the ground state), all the energy levels up to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''/2 are occupied and all the higher levels are empty.

Defining the reference for the Fermi energy to be &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;, the Fermi energy is therefore given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}}^{(\text{1D})}=E_{N^*/2}-E_0=\frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2 m L^2} (N^*/2)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N*'' is equal to (''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) when the number of particles ''N'' is odd, and its equal to (N) for an even number of particles.

==Three-dimensional case==
[[File:Nucleus_drawing.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nucleus_drawing.svg|thumb|A model of the atomic nucleus showing it as a compact bundle of the two types of [[Nucleon|nucleons]]: protons (red) and neutrons (blue). As a first approximation, the nucleus can be treated as composed of non-interacting proton and neutron gases.]]
The three-dimensional [[isotropic]] and non-[[Special relativity|relativistic]] case is known as the '''Fermi sphere'''.

Let us now consider a three-dimensional infinite square well, that is, a cubical box that has a side length ''L''. The states are now labelled by three quantum numbers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;. The single particle energies are
::&lt;math&gt;E_{n_x,n_y,n_z} = E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} \left( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers. There are multiple states with the same energy, for example &lt;math&gt;E_{211}=E_{121}=E_{112}&lt;/math&gt;. Now let's put ''N'' non-interacting fermions of spin ½ into this box. To calculate the Fermi energy, we look at the case where ''N'' is large.

If we introduce a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}=(n_x,n_y,n_z)&lt;/math&gt; then each quantum state corresponds to a point in 'n-space' with energy 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathbf{n}} =  E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} |\mathbf{n}|^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{n}|^2 &lt;/math&gt;denoting the square of the usual Euclidean length &lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{n}|=\sqrt{n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2} &lt;/math&gt;. 
The number of states with energy less than ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ &amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the number of states that lie within a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{n}_{\mathrm{F}}|&lt;/math&gt; in the region of n-space where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive. In the ground state this number equals the number of fermions in the system.
:&lt;math&gt;N =2\times\frac{1}{8}\times\frac{4}{3} \pi n_{\mathrm{F}}^3 \,&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:K-space.JPG|thumb|The free fermions that occupy the lowest energy states form a [[sphere]] in [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]]. The surface of this sphere is the [[Fermi surface]].]]
the factor of two is once again because there are two spin states, the factor of 1/8 is because only 1/8 of the sphere lies in the region where all ''n'' are positive. We find
:&lt;math&gt;n_{\mathrm{F}}=\left(\frac{3 N}{\pi}\right)^{1/3} &lt;/math&gt;
so the '''Fermi energy''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} n_{\mathrm{F}}^2 = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} \left( \frac{3 N}{\pi} \right)^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;

Which results in a relationship between the Fermi energy and the [[Particle number density|number of particles per volume]] (when we replace ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;):
::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 N}{V} \right)^{2/3} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The total energy of a Fermi sphere of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; fermions is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm T} = N E_0 + \int_0^N  E_{\mathrm{F}} \, \mathrm{d}N^\prime = \left(\frac{3}{5} E_{\mathrm{F}} + E_0\right)N&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the average energy per particle is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{av} = E_0 + \frac{3}{5} E_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Related quantities==
Using this definition of Fermi energy, various related quantities can be useful.
The '''Fermi temperature''' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{E_{\mathrm{F}}}{k_{\rm B}} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.usu.edu/torre/3700_Spring_2015/Lectures/08.pdf|title=PHYS 3700: Introduction to Quantum Statistical Thermodyamics|last=Torre|first=Charles|date=2015-04-21|website=Utah State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature.

Other quantities defined in this context are '''Fermi momentum''' 
:&lt;math&gt; p_{\mathrm{F}} = \sqrt{2 m E_{\mathrm{F}}} &lt;/math&gt;,
and '''Fermi velocity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/Fermi.html|title=Fermi level and Fermi function|last=Nave|first=Rod|date=|website=|publisher=[[HyperPhysics]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{p_{\mathrm{F}}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;.
These quantities are the [[momentum]] and [[group velocity]], respectively, of a [[fermion]] at the [[Fermi surface]]. The Fermi momentum can also be described as &lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{F}} = \hbar k_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the Fermi sphere and is called the '''Fermi wave vector'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashcroft | first = Neil W. | last2 = Mermin | first2 = N. David | title = Solid State Physics | publisher = [[Henry Holt and Company|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] | year = 1976 | isbn = 0-03-083993-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These quantities are ''not'' well-defined in cases where the Fermi surface is non-spherical.

== Thermodynamic quantities ==
=== Degeneracy pressure ===
As we showed above, a Fermi gas has a non-zero total energy even at zero temperature. By using the [[first law of thermodynamics]], we can associate a pressure to this internal energy, that is
:&lt;math&gt;P = -\frac{\partial E_{\rm T}}{\partial V} = \frac{2}{5}\frac{N}{V}E_{\mathrm{F}}= \frac{(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\hbar^2}{5m}\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)^{5/3},&lt;/math&gt;

where the expression is only valid for temperatures much smaller than the Fermi temperature. This pressure is known as the '''degeneracy pressure'''. In this sense, systems composed of fermions are also referred as [[degenerate matter]].

Standard [[star]]s avoid collapse by balancing thermal pressure ([[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and radiation) against gravitational forces. At the end of the star lifetime, when thermal processes are weaker, some stars may become white dwarfs, which are only sustained against gravity by [[electron degeneracy pressure]]. Using the Fermi gas as a model, it is possible to calculate the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], i.e. the maximum mass any star may acquire (without significant thermally generated pressure) before collapsing into a black hole or a neutron star. The latter, is a star mainly composed of neutrons, where the collapse is also avoided by neutron degeneracy pressure.

For the case of metals, the electron degeneracy pressure contributes to the compressibility or [[bulk modulus]] of the material.

=== Chemical potential ===
{{See also|Fermi level}}
Assuming that the concentration of fermions does not change with temperature, then the [[total chemical potential]] ''µ'' (Fermi level) of the three-dimensional ideal Fermi gas is related to the zero temperature Fermi energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; by a [[Sommerfeld expansion]] (assuming &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}T \ll E_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(T) = E_0 + E_{\mathrm{F}} \left[ 1- \frac{\pi ^2}{12} \left(\frac{k_{\rm B}T}{E_{\mathrm{F}}}\right) ^2 - \frac{\pi^4}{80} \left(\frac{k_{\rm B}T}{E_{\mathrm{F}}}\right)^4 + \cdots \right] &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''T'' is the [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/ciencias/jgr/pdfs/fermi.pdf|title=Statistical Mechanics of Ideal Fermi Systems|last=Kelly|first=James J.|date=1996|website=Universidad Autónoma de Madrid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/ugrad/sphys_old/sphys_webct/PHYS3905_SM/TSM12.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919073627/http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/ugrad/sphys_old/sphys_webct/PHYS3905_SM/TSM12.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-19|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2014-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, the [[internal chemical potential]], ''µ''-''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  is approximately equal to the Fermi energy at temperatures that are much lower than the characteristic Fermi temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. This characteristic temperature is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[kelvin|K]] for a metal, hence at room temperature (300 K), the Fermi energy and internal chemical potential are essentially equivalent.

== Density of states ==
[[File:Free-electron_DOS.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Free-electron_DOS.svg|thumb|300x300px|Figure 3: Density of states (DOS) of a Fermi gas in 3-dimensions]]
For the three dimensional case, with fermions of spin-½, we can obtain the number of particles as a function of the energy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;N(E)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting the Fermi energy by a variable energy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(E-E_0)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;N(E)=\frac{V}{3\pi^2}\left[\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E-E_0)\right]^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;,
which we can use to obtain the [[density of states]] (number of energy states per energy per volume) &lt;math&gt;g(E)&lt;/math&gt;. It can be calculated by differentiating the number of particles with respect to the energy:
:&lt;math&gt;g(E) =\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial N(E)}{\partial E}= \frac {1}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac {2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2}\sqrt{E-E_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Arbitrary-dimensional case===
Using a volume integral on &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, we can find the state density:
:&lt;math&gt;g^{(d)}(E)=g_s \int\frac{\mathrm{d}^d\mathbf{k}}{(2\pi)^d}\delta\left(E-E_0-\frac{\hbar^2|\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}\right)=g_s\ \frac{d}{2}\left(\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\right)^{d/2} \frac{(E-E_0)^{d/2-1}}{\Gamma(d/2+1)}  &lt;/math&gt;
By then looking for the [[number density]] of particles, we can extract the Fermi energy:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{N}{V}=\int_{E_0}^{E_0+E_{\mathrm{F}}^{(d)}}g^{(d)}(E) \, \mathrm{d}E&lt;/math&gt;
To get:
: &lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}}^{(d)}=\frac{2\pi\hbar^2}{m}\left(\tfrac{1}{g_s}\Gamma\left(\tfrac{d}{2}+1\right)\frac{N}{V}\right)^{2/d}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding ''d''-dimensional volume,  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g_s&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension for the internal Hilbert space. For the case of spin-½, every energy is twice-degenerate, so in this case &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g_{s}=2&lt;/math&gt;.

A particular result is obtained for &lt;math&gt;d=2&lt;/math&gt;, where the density of states becomes a constant (does not depend on the energy):

:&lt;math&gt;g^{(2\mathrm{D})}(E)=\frac{g_s}{2}\frac{m}{\pi \hbar^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Typical values==

===Metals===
Under the [[free electron model]], the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas. The number density &lt;math&gt;N/V&lt;/math&gt; of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; electrons/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid matter.
This number density produces a Fermi energy of the order:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \left( 3 \pi^2 \ 10^{28 \  \sim  \ 29} \ \mathrm{m}^{-3} \right)^{2/3} \approx 2 \  \sim  \ 10 \ \mathrm{eV} &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/fermi.html|title=Fermi Energies, Fermi Temperatures, and Fermi Velocities|last=Nave|first=Rod|date=|website=|publisher=[[HyperPhysics]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Fermi energy corresponds to a Fermi temperature of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kelvins, much higher than the temperature of the [[sun]] surface. Any metal will boil before reaching this temperature under atmospheric pressure. Thus for any practical purpose a metal, can be considered as a Fermi gas at zero temperature as a first approximation (normal temperatures are small compared to ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;).

===White dwarfs===
Stars known as [[white dwarfs]] have mass comparable to our [[Sun]], but have about a hundredth of its radius.  The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas.  The number density of electrons in a white dwarf is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; electrons/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 
This means their Fermi energy is:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 (10^{36})}{1 \ \mathrm{m}^3} \right)^{2/3} \approx 3 \times 10^5 \ \mathrm{eV} = 0.3 \ \mathrm{MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

===Nucleus===
Another typical example is that of the particles in a nucleus of an atom.  The [[Nuclear size|radius of the nucleus]] is roughly:
::&lt;math&gt;R = \left(1.25 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m} \right) \times A^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''A'' is the number of [[nucleons]].

The number density of nucleons in a nucleus is therefore:
::&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{A}{\begin{matrix} \frac{4}{3} \end{matrix} \pi R^3 } \approx 1.2 \times 10^{44} \ \mathrm{m}^{-3} &lt;/math&gt;

Now since the Fermi energy only applies to fermions of the same type, one must divide this density in two.  This is because the presence of [[neutron]]s does not affect the Fermi energy of the [[proton]]s in the nucleus, and vice versa.

So the Fermi energy of a nucleus is about:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_{\rm p}} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 (6 \times 10^{43})}{1 \ \mathrm{m}^3} \right)^{2/3} \approx 3 \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{eV} = 30 \ \mathrm{MeV} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the proton mass.

The [[Nuclear size|radius of the nucleus]] admits deviations around the value mentioned above, so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 [[MeV]].

== Extensions to the model ==

=== Relativistic Fermi gas ===
[[File:ChandrasekharLimitGraph.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChandrasekharLimitGraph.svg|right|thumb|350x350px|Radius–mass relations for a model white dwarf, relativistic relation vs non-relativistic. The [[Chandrasekhar limit]] is indicated as M&lt;sub&gt;Ch&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
For the whole article, we have only discussed the case where particles have a parabolic relation between energy and momentum, as is the case in non-relativistic mechanics. For particles with energies close to their respective [[rest mass]], we have to use the equations of [[special relativity]]. Where single-particle energy is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E=\sqrt{(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
For this system, the Fermi energy is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}}=\sqrt{(p_{\mathrm{F}}c)^2+(mc^2)^2}-mc^2\approx p_{\mathrm{F}}c&lt;/math&gt; ,
where the &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; equality is only valid in the [[ultrarelativistic limit]], and 
:&lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{F}}=\hbar\left(\frac{1}{g_s}6\pi^2\frac{N}{V}\right)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0827-3_14|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics|last=Greiner|first=Walter|last2=Neise|first2=Ludwig|last3=Stöcker|first3=Horst|date=1995|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|year=|isbn=9780387942995|series=Classical Theoretical Physics|location=|pages=341–386|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0827-3_14|author-link=Walter Greiner|author-link3=Horst Stöcker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The relativistic Fermi gas model is also used for the description of large white dwarfs which are close to the Chandresekhar limit. For the ultrarelativistic case, the degeneracy pressure is proportional to &lt;math&gt;(N/V)^{4/3}&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Fermi liquid ===
In 1956, [[Lev Landau]] developed the [[Fermi liquid theory]], where he treated the case of a Fermi liquid, i.e., a system with repulsive, not necessarily small, interactions between fermions. The theory shows that the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas and a Fermi liquid do not differ that much. It can be shown that the Fermi liquid is equivalent to a Fermi gas composed of collective excitations or [[quasiparticle]]s, each with a different [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and [[magnetic moment]].

[[File:Scout Girl in Concentration.jpg|thumb|right|Concentrating on a task is one aspect of flow.]]
In [[positive psychology]], '''flow''', also known colloquially as being in '''the zone''', is the [[mental state]] of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.

Named by [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]] in 1975, the concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and has an especially big recognition in [[occupational therapy]]), though the concept has existed for thousands of years under other names, notably in some [[East Asian religions|Eastern religions]].&lt;ref name="Csikszentmihalyi1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mihaly Csikszentmihályi|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9KrQgAACAAJ|accessdate=|year=1990|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-016253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow shares many characteristics with [[hyperfocus]].  However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. Some examples include spending "too much" time playing video games or getting side-tracked and pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. In some cases, hyperfocus can "capture" a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few.

==Components==
Jeanne Nakamura and Csíkszentmihályi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow:&lt;ref name="PsychologyProfessor2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nakamura, J.|author2=Csikszentmihályi, M.|editor=C. R. Snyder Erik Wright, and Shane J. Lopez|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Cr5rP8jOnsC|accessdate=20 November 2013|date=20 December 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803094-2|pages=195–206|chapter=Flow Theory and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intense and focused [[Attentional control|concentration]] on [[the present]] moment
# Merging of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[awareness]]
# A loss of [[Self-reflection#Modern_era|reflective]] [[self-consciousness]]
# A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
# A distortion of temporal experience, one's [[sense of time|subjective experience of time]] is altered
# Experience of the activity as intrinsically [[Reward system|rewarding]], also referred to as [[wiktionary:autotelic|autotelic]] experience

Those aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination do they constitute a so-called ''flow experience''. Additionally, psychology writer Kendra Cherry has mentioned three other components that Csíkszentmihályi lists as being a part of the flow experience:&lt;ref name="kendracherry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cherry|first1=Kendra|title=What is Flow?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/PositivePsychology/a/flow.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "Immediate feedback"&lt;ref name=kendracherry /&gt;
# Feeling that you have the potential to succeed  
# Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible 
Just as with the conditions listed above, these conditions can be independent of one another.

==Etymology==
Flow is so named because during Csíkszentmihályi's 1975 interviews several people described their "flow" experiences using the metaphor of a water current carrying them along.&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|title=Beyond boredom and anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ro-gAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 November 2013|year=1975|publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers|isbn=978-0-7879-5140-5|pages=10-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mihaly Csikszentmihályi and his fellow researchers began researching flow after Csikszentmihályi became fascinated by artists who would essentially get "lost" in their work. Artists, especially painters, got so immersed in their work that they would disregard their need for food, water and even sleep. Thus, the origin of research on the theory of flow came about when Csikszentmihályi tried to understand this phenomenon experienced by these artists. Flow research became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, with Csikszentmihályi and his colleagues in Italy still at the forefront. Researchers interested in optimal experiences and emphasizing positive experiences, especially in places such as schools and the business world, also began studying the theory of flow at this time. The theory of flow was greatly used in the theories of [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] in their development of the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic tradition of psychology]].&lt;ref name="PsychologyProfessor2001"/&gt;

Ideas similar to flow have been recognized throughout history and across cultures. The teachings of Buddhism and of Taoism speak of a state of mind known as the "action of inaction" or "doing without doing" (''[[wu wei]]'' in Taoism) that greatly resembles the idea of flow. Also, [[Hindu]] texts on Advaita philosophy such as Ashtavakra Gita and the Yoga of Knowledge such as Bhagavad-Gita refer to a similar state.

==Mechanism==
In any given moment, there is a great deal of information made available to each individual. Psychologists have found that one's mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a time. According to Csikszentmihályi's 2004 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk, that number is about "110 bits of information per second".&lt;ref name="lateralaction.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGuinness|first1=Mark|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihályi – Does Creativity Make You Happy?|url=http://lateralaction.com/articles/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/|website=Lateral Access|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of information. Just decoding speech takes about 60 bits of information per second.&lt;ref name="lateralaction.com"/&gt; That is why when having a conversation one cannot focus as much [[attention]] on other things.

For the most part (except for basic bodily feelings like hunger and pain, which are innate), people are able to decide what they want to focus their attention on. However, when one is in the flow state, they are completely engrossed with the one task at hand and, without making the conscious decision to do so, lose awareness of all other things: time, people, distractions, and even basic bodily needs. This occurs because all of the attention of the person in the flow state is on the task at hand; there is no more attention to be allocated.&lt;ref name="csi1988"&gt;{{citation |last=Csikszentmihályi |first=M. |editor-last=Csikszentmihályi |editor-first=M. |title= Optimal experience: psychological studies of flow in consciousness |chapter=The flow experience and its significance for human psychology |pages=15–35 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge, UK |year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNt6bdfoyxQC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=The%20flow%20experience%20and%20its%20significance%20for%20human%20psychology&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-521-43809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flow state has been described by Csikszentmihályi as the "optimal experience" in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experience.&lt;ref name=harper&amp;row&gt;{{cite web|last1=Csikszentmihályi|first1=Mihály|last2=Harper &amp; Row|title=FLOW: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|url=http://www.psy-flow.com/sites/psy-flow/files/docs/flow.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving this experience is considered to be personal and "depends on the ability" of the individual.&lt;ref name=harper&amp;row /&gt; One's capacity and desire to overcome challenges in order to achieve their ultimate goals not only leads to the optimal experience, but also to a sense of [[life satisfaction]] overall.&lt;ref name=harper&amp;row /&gt;

==Measurement==
There are three common ways to measure flow experiences: the flow questionnaire (FQ), the experience sampling method (ESM), and the "standardized scales of the componential approach".&lt;ref name="moneta2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advances in Flow Research|last = Moneta|first = Giovanni|publisher = Springer|year = 2012|isbn = 1461423589|location = New York|pages = |chapter = On the Measurement and Conceptualization of Flow|url = |editor-first = Stefan|editor-last = Engeser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow questionnaire===
The FQ requires individuals to identify definitions of flow and situations in which they believe that they have experienced flow, followed by a section that asks them to evaluate their personal experiences in these flow-inducing situations. The FQ identifies flow as multiple constructs, therefore allowing the results to be used to estimate differences in the likelihood of experiencing flow across a variety of factors. Another strength of the FQ is that it does not assume that everyone's flow experiences are the same. Because of this, the FQ is the ideal measure for estimating the prevalence of flow. However, the FQ has some weaknesses that more recent methods have set out to address. The FQ does not allow for measurement of the intensity of flow during specific activities. This method also does not measure the influence of the ratio of challenge to skill on the flow state.&lt;ref name="moneta2012" /&gt;

===Experience sampling method===
The ESM requires individuals to fill out the experience sampling form (ESF) at eight randomly chosen time intervals throughout the day. The purpose of this is to understand subjective experiences by estimating the time intervals that individuals spend in specific states during everyday life. The ESF is made up of 13 categorical items and 29 scaled items. The purpose of the categorical items is to determine the context and [[Motivation|motivational]] aspects of the current actions (these items include: time, location, companionship/desire for companionship, activity being performed, reason for performing activity). Because these questions are open-ended, the answers need to be coded by researchers. This needs to be done carefully so as to avoid any biases in the statistical analysis. The scaled items are intended to measure the levels of a variety of subjective feelings that the individual may be experiencing. The ESM is more complex than the FQ and contributes to the understanding of how flow plays out in a variety of situations, however the possible biases make it a risky choice.&lt;ref name="moneta2012" /&gt;

===Standardized scales===
Some researchers are not satisfied with the methods mentioned above and have set out to create their own scales. The scales developed by Jackson and Eklund are the most commonly used in research, mainly because they are still consistent with Csíkszentmihályi's definition of flow and consider flow as being both a state and a trait. Jackson and Eklund created two scales that have been proven to be psychometrically valid and reliable: the Flow State Scale-2 (which measures flow as a state) and the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (designed to measure flow as either a general trait or domain-specific trait). The statistical analysis of the individual results from these scales gives a much more complete understanding of flow than the ESM and the FQ.&lt;ref name="moneta2012" /&gt;

==Conditions==
{{Mental state}}
A flow state can be entered while performing any activity, although it is most likely to occur when one is wholeheartedly performing a task or activity for [[Motivation#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic purposes]].&lt;ref name="csi1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sl2007"&gt;{{citation |last1=Snyder |first1=C.R. |last2=Lopez |first2=S.J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Positive psychology: The scientific and practical explorations of human strengths |publisher=Sage Publications |place=London, UK |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive activities like taking a bath or even watching TV usually do not elicit flow experiences as individuals have to actively do something to enter a flow state.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihályi, M., Larson, R., &amp; Prescott, S. (1977). The ecology of adolescent activity and experience. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 6'', 281-294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delle Fave, A., &amp; Bassi, M. (2000). The quality of experience in adolescents' daily lives: Developmental perspectives. ''Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 126'', 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt; While the activities that induce flow may vary and be multifaceted, Csikszentmihályi asserts that the experience of flow is similar despite the activity.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihayli, M. (2000). Happiness, flow, and economic equality. "American Psychologist, 55" 1163-1164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve a flow state:
# One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.&lt;ref name="can2005"&gt;{{citation |last1=Csikszentmihályi |first1=M. |last2=Abuhamdeh |first2=S. |last3=Nakamura |first3=J. |lastauthoramp=yes |editor-last=Elliot |editor-first=A. |title=Handbook of Competence and Motivation |chapter=Flow |pages=598–698 |publisher=The Guilford Press |place=New York |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their performance to maintain the flow state.&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt;
# One must have a good balance between the ''perceived'' challenges of the task at hand and their own ''perceived'' skills. One must have confidence in one's ability to complete the task at hand.&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt;

However, it was argued that the antecedent factors of flow are interrelated, as a perceived balance between challenges and skills requires that one knows what he or she has to do (clear goals) and how successful he or she is in doing it (immediate feedback). Thus, a perceived fit of skills and task demands can be identified as the central precondition of flow experiences.&lt;ref name="Keller2012"&gt;Keller, J., &amp; Landhäußer, A. (2012). The flow model revisited. In S. Engeser (Ed.), ''Advances in flow research'' (pp. 51-64). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Massimini, Csíkszentmihályi and Carli published the 8-channel model of flow shown here.&lt;ref&gt;Massimini, F., Csikszentmihályi, M., &amp; Carli, M. (1987). The monitoring of optimal experience: A tool for psychiatric rehabilitation. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 175(9), 545-549. doi:10.1097/00005053-198709000-00006&lt;/ref&gt; Antonella Delle Fave, who worked with Fausto Massimini at the University of Milan, now calls this graph the Experience Fluctuation Model.&lt;ref&gt;Delle Fave, A., Massimini, F., &amp; Bassi, M. (2011). Psychological selection and optimal experience across cultures: Social empowerment through personal growth (Vol. 2). Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; The Experience Fluctuation Model depicts the channels of experience that result from different levels of perceived challenges and perceived skills. This graph illustrates one further aspect of flow: it is more likely to occur when the activity at hand is a higher-than-average challenge (above the center point) and the individual has above-average skills (to the right of the center point).&lt;ref name="csi1988"/&gt; The center of this graph (where the sectors meet) represents one's average levels of challenge and skill across all activities an individual performs during their daily life. The further from the center an experience is, the greater the intensity of that state of being (whether it is flow or anxiety or boredom or relaxation).&lt;ref name="sl2007"/&gt;

Several problems of this model have been discussed in literature.&lt;ref name="Keller2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moneta, G. B. (2012). On the measurement and conceptualization of flow. In S. Engeser (Ed.), ''Advances in flow research'' (pp. 23-50). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; One is that it does not ensure a perceived balance between challenges and skills which is supposed to be the central precondition of flow experiences. Individuals with a low average level of skills and a high average level of challenges (or the other way round) do not necessarily experience a fit between skills and challenges when both are above their individual average.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, G. D., Voelkl, J. E., &amp; Morris, C. (1994). Measurement and analysis issues with explanation of variance in daily experience using the flow model. ''Journal of Leisure Research, 26'', 337.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one study found that low challenge situations which were surpassed by skill were associated with enjoyment, relaxation, and happiness, which, they claim, is contrary to flow theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haworth|first=John|author2=Stephen Evans|title=Challenge, skill and positive subjective states in the daily life of a sample of YTS students.|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|date=June 1995|volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=109–121|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8325.1995.tb00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaffer (2013) proposed 7 flow conditions:
#Knowing what to do
#Knowing how to do it
#Knowing how well you are doing
#Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved)
#High perceived challenges
#High perceived skills
#Freedom from distractions&lt;ref name="Schaffer_2013"&gt;{{Citation |first=Owen |last=Schaffer |year=2013 |title=Crafting Fun User Experiences: A Method to Facilitate Flow |publisher=Human Factors International |url=http://humanfactors.com/funexperiences.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaffer also published a measure, the Flow Condition Questionnaire (FCQ), to measure each of these 7 flow conditions for any given task or activity.&lt;ref name="Schaffer_2013"/&gt;

===Challenges to staying===
Some of the challenges to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxiety. Being in a state of apathy is characterized when challenges are low and one's skill level is low producing a general lack of interest in the task at hand. Boredom is a slightly different state in that it occurs when challenges are low, but one's skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges. Lastly, a state of anxiety occurs when challenges are so high that they exceed one's perceived skill level causing one great distress and uneasiness. These states in general differ from being in a state of flow, in that flow occurs when challenges match one's skill level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Jeanne|author2=Csikszentmihályi|title=The concept of flow|journal=Handbook of Positive Psychology|year=2005|pages=89–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Csíkszentmihályi has said, "If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills."&lt;ref name="kendracherry" /&gt;

===The autotelic personality===
Csíkszentmihályi hypothesized that people with several very specific personality traits may be better able to achieve flow more often than the average person. These personality traits include curiosity, persistence, low self-centeredness, and a high rate of performing activities for intrinsic reasons only. People with most of these personality traits are said to have an ''[[autotelic]] personality''.&lt;ref name="sl2007"/&gt; The term “autotelic” is acquired from two Greek words, ''auto'', meaning self, and ''telos'' meaning goal. Being Autotelic means having a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply to experience it as the main goal.&lt;ref name="CWilson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meloncelli |first=C Wilson |title=The Autotelic Personality - Finding Happiness in Flow |url=https://www.cwilsonmeloncelli.com/the-autotelic-personality-finding-happiness-in-flow/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, there is not much research on the ''[[autotelic]] personality'', but results of the few studies that have been conducted suggest that indeed some people are more prone to experience flow than others. One researcher (Abuhamdeh, 2000) found that people with an autotelic personality have a greater preference for "high-action-opportunity, high-skills situations that stimulate them and encourage growth" compared to those without an autotelic personality.&lt;ref name="sl2007"/&gt; It is in such high-challenge, high-skills situations that people are most likely to enter the flow state.

Experimental evidence shows that a balance between skills of the individual and demands of the task (compared to boredom and overload) only elicits flow experiences in individuals characterized by an internal [[locus of control]]&lt;ref&gt;Keller, J., &amp; Blomann, F. (2008). Locus of control and the flow experience. An experimental analyses.

Flow and regulatory compatibility: An experimental approach to flow model of intrinsic motivation. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34'', 196-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Several correlational studies found [[need for achievement]] to be a personal characteristic that fosters flow experiences.&lt;ref name="enge2008"&gt;Engeser, S., &amp; Rheinberg, F.

Flow experiences at work: for high need achievers alone? ''Journal of Organizational Behavior, 26'', 755-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group==
{{see also|Crowd psychology}}

Group flow is notably different from independent flow as it is inherently mutual.  Group flow is attainable when the performance unit is a group, such as a team or musical group.  When groups cooperate to agree on goals and patterns, social flow, commonly known as group cohesion, is much more likely to occur.  If a group still has not entered flow, a team-level challenge may stimulate the group to harmonize.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C. J. (2010). Experiencing flow: Is doing it together better than doing it alone?, "The Journal of Positive Psychology, 5," 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Applications suggested by Csíkszentmihályi versus other practitioners===
Only Csíkszentmihályi seems to have published suggestions for [[extrinsic]] applications of the flow concept, such as [[design]] methods for playgrounds to elicit the flow experience. Other practitioners of Csíkszentmihályi's flow concept focus on [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] applications, such as [[spirituality]], [[performance improvement]], or [[self-help]]. His work has also informed the measurement of donor momentum by The New Science of Philanthropy.

===Education===
[[File:South-Goodwin.jpg|thumb|250px|Young child, painting a model]]
In [[education]], the concept of [[overlearning]] plays a role in a student's ability to achieve flow. Csíkszentmihályi&lt;ref name="CM1990"&gt;{{Citation |last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály |title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience |publisher=[[Harper and Row]] |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-06-092043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that overlearning enables the mind to concentrate on visualizing the desired performance as a singular, integrated action instead of a set of actions. Challenging assignments that (slightly) stretch one's skills lead to flow.&lt;ref name="PP11"&gt;{{citation |last=Snyder |first= C.R. |authorlink=C. R. Snyder |last2=Lopez |first2=Shane J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Positive Psychology |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc. |year=2007 |chapter=11 |isbn=0-7619-2633-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s British cybernetician Gordon Pask designed an adaptive teaching machine called SAKI, an early example of "e-learning". The machine is discussed in some detail in Stafford Beer's book "Cybernetics and Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Stafford|title=Cybernetics and Management|publisher=The English Universities Press|isbn=978-0340045947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the patent application for SAKI (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pask|first1=Gordon|title=US patent 2984017 A: Apparatus for assisting an operator in performing a skill|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2984017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pask's comments (some of which are included below) indicate an awareness of the pedagogical importance of balancing student competence with didactic challenge, which is quite consistent with flow theory:

{{quote|If the operator is receiving data at too slow a rate, he is likely to become bored and attend to other irrelevant data.

If the data given indicates too precisely what responses the operator is required to make, the skill becomes too easy to perform and the operator again tends to become bored.

If the data given is too complicated or is given at too great a rate, the operator is unable to deal with it. He is then liable to become discouraged and lose interest in performing or learning the skill.

Ideally, for an operator to perform a skill efficiently, the data presented to him should always be of sufficient complexity to maintain his interest and maintain a competitive situation, but not so complex as to discourage the operator. Similarly these conditions should obtain at each stage of a learning process if it is to be efficient. A tutor teaching one pupil seeks to maintain just these conditions.}}

Around 2000, it came to the attention of Csíkszentmihályi that the principles and practices of the [[Montessori Method]] of education seemed to purposefully set up continuous flow opportunities and experiences for students. Csíkszentmihályi and psychologist Kevin Rathunde embarked on a multi-year study of student experiences in Montessori settings and traditional educational settings. The research supported observations that students achieved flow experiences more frequently in Montessori settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Rathunde |first1=K. |last2=Csikszetnmihályi |first2=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=American Journal of Education |title=Middle school students' motivation and quality of experience: A comparison of Montessori and traditional school environments |issue=3 |volume=111 |pages=341–371 |year=2005 |doi=10.1086/428885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Rathunde |first1=K. |last2=Csikszentmihályi |first2=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The social context of middle school: Teachers, friends, and activities in Montessori and traditional school environments |journal=Elementary School Journal |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=59–79 |year=2005 |doi=10.1086/496907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Rathunde |first1=K. |last2=Csikszentmihályi |first2=M. |title=The developing person: An experiential perspective |editor1-first=R.M. |editor1-last=Lerner (ed.) |editor2-first=W. |editor2-last=Damon (series ed.) |series=Handbook of Child Psychology |booktitle=Theoretical models of human development |issue=1 |edition=6 |place=New York |publisher=Wiley |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Musicians, especially [[improvisation]]al [[solo (music)|soloists]], may experience a state of flow while playing their instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Parncutt |first1=Richard |last2=McPherson |first2=Gary E. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Science &amp; Psychology of Music Performance: Creative Strategies for Teaching and Learning Book |publisher=Oxford University Press US |page=119 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NCySp2NzAm8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=improvisation+flow+Cs%C3%ADkszentmih%C3%A1lyi |accessdate=2009-02-07 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-513810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research has shown that performers in a flow state have a heightened quality of performance as opposed to when they are not in a flow state. In a study performed with professional classical pianists who played piano pieces several times to induce a flow state, a significant relationship was found between the flow state of the pianist and the pianist's heart rate, blood pressure, and major facial muscles. As the pianist entered the flow state, heart rate and blood pressure decreased and the major facial muscles relaxed. This study further emphasized that flow is a state of effortless attention. In spite of the effortless attention and overall relaxation of the body, the performance of the pianist during the flow state improved.&lt;ref name="de ManzanoTheorell2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Manzano|first1=Örjan|last2=Theorell|first2=Töres|last3=Harmat|first3=László|last4=Ullén|first4=Fredrik|title=The psychophysiology of flow during piano playing.|journal=Emotion|volume=10|issue=3|year=2010|pages=301–311|issn=1931-1516|doi=10.1037/a0018432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of drummers experience a state of flow when they sense a collective energy that drives the beat, something they refer to as ''getting into the groove'' or [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment]]. Likewise drummers and bass guitarists often describe a state of flow when they are feeling the downbeat together as being ''in the pocket.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drummercafe.com/education/articles/in-the-pocket.html|title=In The Pocket|website=www.drummercafe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
[[File:Concentration.jpg|thumb|left|Flow may occur in challenging sports such as [[eventing]].]]
The concept of ''being in the zone'' during an athletic performance fits within Csíkszentmihályi's description of the flow experience, and theories and applications of ''being in the zone'' and its relationship with athletic competitive advantage are topics studied in the field of [[sport psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Janet A. |last1=Young |first2=Michelle D. |last2=Pain |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Zone: Evidence of a Universal Phenomenon for Athletes Across Sports |work=Athletic Insight |url=http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol1Iss3/Empirical_Zone.htm |accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Gallwey]]'s influential works on the "inner game" of sports such as [[golf]] and [[tennis]] described the mental coaching and attitudes required to "get in the zone" and fully internalize mastery of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Inner Tennis&amp;nbsp;— Playing the Game |year=1976 |author=Timothy Galwey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Palmer suggests that "being in the zone" may also influence movement patterns as better integration of the conscious and subconscious reflex functions improves coordination. Many athletes describe the effortless nature of their performance while achieving personal bests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Running in the Zone  A Handbook for Seasoned Athletes|last=King|first=Steve|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1412068576|location=Victoria, BC Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/7223/|title=Being in the zone : notions of agency in athletic performance|last=Abigail|first=Locke,|date=2001-02-01|website=eprints.hud.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2015/05/21/stephen-curry-mvp-golden-state-warriors-sports-illustrated-nba-playoffs|title=No one gets hotter faster than the NBA's lights-out MVP|last=Jenkins|first=Lee|website=www.si.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[martial arts]], the term [[Budō]] is used to describe psychological flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henderson|first1=Shihan|title=Finding Your Inner Master – Kigatsuku|url=http://www.i-budo.com/zen-kata/|website=International Budo Institute|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mixed martial arts]] champion and [[Karate]] master [[Lyoto Machida]] uses meditation techniques before fights to attain [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]], a concept that, by his description, is in all respects equal to flow.

The [[Formula One]] driver [[Ayrton Senna]], during qualifying for the [[1988 Monaco Grand Prix]], explained: "I was already on pole, [...] and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car. And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Ayrton Senna at Monaco (1988)|year=2012 |author=Gerald Donaldson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|500 GP]] rider [[Wayne Gardner]] talking about his victory at the [[1990 Australian motorcycle Grand Prix|1990 Australian Grand Prix]] on ''The Unrideables 2'' documentary said: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;During these last five laps I had this sort of above body experience where actually raised up above and I could see myself racing. It was kind of a remote control and it's the weirdest thing I've ever had in my life. [...] After the race [[Mick Doohan|Mick [Doohan]]] and in fact [[Wayne Rainey]] said: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;How the hell did you do that?&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and I said: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;I have no idea.'&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/92724437#t=1212s|title=The Unrideables 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and spirituality===
Csíkszentmihályi may have been the first to describe this concept in Western [[psychology]], he was most certainly not the first to quantify the concept of flow or develop applications based on the concept.

For millennia, practitioners of [[East Asian religions|Eastern religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and later in [[Sufism]] have honed the discipline of overcoming the duality of self and object as a central feature of spiritual development. Eastern spiritual practitioners have developed a very thorough and holistic set of theories around overcoming duality of self and object, tested and refined through spiritual practice instead of the systematic rigor and controls of modern science.

Csíkszentmihályi's flow concept relates to the idea of being at one with things or as psychology expert, Kendra Cherry, describes it: "complete immersion in an activity".&lt;ref name="kendracherry" /&gt; Practitioners of the varied schools of [[Zen Buddhism]] apply concepts similar to flow to aid their mastery of [[art]] forms, including, in the case of Japanese Zen Buddhism, [[Aikido]], [[Cheng Hsin]], [[Judo]],  [[Honkyoku]], [[Kendo]] and [[Ikebana]]. In [[Yoga|yogic]] traditions such as [[Raja Yoga]], reference is made to a state of ''flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yoga Sutras 3.9-3.16: Witnessing Subtle Transitions with Samyama |url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-30916.htm|publisher=Swamij.com|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the practice of [[Samyama]], a psychological absorption in the object of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink=J. Nigro Sansonese |last=Sansonese |first=J. Nigro |title=The Body of Myth: Mythology, Shamanic Trance, and the Sacred Geography of the Body |page=26 |year=1994 |publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-0-89281-409-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUZBqTKTAfIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=samyama+japan+koan |accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theravada Buddhism]] refers to "access concentration", which is a state of flow achieved through meditation and used to further strengthen concentration into [[jhana]], and/or to develop [[vipassana|insight]].

In [[Sufi]] [[Islam]], the first mental state that precedes human action is known as jila al-khatir, which roughly translates to 'cleansing the heart'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Jilani|first1=Shaikh ‘Abd Al-Qadir|title=Purification of the Mind|url=http://www.quranicstudies.com/books/purification-of-the-mind/|website=Quranic Studies|publisher=Luna Plena|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}

===Games and Gaming===

Flow in [[game]]s and gaming has been linked to the [[Laws of learning|Laws of Learning]] as part of the explanation for why learning-games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) have the potential to be effective.&lt;ref name="WhyGamesWorkAndTheScienceOfLearning"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Curtiss |title=Why Games Work and the Science of Learning |url=http://www.goodgamesbydesign.com/?p=59 |accessdate=2011-07-25 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, flow is intrinsically motivating, which is part of the Law of [[Laws of learning|Readiness]]. The condition of feedback, required for flow, is associated with the feedback aspects of the Law of [[Laws of learning|Exercise]]. This is exhibited in well designed games, in particular, where players perform at the edge of their competency as they are guided by clear goals and feedback.&lt;ref name="Drpamelarutledge"/&gt; The positive emotions associated with flow are associated with the Law of [[Laws of learning|Effect]]. The intense experiences of being in a state of flow are directly associated with the Law of [[Laws of learning|Intensity]]. Thus, the experience of gaming can be so engaging and motivating as it meets many of the Laws of Learning, which are inextricably connected to creating flow.

In games often much can be achieved thematically through an imbalance between challenge level and skill level.  Horror games often keep challenges significantly above the player's level of competency in order to foster a continuous feeling of anxiety.  Conversely, so called "relaxation games" keep the level of challenges significantly below the player's competency level, in order to achieve a similar but opposite effect.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The video game [[Flow (video game)|Flow]] was designed as part of [[Jenova Chen]]'s master's thesis for exploring the design decisions that allow players to achieve the flow state, by adjusting the difficulty dynamically during play.&lt;ref name="JSint"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Ross |title=Joystiq interview: Jenova Chen |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/18/joystiq-qanda-jenova-chen/ |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=2011-01-05 |date=2006-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102012220/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/18/joystiq-qanda-jenova-chen/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It improves performance; calling the phenomenon "TV trance", a 1981 ''[[BYTE]]'' article discussed how "the best seem to enter a trance where they play but don't pay attention to the details of the game".&lt;ref name="smith198112"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n279/mode/2up | title=The Game of Left/Right | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=29 January 2015 | author=Smith, Truck | pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of games is to create entertainment through [[Motivation#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]], which is related to flow; that is, without intrinsic motivation it is virtually impossible to establish flow.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;Paul Benjamin Lowry, James Gaskin, Nathan W. Twyman, Bryan Hammer, and Tom L. Roberts (2013). "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2177442 Taking 'fun and games' seriously: Proposing the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM)]," Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), vol. 14(11), 617–671.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the balance of skill and challenge the player's brain is aroused, with attention engaged and motivation high.&lt;ref name="Drpamelarutledge"&gt;{{cite web|last=Drpamelarutledge|title=The Positive Side of Video Games: Part III|url=http://en.paperblog.com/the-positive-side-of-video-games-part-iii-294723/|publisher=paper blog|accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the use of flow in games helps foster an enjoyable experience which in turn increases motivation and draws players to continue playing. As such, game designers strive to integrate flow principles into their projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=J. |title=Flow in Games |url=http://www.jenovachen.com/flowingames/introduction.htm |accessdate=2008-05-16 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the experience of play is fluid and is intrinsically psychologically rewarding independent of scores or in-game successes in the flow state.&lt;ref name="Drpamelarutledge"/&gt;

===Design of intrinsically motivated computer systems===
A simplified modification to flow has been combined with the [[technology acceptance model]] (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systems. This model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is model to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA). The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden's (2004) model of hedonic system adoption&lt;ref&gt;Hans Van der Heijden (2004) User Acceptance of Hedonic Information Systems, MIS Quarterly, vol. 28(4), pp. 695-704&lt;/ref&gt; by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems. Typically, models simplistically represent "intrinsic motivations" by mere perceived enjoyed. Instead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociation. CA is construct that is grounded in the seminal flow literature, yet CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time—in direct contradiction to the flow literature. Thus, part of HMSAM's contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow. Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; when developing in an undistracted state. Stock market operators often use the term "in the pipe" to describe the psychological state of flow when trading during high volume days and market corrections. Professional [[poker]] players use the term "playing the A-game" when referring to the state of highest concentration and strategical awareness, while [[pool (cue sports)|pool]] players often call the state being in "dead stroke".

===In the workplace===
Conditions of flow, defined as a state in which challenges and skills are equally matched, play an extremely important role in the workplace. Because flow is associated with achievement, its development could have concrete implications in increasing workplace satisfaction and accomplishment. Flow researchers, such as Csikszentmihályi, believe that certain interventions may be performed to enhance and increase flow in the workplace, through which people would gain 'intrinsic rewards that encourage persistence" and provide benefits. In his consultation work, Csikszentmihályi emphasizes finding activities and environments that are conducive to flow, and then identifying and developing personal characteristics to increase experiences of flow. Applying these methods in the workplace, can improve morale by fostering a sense of greater happiness and accomplishment, which may be correlated with increased performance. In his review of Mihály Csikszentmihályi's book "Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning," Coert Visser introduces the ideas presented by Csikszentmihályi, including  "good work" in which one "enjoys doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself."&lt;ref name="Visser_2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Visser|first=Coert|title=Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning|url=http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110043540/http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then provides tools by which managers and employees can create an atmosphere that encourages good work. Some consultants suggest that the experience sampling form (EMS) method be used for individuals and teams in the workplace in order to identify how time is currently being spent, and where focus should be redirected to in order to increase flow experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Positive Psychology Principles Applied to Consulting Psychology at the Individual and Group Level|last = Foster|first = Sandra|date = 2007|journal = Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Lloyd|first2 = Paul|pages = 30–40|volume = 59|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to achieve flow, Csikszentmihályi lays out the following three conditions:
# Goals are clear
# Feedback is immediate
# A balance between opportunity and capacity

Csikszentmihályi argues that with increased experiences of flow, people experience "growth towards complexity". People flourish as their achievements grow and with that comes development of increasing "emotional, cognitive, and social complexity."&lt;ref name="Visser_2007"/&gt; Creating a workplace atmosphere that allows for flow and growth, Csikszentmihályi argues, can increase the happiness and achievement of employees. An increasingly popular way of promoting greater flow in the workplace is using [[Serious Play]] facilitation methods. Some commercial organisations have used the concept of flow in building corporate branding and identity for example [[The Floow Limited]] which created its company brand from the concept.

===Barriers===
There are, however, barriers to achieving flow in the workplace. In his chapter "Why Flow Doesn't Happen on the Job," Csikszentmihályi argues the first reason that flow does not occur is that the goals of one's job are not clear. He explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits it. Second, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job.  When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flow.

In the study "Predicting flow at work: Investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work", Karina Nielsen and Bryan Cleal used a 9- item flow scale to examine predictors of flow at two levels: activity level (such as brainstorming, problem solving, and evaluation) and at a more stable level (such as role clarity, influence, and cognitive demands). They found that activities such as planning, problem solving, and evaluation predicted transient flow states, but that more stable job characteristics were not found to predict flow at work. This study can help us identify which task at work can be cultivated and emphasized in order to help employees experience flow on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Karina |last1=Nielsen |first2=Bryan |last2=Cleal|title=Predicting flow at work: investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date=April 2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=180–90|doi=10.1037/a0018893|pmid=20364915}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her article in ''Positive Psychology News Daily'', Kathryn Britton examines the importance of experiencing flow in the workplace beyond the individual benefits it creates. She writes, "Flow isn't just valuable to individuals; it also contributes to organizational goals. For example, frequent experiences of flow at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development (Csikszentmihályi, 1991, 2004). So finding ways to increase the frequency of flow experiences can be one way for people to work together to increase the effectiveness of their workplaces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britton|first=Kathryn|title=Flowing Together|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/kathryn-britton/200809071013|work=Positive Psychology News Daily|date=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Positive experiences===
Books by Csikszentmihályi suggest that enhancing the time spent in flow makes our lives more happy and successful. Flow experiences are predicated to lead to positive affect as well as to better performance.&lt;ref name="CM1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csik1990"&gt;Csikszentmihályi, M. (1997). ''Finding flow. The psychology of engagement with everyday life.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, delinquent behavior was reduced in adolescents after two years of enhancing flow through activities.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, J., &amp; Csikszentmihályi, M. (year). The concept of flow. In Handbook of positive psychology (89-105).  New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

People who have experienced flow, describe the following feelings:
# Completely involved in what we are doing - focused, concentrated.
# A sense of ecstasy - of being outside everyday reality.
# Great inner clarity - knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.
# Knowing that the activity is doable - that our skills are adequate to the task.
# A sense of serenity - no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.
# Timelessness - thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by the minute.
# Intrinsic motivation - whatever produces flow becomes it own reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|title=Flow, the secret to happiness|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow#t-883527|language=en|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, further empirical evidence is required to substantiate these preliminary indications, as flow researchers continue to explore the problem of how to directly investigate causal consequences of flow experiences using modern scientific instrumentation to observe the neuro-physiological correlates of the flow state.&lt;ref name="land2012"&gt;Landhäußer, A., &amp; Keller, J. (2012). Flow and its affective, cognitive, and performance-related consequences. In S. Engeser (Ed.), ''Advances in flow research'' (pp.65-86). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive affect and life satisfaction====
Flow is an innately positive experience; it is known to "produce intense feelings of enjoyment".&lt;ref name="csi1988"/&gt;  An experience that is so enjoyable should lead to positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[happiness]] in the long run. Also, Csikszentmihályi stated that happiness is derived from personal development and growth&amp;nbsp;– and flow situations permit the experience of personal development.&lt;ref name="csik1990"/&gt;

Several studies found that flow experiences and positive affect go hand in hand,&lt;ref name="schue2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberg, F., Manig, Y., Kliegl, R., Engeser, S., &amp; Vollmeyer, R. (2007). Flow bei der Arbeit, doch Glück in der Freizeit. Zielausrichtung, Flow und Glücksgefühle [Flow during work but happiness during leisure time: goals, flow-experience, and happiness]. ''Zeitschrift für Arbeits- und Organisationspsychologie, 51'', 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt; and that challenges and skills above the individual's average foster positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, S. G., &amp; Haworth, J. T. (1994). "Flow" experience in the daily lives of sixth-form college students. ''British Journal of Psychology, 85'', 511-523.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massimini, F., &amp; Carli, M. (1988). The systematic  assessment of flow in daily experience. In M. Csikszentmihályi &amp; I. S. Csikszentmihályi (Eds.), ''Optimal experience: Psychological studies of flow in consciousness'' (pp. 288-306). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shernoff, D. J., Csikszentmihályi, M., Schneider, B., &amp; Shernoff, E. S. (2003). Student engagement in High School classrooms from the perspective of flow theory. ''School Psychology Quarterly, 18'', 158-176.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the causal processes underlying those relationships remains unclear at present.

====Performance and learning====
Flow experiences imply a growth principle. When one is in a flow state, he or she is working to master the activity at hand. To maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challenges. Attempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one's skills. One emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great "feelings of competence and efficacy".&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt; By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning also increases.&lt;ref&gt;Hektner, J.M. &amp; Csikszentmihályi, M. (1996). A longitudinal exploration of flow an intrinsic motivation in adolescents. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American education research association, New York. Alfred Sloan Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; teaching,&lt;ref&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; learning,&lt;ref&gt;Csíkszentmihályi et al., 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and sports;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Thomas, Marsh, &amp; Smethurst, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Kimiecik, Daniels, &amp; Jackson, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow has been linked to persistence and achievement in activities while also helping to lower anxiety during various activities and raise self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, J., &amp; Csikszentmihályi, M. (2014). The concept of flow. "Handbook of positive psychology," 89-105.  New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evidence regarding better performance in flow situations is mixed.&lt;ref name="land2012"/&gt; For sure, the association between the two is a reciprocal one. That is, flow experiences may foster better performance but, on the other hand, good performance makes flow experiences more likely. Results of a longitudinal study in the academic context indicate that the causal effect of flow on performance is only of small magnitude and the strong relationship between the two is driven by an effect of performance on flow.&lt;ref name="enge2008"/&gt;
In the long run, flow experiences in a specific activity may lead to higher performance in that activity as flow is positively correlated with a higher subsequent motivation to perform and to perform well.&lt;ref name="can2005"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Csikszentmihályi writes about the dangers of flow himself: &lt;blockquote&gt;...enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative effect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Further, he writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The flow experience, like everything else, is not "good" in an absolute sense. It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strengths and complexity of the self. But whether the consequence of any particular instance of flow is good in a larger sense needs to be discussed and evaluated in terms of more inclusive social criteria.&lt;ref name="Csikszentmihályi2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mihály Csikszentmihályi |title=Flow: The Psychology of Happiness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qLWNQAACAAJ |accessdate=25 October 2015 |year=1992 |publisher=Rider |isbn=0-7126-5477-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

|issn= 0022-0418
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intellectually, it was based on the close relationship between the library and the teaching departments.  The library at UCL rejected the major published classification schemes because "none of them would generally acceptable to the teaching departments without such major modifications as would have destroyed its essential character."&lt;ref name="Garside1955" /&gt;
instead, it was modeled around the "subject reading rooms" into which the collection had been divided.  The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme.

==Main outline==

The principles of the scheme were "To provide the optimum arrangement of books in each subject; to permit the revision of the classification to meet a changing academic approach to a subject without disturbing in any way other parts of the scheme; and to provide as simple a shelf mark as possible to help the reader find the book he wants with the minimum mental effort." &lt;ref name=Folklore&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article ''The basic principles of the new library classification at University College London''&lt;ref name="Garside1955" /&gt; Garside set out the generic structure of the system.  The library would be divided into subject based reading rooms such as, in the below example, a dedicated space for biology related materials. These would then be subdivided according to the below table, using alphabetical characters:
{|border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|A
|The subject generally
|-
|B-W
|Main sections of the subject
|-
|X-Y
|Subsidiary works studied in conjunction with the main topic
|-
|Z
|Works not properly belonging to the subject but required to be shelved with it
|}

The alphabetical sub-divisions were designed in consultation with the teaching department.&lt;ref name=Folklore /&gt;
These subsections would then be divided by numbers:
{|border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|1
|Bibliographies
|-
|2
|Reference works
|-
|3
|Periodicals and series

|Miscellanies
|-
|7
|Monographs
|-
|8
|History of the subject
|-
|9
|Methodology
|-
|10 &gt;
|Special topics
|}

The completed shelf mark would then include the first three letters of the author's surname.

==Subject sequence==

In order to provide for a single subject card catalogue, Garside added a further table to which the top reading room divisions could be mapped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2320">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gompertz constant''' or '''Euler-Gompertz constant''', denoted by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, appears in integral evaluations and as a value of [[special function]]s. It is named after [[Benjamin Gompertz|B. Gompertz]].

It can be defined by the [[continued fraction]]

: &lt;math&gt; G = \frac{1}{2-\frac{1}{4-\frac{4}{6-\frac{9}{8-\frac{16}{10-\frac{25}{12-\frac{36}{14-\frac{49}{16-\dots}}}}}}}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

or, alternatively, by

: &lt;math&gt; G = \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{2}{1+\frac{2}{1+\frac{3}{1+\frac{3}{1+4 \frac{1}{1+\dots}}}}}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The most frequent appearance of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is in the following integrals:
: &lt;math&gt; G = \int_0^\infty\ln(1+x)e^{-x}dx=\int_0^\infty\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}dx=\int_0^1\frac{1}{1-\log(x)}dx. &lt;/math&gt;

The numerical value of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is about
: &lt;math&gt; G = 0.596347362323194074341078499369279376074\dots &lt;/math&gt;

During the studying divergent infinite series Euler met with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; via, for example, the above integral representations. [[François Le Lionnais|Le Lionnais]] called &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as Gompertz constant by its role in [[Gompertz function|survival analysis]].&lt;ref name=Finch/&gt;

==Identities involving the Gompertz constant==

The constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed by the [[exponential integral]] as

: &lt;math&gt; G = -e\textrm{Ei}(-1). &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the Taylor expansion of &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Ei}&lt;/math&gt; we have that

: &lt;math&gt; G = -e\left(\gamma+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n\cdot n!}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Gompertz's constant is connected to the [[Gregory coefficients]] via the 2013 formula of I. Mező:&lt;ref name='Mezo'&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mező | first = István| title = Gompertz constant, Gregory coefficients and a series of the logarithm function | journal = Journal of Analysis and Number Theory | year = 2013 | issue = 7 | pages = 1–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; G = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\ln(n+1)}{n!}-\sum_{n=0}^\infty C_{n+1}\{e\cdot n!\}-\frac{1}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Indian Rationalist Association''' is a voluntary organisation in India whose 100,000 members&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;Bedi, Rahul. "[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0713/1224250543047.html Rationalists seek to prove holy men's power not so 'divine' after all]." ''The Irish Times.'' 2009-07-13. Retrieved on 15 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; promote [[scientific skepticism]] and critique supernatural claims. It publishes books and magazines, organises seminars and lectures and its representatives regularly appear in television and print media exposing superstitions.

The Indian Rationalist Association was founded in 1949&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/20/weekinreview/may-13-19-fear-itself.html 13-19 May; Fear Itself]" ''The New York Times'', 2001-05-20. Retrieved on 15 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Chennai]] (then [[Madras]]). The founding president was [[R.P. Paranjpye]] (later [[High Commissioner]] of India in [[Australia]] and vice-chancellor of [[Bombay University]]). [[Sanal Edamaruku]], well-known broadcaster and author, became its president in 2005.

The Indian Rationalist Association has branches in different states of India, with the headquarters of the association located in [[New Delhi]]. The Indian Rationalist Association took the initiative to form the [[Rationalist International]] in 1995 and organised three International Rationalist Conferences in co-operation with it.

==History==

The association was founded in 1949&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; by [[R.P. Paranjpye]].

The [[Divine Miracle Exposure Campaign]] conducted across India during the period 1975-76 had given unprecedented popularity for the rationalist movement. Organized rationalist associations came up in each and every State and each of the State units got affiliated to IRA as parent body of rationalists and atheists in the Country.

[[Jyothi Shankar]] dedicated his work for more than three decades to build IRA as a powerful movement to spread scientific attitude and to live life freed from superstitious belief. He left for Canada on domestic and personal grounds around the time that [[Joseph Edamaruku]], a staunch rationalist activist and writer of atheist literature, was made one of the Vice-Presidents of IRA. Edamaruku along with his family had already shifted from his home town at Kottayam in Kerala to New Delhi and settled there. Edamaruku vented his strong desire to shift the headquarters of IRA to New Delhi, the capital city of India. Since there were no responsible activists available in Madras at that point of time to look after the affairs of IRA, his request was conceded and the headquarters of IRA thus became the residence of Edamaurku clan at Delhi.

Soon after the event, [[Joseph Edamaruku]] came down to Madras and shifted the [[Ramanathan Library]] with its precious collection of books and periodicals to his residential house in Delhi.

Joseph Edamaruku became the President of the Association. After his death in 2005, his son [[Sanal Edamaruku]] took over the role.

==Activities==

'''Inscape''' and '''instress''' are complementary concepts about individuality and uniqueness derived by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] from the ideas of the medieval philosopher [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="Chevigny"&gt;Chevigny, Bell Gale. Instress and Devotion in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins ''Victorian Studies'' Vol. 9, No. 2 (Dec., 1965), pp. 141-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Hopkins] felt that everything in the universe was characterized by what he called ''inscape'', the distinctive design that constitutes individual identity. This identity is not static but dynamic. Each being in the universe 'selves,' that is, enacts its identity. And the human being, the most highly selved, the most individually distinctive being in the universe, recognizes the inscape of other beings in an act that Hopkins calls ''instress'', the apprehension of an object in an intense thrust of energy toward it that enables one to realize specific distinctiveness. Ultimately, the instress of inscape leads one to Christ, for the individual identity of any object is the stamp of divine creation on it.&lt;ref name="Greenblatt"&gt;Stephen Greenblatt et al., Ed. "Gerard Manley Hopkins." ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature.'' 8th ed. Vol. 2. New York, London: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], 2006. pg. 2159 &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is related to a logocentric theology and the [[Imago Dei]]. A logocentric theology of creation is based on correlation of the Genesis account and John 1. Since all creation is by the Word (divine fiat) human identity in God's image is grounded in God's speech and no two creation words are ever spoken alike.{{efn|While it is true that "logos" also means "word" in the conventional sense of "speech", in John it refers. not to the "divine fiat" ("Let there be Light" etc.), but to Christ as the second person of the Trinity. As the first quotation from the Norton Anthology states: "Ultimately, the inscape of instress leads one to Christ".&lt;ref name="Greenblatt"/&gt;}} This idea is reflected by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who compares the Creator to a perfect prism and creation to the refraction of perfect light. Tolkien writes,

:'Dear Sir,' I said – 'Although now long estranged,
:Man is not wholly lost nor wholly changed
:Dis-grace he may be, yet is not de-throned,
:and keeps the rags of lordship once he owned:
:Man, Sub-creator, the refracted Light
:through whom is splintered from a single White
:to many hues, and endlessly combined
:in living shapes that move from mind to mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', in ''Essays Presented to Charles Williams'', CS Lewis Ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is strongly embraced by the [[Trappists|Trappist monk]] and author [[Thomas Merton]] who admired both Scotus and Hopkins. In ''New Seeds of Contemplation'' Merton equates the unique "thingness" of a thing, its inscape, to sanctity. Merton writes,

"No two created beings are exactly alike. And their individuality is no imperfection. On the contrary, the perfection of each created thing is not merely its conformity to an abstract type but in its own individual identity with itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Merton]], ''[[Seeds of Contemplation]]'' New Directions Publishing, 1972. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result is that holiness itself is grounded in God's creation, his call, and not in a [[Theory of Forms|Platonic ideal]]. To the extent that any "thing" (including humans) honors God's unique idea of them they are holy. Holiness thus connects to "[[vocation]]" (from the [[Latin]] vocare for "voice") in two ways. First, God creates through the word; and second, when being responds rightly to God's speech by expressing his unique word the result is Holiness.

'''Machine operator efficiency''' (MOE) is a [[lean manufacturing]] term used to describe the performance of an employee who operates industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do You Know MOE|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-operator-efficiency-moe-rick-wenzel?trk=pulse_spock-articles|publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operator's efficiency is measured as the time spent producing product divided by the time the operator is on duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarkar|first1=Prasanta|title=How to calculate operator efficiency at work|url=http://www.onlineclothingstudy.com/2011/09/how-to-calculate-operator-efficiency.html|publisher=OCS|date=2011-09-23|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: if an operator is assigned to run a CNC machine tool for seven hours, but he only has four hours worth of continuous uninterrupted output of workpieces - his MOE rating is 57% (4 divided by 7) for this seven-hour period of time.

There is a similar lean manufacturing [[Key Performance Indicator|KPI]] called [[overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE). The major difference between OEE and MOE is that the OEE rating is on the machine and the MOE is on the person.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

MOE is a measure of operator performance only, regardless of the type of machine or the speed of the machine he is working on. MOE only measures the operator's ability to keep the machine running continuously (load and unload parts faster that the automatic cycle time of the machine). The MOE rating of an operator will travel with him as he moves from one machine to another. This is easily accomplished because the MOE rating is a universal calculation of time and not reliant on the complex OEE calculations of loading, availability, performance, and quality.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Industrial dashboard|Industrial Dashboards]] can be used to display statistics for MOE ratings on each operator. To boost overall profitability for a manufacturing plant, machine operators are sometimes compensated with a salary bonus based on their MOE ratings.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

*[[Snowball earth]], twice, [[Huronian glaciation|2.4-2.1 billion years ago]] and 790–630 million years ago
*At least five putative [[hydrogen sulfide]]-induced mass extinctions, such as the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]], {{Ma|252.28}}

The list does not include the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], since this was, at least partially, externally induced by a [[meteor impact]].

A '''mental image''' or '''mental picture''' is the representation in a person's mind of the physical world outside that person.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W. (2012). Fundamentals of cognition, 2nd ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an experience that, on most occasions, significantly resembles the experience of perceiving some object, event, or scene, but occurs when the relevant object, event, or scene is not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;McKellar, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finke, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  There are sometimes episodes, particularly on falling asleep ([[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic imagery]]) and waking up ([[hypnopompic]]), when the mental imagery, being of a rapid, phantasmagoric and involuntary character, defies perception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Edmond |year=1983 |title=Inspecting images |journal=Philosophy |volume=58 |issue=223 |pages=57–72 (see pp. 68–72) |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental imagery can sometimes produce the same effects as would be produced by the behavior or experience imagined.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappes|first=Heather Barry|last2=Morewedge|first2=Carey K.|date=2016-07-01|title=Mental Simulation as Substitute for Experience|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=7|pages=405–420|doi=10.1111/spc3.12257|issn=1751-9004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function (if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy{{Elucidate|date=April 2014}} in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], and, more recently, [[neuroscience]]. As contemporary researchers{{whom2|date=April 2014}} use the expression, mental images or imagery can comprise information from any source of sensory input; one may experience auditory images,&lt;ref&gt;Reisberg, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; olfactory images,&lt;ref&gt;Bensafi et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth. However, the majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the topic focus upon ''visual'' mental imagery. It has sometimes been assumed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that, like humans, some types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]: ''[[On the Soul]]'' III.3 428a&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fundamentally introspective nature of the phenomenon, there is little to no evidence either for or against this view.

Philosophers such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], and early experimental psychologists such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[William James]], understood [[idea]]s in general to be mental images. Today it is very widely believed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that much imagery functions as mental representations (or [[mental model]]s), playing an important role in memory and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Paivio|Pavio]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Egan]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence W. Barsalou|Barsalou]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; William Brant (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;12) traces the scientific use of the phrase "mental images" back to [[John Tyndall]]'s 1870 speech called the "Scientific Use of the Imagination". Some have gone so far as to suggest that images are best understood to be, by definition, a form of inner, mental or neural representation;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ned Block|Block]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Kosslyn|Kosslyn]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of hypnagogic and hypnapompic imagery, it is not representational at all.  Others reject the view that the image experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such representation in the mind or the brain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sartre]], 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Ryle|Ryle]], 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomeo, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett &amp; Hacker, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but do not take account of the non-representational forms of imagery.

In 2010, [[IBM]] applied for a patent on a method to extract mental images of human faces from the human brain. It uses a feedback loop based on brain measurements of the [[fusiform face area]] in the brain that activates proportionate with degree of facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20100049076.pdf IBM Patent Application: Retrieving mental images of faces from the human brain]&lt;/ref&gt; It was issued in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-traders.com/INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS-MA-4828/news/Business-Machines--Patent-Issued-for-Retrieving-Mental-Images-of-Faces-from-the-Human-Brain-20127314/ Business Machines : Patent Issued for Retrieving Mental Images of Faces from the Human Brain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mind's eye==
The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA535#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively)—on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S. (trans. and ed.), ''Cicero on Oratory and Orators'', Harper &amp; Brothers, (New York), 1875:  Book III, C.XLI, p.239.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "the mind's eye" first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c. 1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical basis ==
The biological foundation of the mind's eye is not fully understood. Studies using [[fMRI]]  have shown that the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|V1 area]] of the [[visual cortex]] are activated during mental imagery tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf Imagery of famous faces: effects of memory and attention revealed by fMRI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821220736/http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf |date=2006-08-21 }}, A. Ishai, J. V. Haxby and L. G. Ungerleider, ''NeuroImage'' '''17''' (2002), pp. 1729-1741.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ratey|Ratey]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[visual pathway]] is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the [[human brain|brain]] can also send visual input back to [[neuron]]s in lower areas of the visual cortex. [...] As humans, we have the ability to see with the mind's eye – to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, [[PET scan]]s have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the [[visual association cortex]], the [[parietal cortex]], and the [[prefrontal cortex]] - all higher [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|cognitive processing center]]s of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;''A User's Guide to the Brain'', John J. Ratey, {{ISBN|0-375-70107-9}}, at p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rudiments of a biological basis for the mind's eye is found in the deeper portions of the brain below the [[neocortex]], or where the center of perception exists.  The [[thalamus]] has been found to be discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain.  Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the [[cerebral cortex]], the brain adapts to [[neuroplasticity]] to amend any occlusions for perception.  It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex.  This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate - essentially seeing something that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).

Not all people have the same internal perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some people are able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts.

Furthermore, the [[pineal gland]] is a hypothetical candidate for producing a mind's eye; [[Rick Strassman]] and others have postulated that during [[near-death experiences]] (NDEs) and [[dream]]ing, the gland might secrete a hallucinogenic chemical [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|''N'',''N''-Dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is occluded.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strassman, DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences, 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89281-927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis has yet to be fully supported with [[neurochemical]] evidence and plausible mechanism for DMT production.

The hypothesized condition where a person lacks a mind's eye is called [[aphantasia]]. The term was first suggested in a 2015 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019| pmid = 26115582| issn = 0010-9452| last1 = Zeman| first1 = Adam| last2 = Dewar| first2 = Michaela| last3 = Della Sala| first3 = Sergio| title = Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia| journal = Cortex| accessdate = 2015-06-24| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215001781| volume=73| pages=378–380| year = 2015| hdl = 10871/17613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples of mental images include [[daydreaming]] and the mental visualization that occurs while reading a book. Another is of the pictures summoned by athletes during training or before a competition, outlining each step they will take to accomplish their goal.&lt;ref&gt;Plessinger, Annie. ''The Effects of Mental Imagery on Athletic Performance''. The Mental Edge. 12/20/13. Web. http://www.vanderbilt.edu&lt;/ref&gt; When a musician hears a song, he or she can sometimes "see" the song notes in their head, as well as hear them with all their tonal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia:  Tales of Music and the Brain |place=London |publisher=Picador |pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is considered different from an after-effect, such as an after-image.  Calling up an image in our minds can be a voluntary act, so it can be characterized as being under various degrees of conscious control.

According to psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). ''How the Mind Works''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; our experiences of the world are represented in our minds as mental images. These mental images can then be associated and compared with others, and can be used to synthesize completely new images. In this view, mental images allow us to form useful theories of how the world works by formulating likely sequences of mental images in our heads without having to directly experience that outcome. Whether [[animal cognition|other creatures have this capability]] is debatable.

There are several theories as to how mental images are formed in the mind. These include the [[dual coding theory|dual-code theory]], the propositional theory, and the functional-equivalency hypothesis. The dual-code theory, created by [[Allan Paivio]] in 1971, is the theory that we use two separate codes to represent information in our brains: image codes and verbal codes. Image codes are things like thinking of a picture of a dog when you are thinking of a dog, whereas a verbal code would be to think of the word "dog".&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, Allan. 1941. ''Dual Coding Theory. Theories of Learning in Educational Psychology''. (2013). Web. {{cite web |url=http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221091503/http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |archivedate=2011-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the difference between thinking of abstract words such as ''justice'' or ''love'' and thinking of concrete words like ''elephant'' or ''chair.'' When abstract words are thought of, it is easier to think of them in terms of verbal codes—finding words that define them or describe them. With concrete words, it is often easier to use image codes and bring up a picture of a ''human'' or ''chair'' in your mind rather than words associated or descriptive of them.

The propositional theory involves storing images in the form of a generic propositional code that stores the meaning of the concept not the image itself. The propositional codes can either be descriptive of the image or symbolic. They are then transferred back into verbal and visual code to form the mental image.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Imaging Theories. 2013. Web. http://faculty.mercer.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional-equivalency hypothesis is that mental images are "internal representations" that work in the same way as the actual perception of physical objects.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W. (2012). ''Fundamentals of Cognition'', 2nd ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the picture of a dog brought to mind when the word ''dog'' is read is interpreted in the same way as if the person looking at an actual dog before them.

Research has occurred to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show a multitude of results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in brodmann area 17.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi e21736"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Masayuki|last2=Sasabe|first2=Tetsuya|last3=Shigihara|first3=Yoshihito|last4=Tanaka|first4=Masaaki|last5=Watanabe|first5=Yasuyoshi|date=2011-07-08|title=Gustatory Imagery Reveals Functional Connectivity from the Prefrontal to Insular Cortices Traced with Magnetoencephalography|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21736|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021736|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3132751|pmid=21760903|bibcode=2011PLoSO...621736K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial brodmann area 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meister|first=I.

==Neural substrates of visual imagery==
'''Visual imagery''' is the ability to create [[Mental image|mental representations]] of things, people, and places that are absent from an individual’s visual field. This ability is crucial to problem-solving tasks, memory, and spatial reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscientist|Neuroscientists]] have found that imagery and [[Perception|perception]] share many of the same [[Neural substrate|neural substrates]], or areas of the [[Brain|brain]] that function similarly during both imagery and perception, such as the [[Visual cortex|visual cortex]] and higher visual areas. Kosslyn and colleagues (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Pascual-Leone, A., Felician, O., Camposano, S., Keenan, J. P., L., W., … Alpert. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/284/5411/167.abstract “The Role of Area 17 in Visual Imagery: Convergent Evidence from PET and rTMS”], Science, 284(5411), 167 LP-170, (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the early visual cortex, Area 17 and Area 18/19, is activated during visual imagery. They found that inhibition of these areas through repetitive [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (rTMS) resulted in impaired visual perception and imagery. Furthermore, research conducted with lesioned patients has revealed that visual imagery and visual perception have the same representational organization. This has been concluded from patients in which impaired perception also experience visual imagery deficits at the same level of the mental representation.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, M. (1988). "Is Visual Imagery Really Visual? Overlooked Evidence From Neuropsychology". Psychological review. 95. 307-17. 10.1037/0033-295X.95.3.307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behrmann and colleagues (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Behrmann, M., Winocur, G., &amp; Moscovitch, M. [https://doi.org/10.1038/359636a0 “Dissociation between mental imagery and object recognition in a brain-damaged patient”]. Nature, 359, 636. (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; describe a patient C.K., who provided evidence challenging the view that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same representational system. C.K. was a 33-year old man with [[Visual agnosia|visual object agnosia]] acquired after a vehicular accident. This deficit prevented him from being able to recognize objects and copy objects fluidly. Surprisingly, his ability to draw accurate objects from memory indicated his visual imagery was intact and normal. Furthermore, C.K. successfully performed other tasks requiring visual imagery for judgment of size, shape, color, and composition. These findings conflict with previous research as they suggest there is a partial dissociation between visual imagery and visual perception. C.K. exhibited a perceptual deficit that was not associated with a corresponding deficit in visual imagery, indicating that these two processes have systems for mental representations that may not be mediated entirely by the same neural substrates. 

Schlegel and colleagues (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, A., Kohler, P. J., Fogelson, S. V, Alexander, P., Konuthula, D., &amp; Tse, P. U. [http://www.pnas.org/content/110/40/16277.abstract “Network structure and dynamics of the mental workspace”], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(40), 16277 LP-16282. (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] analysis of regions activated during manipulation of visual imagery. They identified 11 bilateral [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and subcortical regions that exhibited increased activation when manipulating a visual image compared to when the visual image was just maintained. These regions included the [[Occipital lobe|occipital lobe]] and [[Two-streams hypothesis|ventral stream]] areas, two [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobe]] regions, the [[Posterior parietal cortex|posterior parietal cortex]] and the [[Precuneus|precuneus]] lobule, and three [[Frontal lobe|frontal lobe]] regions, the [[Frontal eye fields|frontal eye fields]], [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], and the [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal cortex]]. Due to their suspected involvement in [[Working memory|working memory]] and [[Attention|attention]], the authors propose that these parietal and prefrontal regions, and occipital regions, are part of a network involved in mediating the manipulation of visual imagery. These results suggest a top-down activation of visual areas in visual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, B., &amp; Whishaw, I. Q. (2015). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology. New York. Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Dynamic causal modelling|Dynamic Causal Modeling]] (DCM) to determine the connectivity of cortical networks, Ishai et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Ishai, A. “Seeing faces and objects with the "mind's eye”", Archives Italiennes de Biologie, 148(1):1-9. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that activation of the network mediating visual imagery is initiated by prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activity. Generation of objects from memory resulted in initial activation of the prefrontal and the posterior parietal areas, which then activate earlier visual areas through backward connectivity. Activation of the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex has also been found to be involved in retrieval of object representations from [[Long-term memory|long-term memory]], their maintenance in working memory, and attention during visual imagery. Thus, Ishai et al. suggest that the network mediating visual imagery is composed of attentional mechanisms arising from the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.

Vividness of visual imagery is a crucial component of an individual’s ability to perform cognitive tasks requiring imagery. Vividness of visual imagery varies not only between individuals but also within individuals. Dijkstra and colleagues (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; found that the variation in vividness of visual imagery is dependent on the degree to which the neural substrates of visual imagery overlap with those of visual perception. They found that overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual cortex, the parietal precuneus lobule, the right parietal cortex, and the medial frontal cortex predicted the vividness of a mental representation. The activated regions beyond the visual areas are believed to drive the imagery-specific processes rather than the visual processes shared with perception. It has been suggested that the precuneus contributes to vividness by selecting important details for imagery. The medial frontal cortex is suspected to be involved in the retrieval and integration of information from the parietal and visual areas during working memory and visual imagery. The right parietal cortex appears to be important in attention, visual inspection, and stabilization of mental representations. Thus, the neural substrates of visual imagery and perception overlap in areas beyond the visual cortex and the degree of this overlap in these areas correlates with the vividness of mental representations during imagery.

==Philosophical ideas==
{{Main|Mental representation}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Mental images are an important topic in classical and modern philosophy, as they are central to the study of [[knowledge]].  In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', Book VII, [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] present the [[Allegory of the Cave]]: a prisoner, bound and unable to move, sits with his back to a fire watching the shadows cast on the cave wall in front of him by people carrying objects behind his back. These people and the objects they carry are representations of real things in the world. Unenlightened man is like the prisoner, explains  Socrates, a human being making mental images from the sense data that he experiences.

The eighteenth-century philosopher Bishop [[George Berkeley]] proposed similar ideas in his theory of [[idealism]].  Berkeley stated that reality is equivalent to mental images&amp;mdash;our mental images are not a copy of another material reality but that reality itself. Berkeley, however, sharply distinguished between the images that he considered to constitute the external world, and the images of individual imagination. According to Berkeley, only the latter are considered "mental imagery" in the contemporary sense of the term.

The eighteenth century British writer Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] criticized idealism.  When asked what he thought about idealism, he is alleged to have replied "I refute it thus!"{{Cite quote|date=February 2017}} as he kicked a large rock and his leg rebounded.  His point was that the idea that the rock is just another mental image and has no material existence of its own is a poor explanation of the painful sense data he had just experienced.

David Deutsch addresses Johnson's objection to idealism in ''The Fabric of Reality'' when he states that, if we judge the value of our mental images of the world by the quality and quantity of the sense data that they can explain, then the most valuable mental image&amp;mdash;or theory&amp;mdash;that we currently have is that the world has a real independent existence and that humans have successfully evolved by building up and adapting patterns of mental images to explain it.  This is an important idea in [[Philosophy of science|scientific thought]].{{Why|date=May 2010}}

Critics of [[scientific realism]] ask how the inner perception of mental images actually occurs. This is sometimes called the "[[homunculus]] problem" (see also the [[mind's eye]]). The problem is similar to asking how the images you see on a computer screen exist in the memory of the computer. To scientific [[materialism]], mental images and the perception of them must be brain-states. According to critics,{{Who|date=May 2010}} scientific realists cannot explain where the images and their perceiver exist in the brain. To use the analogy of the computer screen, these critics argue that [[cognitive science]] and [[psychology]] have been unsuccessful in identifying either the component in the brain (i.e., "hardware") or the mental processes that store these images (i.e. "software").

==In experimental psychology==

[[cognitive psychology|Cognitive psychologists]] and (later) [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientists]] have empirically tested some of the philosophical questions related to whether and how the human brain uses mental imagery in cognition.

[[Image:MR TMR.jpg|right]]One theory of the mind that was examined in these experiments was the "brain as serial computer" philosophical metaphor of the 1970s. Psychologist [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] theorized that the human mind processes mental images by decomposing them into an underlying mathematical proposition. [[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler challenged that view by presenting subjects with 2D line drawings of groups of 3D block "objects" and asking them to determine whether that "object" is the same as a second figure, some of which rotations of the first "object".&lt;ref&gt;Shepard and Metzler 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Shepard and Metzler proposed that if we decomposed and then mentally re-imaged the objects into basic mathematical propositions, as the then-dominant view of cognition "as a serial digital computer"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1987&lt;/ref&gt; assumed, then it would be expected that the time it took to determine whether the object is the same or not would be independent of how much the object had been rotated.  Shepard and Metzler found the opposite: a linear relationship between the degree of rotation in the mental imagery task and the time it took participants to reach their answer.

This [[mental rotation]] finding implied that the human mind—and the human brain—maintains and manipulates mental images as topographic and topological wholes, an implication that was quickly put to test by psychologists.  [[Stephen Kosslyn]] and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn 1995; see also 1994&lt;/ref&gt; showed in a series of neuroimaging experiments that the mental image of objects like the letter "F" are mapped, maintained and rotated as an image-like whole in areas of the human visual cortex.  Moreover, Kosslyn's work showed that there are considerable similarities between the neural mappings for imagined stimuli and perceived stimuli.  The authors of these studies concluded that, while the neural processes they studied rely on mathematical and computational underpinnings, the brain also seems optimized to handle the sort of mathematics that constantly computes a series of topologically-based images rather than calculating a mathematical model of an object.

Recent studies in neurology and neuropsychology on mental imagery have further questioned the "mind as serial computer" theory, arguing instead that human mental imagery manifests [[motor imagery|both visually and kinesthetically]].  For example, several studies have provided evidence that people are slower at rotating line drawings of objects such as hands in directions incompatible with the joints of the human body,&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1987; 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and that patients with painful, injured arms are slower at mentally rotating line drawings of the hand from the side of the injured arm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwoebel et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists, including Kosslyn, have argued that such results occur because of interference in the brain between distinct systems in the brain that process the visual and motor mental imagery.  Subsequent [[neuroimaging]] studies&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the interference between the motor and visual imagery system could be induced by having participants physically handle actual 3D blocks glued together to form objects similar to those depicted in the line-drawings.  Amorim et al. have shown that, when a cylindrical "head" was added to Shepard and Metzler's line drawings of 3D block figures, participants were quicker and more accurate at solving mental rotation problems.&lt;ref&gt;Amorim et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that motoric embodiment is not just "interference" that inhibits visual mental imagery but is capable of facilitating mental imagery.

As cognitive neuroscience approaches to mental imagery continued, research expanded beyond questions of serial versus parallel or topographic processing to questions of the relationship between mental images and perceptual representations. Both brain imaging (fMRI and ERP) and studies of neuropsychological patients have been used to test the hypothesis that a mental image is the reactivation, from memory, of brain representations normally activated during the perception of an external stimulus. In other words, if perceiving an apple activates contour and location and shape and color representations in the brain’s visual system, then imagining an apple activates some or all of these same representations using information stored in memory. Early evidence for this idea came from neuropsychology. Patients with brain damage that impairs perception in specific ways, for example by damaging shape or color representations, seem to generally to have impaired mental imagery in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J.|title=Is visual imagery really visual? Overlooked evidence from neuropsychology|journal=Psychological Review|date=Sep 30, 1987|volume=95|issue=3|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0033.295X.95.3.307|pmid=3043530|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/95/3/307/|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of brain function in normal human brains support this same conclusion, showing activity in the brain’s visual areas while subjects imagined visual objects and scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cichy|first1=Radoslaw M.|last2=Heinzle|first2=Jakob|last3=Haynes|first3=John-Dylan|title=Imagery and Perception Share Cortical Representations of Content and Location|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=June 10, 2011|volume=22|issue=2|pages=372–380|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr106|url=http://psych.wisc.edu/postlab/readings/Cereb.%20Cortex-2012-Cichy-372-80.pdf|pmid=21666128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previously mentioned and numerous related studies have led to a relative consensus within [[cognitive science]], psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy on the neural status of mental images.  In general, researchers agree that, while there is no [[homunculus]] inside the head viewing these mental images, our brains do form and maintain mental images as image-like wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem of exactly how these images are stored and manipulated within the human brain, in particular within language and communication, remains a fertile area of study.

One of the longest-running research topics on the mental image has basis on the fact that people report large individual differences in the vividness of their images.  Special questionnaires have been developed to assess such differences, including the [[Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)]] developed by [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]. Laboratory studies have suggested that the subjectively reported variations in imagery vividness are associated with different neural states within the brain and also different cognitive competences such as the ability to accurately recall information presented in pictures&lt;ref&gt;Marks, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway, Gillies and Schepman used a novel long-term change detection task to determine whether participants with low and high vividness scores on the VVIQ2 showed any performance differences.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway, Gillies and Schepman 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway et al. found that high vividness participants were significantly more accurate at detecting salient changes to pictures compared to low-vividness participants.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This replicated an earlier study.&lt;ref&gt;Gur and Hilgard 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have found that individual differences in VVIQ scores can be used to predict changes in a person's brain while visualizing different activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cui et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) was used to study the association between early visual cortex activity relative to the whole brain while participants visualized themselves or another person bench pressing or stair climbing. Reported image vividness correlates significantly with the relative fMRI signal in the visual cortex. Thus, individual differences in the vividness of visual imagery can be measured objectively.

Logie, Pernet, Buonocore and Della Sala (2011) used behavioural and fMRI data for mental rotation from individuals reporting vivid and poor imagery on the VVIQ. Groups differed in brain activation patterns suggesting that the groups performed the same tasks in different ways. These findings help to explain the lack of association previously reported between VVIQ scores and mental rotation performance.

==Training and learning styles==

Some [[Learning theory (education)|educational theorists]]{{Who|date=May 2010}} have drawn from the idea of mental imagery in their studies of [[learning styles]]. Proponents of these theories state that people often have learning processes that emphasize visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems of experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} According to these theorists, teaching in multiple overlapping sensory systems benefits learning, and they encourage teachers to use content and media that integrates well with the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems whenever possible.

Educational researchers have examined whether the experience of mental imagery affects the degree of learning. For example, imagining playing a 5-finger piano exercise (mental practice) resulted in a significant improvement in performance over no mental practice—though not as significant as that produced by physical practice.  The authors of the study stated that "mental practice alone seems to be sufficient to promote the modulation of neural circuits involved in the early stages of motor skill learning".&lt;ref&gt;Pascual-Leone et al. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization and the Himalayan traditions==
In general, [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Bön]], and [[Tantra]] utilize sophisticated visualization or ''imaginal'' (in the language of [[Jean Houston]] of [[Transpersonal Psychology]]) processes in the [[thoughtform]] construction of the [[yidam]] [[sadhana]], [[kye-rim]], and [[dzog-rim]] modes of [[meditation]] and in the [[yantra]], [[thangka]], and [[mandala]] traditions, where holding the fully realized form in the mind is a prerequisite prior to creating an 'authentic' new art work that will provide a sacred support or foundation for deity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Dalai-Lama-at-MIT/dp/0674023196 The Dalai Lama at MIT] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf Mental Imagery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229110116/http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf |date=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Substitution effects ==
Mental imagery can act as a [[Substitute good|substitute]] for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and/or behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Imagined experiences are attributed evidentiary value like physical evidence. 
# [[Mental practice of action|Mental practice]] can instantiate the same performance benefits as physical practice. 
# Imagined consumption of a food can reduce its actual consumption. 
# Imagined goal achievement  can reduce motivation for actual goal achievement.

Typically the logarithm of earnings is modelled as the sum of years of education and a [[quadratic function]] of "years of potential experience".&lt;ref name="lemieux"&gt;Lemieux, Thomas. (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FeCS-vRhp9AC&amp;pg=PA127 "The 'Mincer equation' Thirty Years after ''Schooling, Experience, and Earnings''"] in ''Jacob Mincer: A Pioneer of Modern Labor Economics'', Shoshanna Grossbard, ed., Springer: New York. pp. 127–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Heckman |first=James J. |first2=Lance J. |last2=Lochner |first3=Petra E. |last3=Todd |year=2003 |title=Fifty Years of Mincer Earnings Regressions |work=NBER Working Paper No. 9732 |doi=10.3386/w9732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln w = f (s, x) = \ln w_0 + \rho s + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where the variables have the following meanings; &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is earnings (the [[Regression intercept|intercept]] &lt;math&gt;w_0&lt;/math&gt; is the earnings of someone with no education and no experience); &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is years of schooling; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is years of potential labour market experience.&lt;ref name="lemieux" /&gt; The parameters &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the [[Returns (economics)|returns]] to schooling and experience, respectively.

[[Sherwin Rosen]], in his article celebrating Mincer's contribution, memorably noted that when data was interrogated using this equation one might describe them as having been ''Mincered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = Sherwin | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1992 | title = Distinguished Fellow: Mincering Labor Economics | journal = [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–170 | publisher =  | jstor = 2138414 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1257/jep.6.2.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contract law]], a '''mistake''' is an erroneous belief, ''at contracting'', that certain facts are true.  It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully can lead to the agreement in question being found [[Void (law)|void ''ab initio'']] or [[voidable]], or alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'.  The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.

Another breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Mistake in Contract Law" by Melvin A. Eisenberg|url = http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol91/iss6/3/|website = scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
'''Mistake''' can be-
(1) Mistake of Law; or
(2) Mistake of Fact

'''Mistake of law''': when a party enters into a contract, without the knowledge of the law in the country, the contract is affected by such mistakes but it is not void. The reason here is that ignorance of law is not an excuse. However, if a party is ''induced'' to enter into a contract by the mistake of law then such a contract is not valid.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Illustration''': Harjoth and Danny make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian law of Limitation; the contract is not voidable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Mistake of Fact''': Where both the parties enter into an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.

'''Explanation''': An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.{{R|"McRae v Commonwealth"}}

'''Illustration''': A sells a cow to B for $80 because it is an infertile cow. The cow is actually pregnant and worth $1000. The contract is void.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood v. Walker (MI).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Illustration''': Lady found a stone and sold it as a Topaz for $1 ($25 today). It was a raw uncut diamond worth $700 (today $17,000). The contract is not voidable. There was no mistake because neither party knew what the stone was.&lt;ref&gt;Wood v. Boynton (WI)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unilateral mistakes==
{{Contract law}}
A unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter contained in a contract.&lt;ref name="Taylor v Johnson"/&gt; This kind of mistake is more common than other types of mistake. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} One must first distinguish between mechanical calculations and business error when looking at unilateral mistake. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ordinarily, unilateral mistake does not make a contract void.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;  Traditionally, [[Caveat Emptor]] (let the buyer beware), and under Common Law [[Caveat emptor#Caveat venditor|Caveat Venditor]] (let the seller beware).

===Exceptions===

A contract might be voidable from unilateral mistake for any of the following:

:(1)  One party relied on a statement of the other about a material fact that the second party knew or should have known was mistaken by the first party.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2016|page=227|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781259415654|edition=3d|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(2)  “clerical error that did not result in [[gross negligence]]”&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

::For mechanical calculations, a party may be able to set aside the contract on these grounds provided that the other party does not try to take advantage of the mistake, or 'snatch up' the offer (involving a bargain that one did not intend to make, betrayed by an error in arithmetic etc.). This will be seen by an objective standard, or if a reasonable person would be able to know that the mistake would not make sense to one of the parties. Unless one of the parties 'snatched up' the one-sided offer, courts will otherwise uphold the contract.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

:(3)  The mistake was “[[Unconscionability|unconscionable]]”, i.e. so serious and unreasonable to be outrageous.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

==Mutual mistake==
A mutual mistake occurs when the parties to a contract are both mistaken about the same ''material'' fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is a meeting of the minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. ''Collateral'' mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be ''material'' (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, there is the question of the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.

This is easily confused with [[mutual assent]] cases such as ''Raffles v Wichelhaus''.{{R|"Raffles v Wichelhaus"}}

In ''Raffles'', there was an agreement to ship goods on a vessel named ''Peerless'', but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding that they did not communicate about when the goods would be shipped.

In this case, both parties believed there was a "meeting of the minds," but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning. This represents not a mutual mistake but a failure of mutual assent. In this situation, no contract has been formed, since mutual assent is required in the formation stage of contract.  Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 20 deals with this scenario.

==Common mistake==
A common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts.

The [[House of Lords]] case of ''[[Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd.]]''{{R|"Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd"}} established that common mistake can void a contract only if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.

Later in ''Solle v Butcher'',{{R|"Solle v Butcher"}} [[Lord Denning]] added requirements for common mistake in equity, which loosened the requirements to show common mistake. However, since that time, the case has been heavily criticized in cases such as ''[[Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd]]''.{{R|"Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd"}}. For Australian application of Great Peace Shipping (other than in [[Queensland]]), see ''Svanosio v McNamara''.{{R|"Svanosio v McNamara"}}  For Queensland, see ''Australian Estates v Cairns City Council''.{{R|"Australian Estates v Cairns City Council"}}

Those categories of mistake in the United States exist as well, but it is often necessary to identify whether the error was a "decisional mistake," which is a mistake as a matter of law (faced with two known choices, making the wrong one), or an "ignorant mistake," unaware of the true state of affairs.

The difference is in the extent to which an innocent in the information chain, passing along or using or processing incorrect information, becomes liable. There is a principle that an entity or person cannot be made more liable merely by being in the information chain and passing along information taken in good faith in the belief that it was true, or at least without knowledge of the likelihood of falsity or inaccuracy.

===''Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.''===
Under [[New Mexico]] law a bank, title company, document processing firm, or the like is not liable for false information provided to it, any more than a bank was liable for false information from a trusted customer turned embezzler who drew an unauthorized cashier’s check. ''Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.'', 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 143 (1952):

‘A thing is done “in good faith” within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not.
‘…
‘…[a] transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.’

56 N.M. at 112-113 (quoting from the Uniform Fiduciaries Act{{R|"Uniform Fiduciaries Act"}}).

===''Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456''===
Roswell was the case of first impression on this issue in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New Mexico]], and drew on cases in other jurisdictions interpreting the same language, most notably ''Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456'', 12 A.2d 66 (1940), which on similar facts to Roswell came to the same conclusion and exonerated the innocent actor in favor of shifting any responsibility for the loss to tortfeasors and those who enabled them to act by giving them unjustified authority. 56 N.M. at 114.

The Davis case leads into another good analysis, in a case relied upon by Davis:

:‘At what point does negligence cease and bad faith begin? The distinction between them is that bad faith, or dishonesty, is, unlike negligence, wilful. The mere failure to make inquiry, even though there be suspicious circumstances, does not constitute bad faith, unless said failure is due to the deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a vice or defect in the transaction, – that is to say, where there is an intentional closing of the eyes or stopping of the ears.’

===''Union Bank &amp; Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co.''===
''Union Bank &amp; Trust Co.v. [[Girard Trust Co.]]'', 307 Pa. 468, 500-501, 161 A.2d 865 (1932).

:A firm processing information in order to transfer title using information provided by customers lacked the intent to commit illegal or improper acts when the information furnished to it was wrong. It was not part of its job description to know better, and it did not know better, and charged only a nominal fee for the clerical work, clearly not including any investigation. Further, it could not be in a conspiracy with another party or several parties who knew the information was wrong but failed to inform the title firm. The title firm could not unknowingly become part of a conspiracy of which it was never informed, and from which it could derive no benefit. The attempt to enhance liability or shift blame by filtering data through an innocent party has been tried before, but where the conduit providing document preparation does not know more than its informants, and was not hired or paid to investigate, it is not liable in their place for using their bad facts without guilty knowledge.

===''Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States''===
The law governing record-keeping mistakes and how they are corrected has been gathered by the U.S. Court of International Trade in ''Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States'', 414 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (C.I.T. 2006), in which the Court was faced with application of a tariff which had been calculated at the wrong rate by a customs clerk. To enforce "anti-dumping" legislation against foreign-made goods (in this case, Korean electronic components) made using cheap labor and undercutting American industry, a regulatory scheme was implemented under which such imports were charged a “liquidation duty” at a rate to be found on a schedule. The schedule had been made up by a panel of experts using standards for adjusting the price differential in the overseas goods. The custom clerk used the wrong category of goods and overcharged the duty, and by the time Hynix figured out what had happened, part of a very short statute of limitations on protest had expired. Hynix nevertheless prevailed and received the correction in its tariff rate by showing that such an error “…was correctable under 19 U.S.C. § 1520(c) as a mistake of fact or clerical error not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, and because the failure to file a protest within ninety days of the liquidation of the entries is without legal consequence in this context …” Id. at 1319.

The ''Hynix'' court explains the difference between a mistake of law “…where the facts are known but the legal consequences are not, or are believed to be different than they really are…,” ''Century Importers, Inc. v. United States'', 205 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and a mistake of fact, “…where either (1) the facts exist, but are unknown, or (2) the facts do not exist as they are believed to [exist],” quoting ''Hambro Auto. Corp. v. United States'', 66 C.C.P.A. 113, 118, C.A.D. 1231, 603 F.2d 850, 853 (1979) (“A mistake of fact is any mistake except a mistake of law.” Id. at 855) Hynix, 414 F. Supp. 2d. at 1325.

''Hynix'', in reviewing the tariff application to the facts, also provided a guided tour of the different kinds of mistake and how they are treated in the federal court system. The key distinction is between “decisional mistakes” and “ignorant mistakes.” Id. at 1326; ''G &amp; R Produce Co, v. U.S.'', 281 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1331 (2003); ''Prosegur, Inc. v. U.S.'', 140 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1378 (2001); ''Universal Cooperatives, Inc. v. United States'', 715 F. Supp. 1113, 1114 (1989).

‘Decisional mistakes are mistakes of law and occur when “…a party [makes] the wrong choice between two known, alternative sets of facts.” ''Universal Cooperatives'', (citation partly omitted), 715 F. Supp. at 1114. On the other hand, an ignorant mistake occurs where “…a party is unaware of the existence of the correct alternative set of facts.” Id. “In order for the goods to be reliquidated under 1520 (c) (1), the alleged mistake of fact must be an ignorant mistake.” Prosegur, (citation partly omitted), 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1378.’ ''Hynix'' at 1326.

''Hynix'' provided one more criterion, and that is “materiality,” citing to extensive development of that requirement in ''Degussa Canada Ltd. v. United States'', 87 F.3d 1301, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and ''Xerox Corp. v. United States'', 2004 C.I.T. (Sept. 8, 2004) (“[A] mistake of fact … is a factual error that, if the correct fact had been known, would have resulted in a different classification.”) The error must be “material” in order to be corrected without consequence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16776">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[homotopy theory]], a  '''model category''' is a [[category theory|category]] with distinguished classes of [[morphism]]s ('arrows') called '[[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)|weak equivalence]]s', '[[fibration]]s' and '[[cofibration]]s'. These abstract from a conventional [[homotopy category]] of [[topological space]]s or of [[chain complex]]es ([[derived category]] theory), via the [[acyclic model]] theorem. The concept was introduced  by  {{harvs|txt|first=Daniel G. |last=Quillen|authorlink=Daniel  Quillen|year=1967}}.

In recent decades, the language of model categories has been used in some parts of [[algebraic K-theory|algebraic ''K''-theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]], where homotopy-theoretic approaches led to deep results.

==Motivation==

Model categories can provide a natural setting for [[homotopy theory]]: the category of topological spaces is a model category, with the homotopy corresponding to the usual theory. Similarly, objects that are thought of as spaces often admit a model category structure, such as the category of [[simplicial set]]s.

Another model category is the category of [[chain complex]]es of ''R''-modules for a commutative ring ''R''. Homotopy theory in this context is [[homological algebra]]. Homology can then be viewed as a type of homotopy, allowing generalizations of homology to other objects, such as groups and ''R''-algebras, one of the first major applications of the theory. Because of the above example regarding homology, the study of closed model categories is sometimes thought of as [[homotopical algebra]].

==Formal definition==

The definition given initially by Quillen was that of a closed model category, the assumptions of which seemed strong at the time, motivating others to weaken some of the assumptions to define a model category. In practice the distinction has not proven significant and most recent authors (e.g., Mark Hovey and Philip Hirschhorn) work with closed model categories and simply drop the adjective 'closed'.

The definition has been separated to that of a model structure on a category and then further categorical conditions on that category, the necessity of which may seem unmotivated at first but becomes important later. The following definition follows that given by Hovey.

A '''model structure''' on a category ''C'' consists of three distinguished classes of morphisms (equivalently subcategories): [[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)|weak equivalence]]s, [[fibration]]s, and [[cofibration]]s, and two functorial factorizations &lt;math&gt;(\alpha , \beta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (\gamma, \delta)&lt;/math&gt;  subject to the following axioms. Note that a fibration that is also a weak equivalence is called an '''acyclic''' (or '''trivial''') '''fibration'''&lt;ref&gt;Some readers find the term "trivial" ambiguous and so prefer to use "acyclic".&lt;/ref&gt; and a cofibration that is also a weak equivalence is called an '''acyclic''' (or '''trivial''') '''cofibration''' (or sometimes called an '''anodyne morphism''').

;Axioms:

# ''Retracts'': if ''g'' is a morphism belonging to one of the distinguished classes, and ''f'' is a [[retract (category theory)|retract]] of ''g'' (as objects in the arrow category &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt;, where 2 is the 2-element ordered set), then ''f'' belongs to the same distinguished class. Explicitly, the requirement that ''f'' is a retract of ''g'' means that there exist ''i'', ''j'', ''r'', and ''s'', such that the following diagram commutes:
#:[[Image:Model category retract.png]]
# ''2 of 3'': if ''f'' and ''g'' are maps in ''C'' such that ''gf'' is defined and any two of these are weak equivalences then so is the third.
# ''Lifting'': acyclic cofibrations have the left lifting property with respect to fibrations, and cofibrations have the left lifting property with respect to acyclic fibrations. Explicitly, if the outer square of the following diagram commutes, where ''i'' is a cofibration and ''p'' is a fibration, and ''i'' or ''p'' is acyclic, then there exists ''h'' completing the diagram.
#:[[Image:Model category lifting.png]]
# ''Factorization'':
#* every morphism ''f'' in ''C'' can be written as &lt;math&gt;p\circ i&lt;/math&gt; for a fibration ''p'' and an acyclic cofibration ''i'';
#* every morphism ''f'' in ''C'' can be written as &lt;math&gt;p\circ i&lt;/math&gt; for an acyclic fibration ''p'' and a cofibration ''i''.

A '''model category''' is a category that has a model structure and all (small) [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[Limit (category theory)#Colimits|colimits]], i.e., a [[complete category|complete and cocomplete category]] with a model structure.

The axioms imply that any two of the three classes of maps determine the third (e.g., cofibrations and weak equivalences determine fibrations).

Also, the definition is self-dual: if ''C'' is a model category, then its [[opposite category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{op}&lt;/math&gt; also admits a model structure so that weak equivalences correspond to their opposites, fibrations opposites of cofibrations and cofibrations opposites of fibrations.

==Examples==

===Topological spaces===
The [[category of topological spaces]], '''Top''', admits a standard model category structure with the usual [[fibration|(Serre) fibrations]] and with weak equivalences as weak homotopy equivalences.  The cofibrations are not the usual notion found [[cofibration|here]], but rather the narrower class of maps that have the left lifting property with respect to the acyclic Serre fibrations.
Equivalently, they are the retracts of the relative cell complexes, as explained for example in Hovey's ''Model Categories''. This structure is not unique; in general there can be many model category structures on a given category. For the category of topological spaces, another such structure is given by [[Hurewicz fibration]]s and standard cofibrations, and the weak equivalences are the (strong) [[Homotopy#Homotopy_equivalence|homotopy equivalences]].

===Chain complexes===
The category of (nonnegatively graded) [[chain complex]]es of ''R''-modules carries at least two model structures, which both feature prominently in homological algebra:
*weak equivalences are maps that induce [[isomorphism]]s in homology;
*cofibrations are maps that are [[monomorphism]]s in each degree with projective [[cokernel]]; and
*fibrations are maps that are [[epimorphism]]s in each nonzero degree

or
*weak equivalences are maps that induce [[isomorphism]]s in homology;
*fibrations are maps that are [[epimorphism]]s in each degree with injective [[Kernel (category theory)|kernel]]; and
*cofibrations are maps that are [[monomorphism]]s in each nonzero degree.

This explains why Ext-groups of ''R''-modules can be computed by either resolving the source projectively or the target injectively. These are cofibrant or fibrant replacements in the respective model structures.

The category of arbitrary chain-complexes of ''R''-modules has a model structure that is defined by

* weak equivalences are [[chain homotopy equivalence]]s of chain-complexes;
* cofibrations are monomorphisms that are split as morphisms of underlying ''R''-modules; and
* fibrations are epimorphisms that are split as morphisms of underlying ''R''-modules.

===Further examples===
Other examples of categories admitting model structures include the category of all small categories, the category of [[simplicial set]]s or [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on any small [[Grothendieck site]], the category of topological spectra, and the categories of simplicial spectra or [[sheaf of spectra|presheaves of simplicial spectra]] on a small Grothendieck site.

Simplicial objects in a category are a frequent source of model categories; for instance, [[simplicial commutative ring]]s or simplicial ''R''-modules admit natural model structures. This follows because there is an adjunction between simplicial sets and simplicial commutative rings (given by the forgetful and free functors), and in nice cases one can lift model structures under an adjunction.

A ''simplicial model category'' is a [[Simplicially enriched category|simplicial category]] with a model structure that is compatible with the simplicial structure.&lt;ref&gt;Definition 2.1. of [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101162].&lt;/ref&gt;

Given any category ''C'' and a model category ''M'', under certain extra hypothesis the category of [[functor]]s Fun (''C'', ''M'') (also called ''C''-diagrams in ''M'') is also a model category. In fact, there are always ''two'' candidates for distinct model structures: in one, the so-called projective model structure, fibrations and weak equivalences are those maps of functors which are fibrations and weak equivalences when evaluated at each object of ''C''. Dually, the injective model structure is similar with cofibrations and weak equivalences instead. In both cases the third class of morphisms is given by a lifting condition (see below). In some cases, when the category ''C'' is a [[Reedy category]], there is a third model structure lying in between the projective and injective.

The process of forcing certain maps to become weak equivalences in a new model category structure on the same underlying category is known as [[Bousfield localization]]. For example, the category of simplicial [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] can be obtained as a Bousfield localization of the model category of simplicial [[presheaf|presheaves]].

Denis-Charles Cisinski has developed&lt;ref&gt;Cisinski, Denis-Charles. Les préfaisceaux comme modèles des types d'homotopie. (French) [Presheaves as models for homotopy types] Astérisque No. 308 (2006), xxiv+390 pp. {{isbn|978-2-85629-225-9}} {{MR|2294028}}&lt;/ref&gt; a general theory of model structures on presheaf categories (generalizing simplicial sets, which are presheaves on the [[simplex category]]).

If ''C'' is a model category, then so is the category Pro(''C'') of [[pro-object]]s in ''C''. However, a model structure on Pro(''C'') can also be constructed by imposing a weaker set of axioms to ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|
mr=3459031|author1=Barnea, Ilan|author2=Schlank, Tomer M.|title=A projective model structure on pro-simplicial sheaves, and the relative étale homotopy type. |journal= Adv. Math.|volume=291|year=2016|pages=784–858|arxiv=1109.5477|bibcode=2011arXiv1109.5477B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some constructions ==

Every closed model category has a [[terminal object]] by completeness and an [[initial object]] by cocompleteness, since these objects are the limit and colimit, respectively, of the empty diagram. Given an object ''X'' in the model category, if the unique map from the initial object to ''X'' is a cofibration, then ''X'' is said to be '''cofibrant'''. Analogously, if the unique map from ''X'' to the terminal object is a fibration then ''X'' is said to be '''fibrant'''.

If ''Z'' and ''X'' are objects of a model category such that ''Z'' is cofibrant and there is a weak equivalence from ''Z'' to ''X'' then ''Z'' is said to be a '''cofibrant replacement''' for ''X''. Similarly, if ''Z'' is fibrant and there is a weak equivalence from ''X'' to ''Z'' then ''Z'' is said to be a '''fibrant replacement''' for ''X''. In general, not all objects are fibrant or cofibrant, though this is sometimes the case. For example, all objects are cofibrant in the standard model category of simplicial sets and all objects are fibrant for the standard model category structure given above for topological spaces.

Left homotopy is defined with respect to [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cylinder+object cylinder objects] and right homotopy is defined with respect to [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/path+space+object path space objects]. These notions coincide when the domain is cofibrant and the codomain is fibrant. In that case, homotopy defines an equivalence relation on the hom sets in the model category giving rise to homotopy classes.

== Characterizations of fibrations and cofibrations by lifting properties ==

Cofibrations can be characterized as the maps which have the left lifting property with respect to acyclic fibrations, and acyclic cofibrations are characterized as the maps which have the left lifting property with respect to fibrations. Similarly, fibrations can be characterized as the maps which have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to acyclic cofibrations, and acyclic fibrations are characterized as the maps which have the right lifting property with respect to cofibrations.

==Homotopy and the homotopy category==

The ''homotopy category'' of a model category ''C'' is the [[Localization of a category|localization]] of ''C'' with respect to the class of weak equivalences. This definition of homotopy category does not depend on the choice of fibrations and cofibrations. However, the classes of fibrations and cofibrations are useful in describing the homotopy category in a different way and in particular avoiding set-theoretic issues arising in general localizations of categories. More precisely, the "fundamental theorem of model categories" states that the homotopy category of ''C'' is equivalent to the category whose objects are the objects of ''C'' which are both fibrant and cofibrant, and whose morphisms are left homotopy classes of maps (equivalently, right homotopy classes of maps) as defined above. (See for instance Model Categories by Hovey, Thm 1.2.10)

Applying this to the category of topological spaces with the model structure given above, the resulting homotopy category is equivalent to the category of [[CW complexes]] and homotopy classes of continuous maps, whence the name.

===Quillen adjunctions===
A pair of [[adjoint functor]]s
:&lt;math&gt;F: C \leftrightarrows D : G&lt;/math&gt;
between two model categories ''C'' and ''D'' is called a [[Quillen adjunction]] if ''F'' preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations or, equivalently by the closed model axioms, such that G preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations. In this case ''F'' and ''G'' induce an adjunction
:&lt;math&gt;LF: Ho(C) \leftrightarrows Ho(D) : RG&lt;/math&gt;
between the homotopy categories. There is also an explicit criterion for the latter to be an equivalence (''F'' and ''G'' are called a ''Quillen equivalence'' then).

A typical example is the standard adjunction between [[simplicial set]]s and topological spaces:
:&lt;math&gt;|-|: \mathbf{sSet} \leftrightarrows \mathbf{Top} : Sing&lt;/math&gt;
involving the geometric realization of a simplicial set and the singular chains in some topological space. The categories '''sSet''' and '''Top''' are not equivalent, but their homotopy categories are. Therefore, simplicial sets are often used as models for topological spaces because of this equivalence of homotopy categories.

[[Image:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|17th century cloth painting depicting seven levels of Jain hell and various tortures suffered in them. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over the each hell.]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Naraka''' ([[Sanskrit]]: नरक) is the realm of existence in [[Jain cosmology]] characterized by great suffering. [[Naraka]] is usually translated into English as "[[hell]]" or "[[purgatory]]". However, Naraka differs from the hells of [[Abrahamic religions]] as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, the length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long—measured in billions of years.  A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.

==Types of hells==
These realms are situated in the seven lower levels (''adho lok'') of the universe while the human abode of [[Jambudvip]] is in the middle (''madhya lok'') and the heavenly realms exist above (''urdhva loka''). These layers together, form the shape of a man with arms akimbo (the familiar 'keyhole' shaped emblem of Jainism), with the human realm of Jambudvip at the waist, ''adho lok'' below, ''urdhva lok'' above, and ''siddha lok'' or ''[[siddhashila]]'' (the realm of the [[siddhas]]) at or above the head. Many Jain temples are built to display this cosmology such Jambudvip in Hastinapur and the fifteen story [[Trilok Teerth Dham]] temple in Uttar Pradesh. The seven lower grounds are:

# Ratna prabha.
# Sharkara prabha.
# Valuka prabha.
# Panka prabha.
# Dhuma prabha.
# Tamaha prabha.
# Mahatamaha prabha.

The first ground, owing to a predominance of ''ratnas'' or jewels, is called ''Ratnaprabha''. Similarly, the second, owing to a predominance of ''sarkara'' or gravel, is called ''Sarkraprabha''. The third owing to a predominance of ''valuka'' or sands, is called ''Valukaprabha''. The fourth, owing to an excess of ''panka'' or mud, is called ''Pankaprabha''. The fifth, owing to an excess of ''dhuma'' or smoke, is called ''Dhumaprabha''. The sixth, owing to a marked possession of ''tamas'' or darkness, is called ''Tamahprabha'', while the seventh, owing to a high concentration of ''mahatamas'' or dense darkness, is called ''Mahatamahprabha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit|pages=133-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellish beings==
The hellish beings ({{lang-sa|नारकीय}}, ''{{transl|sa|Nārakī}}'') are a type of soul which reside in these various hells. They are born in hells by sudden manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit}} pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The hellish beings each possess a ''vaikriya''  body (protean body which can transform itself and take various forms). They have a fixed life span in the respective hells where they reside. The minimum life span of hellish beings in the first to seventh hellish grounds is 10000 years, 1 ''sagaropama'' year (Ocean-measured years which are countless years as per [[Jain cosmology]]),&lt;ref group=note&gt;As per the [[Jain cosmology]] ''Sirsapahelika'' is the highest measurable number in Jainism which is 10^194 years. Higher than that is palyopama (pit measured years) which is explained by an analogy of a pit. Accordingly, a hollow pit of 8 x 8 x 8 miles tightly filled with hair particles of seven day old newly born. [A single hair from the above cut into eight pieces seven times = 20,97,152 Particles]. 1 Particle emptied after every 100 years, the time taken to empty the whole pit = 1 Palyopama. (1 Palyopama = countless years.) Hence palyopama is at least greater than 10^194 years. Sagrapoma is 10 Quadrillion Palyopama, that means a Sagrapoma is more than 10^210 Years&lt;/ref&gt; 3 ''sagaropama'' years, 7 ''sagaropama'' years, 10 ''sagaropama'' years, 17 ''sagaropama'' years and 22 ''sagaropama'' years respectively. The maximum life span of hellish beings in the first to sixth hellish grounds is 1 ''sagaropama'' year, 3 ''sagaropama'' years, 7 ''sagaropama'' years, 10 ''sagaropama'' years, 17 ''sagaropama'' years and 22 ''sagaropama'' years respectively. They experience five types of sufferings: bodily pain, inauspicious ''[[Lesya|leśyā]] '' or soul colouring and pariṇāma or physical transformation, from the nature and location of hells, pain inflicted on one other and torture inflicted by mansion-dwelling demi-gods.

{{Main|Causes of karma in Jainism#Causes of the Narakayus karma or birth in hells}}

In a dialogue between [[Sudharma Swami]] and [[Mahavira]] in the [[Jain text]] [[Sutrakritanga]], [[Mahavira]] speaks of various reasons a soul may take birth in hells:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.) [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] | title =The Sūtrakritanga | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1895 | location =Oxford | language =English| url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe45/index.htm | series =[[Sacred Books of the East|Sacred Books of the East vol.45, Part 2]] | isbn =0-7007-1538-X }} verse SK:5.1.1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Sudharma Swami''': What is the punishment in the hells? Knowing it, O sage, tell it me who do not know it! How do sinners go to hell?
: '''Mahavira''': I shall describe the truly insupportable pains where there is distress and (the punishment of) evil deeds. Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings for the sake of his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run. Going to a place like a burning heap of coals on fire, and being burnt they cry horribly; they remain there long, shrieking aloud.

According to Jain scripture, [[Tattvarthasutra]], following are the causes for birth in hell:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250-52&lt;/ref&gt;

#Killing or causing pain with intense passion.
#Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts.
#Vowless and unrestrained life.&lt;ref&gt;refer [[Mahavrata]] for the vows and restraints in Jainism&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punishment in Hells.jpg|thumb|300px|Tortures in the hells]]

In a dialogue between Sudharma and Mahavira the Jain text Sutrakritanga, Mahavira describes various tortures and sufferings in hells:{{sfn|Jacobi|1895|p=verse SK:5.1.8-27}}
:They cross the horrible [[Vaitarani]], being urged on by arrows, and wounded with spears. The punishers pierce them with darts; they go in the boat, losing their memory; others pierce them with long pikes and tridents, and throw them on the ground. Some, round whose neck big stones are tied, are drowned in deep water. Others again roll about in the Kadambavâlukâ (river) or in burning chaff, and are roasted in it.  And they come to the great impassable hell, full of agony, called Asûrya (i.e. where the sun does not shine), where there is great darkness, where fires, placed above, below, and all around, are blazing. There, as in a cave, being roasted on the fire, he is burned, having lost the reminiscence (of his sins) and consciousness of everything else; always suffering (he comes) to that miserable hot place that is ever ready (for the punishment of evildoers) There the cruel punishers have lighted four fires, and roast the sinners; they are roasted there like fishes put on the fire alive.
:The prisoners in hell come to the dreadful place called Santakshana (i.e. cutting), where the cruel punishers tie their hands and feet, and with axes in their hands cut them like wooden planks. And they turn the writhing victims round, and stew them, like living fishes, in an iron caldron filled with their own blood, their limbs covered with ordure, their heads smashed.

In Hell beings have a life span of innumerable years and are not easily killed even though they endure great torture. Even if they are killed they immediately take birth and are then repeatedly killed. This is described as thus:
:They are not reduced to ashes there, and they do not die of their enormous pains; undergoing this punishment, the miserable men suffer for their misdeeds. And there in the place, where there is constant shivering, they resort to a large burning fire; but they find no relief in that place of torture; the tormentors torture them still. There is heard everywhere the noise of painfully uttered cries even as in the street of a town. Those whose bad Karman takes effect (viz. the punishers), violently torment again and again those whose bad Karman takes effect also (viz. the punished).
:They deprive the sinner of his life; I shall truly tell you how this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) punishment (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) for the sake of small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.

A '''node''' is a point along a [[standing wave]] where the wave has minimum [[amplitude]].  For instance, in a vibrating [[guitar]] string, the ends of the string are nodes.  By changing the position of the end node through [[frets]], the guitarist changes the effective length of the [[vibrating string]] and thereby the [[Musical note|note]] played. The opposite of a node is an '''anti-node''', a point where the amplitude of the standing wave is a maximum.  These occur midway between the nodes.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite book

In a standing wave the '''nodes''' are a series of locations at equally spaced intervals where the wave [[amplitude]] (motion) is zero (see animation above).  At these points the two waves add with opposite [[phase (waves)|phase]] and cancel each other out.  They occur at intervals of half a [[wavelength]] (λ/2).  Midway between each pair of nodes are locations where the amplitude is maximum.  These are called the '''antinodes'''.  At these points the two waves add with the same phase and reinforce each other.

In cases where the two opposite wave trains are not the same amplitude, they do not cancel perfectly, so the amplitude of the standing wave at the nodes is not zero but merely a minimum.  This occurs when the reflection at the boundary is imperfect.  This is indicated by a finite [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR), the ratio of the amplitude of the wave at the antinode to the amplitude at the node.

In [[resonance]] of a [[two dimensional]] surface or membrane, such as a [[drumhead]] or vibrating metal plate, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface where the surface is motionless, dividing the surface into separate regions vibrating with opposite phase.  These can be made visible by sprinkling sand on the surface, and the intricate patterns of lines resulting are called [[Chladni figure]]s.

In [[transmission line]]s a [[voltage]] node is a [[Electric current|current]] antinode, and a voltage antinode is a current node.

Nodes are the points of zero displacement, not the points where two constituent waves intersect.

== Boundary conditions ==
Where the nodes occur in relation to the boundary reflecting the waves depends on the end conditions or [[boundary conditions]].  Although there are many types of end conditions, the ends of resonators are usually one of two types that cause total reflection:

*&lt;u&gt;Fixed boundary&lt;/u&gt;: Examples of this type of boundary are the attachment point of a [[guitar]] string, the closed end of an open pipe like an [[organ pipe]] or a [[woodwind]] pipe, the periphery of a [[drumhead]], a [[transmission line]] with the end [[short circuit]]ed, or the mirrors at the ends of a [[laser cavity]].  In this type, the amplitude of the wave is forced to zero at the boundary, so there is a node at the boundary, and the other nodes occur at multiples of half a wavelength from it:

:: 0,&amp;nbsp; λ/2,&amp;nbsp; λ,&amp;nbsp; 3λ/2,&amp;nbsp; 2λ, ...

*&lt;u&gt;Free boundary&lt;/u&gt;: Examples of this type are an open-ended organ or woodwind pipe, the ends of the vibrating resonator bars in a [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]] or [[tuning fork]], the ends of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], or a transmission line with an open end.  In this type the [[derivative (calculus)|derivative]] (slope) of the wave's amplitude (in [[sound wave]]s the pressure, in electromagnetic waves the [[Electric current|current]]) is forced to zero at the boundary.  So there is an amplitude maximum (antinode) at the boundary, the first node occurs a quarter wavelength from the end, and the other nodes are at half wavelength intervals from there:

:: λ/4,&amp;nbsp; 3λ/4,&amp;nbsp; 5λ/4,&amp;nbsp; 7λ/4, ...

== Examples ==

=== Sound ===
A sound wave consists of alternating cycles of compression and expansion of the wave medium. During compression, the molecules of the medium are forced together, resulting in the increased pressure and density. During expansion the molecules are forced apart, resulting in the decreased pressure and density.

The number of nodes in a specified length is directly proportional to the frequency of the wave.

Occasionally on a guitar, violin, or other stringed instrument, nodes are used to create [[harmonic]]s. When the finger is placed on top of the string at a certain point, but does not push the string all the way down to the fretboard, a third node is created (in addition to the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[nut (instrument)|nut]]) and a harmonic is sounded. During normal play when the frets are used, the harmonics are always present, although they are quieter.  With the artificial node method, the [[overtone]] is louder and the [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental]] tone is quieter. If the finger is placed at the midpoint of the string, the first overtone is heard, which is an octave above the fundamental note which would be played, had the harmonic not been sounded. When two additional nodes divide the string into thirds, this creates an octave and a perfect fifth (twelfth). When three additional nodes divide the string into quarters, this creates a double octave. When four additional nodes divide the string into fifths, this creates a double-octave and a major third (17th). The octave, major third and perfect fifth are the three notes present in a major chord.

The characteristic sound that allows the listener to identify a particular instrument is largely due to the relative magnitude of the harmonics created by the instrument.

=== Chemistry ===

In chemistry, [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] waves, or "[[atomic orbital|orbitals]]", are used to describe the wave-like properties of electrons. Many of these quantum waves have nodes and antinodes as well. The number and position of these nodes and antinodes give rise to many of the properties of an atom or [[covalent bond]]. [[Atomic orbital]]s are classified according to the number of radial and angular nodes, while [[molecular orbital]]s are classified according to bonding character. Molecular orbitals with an antinode between nuclei are very stable, and are known as "bonding orbitals" which strengthen the bond. In contrast, molecular orbitals with a node between nuclei will not be stable due to electrostatic repulsion and are known as "anti-bonding orbitals" which weaken the bond. Another such [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] concept is the [[particle in a box]] where the number of nodes of the wavefunction can help determine the quantum energy state&amp;mdash;zero nodes corresponds to the ground state, one node corresponds to the 1st excited state, etc. In general,&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Messiah]], 1966. ''Quantum Mechanics'' (Vol. I), English translation from French by G. M. Temmer. North Holland, John Wiley &amp; Sons. Cf. chpt. IV, section III. [https://archive.org/details/QuantumMechanicsVolumeI   online]  Ch 3  §12&lt;/ref&gt; ''If one arranges the eigenstates in the order of increasing energies, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2, \epsilon_3,...&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenfunctions likewise fall in the order of increasing number of nodes; the ''n''th eigenfunction has ''n−1'' nodes, between each of which the following eigenfunctions have at least one node''.

'''Norms''' are concepts ([[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s) of practical import, oriented to effecting an action, rather than conceptual abstractions that describe, explain, and express. Normative sentences imply "ought-to" types of statements and assertions, in distinction to sentences that provide "is" types of statements and assertions. Common normative sentences include [[Imperative mood|commands]], permissions, and prohibitions; common normative abstract concepts include ''sincerity'', ''justification'', and  ''honesty''. A popular account of norms describes them as [[reason]]s to take [[action (philosophy)|action]], to [[belief|believe]], and to [[emotion|feel]].

==Types of norms==
Orders and permissions express norms. Such norm sentences do not describe how the [[world]] is, they rather prescribe how the world should be. [[Imperative mood|Imperative]] sentences are the most obvious way to express norms, but declarative sentences also may be norms, as is the case with [[law]]s or 'principles'. Generally, whether an expression is a norm depends on what the sentence intends to assert. For instance, a sentence of the form "All Ravens are Black" could on one account be taken as descriptive, in which case an instance of a white raven would contradict it, or alternatively "All Ravens are Black" could be interpreted as a norm, in which case it stands as a principle and definition, so 'a white raven' would then not be a raven.

Those norms purporting to create [[Convention (norm)|obligation]]s (or [[duty|duties]]) and [[permission (philosophy)|permission]]s are called ''[[deontology|deontic]] norms'' (see also [[deontic logic]]). The concept of deontic norm is already an extension of a previous concept of norm, which would only include imperatives, that is, norms purporting to create duties. The understanding that permissions are norms in the same way was an important step in [[ethics]] and [[philosophy of law]].
[[File:Constitutive Norms vs. Deontic Norms.png|thumb|A flowchart with examples of constitutive and deontic norms.|339x339px]]
In addition to deontic norms, many other varieties have been identified. For instance, some [[constitution]]s establish the [[national anthem]]. These norms do not directly create any duty or permission. They create a "[[National symbols|national symbol]]". Other norms create [[nation]]s themselves or [[politics|political]] and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] regions within a nation. The action orientation of such norms is less obvious than in the case of a command or permission, but is essential for understanding the relevance of issuing such norms: When a folk song becomes a "national anthem" the meaning of singing one and the same song changes; likewise, when a piece of land becomes an administrative region, this has legal consequences for many activities taking place on that territory; and without these consequences concerning action, the norms would be irrelevant. A more obviously action-oriented variety of such ''constitutive norms'' (as opposed to deontic or ''regulatory norms'') establishes social institutions which give rise to new, previously inexistent types of actions or activities (a standard example is the institution of marriage without which "getting married" would not be a feasible action; another is the rules constituting a game: without the norms of soccer, there would not exist such an action as executing an [[indirect free kick]]).

Any [[convention (norm)|convention]] can create a norm, although the relation between both is not settled.

There is a significant discussion about (legal) norms that give someone the [[power (sociology)|power]] to create other norms. They are called ''power-conferring norms'' or ''norms of competence''. Some authors argue that they are still deontic norms, while others argue for a close connection between them and [[institutional fact]]s (see Raz 1975, Ruiter 1993).

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] conventions, for example, the convention in [[English language|English]] that "cat" means cat or the convention in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] that "gato" means cat, are among the most important norms.

[[Game]]s completely depend on norms. The fundamental norm of many games is the norm establishing who wins and loses. In other games, it is the norm establishing how to score points.

==Major characteristics==
One major characteristic of norms is that, unlike [[proposition]]s, they are not descriptively [[truth|true]] or false, since norms do not purport to describe anything, but to prescribe, create or change something.  Some people say{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} they are "prescriptively true" or false.  Whereas the truth of a descriptive statement is purportedly based on its [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] to [[reality]], some philosophers, beginning with [[Aristotle]], assert that the (prescriptive) truth of a prescriptive statement is based on its correspondence to right [[Motivation|desire]].  Other philosophers maintain that norms are ultimately neither true or false, but only successful or unsuccessful (valid or invalid), as their [[proposition]]al content obtains or not (see also [[John Searle]] and [[speech act]]).

There is an important difference between ''norms'' and ''normative propositions'', although they are often expressed by identical sentences.  "You may go out." usually expresses a norm if it is uttered by the teacher to one of the students, but it usually expresses a normative proposition if it is uttered to one of the students by one of his or her classmates.  Some ethical theories reject that there can be normative propositions, but these are accepted by [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]].  One can also think of propositional norms; [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s and [[question]]s arguably express propositional norms (they set a proposition as asserted or questioned).

Another purported feature of norms, it is often argued, is that they never regard only natural [[property|properties]] or [[entity|entities]].  Norms always bring something artificial, [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], [[institution]]al or "unworldly".  This might be related to [[David Hume|Hume's]] assertion that it is not possible to [[is-ought problem|derive ought from is]] and to [[G.E. Moore|G.E. Moore's]] claim that there is a [[naturalistic fallacy]] when one tries to analyse "good" and "bad" in terms of a natural [[concept]].  In [[aesthetics]], it has also been argued that it is impossible to derive an aesthetical [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] from a non-aesthetical one. The acceptability of [[Ethical non-naturalism|non-natural properties]], however, is strongly debated in present-day philosophy. Some authors deny their [[existence]], some others try to [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduce]] them to natural ones, on which the former [[Supervenience|supervene]].

Other thinkers (Adler, 1986) assert that norms can be [[nature|natural]] in a different sense than that of "corresponding to something proceeding from the object of the prescription as a strictly internal source of action".  Rather, those who assert the existence of natural prescriptions say norms can suit a natural ''need'' on the part of the prescribed entity.  More to the point, however, is the putting forward of the notion that just as descriptive statements being considered true are conditioned upon certain [[self-evident]] descriptive truths suiting the nature of reality (such as:  it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be at the same time and in the same manner), a prescriptive truth can suit the nature of the will through the authority of it being based upon [[self-evident]] prescriptive truths (such as:  one ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else).

Recent works maintain that normativity has an important role in several different philosophical subjects, not only in ethics and philosophy of law (see Dancy, 2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4595">The '''list of traditional Turkish units of measurement''', a.k.a. '''Ottoman units of measurement''', is given below.

== History ==
The [[Ottoman Empire]] (1299&amp;ndash;1923), the predecessor of modern [[Turkey]] was one of the 17 signatories of the [[Metre Convention]] in 1875. For 58 years both the international and the traditional units were in use, but after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic, the traditional units became obsolete. In 1931 by Act No. 1782, international units became compulsory and the traditional units were banned from use starting 1 January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''Türkiye’nin 75 yılı'', Tempo yayınları, İstanbul, 1998, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time ==
The traditional calendar of the Ottoman Empire was, like in most [[Muslim]] countries, the [[Islamic calendar]]. Its era begins from the [[Hegira|Hijra]] in 622 CE and each year is calculated using the 12 Arabian lunar months, approximately eleven days shorter than a Gregorian solar year. In 1839, however, a second calendar was put in use for official matters. The new calendar, which was called the [[Rumi calendar|Rumi]] also began by 622, but with an annual duration equal to a solar year after 1840. In modern Turkey, the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted as the legal calendar, beginning by the end of 1925. The Islamic calendar is still used when discussing dates in an Islamic context.

{{Competition law}}
The '''Parker immunity doctrine''' is an exemption from [[Legal liability|liability]] for engaging in [[antitrust]] violations.  It applies to the state when it exercises legislative authority in creating a regulation with anticompetitive effects, and to private actors when they act at the direction of the state after it has done so.  The doctrine is named for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case in which it was initially developed, ''[[Parker v. Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Parker, Director of Agriculture, et al. v. Brown'', 317 U.S. 341 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind ''Parker'' immunity is that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, evidenced no intent to restrain state behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parker v. Brown]] at 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State must act as a sovereign==
For the doctrine to apply, the state must act as a sovereign, rather than as a "participant in a private agreement or combination by others for restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Parker'' at 351-2; see also ''Omni'', 499 U.S. at 374-5 ("Immunity does not necessarily obtain where the state acts not in a regulatory capacity but as a commercial participant in a given market").&lt;/ref&gt; Antitrust laws do not bar anticompetitive restraints that sovereign states impose "as an act of government".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parker v. Brown]]'', 317 U.S. 341, 352 (1943); see also ''[[Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Assoc.]]'', 107 F.3d 1026, 1035 (3d Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; "The key question is whether the allegedly anticompetitive restraint may be considered the product of sovereign state action. If it is not, then even if sectors of state government are involved, the activity will not constitute "state action" under the Parker doctrine and will not receive immunity."&lt;ref name="BedellWholesale"&gt;[[A.D. Bedell Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Philip Morris Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Parker court found that "a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 317 U.S. at 351.&lt;/ref&gt;Instead, the anticompetitive conduct "must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign," not merely prompted by state action, to be immunized under the state action doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar]]'', {{ussc|421|773|1975|pin=791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special definition of "state action" in Parker immunity cases==
"State action," as defined in cases granting Parker immunity, is qualitatively different from "state action" in other contexts such as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;See 1 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, supra, at P 221.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Fourteenth Amendment can cover
:inadvertent or unilateral acts of state officials not acting pursuant to state policy . . . the term "state action" in antitrust adjudication refers only to government policies that are articulated with sufficient clarity that it can be said that these are in fact the state's policies, and not simply happenstance, mistakes, or acts reflecting the discretion of individual officials.
Because it is grounded in federalism and respect for state sovereignty, this interest in protecting the acts of the  sovereign state, even if anticompetitive, outweighs the importance of a freely competitive marketplace, especially in the absence of contrary congressional intent.

"State action" as defined by the Parker doctrine differs from the government "actions" which results from petitioning. The two are not coterminous. A finding of immunity from injury caused by government action under the [[Noerr-Pennington doctrine]] does not require a finding of Parker state action.&lt;ref&gt;See 1 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, supra, at P 206 (interpreting our dicta in Massachusetts School of Law, 107 F.3d 1026 (3d Cir. 1997) as noting this distinction).&lt;/ref&gt; If the government "action" taken is the result of petitioning, Noerr-Pennington immunity attaches to a broader range of government action than does Parker immunity. Noerr-Pennington immunity protects petitioning, so long as it is not a sham.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Subscription Television v. S. Cal. Theatre Owners Ass'n]], 576 F.2d 230, 233-34 (9th Cir. 1978) (holding defendants immune from antitrust liability under Noerr-Pennington even though their petitioning led to the passage of an unconstitutional initiative).&lt;/ref&gt; Under Noerr-Pennington immunity, the government actions which flow from valid petitioning need not qualify as Parker "state action." Petitioning "would be considerably chilled by a rule which would require an advocate to predict whether the desired legislation would withstand a constitutional challenge in the courts and to expose itself to a potential treble antitrust action based on that prediction."&lt;ref&gt;Subscription Television, 576 F.2d at 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congress intended the Sherman Act to address business combination, not state combination==
Without clear congressional intent to preempt, federal laws should not invalidate state programs. "In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress."&lt;ref&gt;Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; While individual anticompetitive acts of state governments may be considered unwise or counterproductive, the decision to make such choices lies within the sovereign power of the states. Congress did not intend to override important state interests in passing the Sherman Act. "The general language of the Sherman Act should not be interpreted to prohibit anticompetitive actions by the States in their governmental capacities as sovereign regulators."&lt;ref&gt;[[City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver.]], 499 U.S. 365, 374 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sherman Act was enacted to address the unlawful combination of private businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader]], 310 U.S. 469, 493 n.15 (1940) ("The history of the Sherman Act as contained in the legislative proceedings is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that 'business competition' was the problem considered and that the act was designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect on such competition.").&lt;/ref&gt; "There is no suggestion of a purpose to restrain state action in the Act's legislative history."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 63 S. Ct. at 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sherman Act was passed "in the era of 'trusts' and of 'combinations' of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern."&lt;ref&gt;Apex, 310 U.S. at 493.&lt;/ref&gt; Given its focus on the problems of private monopolies and combinations, it is not surprising that the Sherman Act does not set out to curb clearly defined anticompetitive state actions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Assoc. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]], 445 U.S. 97, 104 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

When a state clearly acts in its sovereign capacity it avoids the constraints of the Sherman Act and may act anticompetitively to further other policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;See S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 54 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, state governments frequently sanction monopolies to ensure consistent provision of essential services like electric power, gas, cable television, or local telephone service. But "a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 317 U.S. at 351 (states cannot authorize private parties to set a price and then enforce those prices without any evaluation of their reasonableness).&lt;/ref&gt; Only an affirmative decision by the state itself, acting in its sovereign capacity, and with active supervision, can immunize otherwise anticompetitive activity.

==Midcal's two-part test for whether to treat an action as a "state action"==
Applying ''Midcal'' is unnecessary if the alleged antitrust injury was the direct result of a clear sovereign state act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover v. Am. Bar Assoc.]], 107 F.3d 1026, 1036 (3d Cir. 1997); [[Sessions Tank Liners, Inc. v. Joor Mfg.]], Inc., 17 F.3d 295, 299 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding immunity from antitrust liability where "injuries for which [the plaintiff] seeks recovery flowed directly from government action").&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Massachusetts School of Law'', the Court held that where "the states are sovereign in imposing the bar admission requirements [the alleged anticompetitive restraints], the clear articulation and active supervision requirements . . . are inapplicable."&lt;ref&gt;107 F.3d at 1036.&lt;/ref&gt; There is less need for scrutiny "when the conduct is that of the sovereign itself . . . [because] the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise."&lt;ref&gt;[[PTI, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc.]], 100 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1196 (C.D. Ca. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, concerns about the legitimacy of the action are reduced. The test to determine sufficient state involvement as sovereign is unnecessary when the state legislature or state supreme court acts directly. As the Supreme Court explained: "Closer analysis is required when the activity at issue is not directly that of the legislature or supreme court, but is carried out by others pursuant to state authorization.... When the conduct is that of the sovereign itself, on the other hand, the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise. When the conduct at issue is in fact that of the state legislature or supreme court, we need not address the issues of 'clear articulation' and 'active supervision.'&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hoover v. Ronwin]]'', {{ussc|466|558|1984|pin=568}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when it is uncertain whether an act should be treated as state action for the purposes of Parker immunity, courts apply the test set forth in ''[[California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. 97, 104 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; to "determine whether anticompetitive conduct engaged in by private parties should be deemed state action and thus shielded from the antitrust laws."&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick v. Burget]], 486 U.S. 94, 100 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; "First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself."&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. 97, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Supreme Court has recognized state legislative and judicial action as sovereign under ''Parker''. But "closer analysis is required" when the action is less directly that of the legislature or judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hoover v. Ronwin]], 466 U.S. 558, 568 (1984) (relying in part on Midcal).&lt;/ref&gt; One Court of Appeals has decided that executive officers and agencies "are entitled to Parker immunity for actions taken pursuant to their constitutional or statutory authority, regardless whether these particular actions or their anticompetitive effects were contemplated by the legislature," without the need for ''Midcal'' analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Haw., Inc.]], 810 F.2d 869, 876 (9th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Parker, by its own terms, immunizes only states. But in order to give effect to Parker immunity, private parties to state action must also be immune.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armstrong Surgical Ctr, Inc. v. Armstrong County Mem'l Hosp.]]'', 185 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir. 1999) ("If relief is sought solely for injury as to which the state would enjoy immunity under Parker, the private petitioner also enjoys immunity.").&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, plaintiffs could sue only the private parties and by winning antitrust judgments against them, could thwart state policies as if there were no state immunity. No state could enter into an agreement with private groups, even to further clear state policies, because the potential liability of the private groups would prevent them from joining. Artful pleading should not frustrate state policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., v. United States]], 471 U.S. 48, 56-57 (1985) (absent immunity for private parties, a "plaintiff could frustrate any [State] program merely by filing suit against the regulated private parties").&lt;/ref&gt; "If Parker immunity attaches, it would also reach the private participants of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|[tobacco] Multistate Settlement Agreement]]."&lt;ref name="BedellWholesale"/&gt;

In ''Midcal'', the Supreme Court clarified that requires states to meet two conditions before antitrust immunity will attach: "First, the challenged restraint must be 'one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy'; second, the policy must be 'actively supervised' by the State itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Midcal'', 445 U.S. at 105 (quoting ''City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.'', 435 U.S. 389, 410 (1978)).&lt;/ref&gt; This clearly articulated state policy may be inferred "if suppression of competition is the 'foreseeable result' of what the statute authorizes".&lt;ref&gt;''Omni'', 499 U.S. at 372-73 (quoting ''Hallie v. Eau Claire'', 471 U.S. 34, 42 (1985)).&lt;/ref&gt; Under ''Midcal'', a state "may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details. Actual state involvement, not deference to private pricefixing arrangements under the general auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from federal law."&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 633 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as state action under the ''Midcal'' test, "the challenged restraint must be one 'clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy.'"&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. at 104 (quoting ''City of Lafayette v. La. Power &amp; Light Co.'', 435 U.S. 389, 410 (1978) (opinion of Brennan, J.)).&lt;/ref&gt; A government entity need not "be able to point to a specific, detailed, legislative authorization" to assert a successful Parker defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Lafayette'', 435 U.S. at 415.&lt;/ref&gt; But it must be evident that under the "clear articulation" standard the challenged restraint is part of state policy. As the Supreme Court has stated, "Midcal confirms that while a State may not confer antitrust immunity on private persons by fiat, it may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details".&lt;ref&gt;''FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 633 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prong of the ''Midcal'' test is whether the resulting antitrust violation was "actively supervised" by the state. This standard is more problematic. The essential inquiry of the "actively supervised" prong is to determine if the "anticompetitive scheme is the State's own".&lt;ref&gt;''FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 635 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The active supervision prong "requires that state officials have and exercise power to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy."&lt;ref&gt;''Patrick v. Burget'', 486 U.S. 94, 101 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; "Absent such a program of supervision, there is no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy, rather than merely the party's individual interests." Id. at 100-01. "Such active state review is clearly necessary where private defendants are empowered with some type of discretionary authority in connection with the anticompetitive acts (e.g. to determine price or rate structures)."&lt;ref&gt;''Zimomra'', 111 F.3d at 1500.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubberstamp approval of private action does not constitute state action. A state must independently review and approve the anticompetitive behavior to satisfy this prong of the Parker doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, 486 U.S. at 101 ("The active supervision requirement mandates that the State exercise ultimate control over the challenged anticompetitive conduct."); Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 998 F.2d 1129, 1139 (3d Cir. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

A "hybrid restraint" is discussed by Justice Stevens in his concurrence in ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;458 U.S. 654, 666-67 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; They are not purely private actions, nor are they entirely attributable to the state in the manner of a legislative act. Hybrid restraints are not the type of sovereign state action found in ''Massachusetts School of Law'' or ''Zimomra'', that avoid ''Midcal'' treatment. Instead, hybrid restraints involve a degree of private action which calls for ''Midcal'' analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See Rice, 458 U.S. at 666 ("Hybrid restraints of this character require analysis that is different from a public regulatory scheme on the one hand, and a purely private restraint on the other.") (citations omitted) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''politics of outer space''' includes space treaties, [[space law|law in space]], international cooperation and conflict in [[space exploration]], and the hypothetical political impact of any contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.

'''Astropolitics''', also known as '''astropolitik''', has its foundations in [[geopolitics]] and is a theory that is used for [[outer space|space]] in its broadest sense. Astropolitics is often studied as an aspect of the [[security studies]] and [[international relations]] subfields of [[political science]]. This includes the role of space exploration in [[diplomacy]] as well as the [[military]] uses of satellites, for example, for [[surveillance]] or [[cyber warfare]].

An important aspect of the [[geopolitics]] of space is the prevention of a military threat to Earth from outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3046250/Meta-Geopolitics_of_Outer_Space-_Press_Release_June_14_2012 promotional material for "Meta-Geopolitics of Outer Space" by N. Al-Rodhan]&lt;/ref&gt; 

International cooperation on space projects has resulted in the creation of new national space agencies. By 2005 there were 35 national civilian space agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964606000245 | doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2006.02.007 | volume=22 | issue=2 | title=The changing geopolitics of space activities | year=2006 | journal=Space Policy | pages=100–109 | last1 = Peter | first1 = Nicolas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28395">'''Prosecution of gender-targeted crimes''' is the legal proceedings to prosecute crimes such as rape and domestic violence.{{Cn|date=March 2017}}  The earliest documented prosecution of gender-based/targeted crimes is from 1474 when Sir [[Peter von Hagenbach]] was convicted for rapes committed by his troops.&lt;ref name= "Luping"&gt;Luping, Diane. 2009. “Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes 	before the International Criminal Court.” Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law. 17(2): 431-492.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the trial was unsuccessful in indicting Sir von Hagenbach with the charge of rape because the war in which the rapes occurred was "undeclared" and thus the rapes were only considered illegal.&lt;ref name="Luping"/&gt; Gender-targeted crimes continued to be prosecuted, but it was not until after [[World War II]] when an international criminal tribunal- the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] (Tokyo Tribunal)- were officers charged for being responsible of the gender-targeted crimes (particularly rape) and other crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name="Luping"/&gt; Despite the various rape charges, the Charter of the Tokyo Tribunal did not make references to rape, and rape was considered as subordinate to other war crimes.&lt;ref name= "Luping"/&gt; This is also the situation for other tribunals that followed, but with the establishments of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), there was more attention to the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes with each of the statutes explicitly referring to rape and other forms of gender-targeted violence.&lt;ref name= "Luping"/&gt;

==Types of gender-targeted crimes==

Domestic violence covers a wide range of gender-targeted crimes such as rape and honor killings. As many women, who make up a majority of the victims, deny they are facing domestic violence, there are not enough reliable statistics on [[Domestic violence]]. Due to the lack of information, violence against women is often dismissed as a "private" matter and no legal action is done.&lt;ref name= "Seager"/&gt;

Despite the reforms that will be mentioned in the "Rape" section below, there is still a continuous debate over how the trials of the crimes should be conducted and over the effectiveness of the prosecution.&lt;ref name= "Dempsey"&gt;Dempsey, Michelle Madden. 2007. “Toward a Feminist State: What Does ‘Effective’ Prosecution of Domestic Violence Mean?” ''The Modern Law Review''. 70(6): 908-935.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Violence Against Women Act]], which was passed in 1994, paved the way in providing services and resources for women facing abuse and other forms of violence. However, there are limits on gender-targeted crimes reaching the Supreme Court and many are given to the state governments to oversee.&lt;ref name= "Resnik"&gt;Resnick, Judith. 2001. “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe.” ''The Yale Law Journal.'' 111(3): 619-680.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in the UK conducted from 2011 to 2012 found that false claims of rape and domestic violence are uncommon.&lt;ref name= "Bowcott"&gt;Bowcott, Owen. "Rape investigations 'undermined by belief that false accusations are rife'." ''The Guardian.'' 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of frequent false accusations came about after the police and investigators began to follow an "over-cautious approach" when addressing reports of domestic violence. However, the study showed there were only a few false allegations during seventeen months over 2011-2012.&lt;ref name= "Bowcott"/&gt; The study revealed that during the seventeen months, there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape and 111,891 for domestic violence in England and Wales, and in the same timespan, there were thirty-five prosecutions for making false allegations of rape, six prosecutions for false allegations of domestic violence, and three for false allegations of both crimes.&lt;ref name= "Bowcott"/&gt; Following the study and the eleven percent increase of reported cases of domestic violence in the last three months of 2012, there have been enhancements in the handling of the reported crimes with random checks of cases to ensure the correct handling of the prosecution of the cases.&lt;ref name= "Bowcott"/&gt;

====Rape====
Before there were reforms in [[rape]] laws{{Where?|date=March 2017}} and special units to prosecute rape crimes, rape was a difficult case to prosecute as a crime; this is due to issue of consent,  the need to provide sufficient evidence to charge the accused, and sometime biased cultural depictions of sexuality and gender.&lt;ref name= "Martin"&gt;Martin, Patricia Yancey. 1997. “Gender, Accounts, and Rape Processing Work.” ''Social Problems.'' 44(4): 464-482.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution largely relies on organizations, advocacy groups, or social movements such as the [[Anti-rape movement]] in order to be effective.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; The difficulties can also bring negative consequences upon the victims. For example in the United States, a study in the 1980s found that the rape victims who went through the prosecution system had a slower recovery process than those who were not prosecuted.&lt;ref name= "Martin"/&gt;

In the United States, the late 1980s saw a nationwide movement of women's groups lobbying for reforms in [[rape]] laws. Their main goal was to prosecute rape in the similar manner that other crimes are prosecuted by focusing not on the victim's reputation or behavior but on the unlawful acts perpetrated by the offender.&lt;ref name= "Horney"&gt;Horney, Julia and Spohn, Cassia. 1991. “Rape Law Reform and Instrumental Change in Six Urban Jurisdictions.” ''Law &amp; Society Review'', 25(1): 117-154.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also urged to have new laws improve the treatment of rape victims, and it hoped to have an increase in the number of reports of rape.&lt;ref name= "Horney"/&gt; The movement eventually led to rape law reforms for all fifty states.&lt;ref name= "Horney"/&gt; States varied in their reforms, but the common changes that resulted from the reforms were:

*1) Changes in the definition of rape: include a more diverse range of sexual assaults such as identifying men as potential victims, women as potential perpetrators, and recognizing sexual assaults by a spouse &lt;ref name= "Horney"/&gt;
*2) Elimination of the resistance requirement: Reformers argued that resistance could lead to more injuries and that the law should focus on the actions of the offender rather than those of the victim &lt;ref name= "Horney"/&gt;
*3) Elimination of the corroboration requirement: Before the reform, rape was the only crime, which required  corroborated testimony of the victim &lt;ref name= "Horney"/&gt;
*4) Enactment of a rape shield law: The sexual history or incidents prior to the assault of the victim can no longer be used against the victim since it was argued that this information provides little, if any, evidence for the trial &lt;ref name="Horney"/&gt;

In India after the [[2012 Delhi gang rape case]] amendments were made to the laws concerning rape with more specific protocols towards the trial proceedings.&lt;ref name= "Nundy"&gt;Nundy, Karuna. "Explaining India's new anti-rape laws." ''BBC News.'' 27 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The new law, [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013]], also defines new crimes such as stalking and [[voyeurism]], expands the definition of rape, and brings higher sentences for punishment of the offenders (such as the death penalty for repeated offenders and for cases resulting in the victim's death).&lt;ref name= "Nundy"/&gt; The law was passed by India's Parliament on March 2013, and with the passing of this law, it is also a crime for the police to refuse to open cases for sexual attack allegations.&lt;ref name= "Ravi"&gt;Nessman, Ravi. "India Rape Law: Parliament Passes Strict Sexual Violence Legislation." ''Associated Press.'' 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marital rape is a form of [[sexual abuse]] and [[domestic violence]]. It is today increasingly criminalized around the world, but not all countries recognize it as a crime. Several countries in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking [[Western World]] outlawed it much later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s. In many countries of the world marital rape laws are very new, having been enacted during the 2000s. In 2006, the UN Secretary General found that: "Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 States. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 {{sic}} do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006 several other countries have made marital rape illegal.

In December 1993, the [[United Nations]] [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] published the ''[[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]]''. This establishes marital rape as a [[human rights]] violation.

The idea that marriage grants either spouse's consent to sex formed the basis for the reason why marital rape is not a universally accepted crime.&lt;ref name="Elbe"&gt;Elbe, Stefan. (2002). "HIV/AIDs and the Changing Landscape of War in Africa." ''International Security'', 27(2): 159-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional perceptions of marriage and of women contribute to the reasons why marital rape is not universally identified as crime. Wives were regarded as the property of the husband, and therefore the husband was not responsible for a crime when he raped his wife since he did not infringe on another man's property rights.&lt;ref name= "Elbe"/&gt; In the early 18th century of England, Blackstone's common law united the husband and the wife into a single legal entity upon marriage with the husband having the control of this entity.&lt;ref name= "Elbe"/&gt; Although this view evolved to having independent rights for the wife, the concept of marital rape not as a crime went on with few challenges. In 1958, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica's'' definition of rape stated as "A husband cannot commit rape upon his wife unless she is legally separated from him." &lt;ref name= "Elbe"/&gt;

In the United States, criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s, but it was not until the 1990s when action in regards to marital rape was followed through. Although all fifty states recognized marital rape as a crime on July 5, 1993, not all states treat marital rape the same as other forms of rape (see [[Marital rape#United States]]).

In South Asia, marital rape falls under [[Family law]] rather than criminal law. Marital rape cannot be prosecuted in India and Sri Lanka, unless the couple is separated. The religious laws tend to undermine the legal recognition of marital rape.&lt;ref name= "Savitri"&gt;Goonesekere, Savitri.  "Violence, Law, and Women's Rights in South Asia," UNIFEM.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honor killings====
There is very poor data on the practice of [[Honor killing]] (also known as honor violence) due to the fact that many do not get reported or happen in remote areas or are classified as a different form of crime.&lt;ref name= "CBS News"&gt;Dahl, Julia. (2012). "'Honor killing' under growing scrutiny in the U.S." ''CBS News''&lt;/ref&gt; This is the situation for the international data and American data, but for American data, no national or state agency collects data on honor violence.&lt;ref name= "CBS News"/&gt; However, the practice of honor killings do occur with the family committing acts of honor killing believing that the daughter has become too Westernized and/or after she has refused to follow traditional customs such as arranged marriages.&lt;ref name= "CBS News"/&gt; For example, in Phoenix, Arizona, the police arrested a man for murder after he ran down his 20-year-old daughter for refusing to accept an arranged marriage to a man in the family's native country of Iraq.&lt;ref name= "CBS News"/&gt; The prosecution of such crimes are carried out in the United States, but the crimes are not identified as honor killings under a form of law.&lt;ref name= "Chesler"&gt;Chesler, Phyllis. (2009). "Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?" ''Middle East Quarterly'' 16(2): 61-69.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the lack of using the label "honor killings" and instead using the all-encompassing label of "domestic violence" prevents the public from seeing the key differences between honor killings and domestic violence and also prevents any policies limiting and ultimately, putting an end, to the honor killings.&lt;ref name= "Chesler"/&gt;

Although a law in 2004 made honor killings illegal in Pakistan, honor killings still occur in Pakistan largely because of the lack of strict enforcement and the tendency of the legal system following the religious law.&lt;ref name= "Kwame"&gt;Kwame, Anthony Appiah. (2010). "The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen." W.W. Norton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; By creating laws that aligned legal laws with Islamic law, the [[Hudood Ordinance]] of Pakistan, enacted in 1979, created obstacles for women victimized of gender-based crimes.&lt;ref name= "Imran"&gt;Imran, Rahat. (2005). "Legal Injustices: ''The Zina Hudood Ordinance'' of Pakistan and Its Implications for Women." ''Journal of International Women's Studies. 7(2): 78-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were required to provide four male witnesses, but if they were unable to do so, the case is not prosecuted. For women who are married, they face the punishment for having sex outside of marriage, which range from stoning to public lashing, and some families will commit honor killings  due to the dishonor she has brought upon the family.&lt;ref name= "Kwame"/&gt; A bill removed the four male witnesses requirement of the Hudood Ordinances in 2006, but there are allegations that the police force and other law enforcing officials are not necessarily enforcing the law and bill.&lt;ref name= "Kwame"/&gt; Women rights advocacy groups have pressured the Pakistani government to respond to the deficiencies, but in March 2005, a bill that sought to strengthen the law against the practice of honor killing was rejected by the Pakistani parliament after being declared as un-Islamic by a majority vote.&lt;ref name= "Pakistan"&gt;"Pakistan rejects pro-women bill." 2005. ''BBC News.''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female genital mutilation====
[[Female genital mutilation]] (also referred as FGM) is a common case of [[Infibulation|genital mutilation]]. The act has been practiced in parts of Africa for centuries, but after the United Nations made recommendations in its [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), in the present times, many nations such as Ghana and Egypt have placed laws stopping the practice of FGM through legal means.&lt;ref name= "Ako"&gt;Ako, Matilda Aberese. (2009). "The limited effectiveness of legislation against female genital mutilation and the role of community beliefs in Upper East Region, Ghana." ''Reproductive Health Matters.'' 17(34): 47-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these laws, FGM continues to be practiced in the communities.&lt;ref name= "Ako"/&gt; In Egypt, FGM is banned by ministerial health decree and not in federal law as of 2007, but FGM is a prevalent practice in Egypt with 90% or more prevalence in girls and women between fifteen and forty-nine years of age.&lt;ref name= "Seager"/&gt; 90% of girls who went through FGM were under fourteen years old.&lt;ref name= "Seager"/&gt; Additionally, an estimated 90% of the procedures are done by doctors or other trained medical personnel.&lt;ref name= "Seager"/&gt; In January 2015 Raslan Fadl, a doctor, became the first in Egypt to be convicted of FGM, following an appeal of his acquittal of the manslaughter of Sohair al-Bataa during an FGM procedure. He was sentenced to two years in jail for manslaughter plus three months for the FGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingsley|first1=Patrick|title=Doctor jailed after Egypt's first FGM conviction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/26/doctor-jailed-egypt-first-fgm-conviction|accessdate=February 9, 2015|date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FGM came about to the attention of the American public with a U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals case in which a 17-year-old girl from Togo fled to the U.S. after being forced into a polygamous marriage and told she was to face genital mutilation. The girl was eventually granted asylum&lt;ref name= "Rena"&gt;Justice, Rena Marie. (2006). "Prosecution of Female Genital Mutilation in the United States." American Prosecutors Research Institute. 19(7): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1996, Congress enacted the "Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act," which prohibits FGM on persons under 18 years old.&lt;ref name= "Rena"/&gt; A landmark case is that of [[Khalid Adem]] who was the first person prosecuted and convicted of FGM in the United States after he circumcised his 2 year-old daughter.&lt;ref name= "Father jailed"&gt;"Father jailed for US mutilation." ''BBC News.'' 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A native from Ethiopia and living in Georgia, Adem, circumcised his young daughter with a pair of scissors, and the young girl's mother did not find out about the act until two year later.&lt;ref name= "Patricia"&gt;Broussard, Patricia A. (2008) "Female Genital Mutilation: Exploring Strategies for Ending Ritualized Torture; Shaming, Blaming, and Utilizing the Convention against Torture." ''Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy." 15(19): 19-47.&lt;/ref&gt; After this case, Georgia enacted a law specifically forbidding the practice of FGM, but Adem, while originally facing forty years in prison, was only sentenced to ten years.&lt;ref name= "Patricia"/&gt; Adem's case was the not first case involving FGM for in 2004, two California residents were arrested for conspiring to perform on FGM on young girls.&lt;ref name= "Patricia"/&gt;

The first prosecution for FGM in the UK took place in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=Two men first to be charged in UK under FGM Act|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/21/fgm-female-genital-mutilation-men-charged|accessdate=February 9, 2015|date=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International proceedings==
===International Criminal Court===
The [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) was adopted in 1998 to specifically address war crimes and make advances in the prosecution of crimes committed against women.&lt;ref name= "Oosterveld"&gt;Oosterveld, Valerie. 1999. “The Making of a Gender-Sensitive International Criminal Court.” ''International Law FORUM Du Droit International.'' 1(1): 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], which established the ICC, ensures effective prosecution of all crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC and particularly mentions crimes involving sexual violence.&lt;ref name= "Luping"/&gt; The ICC appointed a Special Gender Advisor to specially manage the crimes of gender-targeted violence.&lt;ref name="Luping"/&gt;

The United States has not officially joined as a member state of the ICC since it has not ratified the Rome Statute for the ICC. The lack of United State's ratifying the statute is considered as limiting the potential of the ICC to prosecute the gender-targeted crimes.&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;Phelps, Andrea R. 2006. “Gender-Based War Crimes: Incidence and Effectiveness of International Criminal Prosecution.” ''William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law'', 12 (2): 499-520.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribunals===
A [[Tribunal]] is a governmental body that makes up courts with a special jurisdiction. As ad hoc courts, they have specific purposes and are created in a response to certain situations. When it comes to gender-targeted crimes, tribunals hear the trials of the related crimes. Two examples of tribunals that have carried out trials of gender-targeted crimes are the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). These two tribunals have particularly focused on gender-based crimes while other tribunals have not.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Askin, Kelly. "Sexual Violence in Decisions and Indictments of the Yugoslav and Rwandan Tribunals: Current Status." ''The American Journal of International Law''. (93)2: 97-123.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, another failure that the Tokyo Tribunal was its omission to call the female victims to give evidence at trial.&lt;ref name="Luping"/&gt; The ICTR and ICTY have made improvements in regards to effectively prosecuting gender-targeted crimes and have carried out indictments that charge the accused with gender-based violence other than just rape charges.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; Women serve in high-level positions of both tribunals and have a prominent role in the prosecution of the gender-based crimes.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; This has allowed more cases to be heard as the female investigators and lawyers are able to reach out to the victims.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

====International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)====
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) was established in November 1994 by the [[United Nations Security Council]] with jurisdiction over the crimes committed during the [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; For its first rape indictment, it took the ICTR three years to proceed.&lt;ref name="Heidi"&gt;Haddad,Heidi. (2001). "Mobilizing the Will to Prosecute: Crimes of Rape at the Yugoslav and Rwandan Tribunals." ''Human Rights Review.'' 12(1): 109-132&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after the establishment of the ICTR, a sexual assault unit of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) was created with three legal officers, one psychologist, one nurse, two lawyers, two policewomen, and one policeman.&lt;ref name="Heidi"/&gt; Under the ICTR, the sexual assault unit of the (OTP) created a policy to specifically carry out the legal proceedings of rape, genital mutilation, and other gender-targeted crimes.&lt;ref name="Obote"&gt;Obote-Odora, Alex. (2005). "Rape and Sexual Violence in International Law: ICTR Contribution." ''New England Journal of International and Comparative Law'', 12(1): 135-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The OTP also has a Rape and Sexual Violence Section.&lt;ref name="Obote"/&gt; This section under the OTP is headed by a female lawyer-investigator, and the OTP use female investigators and trial lawyers to reach out to the victims of rape and sexual violence, who are mostly women.&lt;ref name="Obote"/&gt; Before the OTP, it was difficult to prosecute crimes of sexual violence under international criminal law, and because of these aspects, the OTP is considered to have founded the legal developments in the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes in international law.&lt;ref name="Obote"/&gt;

=====Prosecutor v. Akayesu=====
A landmark case conducted by the OTP is the 1998 conviction of the mayor of Taba commune in south Rwanda, [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], who directed acts of sexual violence on Tutsi girls and women in the Taba commune.&lt;ref name="Obote"/&gt; Akayesu was the first person to be convicted of rape and sexual violence charges by an international court, and the case also represented the first international war crimes trial to convict a defendant for the crime of genocide.&lt;ref name="Obote"/&gt; The case broke through the criminal networks that attempted to protect high-status, powerful political figures such as Akayesu who while not directly carrying out the slaughter, gave out undocumented orders for the mass killings.&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;Phelps, Andrea R. "Gender-Based War Crimes: Incidence and Effectiveness of International Criminal Prosecution." ''William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law'', 12(2): 499-520.&lt;/ref&gt; The case also made the following significant changes&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

* Recognized sexual violence as a fundamental part of the Rwandan Genocide&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;
* Identified rape and other forms of gender-targeted violence as separate crimes of crimes against humanity&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;
* Provided internationally accepted definitions for rape and sexual violence&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;
:* Rape is defined as “a physical invasion of a sexual nature, committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive”&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;
:* Sexual violence is defined as to “[include] rape, is considered to be any act of a sexual nature which is committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive” &lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

====International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)====
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] was established in 1993 by the [[United Nations Security Council]] to conduct the trials of crimes committed during the [[Yugoslav Wars]].&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; Feminist activists played a part in creating the structure of the ICTY over the gender-targeted crimes, and states and international organizations urged criminalizing rape with the main argument that the [[Geneva Conventions]] provided the context. This led to the ICTY Statue specifically listing rape as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="Engle"&gt;Engle, Karen. 2005. "Feminism and Its (Dis)contents: Criminalizing Wartime Rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina." ''The American Journal of International Law,'' 99(4): 778-816&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the ICTY, there is a "Legal Advisor for Gender-related Crimes" position that directs the prosecution's dealings with gender-based crimes similar to the one made in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt; ICTY has a Victims and Witnesses Unit that provides support and counseling to victims and witnesses particularly in rape and sexual assault cases, and the unit is employed by women.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

Three cases- ''Čelebići,'' ''Furundžija,'' and ''Kunarac''- are examples of the ICTY making indictments of gender-targeted violence.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

In ''Kunarac,'' The ICTY convicted Serbian men of confining Bosnian Muslim women under the charges of enslavement, which was listed as a crime against humanity in the Statue.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt; There are arguments that the accused should have been found guilty of sexual slavery and of genocide rather than enslavement &lt;ref name= "Engle"/&gt;

Furundžija was a commander of the Jokers- a unit of the Bosnian Croatian Militia, which allegedly attacked villages of Bosnian Muslims through imprisonment, murder, sexual abuse, and other forms of violence- he was accused of participating in the torture involving forced sexual intercourse of a woman at the Jokers' headquarters.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; The prosecution depended on the testimony of the woman, and this drew debate over the credibility of the victim's memory.&lt;ref name= "Kelly"/&gt; The case led to the concern for the survivors of traumatic events in addition to the victims.&lt;ref name= "Kelly"/&gt;

The Čelebići case found four men guilty for committing various acts of violence while detaining Bosnian Muslims in a prison camp.&lt;ref name="Celebici"&gt;UN ICTY. ''Press Release of Celebici Case: The Judgement of the Trial Chamber.''&lt;/ref&gt; The case is noteworthy for clarifying that the ones responsible of such events include "not only military commanders, but also civilians holding positions of authority..." and "not only persons in de jure positions but also those in such position de facto..." &lt;ref name="Celebici"/&gt; It is also the first conviction of an accused person for the charges of rape by the ICTY &lt;ref name="Celebici"/&gt;

'''Racial polarization''' is the process whereby a population, the individuals of which have varying degrees of diversity in their ancestry, is divided into separate, and distinct (from each other) [[Race (human classification)|racial]] groups.

==Bermuda==
In Bermuda, around 55% of the population is identified as black, followed by 34% white (further subdivided into a British-descended majority and a Portuguese-descended minority), while the remainder are [[mulatto|mixed]] or other (chiefly Asian).

Politically the territory's two political parties are often described along racial lines, the [[United Bermuda Party]] (UBP) being supported by Bermuda's white minority, while the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] (PLP) is supported by the black majority.  In terms of popular support, few whites would not vote for the UBP (In an April 2009 poll, some 85% of whites would vote for the party, while only 4% would vote PLP), while black voters favoured the PLP (in the aforementioned poll, 62% of blacks would vote PLP, 14% UBP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d9543330030003&amp;sectionId=60 Poll shows increased support for Dr. Brown, Paula Cox and Kim Swan]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  White rejection of the PLP is often linked to repeated racist rhetoric from the party,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?sectionId=60&amp;articleId=7d924bf30030000 We must address black people's frustrations]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed not only at whites but at black opponents, who have been referred to as "house niggers" ([[race traitors]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d5b7923003000a&amp;sectionId=60 Race row erupts over Burch show]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The party has even been described as a "[[write-off]]" in terms of diversity by members of the Portuguese-Bermudian community, which is often regarded as a separate ethnic/racial group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d3a88e30030008&amp;sectionId=75 UBP's Gibbons takes heat for party's lack of diversity]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black rejection of the UBP stems from associating the party with [[racial segregation]] and [[slavery]]; while formed in the 1960s, white [[old money]] that was involved in those institutions supports the party.  Within the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda]], there is negligible white presence, with only five white [[member of parliament|MPs]] (four UBP and one PLP) out of thirty-six (around 14%); in the appointed [[Senate of Bermuda]], the white presence is three out of eleven (around 27%).

Economically the advantage lies in the white population, with white holding higher positions and earning higher incomes;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portalimages.gov.bm/CURE/downloads/work_force_survey/2002_work_force_survey_report_0.pdf 2002 Work Force Survey Report]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; these figures do not distinguish between Bermudians and temporary [[expatriate]] workers, however, leading to exaggerated figures stemming from the hire of executives from the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (thus, typically white), and the hire of unskilled, poorly treated labourers from the [[Caribbean]], [[Jamaica]] in particular,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.go-jamaica.com/news/read_article.php?id=7302 Jamaicans complain of abuse in Bermuda]&lt;/ref&gt; (thus, typically black) and so leave their relevance unknown.

==Malaysia==
Sociologist Dr Syed Farid Alatas pointed out "We do not live according to the three principles for harmonious relations – recognising the multi-cultural origins of civilization, inter-religious encounters and showing respect and understanding the point of the other," "We have little appreciation for each other’s religion and culture." "Our education system does not inculcate these attitudes in us but instead tends to polarise us. We have little appreciation for each other’s religion and culture. In China, there is a strong interaction between Islam and Chinese culture." He also said "Dialogue is a matter of national integration but the Malaysian education system does not inculcate the three pre-requisites for inter-religious cooperation and relations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/5/nation/21747726&amp;sec=nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714071342/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F7%2F5%2Fnation%2F21747726&amp;sec=nation |date=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked why this was so, Rais stated that in national schools, there is "too much religion, too much Islam. They became frightened. That is the big impediment to the races studying together under one roof." He then recommended "Have religious classes by all means. But keep away Islam from other aspects of life in the school. No doa (Muslim prayers) at the assembly, no doa in the classroom except during religious classes." (see [[Issues in Malaysian Education]])

{{Anthropology}}
In the [[social science]]s, '''social structure''' is the patterned social arrangements in [[society]] that are both [[emergence|emergent]] from and determinant of the [[Structure and agency|actions of the individuals]]. On the [[Macrosociology|macro]] scale, social structure is the system of socioeconomic [[social stratification|stratification]] (e.g., the class structure), [[social institutions]], or, other patterned relations between large social groups. On the meso scale, it is the structure of [[social network]] ties between individuals or organizations. On the micro scale, it can be the way [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] shape the behavior of individuals within the [[social system]].

[[Norm (social)|Social norms]] influence social structure through relations between the majority and the minority.  Because those who align with the majority are considered [[normality (behavior)|normal]] while those who align with the minority are considered [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormal]], majority-minority relations create a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] stratification within social structures that favors the majority in all aspects of society.

These scales are not always kept separate. For example, recent scholarship by [[John Levi Martin]] has theorized that certain macro-scale structures are the [[emergent properties]] of micro-scale cultural institutions (this meaning of "structure" resembles that used by anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]). Likewise, another recent study, in ethnography, describes how indigenous social structure in the Republic of Panama changed macro social structures and impeded a planned Panama Canal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marxist sociology]] also has a history of mixing different meanings of social structure, though it has done so by simply treating the cultural aspects of social structure as [[epiphenomena]] of its economic ones.

Since the 1920s, the term has been in general use in social science,&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Robert. 1938. ''Social Structure and Anomie''. American Sociological Review, Vol. 3, No.5, pp.672-682&lt;/ref&gt; especially as a variable whose sub-components needed to be distinguished in relationship to other sociological variables.

==Overview==
The notion of social structure ''as relationship between different entities or groups'' or as ''enduring and relatively stable patterns of relationship''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olanike|first=Deji|title=Gender and Rural Development  By|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=as+relationships+between+different+entities+or+groups+or+as+enduring+and+relatively+stable+patterns+of+relationship+emphasises#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20relationships%20between%20different%20entities%20or%20groups%20or%20as%20enduring%20and%20relatively%20stable%20patterns%20of%20relationship%20emphasises&amp;f=false|isbn=9783643901033|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises the idea that society is grouped into structurally related groups or sets of [[role]]s, with different functions, meanings or purposes. One example of social structure is the idea of "[[social stratification]]", which refers to the idea that most societies are separated into different strata (levels), guided (if only partially) by the underlying structures in the social system. This approach has been important in the academic literature with the rise of various forms of [[structuralism]]. It is important in the modern study of organizations, because an organization's structure may determine its flexibility, capacity to change, and many other factors. Therefore, structure is an important issue for [[management]].

Social structure may be seen to influence important social systems including the [[economic system]], [[legal system]], [[political system]], [[cultural system]], and others. [[Family]], [[religion]], [[law]], [[economy]], and [[Social class|class]] are all social structures. The "social system" is the parent system of those various systems that are embedded in it.

==History==
The early study of social structures has informed the study of institutions, culture and agency, social interaction, and history. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was apparently the first to use the term social structure; later, [[Karl Marx]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Max Weber]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], and [[Émile Durkheim]] all contributed to structural concepts in sociology. Weber investigated and analyzed the institutions of modern society: [[Market (economics)|market]], [[bureaucracy]] (private enterprise and public administration), and politics (e.g. democracy).

One of the earliest and most comprehensive accounts of social structure was provided by Karl Marx, who related political, cultural, and religious life to the [[mode of production]] (an underlying economic structure). Marx argued that the economic [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|base]] substantially determined the cultural and political [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|superstructure]] of a society. Subsequent Marxist accounts, such as that by [[Louis Althusser]], proposed a more complex relationship that asserted the relative autonomy of cultural and political institutions, and a general determination by economic factors only "in the last instance".&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;Dictionary of the Social Science, "''Social Structure''" article&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] first published his study ''The Present Problems of Social Structure'' in the U.S.A,&lt;ref&gt;''The [[American Journal of Sociology]]'', vol. 10, 1905, no. 5, p. 569-688&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that only the ''constitution'' of a multitude into a unity creates a "social structure" (basing this approach on his concept of [[will (sociology)|social will]]).

[[Émile Durkheim]] (drawing on the analogies between biological and social systems popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]] and others) introduced the idea that diverse social institutions and practices played a role in assuring the functional integration of society through assimilation of diverse parts into a unified and self-reproducing whole. In this context, Durkheim distinguished two forms of structural relationship: [[mechanical solidarity]] and [[organic solidarity]]. The former describes structures that unite similar parts through a shared culture; the latter describes differentiated parts united through social exchange and material interdependence.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

As did Marx and Weber, more generally, [[Georg Simmel]] developed a wide-ranging approach that provided observations and insights into domination and subordination,  competition, division of labor, formation of parties, representation, inner solidarity coupled with exclusiveness toward the outside, and many similar features in the state, in a religious community, in an economic association, in an art school, and in family and kinship networks (however diverse the interests that give rise to these associations, the forms in which interests are realized may yet be identical (Crothers, 1996)).

The notion of social structure was extensively developed in the 20th century, with key contributions from [[structuralism|structuralist]] perspectives drawing on the theories of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], Feminist or Marxist perspectives, from [[structural functionalism|functionalist]] perspectives such as those developed by [[Talcott Parsons]] and his followers, or from a variety of analytic perspectives (see Blau 1975, Lopez and Scott 2000). Some follow Marx in trying to identify the basic dimensions of society that explain the other dimensions, most emphasizing either economic production or political power. Others follow Lévi-Strauss in seeking logical order in cultural structures. Still others, notably [[Peter Blau]], follow Simmel in attempting to base a formal theory of social structure on numerical patterns in relationships—analyzing, for example, the ways in which factors like [[Group size measures|group size]] shape intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

The notion of social structure is intimately related to a variety of central topics in social science, including the relation of [[structure and agency]]. The most influential attempts to combine the concept of social structure with agency are [[Anthony Giddens]]' [[theory of structuration]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s [[practice theory]]. Giddens emphasizes the duality of structure and agency, in the sense that structures and agency cannot be conceived apart from one another. This permits him to argue that structures are neither independent of actors nor determining of their behavior, but rather sets of rules and competencies on which actors draw, and which, in the aggregate, they reproduce. Giddens's analysis, in this respect, closely parallels [[Jacques Derrida]]'s deconstruction of the binaries that underlie classic sociological and anthropological reasoning (notably the universalizing tendencies of Lévi-Strauss's structuralism). Bourdieu's practice theory also seeks a more supple account of social structure as embedded in, rather than determinative of, individual behavior.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

Other recent work by [[Margaret Archer]] (morphogenesis theory), [[Tom R. Burns]] and collaborators ([[actor-system dynamics theory]] and [[social rule system theory]]), and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] ([[World Systems Theory]]) provided elaborations and applications of the sociological classics in structural sociology.

==Definitions and concepts==
As noted above, social structure has been identified as
* the relationship of definite entities or groups to each other,
* enduring patterns of behaviour by participants in a social system in relation to each other, and
* institutionalised norms or cognitive frameworks that structure the actions of actors in the social system.

Lopez and Scott (2000) distinguish between ''institutional structure'' and ''relational structure'', where in the former:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising those cultural or normative patterns that define the expectations of agents hold about each other's behaviour and that organize their enduring relations with each other.'' (p. 3)}}

whereas in the latter:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising the relationships themselves, understood as patterns of causal interconnection and interdependence among agents and their actions, as well as the positions that they occupy.'' (p. 3)}}

Social structure can also be divided into [[Microsociology|microstructure]] and [[Macrosociology|macrostructure]]. Microstructure is the pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social structure of their own (for example, pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals - where individuals have no social structure, or a structure of organizations as a pattern of relations between [[social position]]s or [[social role]]s, where those positions and roles have no structure by themselves). Macrostructure is thus a kind of 'second level' structure, a pattern of relations between objects that have their own structure (for example, a political social structure between political parties, as political parties have their own social structure). Some types of social structures that modern sociologist differentiate are ''relation structures'' (in family or larger family-like clan structures), ''communication structures'' (how information is passed in organizations) and ''[[sociometry|sociometric structures]]'' (structures of sympathy, antipathy and indifference in organisations - this was studied by [[Jacob L. Moreno]]).

[[Social rule system theory]] reduces the structures of (3) to particular rule system arrangements, that is, the types of basic structures of (1 and 2). It shares with [[role theory]], [[organizational sociology|organizational]] and [[institutional sociology]], and [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] the concern with structural properties and developments and at the same time provides detailed conceptual tools needed to generate interesting, fruitful propositions and models and analyses.

Sociologists also distinguish between:
* normative structure – pattern of relations in given structure (organisation) between [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and modes of operations of people of varying [[social position]]s
* ideal structure – pattern of relations between beliefs and views of people of varying social positions
* interest structure – pattern of relations between goals and desires of people of varying social positions
* interaction structure – forms of communications of people of varying social positions

==Origins and development==
Some believe that social structure is naturally developed. It may be caused by larger system needs, such as the need for [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[management]], [[professional]] and [[military]] classes, or by conflicts between groups, such as competition among [[political party|political parties]] or among [[elite]]s and [[Hoi polloi|masses]]. Others believe that this structuring is not a result of natural processes, but is socially constructed. It may be created by the power of elites who seek to retain their power, or by [[economic system]]s that place emphasis upon [[competition]] or [[cooperation]].  

Ethnography has contributed to understandings about social structure by revealing local practices and customs that differ from Western practices of hierarchy and economic power in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most thorough account of the evolution of social structure is perhaps provided by [[structure and agency]] accounts that allow for a sophisticated analysis of the co-evolution of social structure and human agency, where socialised agents with a degree of autonomy take action in social systems where their action is on the one hand mediated by existing institutional structure and expectations but may, on the other hand, influence or transform that institutional structure.  

==Critical implications==
The notion of social structure may mask systematic biases, as it involves many identifiable subvariables, for example, gender. Some argue that men and women who have otherwise equal qualifications receive different treatment in the workplace because of their gender, which would be termed a "social structural" bias, but other variables (such as time on the job or hours worked) might be masked. Modern social structural analysis takes this into account through [[multivariate analysis]] and other techniques, but the analytic problem of how to combine various aspects of social life into a whole remains.&lt;ref&gt;Aberration, t AL., 2000; Jay &amp; Vary 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[theoretical physics]], the '''spin tensor''' is a quantity used to describe the rotational motion of particles in [[spacetime]]. The tensor has application in 
[[general relativity]] and [[special relativity]], as well as [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], and [[quantum field theory]].

The [[Euclidean group]] SE(d) of [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]] is generated by [[translation]]s and [[rotation]]s. Its [[Lie algebra]] is written &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{se}(d)&lt;/math&gt;.

This article uses [[Cartesian coordinates]] and [[tensor index notation]].

==Background on Noether currents==

The [[Noether current]] for translations in space is momentum, while the current for increments in time is energy. These two statements combine into one in spacetime: translations in spacetime, i.e. a displacement between two events, is generated by the four-momentum ''P''. Conservation of four-momentum is given by the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\nu T^{\mu\nu}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stress–energy tensor]], and ∂ are [[partial derivative]]s that make up the [[four gradient]] (in non-Cartesian coordinates this must be replaced by the [[covariant derivative]]). Integrating over spacetime:

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^4 x T^{\mu 0}(\vec{x},t) = P^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

gives the [[four-momentum]] vector at time ''t''.

The Noether current for a rotation about the point ''y'' is given by a tensor of 3rd order, denoted &lt;math&gt;M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_y&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the [[Lie algebra]] relations

:&lt;math&gt;M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_y(x)=M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_0(x)+y^\alpha T^{\beta\mu}(x)-y^\beta T^{\alpha\mu}(x)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the 0 subscript indicates the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] (unlike momentum, angular momentum depends on the origin), the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^4 x M^{\mu\nu}_0(\vec{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;

gives the angular momentum tensor &lt;math&gt;M^{\mu\nu} \,&lt;/math&gt; at time ''t''.

==Definition==

The '''spin tensor''' is defined at a point '''x''' to be the value of the Noether current at '''x''' of a rotation about ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha\beta\mu}(\mathbf{x})\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_x(\mathbf{x})=M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_0(\mathbf{x})+x^\alpha T^{\beta\mu}(\mathbf{x})-x^\beta T^{\alpha\mu}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;

The continuity equation

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_0=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

implies:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu S^{\alpha\beta\mu}=T^{\beta\alpha}-T^{\alpha\beta} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore, the [[stress–energy tensor]] is not a [[symmetric tensor]].

The quantity ''S'' is the density of [[spin (physics)|spin]] angular momentum (spin in this case is not only for a point-like particle, but also for an extended body), and ''M'' is the density of orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum is always the sum of spin and orbital contributions.

The relation:

:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij} - T_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

gives the [[torque]] density showing the rate of conversion between the orbital angular momentum and spin.

==Examples==

Examples of materials with a nonzero spin density are [[molecular fluid]]s, the [[electromagnetic field]] and [[turbulent fluid]]s. For molecular fluids, the individual molecules may be spinning. The electromagnetic field can have [[circularly polarized light]]. For turbulent fluids, we may arbitrarily make a distinction between long wavelength phenomena and short wavelength phenomena. A long wavelength [[vorticity]] may be converted via turbulence into tinier and tinier vortices transporting the angular momentum into smaller and smaller wavelengths while simultaneously reducing the [[vorticity]]. This can be approximated by the [[eddy viscosity]].

'''Splitting''' (also called '''black-and-white thinking''' or '''all-or-nothing thinking''') is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the [[dichotomy]] of both positive and negative qualities of the self and others into a cohesive, realistic whole. It is a common [[defense mechanism]] used by many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 224184 |year=1979 |last= Carser |first=D. |title= The defense mechanism of splitting: Developmental origins, effects on staff, recommendations for nursing care |journal= Journal of psychiatric nursing and mental health services |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=21–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual tends to think in extremes (i.e., an individual's actions and motivations are ''all'' good or ''all'' bad with no middle ground).

The concept of splitting was first described by [[Ronald Fairbairn]] in his formulation of [[object relations theory]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The unique origins of Fairbairn's Theories | author=Rubens, R. L. | journal=Psychoanalytic Dialogues: the International Journal of Relational Perspectives | year=1996 | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=413–435 | doi=10.1080/10481889609539128}}&lt;/ref&gt; it begins as the inability of the infant to combine the fulfilling aspects of the parents (the good object) and their unresponsive aspects (the unsatisfying object) into the same individuals, instead seeing the good and bad as separate. In psychoanalytic theory this functions as a defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Textbook of Psychoanalysis | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kH0L1x8B88C&amp;printsec=frontcover | editor1-first=Glen O. | editor1-last=Gabbard | editor2-first=Bonnie E. | editor2-last=Litowitz | editor3-first=Paul | editor3-last=Williams | editor1-link=Glen Gabbard | edition=2nd | publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Pub]] | year=2011 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_kH0L1x8B88C&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22defense+mechanism%22+Splitting+psychoanalysis 96] | isbn=978-1-58562-410-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships ==
Splitting creates instability in relationships because one person can be viewed as either personified virtue or personified vice at different times, depending on whether they gratify the subject's needs or frustrate them. This, along with similar oscillations in the experience and appraisal of the self, leads to chaotic and unstable relationship patterns, identity diffusion, and [[mood swings]]. The therapeutic process can be greatly impeded by these oscillations, because the therapist too can come to be seen as all good or all bad. To attempt to overcome the negative effects on treatment outcome, constant interpretations by the therapist are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, J. R., Prentice, N. M. &amp; Ainslie, R. C. (1996). "The splitting index: construction of a scale measuring the defense mechanism of splitting". ''Journal of Personality Assessment'' 66 (2), 414–430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Splitting contributes to unstable relationships and intense emotional experiences. Splitting is common during [[adolescence]], but is regarded as transient. Splitting has been noted especially with persons diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bpdresourcecenter.org/glossary.html What is Borderline personality disorder – Splitting].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bpd /&gt; Treatment strategies have been developed for individuals and groups based on [[dialectical behavior therapy]], and for couples.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, J. P. ''Repairing Intimacy'' (1992) and Linehan, M. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; There are also self-help books on related topics such as [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] and [[emotional self-regulation|emotional regulation]] that claim to be helpful for individuals who struggle with the consequences of splitting.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, B. 2004, Siegel, J. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Borderline personality disorder ==
{{Main article|Borderline personality disorder}}
Splitting is a relatively common defense mechanism for people with borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=bpd&gt;{{cite journal | title=Defense Mechanisms Associated with Borderline Personality Disorder |author1=Mary C. Zanarini |author2=Jolie L. Weingeroff |author3=Frances R.

P. (2006). "Dyadic splitting in partner relational disorders". ''Journal of Family Psychology'', 20 (3), 418–422.&lt;/ref&gt; This school hypothesizes that they consequently experience love and [[sexuality]] as perverse and violent qualities which they cannot integrate with the tender, intimate side of relationships.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01405-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Freud_and_Beyond.html?id=4ODr9mxI53oC|authorlink=Stephen A. Mitchell (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic personality disorder ==
{{Main article|Narcissistic personality disorder}}
People matching the diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder also use splitting as a central defense mechanism. Most often narcissists do this as an attempt to stabilize their sense of self positivity in order to preserve their [[self-esteem]], by perceiving themselves as purely upright or admirable and others who do not conform to their will or values as purely wicked or contemptible.&lt;ref&gt;Abdennur, ''the Narcissistic Principle of Equivalence'', pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive habit of splitting also implies the use of other related defense mechanisms, namely [[idealization and devaluation]], which are preventive attitudes or reactions to [[narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury]].&lt;ref name="Ref-1" /&gt;

== Depression ==
In [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[exaggerated]] all-or-nothing thinking can form a self-reinforcing cycle: these thoughts might be called ''emotional amplifiers'' because, as they go around and around, they become more intense. Typical all-or-nothing thoughts:
* My efforts are either a success or they are an abject failure
* Other people are either all good or all bad.
* I am either all good or all bad.
* [[You're either with us, or against us|If you're not with us, you're against us]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 63 and p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Janet, Bleuler and Freud ==
{{Main article|Pierre Janet|Eugen Bleuler|Sigmund Freud}}
Splits in consciousness ("normal self" vs. "secondary self"&lt;!--Janet's book is in French, but he still employed English terms in his description--&gt;) was first described by [[Pierre Janet]] in ''De l'Automatisme Psychologique'' (1889).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite book |last=Janet |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Janet |year=1899 |title=De l'Automatisme Psychologique |trans-title=Of Psychological Automatism |url=https://archive.org/stream/lautomatismepsyc00jane#page/316|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, Rodney K. B. Parker (eds.), ''Studia Phaenomenologica: Vol. XV / 2015 – Early Phenomenology'', Zeta Books, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were extended by [[Eugen Bleuler|Bleuler]] (who in 1908 coined the word [[schizofrenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal|last=Bleuler|first=Eugen|authorlink=Eugen Bleuler|title=Die Prognose der Dementia Praecox — Schizophreniegruppe|journal=Allgemeine Zeitschrift fur Psychiatrie|year=1908|volume=65|pages=436-434}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''skhízō'' {{bracket|[[wikt:σχῐ́ζω|σχῐ́ζω]], "to split"}} and ''phrḗn'' {{bracket|[[wikt:φρήν|φρήν]], "[[mind]]"}}) and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1995) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the splitting ({{lang-de|Spaltung}})&lt;ref name="Spaltung"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche| authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapter=Splitting of the Ego (pp. 427–9) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsvZpv0ZRw0C&amp;pg=427&amp;dq=%22Splitting+of+the+Ego+%3D+D.\+Ichspaltung%22%22Spa/fwng%27-splitting%22 |publisher= Karnac Books |location= London |year=1988 |edition= reprint, revised |origyear=1973 |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |id={{ISBN|0-94643949-4}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; of consciousness, not (with Janet) as the product of innate weakness, but as the result of inner conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1995) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the idea of [[Psychological repression|repression]], splitting moved to the background of Freud's thought for some years, being largely reserved for cases of double personality.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987) pp. 53–4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his late work saw a renewed interest in how it was "possible for the ego to avoid a rupture... by effecting a cleavage or division of itself",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987) p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; a theme which was extended in his ''Outline of Psycho-Analysis'' (1940a [1938]) beyond fetishism to the neurotic in general.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", ''Metapsychology'' p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter [[Anna Freud]] explored how in healthy childhood development a splitting of loving and aggressive instincts could be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;E. Young-Bruehl (2008). ''Anna Freud''. p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Melanie Klein == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Melanie Klein]] --&gt;
{{See also|Melanie Klein#Thought{{!}}Melanie Klein: thought|Reparation (psychoanalysis)#Klein{{!}}Melanie Klein: reparation}}
There was, however, from early on, another use of the term "splitting" in Freud, referring rather to resolving ambivalence "by splitting the contradictory feelings so that one person is only loved, another one only hated&amp;nbsp;... the good mother and the wicked stepmother in fairy tales".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Or, with opposing feelings of love and hate, perhaps "the two opposites should have been split apart and one of them, usually the hatred, has been repressed".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991) p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Such splitting was closely linked to the defence of "[[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]&amp;nbsp;... The division of objects into congenial and uncongenial ones&amp;nbsp;... making 'disconnections'."&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the latter sense of the term that was predominantly adopted and exploited by Melanie Klein. After Freud, "the most important contribution has come from Melanie Klein, whose work enlightens the idea of 'splitting of the object' (''{{lang|de|Objektspaltung}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1973). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=PsvZpv0ZRw0C&amp;pg=430&amp;dq=%22Splitting+of+the+Object+%3D+D.\+Objektspaltung%22 Splitting of the Object (p. 430)"].&lt;/ref&gt; (in terms of 'good/bad' objects)".&lt;ref&gt;T. Bokanowski and S. Lewkowicz, ''On Freud's "Splitting of the ego in the process of defense"'' (London 2009) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; In her object relations theory, Klein argues that "the earliest experiences of the infant are split between wholly good ones with 'good' objects and wholly bad experiences with 'bad' objects",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) np [173].&lt;/ref&gt; as children struggle to integrate the two primary drives, love and hate, into constructive social interaction. An important step in childhood development is the gradual depolarization of these two drives.

At what Klein called the [[paranoid-schizoid position]], there is a stark separation of the things the child loves (good, gratifying objects) and the things the child hates (bad, frustrating objects), "because everything is polarised into extremes of love and hate, just like what the baby seems to experience and young children are still very close to."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Klein refers to the ''good breast'' and the ''bad breast'' as split mental entities, resulting from the way "these primitive states tend to deconstruct objects into 'good' and 'bad' bits (called 'part-objects')".&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, ''Klein'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The child sees the breasts as opposite in nature at different times, although they actually are the same, belonging to the same mother. As the child learns that people and objects can be good ''and'' bad at the same time, he or she progresses to the next phase, the [[depressive position]], which "entails a steady, though painful, approximation towards the reality of oneself and others":&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, ''Klein'' p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; integrating the splits and "being able to balance [them] out&amp;nbsp;... are tasks that continue into early childhood and indeed are never completely finished."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, ''Families'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Kleinians also utilize Freud's first conception of splitting, to explain the way "In a related process of splitting, the person divides his own self. This is called 'splitting of the ego'."&lt;ref name="Spaltung" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, ''Klein'' p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Klein herself maintained that "the ego is incapable of splitting the object—internal or external—without a corresponding splitting taking place within the ego".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Paul Holmes, ''The inner world outside'' (1992) p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably at least, by this point "the idea of splitting does not carry the same meaning for Freud and for Klein": for the former, "the ego finds itself 'passively' split, as it were. For Klein and the post-Kleinians, on the other hand, splitting is an 'active' defence mechanism".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2005) p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, by the close of the century "four kinds of splitting can be clearly identified, among many other possibilities" for post-Kleinians: "a coherent split in the object, a coherent split in the ego, a fragmentation of the object, and a fragmentation of the ego."&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Robert Hinshelwood, in Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Otto Kernberg ==
{{Main article|Otto Kernberg}}
In the developmental model of Otto Kernberg, the overcoming of splitting is also an important developmental task.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt; The child has to learn to integrate feelings of love and hate. Kernberg distinguishes three different stages in the development of a child with respect to splitting:
* First stage: the child does not experience the self and the object, nor the good and the bad as different entities.
* Second stage: good and bad are viewed as different. Because the boundaries between the self and the other are not stable yet, the other as a person is viewed as either all good or all bad, depending on their actions. This also means that thinking about another person as bad implies that the self is bad as well, so it's better to think about the caregiver as a good person, so the self is viewed as good too. "Bringing together extremely opposite loving and hateful images of the self and of significant others would trigger unbearable anxiety and guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Otto F. Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third stage: Splitting – "the division of external objects into 'all good' or 'all bad'"&lt;ref&gt;Kernberg, ''Borderline'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; – begins to be resolved when the self and the other can be seen as possessing both good and bad qualities. Having hateful thoughts about the other does not mean that the self is all hateful and does not mean that the other person is all hateful either.

If a person fails to accomplish this developmental task satisfactorily, borderline pathology can emerge. "In the borderline personality organization", Kernberg found 'dissociated ego states that result from the use of "splitting" defences'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brinich and Christopher Shelley, ''The Self and Personality Structure'' (Buckingham 2002) p 51&lt;/ref&gt; His therapeutic work then aimed at "the analysis of the repeated and oscillating projections of unwanted self and object representations onto the therapist" so as to produce "something more durable, complex and encompassing than the initial, split-off and polarized state of affairs".&lt;ref&gt;Brinich, ''Self'' p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Horizontal and vertical ==
[[Heinz Kohut]] has emphasized in his [[self psychology]] the distinction between horizontal and vertical forms of splitting.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (1971) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional psychoanalysis saw repression as forming a horizontal barrier between different levels of the mind – so that for example an unpleasant truth might be accepted superficially but denied in a deeper part of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;O. Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut contrasted with this vertical fractures of the mind into two parts with incompatible attitudes separated by mutual disavowal.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (1971) p. 177 and p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transference ==
{{Main article|Transference}}
It has been suggested that interpretation of the transference "becomes effective through a sort of splitting of the ego into a reasonable, judging portion and an experiencing portion, the former recognizing the latter as not appropriate in the present and as coming from the past".&lt;ref name="Fenichel Neurosis p 570"&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, "in this sense, splitting, so far from being a pathological phenomenon, is a manifestation of self-awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1995) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, "it remains to be investigated how this desirable 'splitting of the ego' and 'self-observation' are to be differentiated from the pathological cleavage&amp;nbsp;... directed at preserving isolations".&lt;ref name="Fenichel Neurosis p 570" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9118">'''Telematic art''' is a descriptive of art projects using computer mediated [[telecommunications]] networks as their medium. Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Ascott, Roy.(2003).''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness.'' (Ed.) Edward A. Shanken. Berkeley, CA:University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21803-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Telematics'' was first coined by Simon Nora and [[Alain Minc]] in ''The Computerization of Society''.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Nora and Alain Minc, ''The Computerization of Society'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1980): 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Ascott]] sees the telematic art form as the transformation of the viewer into an active participator of creating the artwork which remains in process throughout its duration. Ascott has been at the forefront of the theory and practice of telematic art since 1978 when he went online for the first time, organizing different collaborative online projects.

== Pioneering experiments ==
Although Ascott was the first person to name this phenomenon, the first use of telecommunications as an artistic medium has occurred in 1922 when the Hungarian constructivist artist [[László Moholy-Nagy]] made the work ''Telephone Pictures''[https://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78747].  This work questioned the idea of the isolated individual artist and the unique art object. In 1932 [[Bertold Brecht]] emphasized the idea of telecommunications as an artistic medium in his essay 'The Radio as an Apparatus of Communication'. In this essay Brecht advocated the two-way communication for radio to give the public the power of [[Representation (politics)|representation]] and to pull it away from the control of corporate [[Mass media|media]]. Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has authored several historical accounts of telematic art, including "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 'Satellite Arts Project' by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz&lt;ref&gt;See Carl Eugene Loeffler and Roy Ascott, ''Chronology and Working Survey of Select Communications Activity'' in [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] (Journal of [[Leonardo/ISAST]], the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology), vol. 24, N° 2 , 1991, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; used satellites to connect artists on the east and west coast of the United States. This was the first time that artists were connected in a [[telematic]] way. With the support of [[NASA]] the artists produced composite images of participants, enabling an interactive dance concert amongst geographically disparate performers. An estimated audience of 25,000 saw bi-coastal discussions on the impact of new technologies on art, and improvised, interactive dance and music performances that were mixed in real time and shown on a split screen. These first satellite works emphasized the primacy of process that remained central to the theory and practice of telematic art.&lt;ref&gt;Ascott(2003): 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Ascott used [[telematics]] for the first time in 1978 when he organized a computer-conferencing project between the United States and the United Kingdom called ''Terminal Art''. For this project he used [[Jacques Vallée]]'s Infomedia Notepad System, which made it possible for the users to retrieve and add information stored in the computer’s memory. This made it possible to interact with a group of people to make "aesthetic encounters more participatory, culturally diverse, and richly layered with meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Ascott(2003): 63&lt;/ref&gt; Ascott did more similar projects like ''Ten Wings'' which was part of Robert Adrian’s ''The World in 24 Hours'' in 1982. The most important telematic artwork of Ascott is ''La Plissure du Texte''[http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_ascott.html] from 1983. This project allowed Ascott and other artists to participate in collectively creating texts to an emerging story by using computer networking. This participation has been termed as ‘distributed authorship’.&lt;ref&gt;Ascott(2003): 64&lt;/ref&gt; But the most significant matter of this project is the [[interactivity]] of the artwork and the way it breaks the barriers of time and space. In the late 1980s the interest in this kind of project using computer networking expanded, especially with the release of the [[World Wide Web]] in the early 1990s.

==French side story ==
Thanks to the [[Minitel]], France had a public telematic infrastructure more than a decade before the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1994. This enabled a different style of telematic art than the point-to-point technologies to which other locations were limited in the 1970s and 1980s. As reported by [[Don Foresta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donforesta.net/ Don Foresta] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018143723/http://www.donforesta.net/ |date=2013-10-18 }} : [http://195.194.24.18/~donforesta/mambo/images/stories/other_docs/annexe_ga2.pdf ''Chronologie historique résumée d'échanges artistiques par télécommunications.

==Pop culture and mass media ==
Telematic art is now being used more frequently by televised performers. Shows such as ''American Idol'' that are based highly form viewer polls incorporate telematic art. This type of consumer applications is now grouped under the term "[[transmedia]]".

'''Transrational''', or "transrational reality," refers to the experience of objective nonpersonal, nonrational phenomena occurring in the natural universe, information and experience that does not readily fit into standard cause and effect logical structure; the kinds of experience that typically are labeled and dismissed as [[superstition]], irrational, and, in the extreme, abnormal or crazy.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Jerome S. Introduction. Living in the Borderland: The Evolution of Consciousness and the Challenge of Healing Trauma. London: Routledge, 2005. xv-xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the ‘supernatural’ and the ‘rational’ in that it neither directly controverts nor affirms logical sense or reason. A transrational experience is not [[pathological]]. The transrational does not engage with the question of how to sensibly fit an experience into a rational framework, instead allowing the experience to remain as it was experienced or witnessed, uninterpreted by rational [[sensemaking]] or [[meaning-making]]. The experience is what it is and is taken on its own terms.

The concept was first conceptualized in this sense by Jungian analyst [http://www.borderlanders.com/book/about-author Jerome Bernstein] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Jerome. "Listening in the Borderlands." The Salt Journal 2.2 (January/February 2000): 13-21. [The concept was first published, though not named, by Bernstein in this article, and was later coined “transrational” in lectures that year and in subsequent publications.]&lt;/ref&gt; however it had also been used to very different effect by Ken Wilber in his 1995 book, ''[[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality]]''.

People are so afraid of being considered pre-rational that they avoid and deny the very possibility of the transrational. Others substitute mere pre-rational emotions for authentic religious  experience, which is always transrational. Ken  Wilbur

# [After an account of human communication with animals and stones] “Of course, many of us shudder when we think of some of our companions who do talk with inanimate objects or invisible friends. Yet even here, I think that psychologists’ scholarly prejudices have often overcome their common sense and analytical skills. The point is not whether people talk to animals and plants, but the validity of the messages that are given and received. In other words, people picking up gibberish should be given therapy. When a person is told, however, that a certain plant, used in a particular way, is excellent for curing boils, stopping bleeding, or reducing fevers—and the cure works—that is another matter altogether.”&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, Vine.

'''Two-point tensors''', or '''double vectors''', are [[tensor]]-like quantities which transform as [[euclidean vector]]s with respect to each of their indices and are used in [[continuum mechanics]] to transform between reference ("material") and present ("configuration") coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, Jay D. Cardiovascular solid mechanics: cells, tissues, and organs. Springer Verlag, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Finite_strain_theory#Deformation_gradient_tensor|deformation gradient]] and the first [[Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor]].

As with many applications of tensors, [[Einstein summation notation]] is frequently used. To clarify this notation, capital indices are often used to indicate reference coordinates and lowercase for present coordinates. Thus, a two-point tensor will have one capital and one lower-case index; for example, ''A&lt;sub&gt;jM&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Continuum mechanics==
A conventional tensor can be viewed as a transformation of vectors in one coordinate system to other vectors in the same coordinate system. In contrast, a two-point tensor transforms vectors from one coordinate system to another. That is, a conventional tensor,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = Q_{pq}(\mathbf{e}_p\otimes \mathbf{e}_q)&lt;/math&gt;,
[[active transformation|actively transforms]] a vector '''u''' to a vector '''v''' such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''v''' and '''u''' are measured in the same space and their coordinates representation is with respect to the same basis (denoted by the "''e''").

In contrast, a two-point tensor, '''G''' will be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} = G_{pq}(\mathbf{e}_p\otimes \mathbf{E}_q)&lt;/math&gt;
and will transform a vector, '''U''', in '''''E''''' system to a vector, '''v''', in the '''e''' system  as    
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{GU}&lt;/math&gt;.

==The transformation law for two-point tensor==
Suppose we have two coordinate systems one primed and another unprimed and a vectors' components transform between them as 
:&lt;math&gt;v'_p = Q_{pq}v_q&lt;/math&gt;.
For tensors suppose we then have
:&lt;math&gt;T_{pq}(e_p \otimes e_q)&lt;/math&gt;.
A tensor  in the system &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt;. In another system, let the same tensor be given by
: &lt;math&gt;T'_{pq}(e'_p \otimes e'_q)&lt;/math&gt;.
We can say
:&lt;math&gt;T'_{ij} = Q_{ip} Q_{jr} T_{pr}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then 
:&lt;math&gt;T' = QTQ^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;
is the routine tensor transformation. But a two-point tensor between these systems is just
: &lt;math&gt;F_{pq}(e'_p \otimes e_q)&lt;/math&gt;
which transforms as
: &lt;math&gt;F' = QF&lt;/math&gt;.

==The most mundane example of a two-point tensor==
The most mundane example of a two-point tensor is the transformation tensor, the ''Q'' in the above discussion. Note that
: &lt;math&gt;v'_p=Q_{pq}u_q&lt;/math&gt;.
Now, writing out in full,
:&lt;math&gt;u=u_q e_q&lt;/math&gt;
and also
:&lt;math&gt;v=v'_p e'_p&lt;/math&gt;.
This then requires ''Q'' to be of the form
: &lt;math&gt;Q_{pq}(e'_p \otimes e_q)&lt;/math&gt;.
By definition of [[tensor product]],
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;(e'_p\otimes e_q)e_q=(e_q.e_q) e'_p =3 e'_p&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
So we can write
: &lt;math&gt;u_p e_p = (Q_{pq}(e'_p \otimes e_q))(v_q e_q)&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
: &lt;math&gt;u_p e_p = Q_{pq} v_q(e'_p \otimes e_q) e_q&lt;/math&gt;
Incorporating ({{EquationNote|1}}), we have
:&lt;math&gt;u_p e_p = Q_{pq} v_q e_p&lt;/math&gt;.

In the equation following (1) there are four q's !?

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''T–V distinction''' (from the Latin [[pronoun]]s {{lang|la|'''t'''u}} and {{lang|la|'''v'''os}}) is a contrast, within one language, between various forms of addressing one's conversation partner or partners that are specialized for varying levels of politeness, [[social distance]], courtesy, familiarity, age or insult toward the addressee. Many languages lack this type of distinction, instead relying on more explicit wording to convey these meanings. The [[morphosyntax|morphosyntactic]] T–V distinction, though, is found in a variety of languages around the world.

English does not have a T–V distinction, with the exception of a few dialects. There previously was one with the pronouns ''[[thou]]'' and ''you'', with the familiar ''thou'' disappearing from [[Early Modern English]]. Additionally British commoners have historically spoken to nobility and royalty using the third person rather than the second person, a practice that has fallen out of favor. English speakers today often employ [[semantics|semantic]] analogues to convey the mentioned attitudes towards the addressee, such as whether to address someone by [[given name|given]] or [[surname]], or whether to use ''[[sir]]''/''[[madam|ma'am]]''. Under a broader classification, '''T''' and '''V''' forms are examples of [[honorifics (linguistics)|honorifics]].

The T–V distinction is expressed in a variety of forms. Two particularly common means are
# Addressing a single individual using the second-person plural forms in the language, instead of the singular (e.g. in French).
# Addressing individuals in the third person, rather than the second (e.g. in Spanish).

== History and usage ==
The terms '''T''' and '''V''', based on the [[Latin]] pronouns {{lang|la|tu}} and {{lang|la|vos}}, were first used in a paper by the social psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and the Shakespearian scholar [[Roger Brown (psychologist)#Personal life|Albert Gilman]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Pronouns of Power and Solidarity'' published in T.A Seboek (ed) (1960). Republished in Giglioli (1972). The pages numbers cited below are from Giglioli.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a historical and contemporary survey of the uses of pronouns of address, seen as [[semantic]] markers of social relationships between individuals. The study considered mainly [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[German language|German]]. The paper was highly influential&lt;ref&gt;Giglioli p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and with few exceptions, the terms '''T''' and '''V''' have been used in subsequent studies.

=== Origin ===
In [[Latin language|Latin]], {{lang|la|tu}} was originally the singular, and {{lang|la|vos}} the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, usage of the plural to the [[Roman emperor]] began in the 4th century AD. They mention the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in [[Constantinople]] and [[Rome]]), but also mention that "plurality is a very old and ubiquitous metaphor for power". This usage was extended to other powerful figures, such as [[Pope Gregory I]] (590–604). However, Brown and Gilman note that it was only between the 12th and 14th centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural may be extended to other [[grammatical person|persons]], such as the "[[royal we|royal ''we'']]" ([[majestic plural]]) in [[English language|English]].

Brown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either relationships of 'power' and/or 'solidarity', depending on the culture of the speakers, showing that 'power' had been the dominant predictor of form in Europe until the 20th century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful person to use a T-form but expect a V-form in return. However, in the twentieth century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use T-forms with those they knew, and V-forms in service encounters, with [[wikt:reciprocity|reciprocal]] usage being the norm in both cases.

=== Early history: the power semantic ===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]] (the 5th century to the 10th century), the pronoun {{lang|la|vos}} was used to address the most exalted figures, emperors and popes, who would use the pronoun {{lang|la|tu}} to address a subject. This use was progressively extended to other states and societies, and down the social hierarchy as a mark of respect to individuals of higher rank, religious authority, greater wealth, or seniority within a family. The development was slow and erratic, but a consistent pattern of use is estimated to have been reached in different European societies by the period 1100 to 1500. Use of V spread to upper-class individuals of equal rank, but not to lower class individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;
This may be represented in Brown and Gilman's notation:
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="2"| Unequal power
!colspan="2"| Equal power
|-
| Emperor          || Father           || High-class friend || Low-class friend
|-
| T↓{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}↑V || ↓↑V               || T↓↑
|-
| Subject          || Son              || High-class friend || Low-class friend
|}

=== Modification: the solidarity semantic ===
Speakers developed greater flexibility of pronoun use by redefining relationships between individuals. Instead of defining the father–son relationship as one of power, it could be seen as a shared family relationship. Brown and Gilman term this the semantics of solidarity. Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose '''V''' to express fellow feeling with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use '''V''' to their favourite waiter. Similarly a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use '''T'''. For example, a child might use '''T''' to express affection for their parent.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be represented as:
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="3"| Superior has choice
!colspan="3"| Subordinate has choice
|-
| Customer          || Officer           || Employer          || Parent            || Master            || Elder sibling
|-
| T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V
|-
| Waiter            || Soldier           || Employee          || Child             || Faithful servant  || Younger sibling
|}
These choices were available not only to reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary changes of attitude. This allowed playwrights such as [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Ben Jonson|Ben Johnson]], [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Shakespeare]] to express a character's inner changes of mood through outward changes of pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 278–280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David &amp; Ben (2002) pp. 450–451. Reproduced at David Crystal's [http://www.shakespeareswords.com/thou-and-you Explore Shakespeare's Works] site&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, it was the more powerful individual who chose to address a subordinate either with '''T''' or with '''V''', or to allow the subordinate to choose. For this reason, the pronouns were traditionally defined as the ''pronoun of either condescension or intimacy'' ('''T''') and ''the pronoun of reverence or formality'' ('''V'''). Brown and Gilman argue that modern usage no longer supports these definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
Developments from the nineteenth century have seen the solidarity semantic more consistently applied. It has become less acceptable for a more powerful individual to exercise the choice of pronoun. Officers in most armies are not permitted to address a soldier as '''T'''. Most European parents cannot oblige their children to use '''V'''. The relationships illustrated above have changed in the direction of the following norms:&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 269–261&lt;/ref&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="3"| Superior choice removed
!colspan="3"| Subordinate choice removed
|-
| Customer || Officer || Employer || Parent || Master           || Elder sibling
|-
| ↑↓V      || ↑↓V     || ↑↓V      || T↑↓    || T↑↓              || T↑↓
|-
| Waiter   || Soldier || Employee || Child  || Faithful servant || Younger sibling
|}
The tendency to promote the solidarity semantic may lead to the abolition of any choice of address pronoun. During the [[French Revolution]] attempts were made to abolish '''V'''. In 17th century England the [[Society of Friends]] obliged its members to use only '''T''' to everyone, and some continue to use '''T''' (''thee'') to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; In most Modern English dialects the choice of '''T''' no longer exists outside of poetry.

=== Changes in progress ===
It was reported in 2012 that use of the [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|vous}} and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|usted}} are in decline in [[social media]].&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawn |first=Rebecca |title=Tu and Twitter: Is it the end for 'vous' in French? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19499771 |accessdate=7 September 2012 |work=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation offered was that such online communications favour the philosophy of [[social equality|equality]], regardless of usual formal distinctions. Similar tendencies were observed in [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as well as in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012"/&gt;

=== History of use in individual languages ===

==== English ====
The [[Old English]] and [[Early Middle English#Early Middle English|Early Middle English]] [[grammatical person|second person]] pronouns {{lang|enm|thou}} and {{lang|enm|ye}} (with variants) were used for singular and plural reference respectively with no '''T–V''' distinction. The earliest entry in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] for ''ye'' as a '''V''' pronoun in place of the singular ''thou'' exists in a [[Middle English]] text of 1225 composed in 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/231466#eid13732377 |title=ye, ''pron.'' and ''n.'' |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=10 November 2018 |url-access=subscription |quote=''a''1225 (▸c1200) ''Vices &amp; Virtues'' (1888) 31 (''MED''): {{lang|enm|Hwo is þat us muȝen sceawin ða gode ðe '''ȝe''' us behoteð?}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage may have started among the [[Norman French]] nobility in imitation of French. It made noticeable advances during the second half of the 13th century. During the 16th century, the distinction between the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] form ''ye'' and the [[object (grammar)|object]] form ''you'' was largely lost, leaving ''you'' as the usual '''V''' pronoun (and plural pronoun). After 1600, the use of ''ye'' in standard English was confined to literary and religious contexts or as a consciously archaic usage.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlude 12 : Choosing ''thou'' or ''you''" David Crystal (2004) pp. 307–310&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Crystal]] summarises [[Early Modern English]] usage thus:

'''V''' would normally be used
* by people of lower social status to those above them
* by the upper classes when talking to each other, even if they were closely related
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with ''thou'') in the emotional temperature of an interaction

'''T''' would normally be used
* by people of higher social status to those below them
* by the lower classes when talking to each other
* in addressing God/Jesus
* in talking to ghosts, witches, and other supernatural beings
* in an imaginary address to someone who was absent
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with ''you'') in the emotional temperature of an interaction&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (2004) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''T–V''' distinction was still well preserved when Shakespeare began writing at the end of the 16th century. However, other playwrights of the time made less use of '''T–V''' contrasts than Shakespeare. The infrequent use of '''T''' in popular writing earlier in the century such as the [[Paston Letters]] suggest that the distinction was already disappearing from gentry speech. In the first half of the 17th century, ''thou'' disappeared from [[Standard English]], although the '''T–V''' distinction was preserved in many [[dialect|regional dialects]]. When the [[Quakers]] began using ''thou'' again in the middle of the century, many people were still aware of the old '''T–V''' distinction and responded with derision and physical violence.

In the 19th century, one aspect of the '''T–V''' distinction was restored to some English dialects in the form of a pronoun that expressed friendly solidarity, written as ''[[y'all]]''. Unlike earlier ''thou'', it was used primarily for plural address, and in some dialects for singular address as well.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=Edgar W. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqUBUgW_Ax8C&amp;pg=PA284 |chapter=The English dialect heritage of the southern United States |title=Legacies of Colonial English |editor-first=Raymond |editor-last=Hickey |year=2005 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronoun was first observed in the southern states of the US among [[African-American]] speakers, although its precise origin is obscure. The pronoun spread rapidly to [[White people|White]] speakers in those southern states, and (to a lesser extent) other regions of the US and beyond. This pronoun is not universally accepted, and may be regarded as either nonstandard or a regionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlude 17, Tracking a change: the case of ''y'all''" Crystal (2004) pp. 449–452&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yous(e)'' (pron. {{IPAc-en|j|uː|z|}}, {{IPAc-en|j|ə|z|}}) as a plural is found mainly in [[English language in Northern England|(Northern) England]], [[Scottish English|Scotland]], parts of [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[South African English|South Africa]], northern [[Nova Scotia]] and parts of [[Ontario]] in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States (especially areas where there was historically Irish or Italian immigration), including in [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York]], and scattered throughout working class Italian-American communities in the American [[Rust Belt]]. It also occurs in [[Scouse]] (the regional dialect of the [[Liverpool]] area).

==== French ====
In [[Old French]] texts, the pronouns {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}} are often used interchangeably to address an individual, sometimes in the same sentence. However, some emerging pattern of use has been detected by recent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Summarised in Fagyal et al (2006) pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt; Between characters equal in age or rank, {{lang|fr|vous}} was more common than {{lang|fr|tu}} as a singular address. However, {{lang|fr|tu}} was sometimes used to put a young man in his place, or to express temporary anger. There may also have been variation between [[Parisian (person)|Parisian]] use and that of other regions.

In the [[Middle French]] period a relatively stable '''T–V''' distinction emerged. ''Vous'' was the '''V''' form used by upper-class speakers to address one another, while {{lang|fr|tu}} was the '''T''' form used among lower class speakers. Upper-class speakers could choose to use either '''T''' or '''V''' when addressing an inferior. Inferiors would normally use '''V''' to a superior. However, there was much variation; in 1596 {{lang|fr|[[Étienne Pasquier]]|italic=no}} in his comprehensive survey {{lang|fr|Recherches de la France|italic=yes}} observed that the French sometimes used {{lang|fr|vous}} to inferiors as well as to superiors "{{lang|fr|selon la facilité de nos naturels}}" ("according to our natural tendencies"). In poetry, {{lang|fr|tu}} was often used to address kings or to speak to God.&lt;ref&gt;Fagyal et al p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of names ===
The boundaries between formal and informal language differ from language to language, as well as within social groups of the speakers of a given language. In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German teachers use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of formality in T–V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers. In Italian, {{lang|it|(Signor) Vincenzo Rossi}} can be addressed with the {{lang|it|tu}} (familiar) form or the {{lang|it|Lei}} (formal) one, but complete addresses range from {{lang|it|Tu, Vincenzo}} (peer to peer or family) and {{lang|it|Tu, Rossi}} (teacher or fellow student to high-school student, as stated above) to {{lang|it|Lei, signor Vincenzo}} (live-in servant to master or master's son) and {{lang|it|Lei, Rossi}} (senior staff member to junior) and {{lang|it|Lei, signor Rossi}} (among peers).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Translation issues ===
The use of these forms may be an issue for [[untranslatability#Compensation|compensating translation]] of dialogue into English if the translator does not wish to use the "thou" pronoun to translate. For example, a character in a French film or novel saying "{{lang|fr|Tutoie-moi&amp;thinsp;!}}" ("Use [the informal pronoun] {{lang|fr|tu}} when addressing me!") might be translated "Do not be so formal!" or "Call me by my first name!"

Conversely, when translating from English to a T–V language, the translator must decide again and again throughout the work which second-person form the reader would deem the more appropriate in a given situation. In the current German DVD release of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the translators of the dubbed soundtrack and of the subtitles sometimes make opposite decisions; the actors dubbed voices speak with the familiar form, while the subtitles for the same scene are more formal.

== Singular, plural and other ways of distinction ==
In many languages, the respectful singular pronoun derives from a plural form. Some Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] singular {{lang|la|'''t'''u}} and respectful forms derived from Latin plural {{lang|la|'''v'''os}}, sometimes via a circuitous route. Sometimes, singular V-form derives from a third person pronoun; in [[German language|German]] and some [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] languages, it is the third person ''plural''. Some languages have separate T and V forms for both singular and plural; others have the same form; others have a T–V distinction only in the singular.

Different languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of higher status tending both to use and to expect more respectful language) and between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, V form {{lang|nl|u}} is slowly falling into disuse in the plural, thus one could sometimes address a group as T form {{lang|nl|jullie}} (which clearly expresses the plural) when one would address each member individually as {{lang|nl|u}} (which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous). In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred – having lost the T form {{lang|nl|vosotros}}, Latin Americans address all groups as {{lang|nl|ustedes}}, even if the group is composed of friends whom they would call {{lang|nl|tú}} or {{lang|nl|[[voseo|vos]]}} (both T forms).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In Standard Peninsular Spanish however, {{lang|nl|vosotros}} (literally, "you others") is still regularly employed in familiar conversation. In some cases V-forms are likely to be capitalized when written.

== In specific languages ==

=== Germanic ===

==== Afrikaans ====
Modern [[Afrikaans]] rarely makes the distinction between the informal {{lang|af|jy}} and {{lang|af|jou}} ("you" subject and "your" / "you" object) and the more formal {{lang|af|u}} (or {{lang|af|U}} when addressing God), although sometimes it is upheld in a formal setting, such as in politics, business or in a polite conversation. The trend is moving towards using the informal pronoun most often.

==== Dutch ====
[[Old Dutch]] did not appear to have a T–V distinction. {{lang|odt|Thu}} was used as the second-person singular, and {{lang|odt|gi}} as the second-person plural. In early [[Middle Dutch]], influenced by [[Old French]] usage, the original plural pronoun {{lang|dum|gi}} (or {{lang|dum|ji}} in the north) came to be used as a respectful singular pronoun, creating a T–V distinction. However, the formal {{lang|dum|gi}} started to be used in more and more situations. By the 17th century, {{lang|dum|du}} had largely fallen out of use, although it lingered on in some of the more peripheral areas. At this point, the original T–V distinction had been lost, and the original V-pronoun {{lang|dum|gij}}/{{lang|dum|jij}} was used universally for both singular and plural regardless of the type of address. This resembled the state of English today, which has also (outside of dialectal, literary or religious use) lost its original T-pronoun ''thou''.

Around this time, a new formal pronoun {{lang|dum|u}} started to come into use. This was also the object form of the subject pronoun {{lang|dum|gij}}/{{lang|dum|jij}}, and how it came to be used as a subject pronoun is not exactly clear. It is usually related to a form of address in writing of the time: letters were often addressed formally to {{lang|dum|U.E.}}, standing for {{lang|dum|Uwe Edelheid}} ("Your Highness"), which is thought to have been shortened to {{lang|dum|u}} eventually. It can be compared to the Spanish {{lang|es|usted}}, which is a similar contraction of a phrase of indirect address. As in Spanish, the Dutch {{lang|dum|u}} was originally conjugated as the third person in verbs, although most verbs had identical second- and third-person singular forms, so that this difference was not apparent for the most part. It remains today in the use of {{lang|nl|u heeft}} ("you (formal) have", like {{lang|nl|hij heeft}} "he has"), compared to {{lang|nl|jij hebt}} ("you (informal) have"). However, {{lang|nl|u hebt}} is now also common.

Around the same time, it became more common to clarify when multiple people were being spoken to, by adding {{lang|dum|luyden}}, {{lang|dum|lieden}} ("people"), or a shortened variety, to the end of the pronoun. Thus, when speaking to multiple people, one would use {{lang|dum|jij luyden}} or {{lang|dum|je lieden}}. This combination was contracted and fused over time, eventually resulting in {{lang|nl|jullie}}, the informal plural pronoun that is used today. It can be compared, in its origin, to the English ''y'all'' or Spanish {{lang|es|vosotros}}.

Modern northern [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and usually standard Dutch as well, has two forms of second person pronouns, namely {{lang|nl|jij}} and {{lang|nl|u}}. {{lang|nl|U}} is the formal pronoun, whereas {{lang|nl|jij}} is used as the informal personal pronoun to address a single person. In the plural, {{lang|nl|u}} is also used, alongside the informal {{lang|nl|jullie}}. In the south, only one pronoun, {{lang|nl|gij}}, is generally used in all three roles: both singular and plural, formal and informal. ''U'' is sometimes also used in formal situations, but the southern {{lang|nl|gij}} does not have a distinct informal connotation like the northern/standard {{lang|nl|jij}}, and can be used to address anyone without offence. Religious Dutch speakers in all areas address [[God]] using either {{lang|nl|Gij}} or {{lang|nl|U}}; {{lang|nl|jij}} is never used. For speakers of the north, this is usually the only place where {{lang|nl|gij}} is encountered, giving it a formal and archaic tone, even though it is neutral in the southern areas where it is still used.

The pronoun {{lang|nl|je}} (unstressed variant of {{lang|nl|jij}}) can also be used impersonally, corresponding to the English [[generic you]]. The more formal Dutch term corresponding to English [[generic you]] or [[generic one|one]] is {{lang|nl|men}}.

In Dutch the formal personal pronoun is used for older people or for people with a higher or equal status, unless the addressed makes it clear they want to be spoken to with the informal pronoun. Unlike for example in [[German language|German]], there is no defined line (in the case of German, roughly when someone passes the age of 16) in which everyone, apart from family, is addressed with the formal pronoun. Addressing parents by {{lang|nl|u}} has become very rare; {{lang|nl|jij}} is often even used to address grandparents. There is also a tendency towards more use of the informal pronoun. Some companies such as [[IKEA]] consciously address their customers with the informal {{lang|nl|jij}}. However, {{lang|nl|u}} can still be considered more or less obligatory in situations where, for example, a pupil addresses their teacher, people testify in court or communication between a doctor and their patient.

==== English ====
{{See also|Thou|You}}

Contemporary English generally uses only the form "you", regardless of level of familiarity.

[[Old English]] used {{wikt-lang|ang|þū}}&lt;ref&gt;{{wikt-lang|ang|þū|Þū}} was the [[nominative case]] of the word; the [[accusative case|accusative]] form was originally {{wikt-lang|ang|þeċ}} but over time the [[dative case|dative]] {{wikt-lang|ang|þē}} replaced it.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second-person singular for both formal and informal contexts. Following the [[Norman Conquest]], the [[Middle English]] that emerged continued to use ''{{linktext|þou}}''&lt;ref&gt;The accusative of {{wikt-lang|ang|þou}} was at first spelled {{wikt-lang|ang|þe}} or {{wikt-lang|ang|the}} but later became ''{{linktext|thee}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; at first, but by the 13th century, Norman [[#French|French]] influence had led to the use of the second-person plural {{wikt-lang|enm|ȝe}} or {{wikt-lang|enm|ye}} in formal contexts.

In [[Early Modern English]] superiors and strangers were therefore respectfully addressed as ''ye'' in the [[nominative case|nominative]]&lt;ref name="yeyou"/&gt; and ''you'' in the [[objective case|objective]]; ''thou'' and ''thee'' were used for familiars and subordinates. The more widespread and observed this division became, the more pejorative it became to strangers to be called by the familiar form of address. By the 17th century, such a use among the nobility was strongly and deliberately contemptuous, as in the declamation of the prosecutor at Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s 1603 trial "I thou thee, thou traitor!" Accordingly, the use of ''thou'' began to decline and it was effectively extinct in the everyday speech of most English dialects by the early 18th century, supplanted by the polite ''you'', even when addressing children and animals, something also seen in Dutch and Latin America (most of [[Brazilian Portuguese#Tu and você|Brazil]] and parts of [[Spanish language#Usted|Spanish America]]). Meanwhile, as part of English's continuing development away from its [[synthetic language|synthetic]] origins since the influx of French vocabulary following the Norman invasion, ''you'' had been replacing ''ye'' since the 15th century. Standard English was left with a single second-person pronoun for all cases, numbers and contexts and largely incapable of maintaining a T–V distinction.&lt;ref&gt;There is a minor amount of T–V distinction among dialects of English that ''(a)'' employ informal first-person singulars (such as [[South Yorkshire]]'s continuing use of ''tha'') or ''(b)'' have adopted a new second-person plural (such as the [[American South]]'s ''y'all''). The non-[[prestige dialect|prestige]] nature of these dialects means that they [[diglossia|maintain a separate language register]] (including ''you'') to be used among people outside their community whose judgment they are afraid of offending. For other variants, see the articles collected at [[:Category:Second-person plural pronouns in English]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Notwithstanding all of this, the translators of the [[King James version]] of the [[Bible]] chose to employ the older forms in their work (1604–1611) in order to convey the grammatical distinctions made by their [[Daniel Bomberg|Hebrew]], [[Theodore Beza|Greek]] and [[Robert Estienne|Latin]] sources. Its subsequent popularity and the religious rationale of many{{refn|Including the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]]' "[[Testimony of Simplicity|Plain Speech]]" and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]]' prayers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Dallin H. Oaks |last=Oaks |first=Dallin H. |url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/05/the-language-of-prayer |title=The Language of Prayer |work=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} who continued to employ ''thou'' has preserved its use in English, but made it seem pious and ironically ''more'' formal and respectful than the everyday ''you''.

In the United States, some Protestant sects, such as the [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Mormons]] insisted on addressing everyone as ''thou'', because they considered every person to be a friend and an equal. This persisted until the 19th or early 20th century.

==== Frisian (West) ====
In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], the formal singular nominative {{lang|fy|jo}} (pronounced ''yo'') is very close to the English ''you'' and the Middle and Early Modern English {{lang|enm|ye}}. There is no such distinction in the plural; the plural second person pronoun is always {{lang|fy|jimme}}. {{lang|nl|[[Stadsfries]]|italic=no}}, a Dutch dialect with strong Frisian influence, parallels this distinction ({{lang|nl|dou}}, {{lang|nl|jou}}, {{lang|nl|jimme}}).

West Frisian {{lang|fy|jo}} is used slightly more often than Dutch {{lang|nl|u}}. Native speakers of Dutch are sometimes warned against addressing newly acquainted people with {{lang|fy|do}} too soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pieter Duijff |title=Taal in stad en land – Fries en Stadsfries |publisher=Sdu Uitgevers |location=The Hague |year=2002 |pages=51–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German ====
===== {{lang|de|Sie}} and {{lang|de|du}} =====
{{See also|Du (personal pronoun)}}
In [[German language|German]], the formal address {{lang|de|Sie}} is the same as the third person plural pronoun {{lang|de|sie}}. Verbs used with this form of address are also identical to third person plural forms. The polite form and its inflected forms are always capitalized in writing, to avoid any ambiguity.

The corresponding informal German address is {{lang|de|du}} or {{lang|de|Du}}. The verbs {{lang|de|duzen}} and {{lang|de|siezen}} mean respectively "to address using {{lang|de|du}}" and "to address using {{lang|de|Sie}}" and the phrases {{lang|de|per du}} or {{lang|de|auf du und du}} mean, "to be on du terms". The use of {{lang|de|Sie}} often coincides with the use of the title plus surname,&lt;ref name="Siedu"&gt;About.com [http://german.about.com/od/grammar/a/Siedu.htm Sie &amp; Du].&lt;/ref&gt; usage of which is more widespread in German-speaking areas than Anglophone areas.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In general terms, {{lang|de|du}} is used to children, animals and God, and between adults (or between adults and children) who are good friends of or related to each other. {{lang|de|Sie}} is used in other situations, such as in a business situation or where there is no existing relationship.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In Internet chats and forums, Germans rarely use {{lang|de|Sie}}, although there are exceptions. Except in the case of adults addressing children, where it is common for the child to address the adult as {{lang|de|Sie}}, but be addressed as {{lang|de|du}} in return, it is not common in German for one party to address the other as {{lang|de|Sie}}, but be addressed as {{lang|de|du}} in return.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In almost all cases it can be considered as impolite to use the "wrong" pronoun, that is a pronoun that is not expected by the other party. However on the other hand, using an unexpected {{lang|de|du}} can also be a very welcome sign of affection, and using an unexpected {{lang|de|Sie}} can, in the young, be a very welcome sign of appreciation of the addressed one's maturity.

High school students in Germany are often called {{lang|de|Sie}} plus given name ({{lang|de|Hamburger Sie}}) by their teachers when they enter the {{lang|de|[[Abitur|Oberstufe]]}} — the last 2 or 3 years of high school — around the age of 16.

Children and teenagers are expected to use {{lang|de|Sie}} when addressing all adults except for family members and family friends whom they have known since early childhood. Street and similar social workers, sports clubs trainers will sometimes tell children and teens to address them with {{lang|de|du}}. In shops, bars, and other establishments, if they target a younger audience, it is becoming increasingly common for customers and staff to address each other as {{lang|de|du}}, to the degree that it is sometimes considered awkward if a waitress and a customer who are both in their twenties call each other {{lang|de|Sie}}.

The use of {{lang|de|du}} or {{lang|de|Sie}} between two strangers may also be determined by the setting in which they meet (casual/formal), as well as clothing (casual/formal), gender (same/opposite), and personal preference. For example, it is customary to use {{lang|de|du}} in traditional small pubs and taverns in certain regions (including the [[Rhineland]]). This applies also to older people, whom one would otherwise address as {{lang|de|Sie}}. Two people who addressed each other as {{lang|de|du}} in a pub may go back to {{lang|de|Sie}} when they meet in the street if their acquaintance was only very superficial. During the famous Rhenish [[carnival]], it is customary for most revelers to address each other as {{lang|de|du}}. Only if the age difference is more than one generation, the younger person might still use {{lang|de|Sie}}. Another setting in which {{lang|de|du}} is often used between adults is sporting events.

Being {{lang|de|per du}} has also become increasingly common in workplace environments (depending on the line of business and corporate culture to varying degrees), mostly regardless of age. In such environments, the {{lang|de|du}} basis may also be observed as a (sometimes necessary) mark of good social integration within a working group. As a rule of thumb, one might expect to see team colleagues on the workplace level in many industries on a customary {{lang|de|du}} basis with each other, though not always with the group manager and more rarely with higher-ranking managers. As entrants to a team are more closely integrated, this is often marked by making an informal affirmation to that basis or by formally offering it, as a matter of style and habituality. Both the tempo and extent of using the {{lang|de|du}} basis depends much on the culture (and sometimes the climate) of the business, and in some places even more so on that of the particular workgroup itself. Business cultures that pride themselves on a "flat hierarchy" are more likely to adopt or accent a general professional parlance of {{lang|de|du}} and given name while inside corporations tending to emphasize professional formality, a {{lang|de|Sie}} may be expected to be used always except between very close colleagues or inside closed groups (sometimes including managers meeting on the same level with the exclusion of any subordinates), and strictly always in the presence of a superior. The superior, on the other hand, has the right to address the other perform informally or formally, which is a personal preference.

Customarily, the switch from {{lang|de|Sie}} to {{lang|de|du}} is initially proposed by the elder of the two people, the person with socially higher standing or by the lady to the gentleman. Alternatively, one person may use {{lang|de|Sie}} while they ask the other person if it is acceptable to be addressed informally, and then act accordingly. One way to propose the use of {{lang|de|du}} rather than {{lang|de|Sie}} is by stating one's first name (as in: {{lang|de|Ich heiße...}}). One accepts the proposal by introducing one's own first name. Should a person later forget that they have adopted {{lang|de|du}}, it is polite to remind them by saying, {{lang|de|Wir waren doch per du}} (We moved on to {{lang|de|du}} terms). Sometimes switching back to {{lang|de|Sie}} is used as a method of distancing oneself from the addressee; the connotation is slightly ironic courtesy.

The inappropriate and uninvited use of {{lang|de|du}} towards someone who would otherwise reasonably expect to be addressed as {{lang|de|Sie}} is considered to be condescending and disrespectful, although insistence on {{lang|de|Sie}} in an environment where {{lang|de|du}} is largely accepted (flat hierarchies) can be interpreted as being equally disrespectful. The degree of offense that might be taken will depend on how obvious the etiquette violation was (an example of an obvious violation would be a teenager in the street addressing an elderly stranger on the street with {{lang|de|du}}, addressing a senior manager with {{lang|de|du}} as a result of a misjudged professional relationship would probably be taken with less offense), and will also depend on the upbringing of the person in question – progressive vs. conservative outlooks and age are examples of factors which can play a role in how individuals prefer to be addressed and choose to address others.

It has become the policy of some businesses for their employees to address customers with {{lang|de|du}}, often to set a progressive, "modern" tone, occasionally for other cultural reasons. [[IKEA]], for instance, does this to reflect the widespread use of the {{lang|sv|du}} form in Sweden (see {{lang|sv|[[Du-reformen]]}}).

In Germany, an old [[norm (sociology)|custom]] (called {{lang|de|Bruderschaft trinken}}, drinking brotherhood) involves two friends formally sharing a bottle of [[wine]] or drinking a glass of [[beer]] together to celebrate their agreement to call one another {{lang|de|du}} rather than {{lang|de|Sie}}. This custom has also been adopted among the Swiss-French of the Jura, in Poland and Russia (called by its German name, spelled {{lang|pl|bruderszaft}} and {{lang|ru|брудершафт}} respectively), though the custom in Poland is now slowly disappearing. It was formerly found also in Sweden.

Although the use of {{lang|de|Sie}} generally coincides with the use of title plus surname, especially in northern and eastern Germany, there is an intermediate address combining {{lang|de|Sie}} with the first name ({{lang|de|[[:de:Hamburger Sie|Hamburger Sie]]}}), whereas in the Berlin region, sometimes {{lang|de|Du}} is combined with the surname ({{lang|de|Berliner Du}}). The former usage also occurs when addressing teenagers, household staff, or guests of TV or radio programs, while the latter style is usually considered inferior and mainly occurs in working class environments. It may be associated with professional contexts, when colleagues have known one another for a long time, but, e. g. due to differences of status, do not want to switch to the usual {{lang|de|Du}} style; or in situations where strangers (e.g. customers) are present for whom it would not be appropriate to learn the first name of the addressee.

When speaking to more than one person in formal situations where one would use {{lang|de|Sie}} to each one of them separately, Standard German uses {{lang|de|Sie}}. However, in this situation {{lang|de|ihr}} can often be heard instead, especially in the South of Germany and in [[Swiss German|Swiss German dialects]], and is standard usage for pastors when preaching. If the {{lang|de|Sie}} standard here is followed, then the usage varies when addressing a group containing both {{lang|de|du}} and {{lang|de|Sie}} persons: Some speakers use the informal plural {{lang|de|ihr}} others prefer the formal {{lang|de|Sie}} and many, concerned that both pronouns might cause offence, prefer to use circumlocutions that avoid either pronoun, for example by expressing an [[imperative mood|imperative]] in [[infinitive]] form ({{lang|de|bitte das machen}}), by applying the [[passive voice]] ({{lang|de|es wird gemacht}}), or using the [[generic you|indefinite pronoun]] {{lang|de|man}} ({{lang|de|man macht das}}).

===== Historical predecessors: {{lang|de|Ihr}} and {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} =====
Formerly, the 2nd person plural {{lang|de|Ihr}} ("ye") was used to address social superiors, unless more informal relations had been established. The use of {{lang|de|Ihr}} as the polite form, as this is the case with {{lang|fr|vous}} in the French language, has still survived in [[Bernese German]] and other [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects. {{lang|de|Ihr}} in this case has to be capitalized. However, {{lang|de|Ihr}} itself shows a degree of informality, and would for example be used in addressing one's father. For the formal address, the third person would be used; and this in the singular with {{lang|de|Er}}, {{lang|de|Sie}} (capitalized) to a social inferior, as a farmer addressing a stableboy, or in the plural to a social superior. It is from the latter occurrences that modern {{lang|de|Sie}} takes its origin; {{lang|de|Sie}} is the 3rd person plural pronoun. However, {{lang|de|Sie}} itself is relatively young, and it was rather the formal addresses, often itself singular forms, that took the plural. Even as late as in [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt|Dürrenmatt]]'s "The Visit" (written in 1956), an address {{lang|de|Das wissen Herr Bürgermeister schon}} ("You do know that, Mr Mayor", modern German would just say {{lang|de|Das wissen Sie schon}}) can be found; Herr Bürgermeister is the formal address and itself a singular term, but wissen is plural. However, if the formal address itself contains a personal pronoun as in {{lang|de|Seine Majestät}} (His Majesty) etc., this one would be put to the 2nd person plural: {{lang|de|Was geruhen Euer}} (not: {{lang|de|Seine}}) {{lang|de|Majestät zu befehlen?}} ("What does [but plural] Your Majesty condescend to order?")

Thus, all these go by a similar grammar rule pertaining to the verb used with these addresses as modern {{lang|de|Sie}}. The dated capitalized address {{lang|de|Ihr}} demands the same verb form as the modern second person plural pronoun {{lang|de|ihr}}, the dated {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} demands the same verb form as the modern third person singular {{lang|de|er}} and {{lang|de|sie}}, and the dated 3rd person plural address without {{lang|de|Sie}} demands, just as {{lang|de|Sie}} itself, the same verb form as the 3rd person plural pronoun {{lang|de|sie}} (they).

The forms are still found today in some dialects as a respectful way of addressing elders, and is still very often found in works of art and literature (such as books and movies) depicting events at least several centuries in the past, or in a "past-like" fantasy setting, even if modern German is otherwise used in these works; indeed, using the modern {{lang|de|Sie}} in such a setting would be considered an out-of-place anachronism. {{lang|de|Ihr}} and the 3rd person plural without {{lang|de|Sie}} is somewhat analogous to the English [[majestic plural]].

The {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} form is not widely known or understood by the average person any more. While {{lang|de|Ihrzen}} is often still used in dubbed films, especially in medieval/fantasy contexts such as [[Lord of the Rings]] e.g. "{{lang|de|'''Ihr''' habt das Reich der Herrin des Waldes betreten, '''Ihr''' könnt nicht umkehren}}" ("you have entered the Realm of the Lady of the Wood, you can not turn back"). In this context, a historical level is used where the second person plural indicates some nobility of or respect for the addressee, such that from {{lang|de|Ihr}} being used to address a single person, the viewer could mostly, without looking, conclude that the person was of elevated rank such as a king or nobleman, or at least being treated with expressed regard. {{lang|de|Ihr}} would not normally be used to address a peasant (unless he is a prince in disguise or a future prince and the person addressing him has gathered some knowledge or presumption of that).

==== Scandinavian languages ====
===== Danish =====
In [[Danish language|Danish]], the informal second-person singular is {{wikt-lang|da|du}} and the formal form of address uses the third-person plural {{wikt-lang|da|De}}, capitalized to distinguish it from its other use. The second-person plural {{wikt-lang|da|I}} and the third-person singular {{wikt-lang|da|han}} ("he") or {{wikt-lang|da|hun}} ("she") were sometimes used until the early 19th century in standard Danish&lt;ref&gt;As in [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s dramas.&lt;/ref&gt; and awhile longer in the countryside. The German-inspired form {{lang|da|De}} entered Danish in the 18th century, too late to enter liturgical use. In church, as in rural or dialect-speaking areas, {{lang|da|du}} has always been the universal form, especially in [[Jutland]].

As in other Scandinavian languages, even among the prestige dialects, the formal pronoun is waning in use — in the case of Danish, since the {{lang|da|[[:da:Ungdomsoprøret i Danmark|Ungdomsoprøret]]}} ("Youth Revolts") during and after the [[protests of 1968]]. As a general rule, the informal {{lang|da|du}} is accepted everywhere today, except when addressing [[Danish royal family|royalty]]{{refn|Some members of the royal family insist upon it. During a 2010 interview with a [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] journalist on board the training ship ''[[Danmark (ship)|Danmark]]'', [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]] pointedly refused to answer a question posed in the {{lang|da|du}} form until the reporter rephrased it as {{lang|da|De}}. The public debate then centered around whether the prince had demonstrated snobbishness, the journalist ignorance, or both.&lt;ref&gt;DR 2. [http://vimeo.com/66100977 Prince Joachim interview].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Motion.com. [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzudzv_arrogant-prins-joachim-pa-skoleskibet-danmark-irettesatte-en-journalist_news Arrogant Prince Joachim].&lt;/ref&gt;}} or during military service. In other contexts, it has come to seem excessively formal and old-fashioned to most Danes.{{refn|A 2012 survey found that only 6% of Danes would use {{lang|da|De}} towards anyone they met and 16% would self-consciously never use it. However, 64% accepted its use towards members of the [[Danish royal family]].&lt;ref name=bork&gt;Etik.dk. ''[http://m.etik.dk/artikel/469393:Danmark--Hver-fjerde-dansker-vil-afskaffe--De Hver fjerde dansker vil afskaffe 'De']'' ["One in four Danes want to abolish '{{lang|da|De}}'&amp;thinsp;"]. 6 July 2012. {{da-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even at job interviews and among [[f
olketing|parliamentarians]],&lt;ref&gt;During debates at the [[Folketing]], members are required to address one another in the third person by title or with the prefix of {{lang|da|hr.}} (Mr.) or {{lang|da|fru}} (Mrs.), {{lang|da|frøken}} (Miss) having recently been given up. In debates away from the rostrum, however, they invariably default to {{lang|da|du}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|da|du}} has become standard.

In written Danish, {{lang|da|De}} remains current in legal, legislative, and formal business documents, as well as in some translations from other languages. This is sometimes audience-dependent, as in the Danish government's general use of {{lang|da|du}} except in healthcare information directed towards the elderly,{{refn|The same 2012 survey said 46% of Danes use {{lang|da|De}} when speaking towards the elderly, out of respect. At the same time, the elderly were much more supportive of abolishing the word entirely.&lt;ref name="bork"/&gt;}} where {{lang|da|De}} is still used. Other times, it is maintained as an affectation, as by the staff of some formal restaurants, the {{lang|da|[[Weekendavisen]]|italic=yes}} newspaper, [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] announcers, and the avowedly conservative [[Maersk]] corporation. Attempts by other corporations to avoid sounding either stuffy or too informal by employing circumlocutions — using [[passive voice|passive phrasing]] or using the pronoun {{lang|da|man}} ("one") — have generally proved awkward and been ill-received,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Erik. ''Skulle vi ikke være Des''. ''[http://www.målogmæle.dk/MoM-arkiv/MoM_21/MoM21_1.pdf Mål og Mæle]'', #1. 1998. {{Da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with the notable exception of the national railway [[Danske Statsbaner|DSB]]) most have opted for the more personable {{lang|da|du}} form.

===== Icelandic =====
Modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] is the Scandinavian dialect closest to [[Old Norse]], which made a distinction between the plural {{lang|is|þér}} and the dual {{lang|is|þið}}. This distinction continued in written Icelandic the early 1920 when the plural {{lang|is|þér}} was also used on formal occasions. The formal usage of {{lang|is|þér}} seems to have pushed the dual {{lang|is|þið}} to take over the plural so modern Icelandic normally uses {{lang|is|þið}} as a plural. However, in formal documents such as by the president {{lang|is|þér}} is still used as plural, and the usage of {{lang|is|þér}} as plural and {{lang|is|þið}} as dual is still retained in the Icelandic translation of the Christian scriptures. There are still a number of fixed expressions — particularly religious adages such as "seek and ye shall find" ({{lang|is|leitið og þér munuð finna}}) — and the formal pronoun is sometimes used in translations from a language that adheres to a T–V distinction, but otherwise it appears only when one wants to be excessively formal either from the gravity of the occasion (as in court proceedings and legal correspondence) or out of contempt (in order to ridicule another person's self-importance), and {{lang|is|þú}} is used in all other cases.

===== Norwegian =====
In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the polite form {{lang|nb|De}}/{{lang|nb|Dem}} ({{lang|nb|[[Bokmål]]|italic=no}}) and {{lang|nn|De}}/{{lang|nn|Dykk}} ({{lang|nn|[[Nynorsk]]|italic=no}}) has more or less disappeared in both spoken and written language. Norwegians now exclusively use {{lang|no|du}}, and the polite form does not have a strong cultural pedigree in the country. Until recently, {{lang|no|De}} would sometimes be found in written works, business letters, plays and translations where an impression of formality must be retained. The popular belief that {{lang|no|De}} is reserved for the [[king of Norway|king]] is incorrect, since according to royal etiquette, the King (and other members of the royal family) will be addressed as {{lang|nb|Deres majestet}} ({{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}})/{{lang|nn|Dykkar majestet}} ({{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}}) (Your majesty) or in third person singular as {{lang|no|Hans majestet}} (His majesty), {{lang|nb|Hennes majestet}}/{{lang|nn|Hennar majestet}} (Her majesty), {{lang|no|Kongen}} (the King), {{lang|no|Dronningen}} (the Queen) and similar.

Norwegians generally refer to one another by first name only, unless the person is better known by full or last name only. This also contributes to the weakening of these pronouns and a general pattern of declining use of polite speech. For example, a student might address their professor by their first name, but would refer to a leading politician by their last name. Norwegian politicians and celebrities are sometimes referred to by their first names, especially in newspaper headlines, while the text of the article most likely would use the person's last name. Nicknames are not very common.

The distinction between {{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}} and {{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}} exists primarily for written Norwegian (most Norwegians speak dialects that differ from the standard written forms), and the T–V rules are the same for both forms—except that {{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}} uses the third person plural to indicate politeness (as in German), while {{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}} uses the second person plural (as in French). In both forms, when these pronouns are used to indicate politeness, they are always capitalised (to show deference, and separate them from when they indicate, respectively, the third and second person plural).

===== Swedish =====
{{Main|Du-reformen}}
In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], there has in the last two centuries been a marked difference between usage in [[Finland Swedish]] and in [[Sweden]].

In the Swedish of Sweden, the polite {{lang|sv|Ni}} was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether. Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the 1960s.

As the 20th century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. In the sixties, the so-called {{lang|sv|[[du-reformen]]}} ('thou-reform') was carried out. First, authorities and influential circles tried rehabilitating the {{lang|sv|Ni}} in a so-called "{{lang|sv|ni}} reform"—but most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, almost overnight and dubbed the "{{lang|sv|du}} reform", the system broke down, and {{lang|sv|du}} (noted as informal above) became the accepted way of addressing anyone except for royalty.

Addressing royalty went somewhat more slowly from a universal {{lang|sv|Ers majestät}} ('Your Majesty'), etc., to that address only on formal occasions, otherwise replaced by third person (singular if the addressee is single) with title ({{lang|sv|K(on)ungen}} 'the King', etc.).

These rules still apply, with marginal exceptions. The vast majority of Swedes, including younger people in most or all situations, stick to the {{lang|sv|du}}. In order to "alleviate the intrusion" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the {{lang|sv|Du}} can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal ''du'' address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial {{lang|sv|Ni}} revival.

Finland Swedish has undergone a similar development to mainland Swedish since the 1960s, but slower and slightly less. There, one may have to reckon with influence from the [[Finnish language]], still slightly more conservative. In Finland Swedish, the second person plural form {{lang|sv|Ni}} (noted as formal above) was indeed the traditional respectful address to a single person up to the 1970s or so.

Swedish, also, has verbs for the addresses: {{lang|sv|dua}} 'to say {{lang|sv|du}}', and {{lang|sv|nia}} 'to say {{lang|sv|ni}}'.

==== Scots ====
In [[Modern Scots]] the second person singular nominative {{lang|sco|thoo}} ({{IPA|[ðuː]}}, [[Southern Scots]] {{IPA|[ðʌu]}}, [[Shetlandic]] {{IPA|[duː]}}) survived in colloquial speech until the mid 19th century in most of lowland Scotland.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} It has since been replaced by {{lang|sco|ye}}/{{lang|sco|you}} in most areas except in [[Insular Scots]] where {{lang|sco|thee}} ({{IPA|[ðiː]}}, Shetlandic {{IPA|[diː]}}) is also used, in [[North Northern Scots]] and in some Southern Scots varieties. {{lang|sco|Thoo}} is used as the familiar form by parents speaking to children, elders to youngsters, or between friends or equals. The second person formal singular {{lang|sco|ye}} or {{lang|sco|you}} is used when speaking to a superior or when a youngster addresses an elder. The older second person singular possessive {{lang|sco|thy}} ({{IPA|[ðai]}}), and {{lang|sco|thee}} ({{IPA|[ði]}}, Shetlandic {{IPA|[diː]}} along with {{lang|sco|thine(s)}} {{IPA|[dəin(z)]}}) still survive to some extent where {{lang|sco|thoo}} remains in use.

==== Yiddish ====
[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] makes use of the second person plural form as the polite form for both singular and plural. In the second person plural form {{lang|yi|איר}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|ir}}), there is therefore no distinction between formal and informal forms. There is a [[dialect]]al pronoun {{lang|yi|עץ}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|ets}}) strictly for informal second-person plural form, but this pronoun is rarely used today and is only found in some dialects of Poland and neighboring regions.

Given that old German dialects were the main influence on the development of the Yiddish language, this form may be recognized with older polite forms of the German language.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

=== Romance languages ===
==== French ====
In most [[French language|French]]-speaking regions (Canada is an exception; see "[[#North American French|North American French]]" below), a rigid T–V distinction is upheld. With regard to the second person singular, {{lang|fr|tu}} is used informally, whereas {{lang|fr|vous}} is used to convey formality. (The second person plural is always {{lang|fr|vous}}.) The formal {{lang|fr|vous}} is expected when encountering any unknown adult under normal circumstances. In general, the switch from {{lang|fr|vous}} to {{lang|fr|tu}} is "negotiated" on a case-by-case basis; it can happen nearly unconsciously, or can be explicitly negotiated. For instance, some couples have been known to call each other {{lang|fr|vous}} for some time while dating, and gradually switch to calling each other {{lang|fr|tu}}. The verb {{wikt-lang|fr|tutoyer}} means "address someone with {{lang|fr|tu}}-forms, speak informally"; by contrast {{lang|fr|vouvoyer}} means "address someone with {{wikt-lang|fr|vous}} forms". Rigidly sticking to ''vous'' can become equally awkward in a long-standing relationship.

In certain circumstances, however, {{lang|fr|tu}} is used more broadly. For example, new acquaintances who are conscious of having something socially significant in common (e.g., student status, or the same "rank" in some hierarchy) often use ''tu'' more or less immediately. In some cases, there may be an explicitly defined practice in a particular company, political party, as to the use of {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}}. Also, using the {{lang|fr|vous}} in conjunction with someone's given name is rather current in France as a less formal way of addressing someone, e.g. at work, among members of an association etc. Children and adolescents generally use {{lang|fr|tu}} to speak with someone of their own age, whether known or not. {{lang|fr|Tu}} can also be used to show disrespect to a stranger, such as when surprising a thief or cursing other drivers on the road.

{{lang|fr|Vous}} may be used to distance oneself from a person with whom one does not want to interact. Additionally, two people who use {{lang|fr|tu}} in their private interactions may consciously switch back to {{lang|fr|vous}} in public in order to act appropriately in a formal or professional environment, to play the part in an artificially constructed situation (such as between co-hosts of a television show), or simply to conceal the nature of their relationship from others.

In families, {{lang|fr|vous}} was traditionally used to address older family members. Children were taught to use {{lang|fr|vous}} to address their parents, and {{lang|fr|vous}} was used until about 1950 between spouses of the higher classes. Former president [[Jacques Chirac]] and his wife Bernadette are a prominent example of the continuation of this usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/19/style/19iht-blume.t.html |title=Mastering the Unmasterable: A French Puzzle |author=Mary Blume |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=19 February 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When praying, {{lang|fr|tu}} is nowadays often used in addressing the deity, though {{lang|fr|vous}} was used in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] prayers until the [[Second Vatican Council]], and is still used to address the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. In Louisiana, however, {{lang|fr|vous}} is always used to convey a sense of respect and reverence when praying.

In Walloon, the use of which tends, in any case, to be restricted mostly to "familiar" contexts, {{lang|wa|vos}} (equivalent to {{lang|fr|vous}}) is the general usage and is considered informal and friendly. {{lang|wa|Ti}} (equivalent to {{lang|fr|tu}}), on the other hand, is considered vulgar, and its use can be taken as an expression of an aggressive attitude towards the person addressed. This influence from Walloon affects the usage of {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}} in the French spoken in Belgium, though more so among people accustomed to using Walloon as their everyday language (a tiny minority, mostly in the countryside). The influence of Standard French, particularly as exercised through the [[mass media]], is eroding this particularity among younger French-speakers.

In the {{lang|fr|[[early modern France|ancien régime]]}}, the use of honorific styles or their abbreviation {{lang|fr|Elle}} (literally ''she'', irrespective of the gender of the addressee, as the honorifics were feminine nouns) together with the 3rd person singular was also common. See below for [[#Italian|Italian]] which has kept this style.

===== North American French =====
[[Canadian French|North American dialects of French]], including [[Quebec French]] and [[Acadian French]] as well as [[Louisiana French]], permit and expect a far broader usage of the familiar {{lang|fr|tu}} than in [[Standard French]]. There are still circumstances in which it is necessary to say {{lang|fr|vous}}: in a formal interview (notably for a job) or when addressing people of very high rank (such as judges or prime ministers), senior citizens, between professors and students in universities, towards customers or new acquaintances in a formal setting. As acquaintances become familiar with one another, they may find {{lang|fr|vous}} to be unnecessarily formal and may agree to return to the {{lang|fr|tu}} with which they are generally more comfortable.

For a number of Francophones in Canada, {{lang|fr|vous}} sounds stilted or snobbish, and archaic. {{lang|fr|Tu}} is by no means restricted to intimates or social inferiors. There is however an important minority of people, often those who call for a use of standard French in Quebec, who prefer to be addressed as {{lang|fr|vous}}. At [[Radio-Canada]] (the public broadcaster, often considered as establishing the normative objectives of standard French in Canada), the use of {{lang|fr|vous}} is widespread even among colleagues.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===== African French =====
In {{lang|fr|[[Côte d'Ivoire]]|italic=no}}, local languages (such as [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]], [[Dyula language|Dioula]], etc.) do not make a distinction between informal or formal pronouns, which reflects on the local usage of French. It is thus uncommon to call an individual {{lang|fr|vous}}. A waiter, shop-keeper or taxi driver can very well call a customer {{lang|fr|vous}}, just like an employee towards a superior. For example, an accountant could call her direct branch manager {{lang|fr|tu}}, but will still use {{lang|fr|vous}} to address the company's CEO.

Relationships between men and women are typically less formal than between people of the same gender (a female supermarket worker will more easily say {{lang|fr|tu}} towards a male customer than her male colleague).

Even in formal situations (business, politics), the superiors can often be called in a familiar way by subordinates who will use affectionate terms of address such as {{lang|fr|vieux père}}, {{lang|fr|papa}}, {{lang|fr|tonton}}, {{lang|fr|patron}}, {{lang|fr|boss}} for males, {{lang|fr|la vieille mère}}, {{lang|fr|maman}}, {{lang|fr|tata}}, {{lang|fr|patronne}} for females, instead of the standard {{lang|fr|monsieur}} and {{lang|fr|madame}}. Superiors reciprocate with terms of address such as {{lang|fr|mon fils}}, {{lang|fr|mon petit}}, {{lang|fr|ma chérie}}, {{lang|fr|ma fille}}. All those terms of address typically exclude the use of "vous".

The use is also conditioned to the "level" of French being spoken: using a Standard French code and/or accent (what is call {{lang|fr-CI|chocoter}} in [[Ivorian French]]) will prompt addresses of {{lang|fr|vous}}, whereas [[code switching]] to Ivorian French will typically invite a concomitant switch to {{lang|fr|tu}}.

Informed local people will still, most of the time, make a conscious effort to use {{lang|fr|vous}} and {{lang|fr|monsieur}}/{{lang|fr|madame}} when addressing Westerners in formal situations (unless, again, that Westerner talks Ivorian French rather than Standard French). Other groups of foreigners such as other Africans, Asians or Middle-Eastern people are less likely to enjoy that "privilege".

The use of {{lang|fr|vous}}, just like the use of {{lang|fr|monsieur}} and {{lang|fr|madame}}, is thus restricted to very formal situations where Standard French is being used, mostly for the higher class between themselves: managers at a meeting with the CEO, representatives of different political parties, upper class people who don't know each other at a social gathering. A switching to {{lang|fr|tu}} can still happen as soon as the formal event is over (such as managers getting out of the meeting room) or just after having been introduced to each other – usually simultaneous to a switch from Standard French to Ivorian French.

==== Catalan ====
[[Catalan language|Catalan]] uses the singular pronouns {{lang|ca|tu}} (informal) and {{lang|ca|vostè}} (formal), while {{lang|ca|vosaltres}} (informal) and {{lang|ca|vostès}} (formal) are used for two or more addressees. The form {{lang|ca|vós}}, used instead of {{lang|ca|tu}} to address someone respectfully, follows the same concordance rules as the French {{lang|fr|vous}} (verbs in second person plural, adjectives in singular), and {{lang|ca|vostè}} follows the same concordance rules as the Spanish {{lang|es|usted}} (verbs in third person). {{lang|ca|Vostè}} originated from {{lang|ca|vostra mercè}} as a [[calque]] from Spanish, and replaced the original Catalan form {{lang|ca|vós}}.

In some dialects, {{lang|ca|vós}} is no longer used. Other dialects have a three-way distinction {{lang|ca|tu}} / {{lang|ca|vós}} / {{lang|ca|vostè}}, where {{lang|ca|vós}} is used as a respectful form for elders and respected friends, and {{lang|ca|vostè}} for foreigners and people whom one does not know well. {{lang|ca|Vostè}} is more distant than {{lang|ca|vós}}.

The Administration uses {{lang|ca|vós}} to address people.

==== Spanish ====
{{See also|Spanish dialects|voseo}}

In [[Peninsular Spanish|Peninsular]], [[Mexican Spanish|Mexican]], and [[Peruvian Spanish|Peruvian]] Spanish, as in [[#Italian|Italian]], an original {{lang|es|tú}} and {{lang|es|vos}} usage similar to [[#French|French]] disappeared in the [[Early Modern period]]. Today, {{lang|es|tú}} is used for informal and familiar address while the respectful form is the third-person {{lang|es|usted}}, which can be used respectfully to anyone. Scholars argue that {{lang|es|usted}} evolved as a contraction of the [[Old Spanish]] {{lang|osp|Vuestra Merced}} ("your mercy"), with {{lang|es|vusted}} as a transitional form. In some cases, the title {{lang|es|[[Don (honorific)|Don]]}} is also employed when speaking to a respected older man, while {{lang|es|Doña}} is used for older women.

Among [[Spanish dialects]], the situation is complicated by the fact that the [[Spanish Empire]] was created during the middle of this linguistic shift, leading to differing linguistic norms being established across its territory. The region surrounding the [[Colombia]]n capital of [[Bogotá]] (although not the city itself) preserves an alternate respectful form {{lang|es-CO|sumercé}} simplified from a different contraction of {{lang|es|vuestra merced}}. In [[Rioplatense]], {{lang|es|vos}} was preserved — but as a replacement for {{lang|es|tú}} and not as a respectful form of address; in [[Chilean Spanish|Chile]], in Western [[Venezuela]], parts of [[Colombia]] and in [[Central American Spanish|Central America]], {{lang|es|vos}} is used in spoken address and {{lang|es|tú}} is used in print and to express moderate formality, that is, it has essentially switched its function to the former role of {{lang|es|vos}}. In [[Costa Rica]] and part of Colombia, {{lang|es|usted}} is used as the common pronoun, using it both in formal and informal situations.

In the second-person plural, modern Spanish speakers in most of [[Spain]] employ {{lang|es-ES|vosotros}} (masculine) and {{lang|es-ES|vosotras}} (feminine) informally and (as the third-person plural) {{lang|es-ES|ustedes}} to express respect. In western [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalucia]], {{lang|es|ustedes}} is used in both contexts, but its verbs are conjugated in the second-person plural. Throughout the Americas and the [[Canarian Spanish|Canaries]], {{lang|es|ustedes}} is used in all contexts and in the third person.

==== Portuguese ====
{{See also|Portuguese personal pronouns}}

===== European Portuguese =====
In [[European Portuguese]] (as well as in [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Africa]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Macau]]), {{lang|pt|tu}} (singular "you") is commonly used as the familiar addressing pronoun, while {{lang|pt|você}} is a general form of address; {{lang|pt|vocês}} (plural both of {{lang|pt|tu}} and {{lang|pt|você}}) is used for both familiar and general. The forms {{lang|pt|o senhor}} and {{lang|pt|a senhora}} (plurals {{lang|pt|os senhores}} and {{lang|pt|as senhoras}}) are used for more formal situations (roughly equivalent to "Mr/Sir" and "Mrs/Madam".) Similarly to some Romance languages (e.g. Italian), {{lang|pt|tu}} can be omitted because the verb ending provides the necessary information. Not so much so with {{lang|pt|você}} or {{lang|pt|o senhor}} / {{lang|pt|a senhora}} because the verb ending is the same as for the third person (historically, {{lang|pt|você}} derives from {{lang|pt|vossa mercê}} ("your mercy" or "your grace") via the intermediate forms {{lang|pt|vossemecê}} and {{lang|pt|vosmecê}}). The second person plural pronoun {{lang|pt|vós}}, from Latin {{lang|la|vos}}, is archaic in most of the Portuguese-speaking world, but can be heard in liturgy and has a limited regional use.

===== Brazilian Portuguese =====
In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], {{lang|pt|você}} and {{lang|pt|vocês}} (singular and plural "you", respectively) are used informally, while {{lang|pt|o senhor}} and {{lang|pt|a senhora}} ("Mr"/"Sir" and "Mrs"/"Madam", plurals {{lang|pt|os senhores}} and {{lang|pt|as senhoras}}) are used in formal speech. Although now seen as archaic, {{lang|pt|a senhorita}} is used when speaking ironically, very formally or when one is demonstrating respect to a superior and it is sometimes replaced by {{lang|pt-BR|moça}} ("Lady"). Informal terms of respect to superiors, elders or strangers are {{lang|pt-BR|Seu}} (abbreviation of {{lang|pt|senhor}}) and {{lang|pt|Dona}} (feminine of {{lang|pt|Dom}} i.e. {{lang|pt|Don}}). {{lang|pt-BR|Moço}}/{{lang|pt-BR|rapaz}} and {{lang|pt-BR|moça}} ("Lad"/"Young man" and "Lady") are used by seniors when addressing non-intimate youths and also as an equalizing form among strange youths. {{lang|pt-BR|Jovem}} ("youngster") is used in the same manner by elders when addressing strange youths of both genders.

On premises where the atmosphere requires extreme formality like the Senate or different courts, the protocolar forms to address dignitaries {{lang|pt|Vossa Excelência}} ("Your Excellence") and {{lang|pt|Vossa Senhoria}} ("Your Lordship/Ladyship") can still be heard. In a direct address to a judge or the president, {{lang|pt|Vossa Excelência}} must follow the vocatives {{lang|pt|Meritíssimo/a}} ("Your Honour", literally "full of merit") and {{lang|pt|Sr/Sra Presidente}} ("Mr/Mrs" President). When addressing an ecclesiastical dignitary the form {{lang|pt|Vossa Reverência}} ("Your Reverence") is used. Although {{lang|pt|Vossa Senhoria}} is regarded as protocolar, it is an equalizing form.

In many parts of the geographic extension of the language e.g. most of [[South Region, Brazil|Southern]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] Brazil, some [[sociolect]]s of coastal São Paulo, mainly in Greater [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]], colloquial {{lang|pt-BR|[[carioca]]}} sociolect, mainly among the less educated and some all-[[social class|class]] [[youth]]s of [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]], and in [[Riverense Portuñol language|Uruguay]], ''tu'' (singular "you" or simply "thou") is used informally, but the plural form is always {{lang|pt|vocês}}. For the overwhelmingly majority of people, the pronoun {{lang|pt|tu}} is commonly used with the verb conjugated as {{lang|pt|você}} (third-person singular) rather than in the traditional conjugation (second-person singular). {{lang|pt|Tu}} is somewhat familiar, even intimate, and should never be addressed to superiors, or strange elders, while {{lang|pt|você}} is much more neutral, although equalizing.

The dialect that includes {{lang|pt-BR|[[Florianópolis]]|italic=no}}, capital city of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], as well as its shore and inner regions in the proximity like [[Blumenau]], is an exception, as the use of {{lang|pt|tu}} is widespread, even addressing formally to an authority or to a superior. It is one of the few dialects in [[Brazil]] in which second-person singular agreement is used (along with the relatively conservative dialect of the state of {{lang|pt-BR|Maranhão|italic=no}}).

==== Italian ====
In [[Standard Italian]] the informal second-person singular pronoun is {{lang|it|tu}} and the formal second-person singular pronoun is {{lang|it|Lei}} (&lt;small&gt;inf.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"she", &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"her"), always used with the third-person singular conjugation of the verb. The pronouns may be freely omitted.&lt;ref&gt;As especially polite alternatives, one may capitalize the pronoun to {{lang|it|Lei}} or use {{lang|it|Ella}} (lit.&amp;nbsp;"She"); both sound quite archaic. If the pronoun is capitalized, the majuscule is applied to all its forms including the [[enclitic]]s: {{lang|it|...vorrei incontrarLa per parlarGliene}} ("I would like to talk to you about it").&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the original meaning of {{lang|it|lei}}, modern Italian typically [[agreement (linguistics)|concords]] with the gender of the addressee when {{lang|it|lei}} is the sentence subject; using feminine adjectives for a male addressee is not especially insulting but sounds confusing, literary or even archaic. When {{lang|it|lei}} is an object, using feminine adjectives is normal ({{lang|it|l'ho vista}}, i.e. "I saw you (m.)"), whereas gender concord is considered non-standard ({{lang|it|l'ho visto}}, i.e. "I saw you (m.)).

{{lang|it|Lei}} is normally used in formal settings or with strangers, although it implies a sense of distance (even coldness) similar to the [[#French|French]] use of {{lang|fr|vous}}. Presently Italian adults prefer to employ {{lang|it|tu}} towards strangers until around 30 years old. It is used reciprocally between adults; the usage may not be reciprocal when young people address older strangers or otherwise respected people. Students are addressed with {{lang|it|tu}} by their teachers until the end of high school with few exceptions and usually with {{lang|it|Lei}} in universities. Students might use {{lang|it|tu}} with their teachers in elementary school, but switch to {{lang|it|Lei}} from middle school. {{lang|it|Tu}} is the common form of address on the Internet&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012" /&gt; and within some professions {{ndash}} such as journalism and law {{ndash}} as a recognition of comradeship. In the law however the {{lang|it|tu}} is only used in informal settings; in the courtroom it is used only to small children, if ever any happens to appear there. The second-person plural pronoun is {{lang|it|voi}}. Its polite counterpart was formerly {{lang|it|Loro}} ("They"), but it is now little used outside of self-consciously formal situations such as expensive restaurants.

{{wikt-lang|it|Voi}} is the traditional polite form of address in [[Tuscan dialect]]s: [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] employs it in his 14th-century ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' when showing particular respect.&lt;ref&gt;As when meeting his former teacher: {{lang|it|Siete Voi qui, ser Brunetto?}} ("Are you here, sir Brunetto?").&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|it|Lei}} began to replace it during the [[Renaissance]] and then, under [[#Spanish|Spanish]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|influence]], it became common to contract obsequious honorifics such as "Your Lordship", "Eminence", and "Majesty", all of which are feminine third-person singular nouns in Italian ({{lang|it|Vostra Signoria}}, {{lang|it|Eminenza}}, {{lang|it|Maestà}}). Over the next four centuries, all three pronouns — {{lang|it|tu}}, {{lang|it|Voi}}, {{lang|it|Lei}} — were employed together to express degrees of formality and status, as displayed in [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]'s 19th-century ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]''. {{lang|it|Voi}} continues to be used by some speakers, particularly of [[Regional Italian|Southern dialects]], as an alternative to {{lang|it|Lei}} in polite address, but its use is increasingly uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Serianni |first=Luca |title= La Crusca per voi |url= http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/allocutivi-cortesia |issue=no. 20 |date= April 2000 |language=it }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of {{lang|it|Voi}} was imposed by the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascists]] from 1938 to 1944. {{lang|it|Voi}} still appears in comics, and in instruction books and advertisements where {{lang|it|Lei}} would sound too distant, but in the latter case most of the time it is used directly as a plural and not as a polite singular. (An example of all three forms of address in action is the Italian ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' translation: a character such as Aragorn is usually addressed as {{lang|it|lei}}, but neither {{lang|it|lei}} nor {{lang|it|tu}} seemed appropriate for how Samwise addresses his higher-class friend and employer Frodo; Sam calls Frodo {{lang|it|voi}}, in consequence.)

Although seldom encountered, the third person {{lang|it|la Signoria Vostra}} or {{lang|it|la S.V.}} ("Your Lord-" or "Ladyship") is sometimes seen in formal correspondence and invitations, as a stronger form of its descendant {{lang|it|lei}}.

==== Romanian ====
The [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word {{wikt-lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} when used for the second-person singular formal takes plural verbs but singular adjectives, similar to French {{lang|fr|vous}}. It is used roughly in the same manner as in Continental French and shows no signs of disappearing. It is also used as a more formal {{wikt-lang|ro|voi}}. It originates from {{lang|ro|domnia voastră}} – your lordship. In the past it was used extreme rarely to nobles especially, but its sense extended to other people in the 20th century but not so common and when the communists arrived it took the actual form.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}{{cn|date=April 2017}} As happens with all subject pronouns, {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} is often omitted from sentences, its use being implied by verbs in the second person plural form.

The form {{wikt-lang|ro|dumneata}} (originating from {{lang|ro|domnia ta}} – thy lordship) is less distant than {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} and somewhat midway between {{lang|ro|tu}} and {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}}. The verb is conjugated, as for {{lang|ro|tu}}, in the second person singular form. Older people towards younger people and peers favor {{lang|ro|dumneata}}. Its use is gradually declining.

A more colloquial form of {{lang|ro|dumneata}} is {{wikt-lang|ro|mata}}, {{wikt-lang|ro|matale}} or {{wikt-lang|ro|tălică}}. It is more familiar than {{lang|ro|tu}} and is used only in some regions of Romania. It is used only with immediate family members, and is spelled and pronounced the same in all cases, similar to {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}}. It is used with verbs in the second person singular, as is {{lang|ro|tu}}.

The plural form is a recent borrowing. [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], like Classical Latin, do not have the plural form.

==== Sicilian ====
Most dialects of Sicilian Language have utilised {{lang|scn|vussìa}}, {{lang|scn|vossìa}}, or {{lang|scn|vassa}} to express formality. However, due to encroachment by Italian language {{lang|it|Lei}} has become increasingly common particularly among younger speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to Sicilian Grammar |last=Cipolla |first=Gaetano |publisher=Legas |year= |isbn=1881901254 |pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hellenic ===
==== Ancient and Hellenistic or Koine Greek ====
In [[Ancient Greek]], {{lang|grc-Latn|sý}} ({{lang|grc|σύ}}) was the singular, and {{lang|grc-Latn|hymeis}} ({{lang|grc|ὑμεῖς}}) the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] addresses King [[Agrippa II]] as {{lang|grc-Latn|sý}} ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 26:2).

Later, {{lang|grc-Latn|hymeís}} and {{lang|grc-Latn|hēmeís}} ({{lang|grc|ἡμεῖς}},"we") became too close in pronunciation, and a new plural {{lang|grc-Latn|seís}} or {{lang|grc-Latn|eseís}} ({{lang|grc|σεις}}/{{lang|grc|εσείς}}) was invented, the initial {{lang|grc-Latn|e}} ({{lang|grc|ε}}) being a [[euphony|euphonic]] prefix that was also extended to the singular ({{lang|grc-Latn|sý}}/{{lang|grc-Latn|esý}}).

==== Modern Greek ====
In [[Greek language|Modern Greek]], {{lang|el|εσείς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|eseís}}, second person plural) with second person plural verb conjugation is used as the formal counterpart of {{lang|el|εσύ}} ({{lang|el-Latn|esý}}, second person singular) when talking to strangers and elders, although in everyday life it is common to speak to strangers of your age or younger using the singular pronoun. In addition, the informal second person singular is used even with older people you are acquainted with, depending on the level of mutual familiarity.

Since the formal {{lang|el|εσείς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|eseís}}) has become less common outside schools and workplaces, many people often do not know which form to use (because using a formal version might sound too snobbish even to an elder and using the informal version might sound inappropriate to some strangers) and thus prefer to replace verbs with nouns (avoiding the dilemma) until enough information on the counterpart's intentions is gathered in order to choose between formal or informal second person pronoun and verb conjugation. A good rule of thumb is that singular accompanies first names and plural accompanies surnames with title (Mr, Mrs, etc.). Exceptions are rare, for example younger schoolchildren may address their teacher in the plural, title and ''first name'', or an officer may address a soldier in the singular and surname. The sequence singular-title-surname is a faux pas that can often indicate lack of education, of good manners, or of both.

The modern [[social custom]] when using Greek in Greece is to ask the other person "may we speak in the singular?" in which the other person is expected to answer "yes" and afterwards the discussion continues using the informal {{lang|el|εσύ}} ({{lang|el-Latn|esý}}); it is unthinkable for the other person to answer "no" or show preference for plural forms, and for this reason one should not even ask this question to a person of high status, such as a professional. Therefore, asking this question can itself be considered a form of disrespect in some social situations. Likewise, not asking this question and simply using the singular without prior explicit or implicit agreement would also be considered disrespectful in various social contingencies. In other cases, even using the formal plural (without a question) could also be considered offensive. A person being inappropriately addressed in the singular will often indicate their displeasure by insisting on responding in the plural, in a display of irony that may or may not be evident to the other party. A similar social custom exists with the words {{lang|el|κύριε}} ([[Mr]]/[[Sir]]) and {{lang|el|κυρία}} ([[Mrs]]/[[Madam]]), which can show both respect and a form of "mock respect" essentially communicating disapproval, often depending on the voice intonation and the social situation. Overall, the distinction between formal and informal forms of address and when to use each can be quite subtle and not easily discernible by a non-native speaker.

[[Cypriot Greek]] traditionally had no T–V distinction, with even persons of very high social status addressed in the singular, usually together with an honorific or title such as {{lang|el-CY|δάσκαλε}} ("teacher", mainly for priests) or {{lang|el-CY|μάστρε}} (literally "master", loosely "sir"). Even today, the singular form is used much more frequently in [[Cyprus]] compared to Greece, although this is changing under the influence of [[Standard Modern Greek]]. The plural form is now expected in a formal setting.

=== Celtic ===
==== Scottish Gaelic ====
In [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], the informal form of the second-person singular is {{lang|gd|thu}}/{{lang|gd|tu}} (emphatic: {{lang|gd|thusa}}/{{lang|gd|tusa}}), used when addressing a person the speaker knows well, or when addressing a person younger or relatively the same age as the speaker. When addressing a superior, an elder, or a stranger, or in conducting business, the form {{lang|gd|sibh}} (emphatic: {{lang|gd|sibhse}}) is used. ({{lang|gd|Sibh}} is also the second person plural). This distinction carries over into [[conjugated preposition|prepositional pronouns]]: for instance, {{lang|gd|agad}} and {{lang|gd|agaibh}} (at you), {{lang|gd|riut}} and {{lang|gd|ribh}} (against you), {{lang|gd|romhad}} and {{lang|gd|romhaibh}} (before you), etc., and into [[possessive pronoun]]s {{lang|gd|do}} and {{lang|gd|ur}} (your).

==== Irish ====
In Irish, the use of {{lang|ga|sibh}} as an address to one person has died out, and {{lang|gd|tú}} is preferred. Formerly, [[Roman Catholic]] priests were addressed with the plural form {{lang|gd|sibh}}, especially in Ulster, due to the possibility that the priest may be carrying the [[Eucharist]] on his person—belief in the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] would require the use of the plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subject: Re: sibh &amp; thu |publisher=GAELIC-L Archives |date=29 October 1991 |url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9110&amp;L=gaelic-l&amp;P=16479 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Welsh, Cornish and Breton ====
Modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] all retain a T–V distinction to varying degrees.

In spoken Welsh, the plural pronoun {{lang|cy|chi}} is used when speaking to strangers, elders or superiors, while {{lang|cy|ti}} (or {{lang|cy|chdi}} in some parts of the North) is used with friends, close family, animals and children. {{lang|cy|Ti}} is also the form used when addressing God. Nonetheless, the use of {{lang|cy|chi}} and {{lang|cy|ti}} varies between families and regions, but those guidelines are generally observed.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ceri Jones |title=Dweud Eich Dweud: A Guide to Colloquial and Idiomatic Welsh |year=2013 |location=Llandysul, Ceredigion |publisher=Gwasg Gomer |origyear=2001 |page=204 }}, which also cites {{cite book |author=Dic Jones |title=Os Hoffech Wybod |edition=1st |location=Caernarfon, Gwynedd |publisher=Gwasg Gwynedd |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|cy|Chwi}} is an alternative to {{lang|cy|chi}} found in very formal literary language. Alongside the usages explained above, [[Silent Generation|those born before 1945]] would, in their youth, use {{lang|cy|chi}} with a girl of about the same age.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"/&gt; Similarly to [[Italian language|Italian]], the third person singular is used by some speakers in the former [[Dyfed]] region of west Wales; it appears, however, that the pronoun used – between either {{lang|cy|e}} or {{lang|cy|fe}} (masculine, South), {{lang|cy|o}} or {{lang|cy|fo}} (masculine, North) and {{lang|cy|hi}} (feminine) – depends on the gender of the listener.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"/&gt;

A similar distinction exists between Cornish singular {{lang|kw|ty}} / {{lang|kw|chy}} and plural {{lang|kw|hwi}} / {{lang|kw|whi}}. The singular form is used when talking to friends, family, animals and children, and the plural form is used to talk to a group of people, or when being especially polite to one person.

In Breton the second person plural {{lang|kw|c'hwi}} is used as a polite form when addressing a single person and the singular {{lang|kw|te}} is reserved for informal situations. However, in a large area of central Brittany the singular form has been entirely replaced by {{lang|kw|c'hwi}}, as in English.

=== Balto-Slavic ===

==== Russian and Ukrainian (mainly Eastern) ====
Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] distinguishes between the familiar '''{{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}''' ({{lang|ru|ты}}) and the respectful '''{{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}''' ({{lang|ru|вы}}), the latter also being the plural of both forms. (Respectful {{lang|ru-Latn|Vy}} ({{lang|ru|Вы}}) may be capitalised in written correspondence, while plural {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is not.) The distinction appeared relatively recently and began to gain currency among the educated classes in the 18th century through French influence.&lt;ref name="popov"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/307220?uid=3738200&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103199636893 On the origin of Russian ''Vy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults but are taught to address adults with {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}. Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} but may transition to {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address B, then B also uses {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address A. While people may transition quickly from {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} to {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult (or, in the case of opposite-sexed people, overly flirtatious), particularly if the other party maintains using {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}.

Historically, the rules used to be more [[estates of the realm|class]]-specific: as late as at the end of the 19th century, it was accepted in some circles (in aristocracy and especially gentry) that {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} was to be used also between friends, between husband and wife, and when addressing one's parents (but not one's children), all of which situations today would strongly call for using {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}. Meanwhile, up to this day, common people, especially those living in rural areas, hardly ever use the polite {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}.&lt;ref name="popov" /&gt; Russian speakers online uphold the distinction and mainly use {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} for strangers, although in the earlier days of internet it was more common and expected to use {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address everyone.

The choice between {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} and {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is closely related to, yet sometimes different from, the choice of the addressing format – that is, the selection from the first name, [[patronymics]], last name, and the title to be used when addressing the person. Normally, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is associated with the informal addressing by first name only (or, even more informally, by the patronymic only), whereas {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is associated with the more formal addressing format of using the first name together with patronymics (roughly analogous to "title followed by last name" in English) or the last name together with a title (the last name is almost never used together with either of the other two names to ''address'' someone, although such combinations are routinely used to ''introduce'' or ''mention'' someone). However, nowadays, {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} can also be employed while addressing by first name only.

In Ukrainian, the present practice is essentially the same as in Russian, historically this was primarily in the Eastern, Russian-ruled part of Ukraine. Until about 1945, due to Polish influence, the practices in the former [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia|Volyn]] regions, tended to more closely resemble the Polish practices, as described below. But since those areas became annexed to the Soviet Union, the East Ukrainian and Russian practices have become prevalent all over Ukraine, with the {{lang|uk|панство}} {{lang|uk-Latn|panstvo}}, {{lang|uk|прошу пана}} {{lang|uk-Latn|proshu pana}}, {{lang|uk|прошу пани}} {{lang|uk-Latn|proshu pani}}, etc. forms only being preserved in the émigré diaspora.

==== Serbo-Croatian ====
In all standard forms of [[Serbo-Croatian]], i.e. [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], the use of {{lang|sh|ti}} is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any formal use, {{lang|sh|vi}}, the second-person plural, is used only;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |language=German |title=Wörter im Grenzbereich von Lexikon und Grammatik im Serbokroatischen |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Words on the Border Between Lexicon and Grammar |url= |series=Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; 18 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |year=2001 |pages=37–48 |isbn=3-89586-954-6 |lccn=2005530313 |oclc=47905097 |ol=2863539W}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6A80Mj8Bf?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Summary_Worter.pdf Summary].&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|sh|ti}} can be used among peers in a workplace but is rare in official documents. It is a common misconception, even among native speakers, that {{lang|sh|vi}} is always capitalized when used in formal tone; {{lang|sh|Vi}} is capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.

With the polite {{lang|sh|vi}}, masculine plural (in participles and adjectives) is used regardless of the sex of the person addressed.

==== Bulgarian ====
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] distinguishes between familiar {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} ({{lang|bg|ти}}) and respectful {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} ({{lang|bg|Вие}}). {{lang|bg-Latn|Ti}} is always singular and implies familiarity. {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}}, the plural of {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, also functions as the formal singular.

In addressing more than one person, the plural {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} is always used. For example, {{lang|bg|'''Вие''' двамата напуснете, моля!}}" means "''You'' two leave, please!"). Here, although {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} and {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} both means ''you'', {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} can not be used.

When addressing a single person, if the people talking are acquainted then singular {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} is used, otherwise plural {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} should be used. Sometimes people start a new acquaintance straightforwardly with singular {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, but generally this is considered offensive, rude, or simply impolite. Children are taught to always use {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} between themselves, but {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} for addressing more than one child or an unknown adult.

The grammatically correct spelling of the singular word {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} is always with a capital letter, whether being the first word in a sentence or not. For example, the sentence "But ''you'' are wrong!", if spelled (in Bulgarian) {{lang|bg|Но '''Вие''' грешите!}} (the word {{lang|bg|Вие}} with capital {{lang|bg|В}}), it would convey that the speaker is addressing an individual person with a plural, because he/she wants to express a polite, official manner; if spelt {{lang|bg|Но '''вие''' грешите!}} (the second possible Bulgarian translation of "But ''you'' are wrong!"), it would then mean that someone is talking to several persons.

Generally, {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} is used among friends and relatives. When talking to each other, young people often start with the formal {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} but quickly transition to {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} in an informal situation. Unless there is a substantial difference in social situation (e.g. a teacher and a student), the choice of the form is symmetric: if A. uses {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} to address B., then B. also uses {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} to address A. While people may transition quickly from {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} to {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. There is a recent trend not to use the formal {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} at all, but this can lead to awkward situations.

==== Macedonian ====
[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] distinguishes between familiar {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} ({{lang|mk|ти}}) and respectful {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} ({{lang|mk|вие}}) – which is also the plural of both forms, used to address a pair or group. (Respectful {{lang|mk-Latn|Vie}} may be capitalized, while plural {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} is not.) Generally, {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults, but are taught to address adults with {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}. Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}, but may transit to {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address B, then B also uses {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address A. While people may transit quickly from {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} to {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult, particularly if the other party maintains using {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}.

==== Polish ====
{{Main|Polish name#Formal and informal use|Honorifics (linguistics)#Polish|l2=Polish honorifics}}

Polish uses as formal forms the words {{lang|pl|pan}} (meaning "mister" or "gentleman") and {{lang|pl|pani}} ("lady"), and in the plural {{lang|pl|panowie}} ("gentlemen") and {{lang|pl|panie}} ("ladies") respectively, {{lang|pl|państwo}} being used for mixed groups (originally a neutral noun, meaning roughly "lordship", but also, and until today, "state"). {{lang|pl|Państwo}} is used with the plural, like {{lang|pl|panowie}} and {{lang|pl|panie}}. Because of their character as nouns (and not pronouns) these words are used with the third person: For example, the familiar {{lang|pl|Chcesz pić}} ("You want to drink") becomes {{lang|pl|Pan chce pić}} (literally "The gentleman wants to drink").

Further, {{lang|pl|pan}} and {{lang|pl|pani}} can be combined with the first name, the last name and with titles like "President", "Professor", "Doctor", "Editor" and others ({{lang|pl|Pan Prezydent}}, {{lang|pl|pani profesor}} etc.; using these titles is considered necessary); using both ({{lang|pl|Pan Prezydent Kowalski}}, {{lang|pl|pani profesor Nowak}}) is considered more polite or, in some context, even submissive. Addressing a present person with the last name is only usual in court or in other affairs, where government authority is involved, and generally considered impolite or condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poradnia.pwn.pl/lista.php?id=12364 |title=Szanowny Panie Kowalski! |website=Poradnia językowa PWN |accessdate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When addressing someone, all these forms always require the [[vocative]] case, which is otherwise optional (for example {{lang|pl|panie Kowalski}} ("Mr Kowalski!"), {{lang|pl|pani Joanno}} ("Mrs Joanna!"), {{lang|pl|panie profesorze}} ("Professor!")). For {{lang|pl|pan}}, {{lang|pl|pani}} etc. alone, {{lang|pl|proszę}} + [[genitive]] is used instead of vocative: {{lang|pl|proszę pana}}, {{lang|pl|proszę pani}}, {{lang|pl|proszę panów}}, {{lang|pl|proszę pań}} and {{lang|pl|proszę państwa}}.

A unique practice among both Poles and Western Ukrainians is addressing a lawyer as {{lang|pl|pan Mecenas}}, meaning "Mr. Philanthropist", derived from the name of an ancient Greek king known for his generosity.

The V-forms are capitalized only in actual letters (or e-mails), where the T-forms {{lang|pl|ty}} and {{lang|pl|wy}} are also capitalized.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Plural {{lang|pl|wy}} is also used as V-form in dialects, for example {{lang|pl|Matko, co wy jecie?}} ("Mother, what are you eating?").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Dialekty i gwary polskie|author1=S. Dubisz |author2=H. Karaś |author3=N. Kolis |isbn=83-214-0989-X|chapter=Pluralis maiestaticus|year=1995|location=Warszawa|publisher=Wiedza Powszechna|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its Russian usage, the plural V-form was also promoted in the Polish language [[Polish People's Republic|from 1945]], becoming associated with Communist ideology and addressing of a person by a government or Party official.

Besides, other forms can be sometimes used like {{lang|pl|pan}} in third person when talking to older family members ({{lang|pl|Niech mama powie}}, "May mother say"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poradnia.pwn.pl/lista.php?id=4114|title=Jak to w rodzinie…|website=Poradnia językowa PWN|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to clergy ({{lang|pl|Tak, dobrze ksiądz trafił}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piszmy.pl/agata-podniosla-sie-ze-swojego-fotela/Chapter.html|title=Agata podniosła się ze swojego fotela…|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Yes, priest got it right") or to other people in less formal or semi-formal situations, e.g. polite quarrel or dispute ({{lang|pl|Zatem – proszę kolegi – niech kolega się trochę douczy, a potem poucza innych}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.fm/justlikethat3/answer/110875416461 |title=ask.fm/Kuebonafide ---- :* ! |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140429191953/http://ask.fm/justlikethat3/answer/110875416461 |archivedate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Also, may my dear friend please learn more and only then instruct others").

[[File:Jozef Nahtigal tombstone in Dobrova Slovenia.jpg|thumb|220px|Tombstone of {{lang|sl|[[Jožef Nahtigal]]|italic=no}} in {{lang|sl|[[Dobrova, Dobrova – Polhov Gradec|Dobrova]]|italic=no}} with archaic Slovene {{lang|sl|onikanje}} in indirect reference. Literal translation "Here lie [{{lang|sl|počivajo}}] the honorable {{lang|sl|Jožef Nahtigal|italic=no}} … they were born [{{lang|sl|rojeni}}] … they died [{{lang|sl|umerli}}] … God grant them [{{lang|sl|jim}}] eternal peace and rest."]]
In [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], although informal address using the second person singular {{lang|sl|ti}} form (known as {{lang|sl|tikanje}}) is officially limited to friends and family, talk among children, and addressing animals, it is increasingly used instead of its polite or formal counterpart using the second person plural {{lang|sl|vi}} form (known as {{lang|sl|vikanje}}).

There is an additional nonstandard but widespread use of a singular participle combined with a plural auxiliary verb (known as {{lang|sl|polvikanje}}) that also reveals the gender of the person and is used in somewhat less formal situations:

* {{lang|sl|Vi ga niste videli.}} ('You did not see him': both the auxiliary verb {{lang|sl|niste}} and the participle {{lang|sl|videli}} are plural masculine.)
* {{lang|sl|Vi ga niste videl/videla.}} ('You did not see him': the auxiliary verb {{lang|sl|niste}} is plural but the participle {{lang|sl|videl/videla}} is singular masculine/feminine.)

The use of the third person plural {{lang|sl|oni}} form (known as {{lang|sl|onikanje}} in both direct address and indirect reference) as an ultra-polite form is now archaic or dialectal; it is associated with servant-master relationships in older literature, the child-parent relationship in certain conservative rural communities, and in general with relationships with people of highest respect (parents, clergy, royalty).

==== Czech ====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
{{See also|Czech verb}}
In [[Czech language|Czech]], there are three levels of formality. The most formal is using the second person plural verb forms (V form) with the surname or title of the addressed person, usual between strangers or people in a professional relationship. The second common form is made by using the second person singular verb forms (T form) together with the given name of the other person, used between friends and in certain social groups (students etc.). The third form, which is rather less common, is using the V form in combination with the given name. It may be used by a teacher when addressing a student (especially at the secondary school level), by a boss addressing their secretary, or in other relationships where a certain degree of familiarity has developed, but has not superseded some level of mutually acknowledged respect or distance. This form of address is usually asymmetrical (the perceived social superior uses V form in combination with the first name, the perceived social inferior using V form and the surname or honorific), less often symmetrical. Using the singular verb forms together with the surname or title is considered very rude. Where a stranger introduces themself with title (like {{lang|cs|inženýr Novák}}, {{lang|cs|doktor Svoboda}}), it is considered more polite to address them using the V form in combination with their title (always preceded by the honorific {{lang|cs|paní}}/{{lang|cs|pane}}, i.e. Mr/Ms), rather than their surname. However, it is considered poor manners to address somebody with their title in combination with the T form.

Traditionally, use of the informal form was limited for relatives, very close friends, and for children. During the second half of the 20th century, use of the informal form grew significantly among coworkers, youth and members of organisations and groups. The formal form is always used in official documents and when dealing with a stranger (especially an older one) as a sign of respect. 2nd-person pronouns ({{lang|cs|Ty}}, {{lang|cs|Tvůj}}, {{lang|cs|Vy}}, {{lang|cs|Váš}}) are often capitalized in letters, advertisement, etc. The capitalization is optional and is slowly becoming obsolete. A variant of the formal form modeled after German {{lang|de|Sie}} ({{lang|cs|Oni}}/{{lang|cs|oni}}, {{lang|cs|Jejich}}/{{lang|cs|jejich}}, verb {{lang|cs|onikat}}) was frequently used during the 19th century but has since disappeared. This form is also associated with Czech [[Jew]]ish community before [[Second World War]], and still appears very often in [[Jewish humour]] as sign of local colour. Sometimes it is used as [[irony]].

In the Internet age, where people communicate under nicknames or pseudonymes and almost solely in informal way, capitalizing ({{lang|cs|ty}}/{{lang|cs|Ty}}) is used to emphasise respect, or simply presence of respect. ({{lang|cs|Ty}} = friends, honored acquaintance, strangers {{lang|cs|ty}} = basic form, {{lang|cs|vy}}/{{lang|cs|Vy}} = most formal, used to create distance or express contempt, very rude if not sufficiently advocated, often used as insult itself). {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In grammar, plural forms are used in personal and possessive [[pronoun]]s ({{lang|cs|vy}} – you, {{lang|cs|váš}} – your) and in verbs, but not in [[participle]]s and [[adjective]]s, they are used in singular forms (when addressing a single person). This differs from some other [[Slavic languages]] ([[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Russian language|Russian]], etc.)

==== Lithuanian ====
In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], historically, aside from familiar {{lang|lt|tu}} and respectful {{lang|lt|jūs}} or {{lang|lt|Jūs}}, also used to express plural, there was a special form {{lang|lt|tamsta}}, mostly referred to in third person singular (although referring in second person singular is also not uncommon). This form was used to communicate with a stranger who has not earned particular respect (a beggar, for example). Modern Lithuanian Dictionary describes {{lang|lt|tamsta}} as a polite form of second singular person {{lang|lt|tu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dz.lki.lt/get/87718/ |title=Dabartinės lietuvių kalbos žodynas |work=lki.lt }}&lt;/ref&gt; making its meaning somewhere in the middle between informal {{lang|lt|tu}} and formal {{lang|lt|jūs}}. Through the Soviet occupation period, however, this form was mostly replaced by standard neutral form {{lang|lt|drauge}} (the [[vocative case]] for {{lang|lt|draugas}}, "[[comrade]]", the latter being the standard formal form of addressing in all languages of the [[Soviet Union]] used in all situations, from "comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]" to "comrade student"), and by now {{lang|lt|tamsta}} is used sparsely. A common way of addressing people whom one doesn't know well is also {{lang|lt|Ponas}} (m) and {{lang|lt|Ponia}} (f), from Polish forms of address {{wikt-lang|pl|pan}} and {{wikt-lang|pl|pani}}, respectively.

=== Indic ===
==== Hindi and Urdu ====
In the standard forms of both [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Standard Urdu|Urdu]] there are three levels of honorifics:
* '''{{lang|hi|आप}} {{lang|ur|آپ}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|āp}} {{IPA|[aːp]}}: The formal V-form used to address another person. Used with third-person verbs or separate honorific verb forms in all formal settings and when speaking to persons who are senior in age or social hierarchy. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" ({{lang|hi|आप लोग}} {{lang|ur|آپ لوگ}} {{lang|hi-Latn|āp log}}) or "you all" ({{lang|hi|आप सब}} {{lang|ur|آپ سب}} {{lang|hi-Latn|āp sab}}). It is sometimes combined with a second-person verb when speaking to persons lower in social hierarchy or, generally, to reduce distance while avoiding the informal flavour of {{lang|hi-Latn|tum}}.
* '''{{lang|hi|तुम}} {{lang|ur|تُم}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|tum}} {{IPA|[tʊm]}}: Originally, a plural pronoun ("you"), it is nowadays used as singular V-form in all informal settings and when speaking to persons who are junior in age or social hierarchy. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" ({{lang|hi|तुम लोग}} {{lang|ur|تُم لوگ}} {{lang|hi-Latn|tum log}}) or "you all" ({{lang|hi|तुम सब}} {{lang|ur|تُم سب}} {{lang|hi-Latn|tum sab}}).
* '''{{lang|hi|तू}} {{lang|ur|تُو}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|tū}} {{IPA|[tuː]}}: Originally, a singular pronoun ("thou"), it is nowadays used exclusively as a T-form, in extremely informal settings: to address own children, very close friends, or in poetic language (either with God or with lovers). When used to others (e.g., strangers), it is considered offensive both in Pakistan and India.

==== Bengali ====
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] has three levels of formality in its pronouns; the most neutral forms of address among closer members of a family are {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}} (plural). These two pronouns are also typically used when speaking to children, or to younger members of the extended family. {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} is also used when addressing God. When speaking with adults outside the family, or with senior members of the extended family, the pronouns {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} (plural) are used. This is also true in advertisements and public announcements. A third set of pronouns, {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} (plural), is reserved for use between very close friends, and by extension, between relatives who share a bond not unlike a close friendship. It is also used when addressing people presumed to be of "inferior" social status; this latter use is occasionally used when speaking to housemaids, [[rickshaw]]-pullers, and other service workers, although this use is considered offensive.

The situations in which these different pronouns can be used vary considerably depending on many social factors. In some families, children may address their parents with {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}}, although this is becoming increasingly rare. Some adults alternate between all three pronoun levels when speaking to children, normally choosing {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}}, but also often choosing {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} to indicate closeness, or {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} or {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} in a joking manner. Additionally, Bengalis vary in which pronoun they use when addressing servants in the home; some may use {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} to indicate respect for an adult outside the family, while others may use {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}} to indicate either inclusion into the family or to indicate somewhat less honorable status. Others may even use {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} to indicate inferior status.

=== Finno-Ugric ===

==== Finnish ====
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], today the use of the informal singular form of address ({{lang|fi|sinä}}) is widespread in all social circles, even among strangers and in business situations. The use of formal address has not disappeared however, and persists in situations involving customer service (especially if the customer is clearly older than the person serving them) and in general in addressing the elderly or in situations where strict adherence to form is expected, such as in the military. An increase in the use of formal address has been reported in recent years, whereby some people are choosing to use the formal form more often.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. As the use of the form conveys formal recognition of the addressee's status and, more correctly, of polite social distance, the formal form might also occasionally be used jeeringly or to protest the addressee's snobbery. A native speaker may also switch to formal form when speaking in anger, as an attempt to remain civil. Advertisements, instructions and other formal messages are mostly in informal singular form ({{lang|fi|sinä}} and its conjugations), but the use of formal forms has increased in recent years. For example, as the tax authorities tend to become more informal, in contrast the social security system is reverting to using the formal form.

The same forms, such as the pronoun {{lang|fi|te}}, are used for formal singular and for both formal and informal plural.

In Finnish the number is expressed in pronouns ({{lang|fi|sinä}} for second person singular, or {{lang|fi|te}} for second person plural), verb inflections, and [[possessive suffix]]es. Almost all of these elements follow the grammar of the second person plural also in the formal singular form. For example, polite {{lang|fi|Voisitteko (te) siirtää autonne}} vs. informal {{lang|fi|Voisitko (sinä) siirtää autosi}}, "Could you move your car, (please)?". Each of the person markers are modified: {{lang|fi|-t-}} to {{lang|fi|-tte-}} (verb person), {{lang|fi|sinä}} to {{lang|fi|te}} (pronoun), {{lang|fi|-si}} to {{lang|fi|-nne}} (possessive suffix).

As a few examples of this could be mentioned the way [[imperative mood|imperatives]] are expressed: {{lang|fi|Menkää!}} "Go!" (plural), vs. {{lang|fi|Mene!}} "Go!" (singular), and the usage of the plural suffix {{lang|fi|-nne}} "your" instead of the singular {{lang|fi|-si}} "your".

There is number agreement in Finnish, thus you say {{lang|fi|sinä olet}} "you are" (singular), but {{lang|fi|te olette}} "you are" (plural). However, this does not extend to words describing the addressee, which are in the singular, e.g. {{lang|fi|oletteko te lääkäri?}} "are you doctor?" (plural, plural, singular)

A common error, nowadays often made even by native speakers unused to the formal forms, is to use the plural form of the main verb in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[pluperfect]] constructions. The main verb should be in the singular when addressing one person in the formal plural: {{lang|fi|Oletteko kuullut?}} instead of {{lang|fi|*Oletteko kuulleet?}} "Have you heard?"

Sometimes the third person is used as a polite form of address, after the [[T–V distinction#Swedish|Swedish model]]: {{lang|fi|Mitä rouvalle saisi olla?}} "What would madam like to have?" This is far less common in the Eastern parts of Finland, influenced less by the Swedish language and all in all a declining habit. The [[passive voice]] may be used to circumvent the choice of the correct form of address. In another meaning, the passive voice is also the equivalent of the English patronizing ''we'' as in {{lang|fi|Kuinkas tänään voidaan?}} "How are we feeling today?"

Finnish language includes the verbs for calling one with informal singular or formal plural: {{lang|fi|sinutella}}, {{lang|fi|teititellä}}, respectively.

In the Bible and in the [[Kalevala]], only the "informal" singular is used in all cases.

==== Estonian ====
[[Estonian language|Estonian]] is a language with T–V distinction, second person plural ({{lang|et|teie}}) is used instead of second person singular ({{lang|et|sina}}) as a means of expressing politeness or formal speech. {{lang|et|Sina}} is the familiar form of address used with family, friends, and minors. The distinction is still much more widely used and more rigid than in closely related Finnish language.

Similar to the French language {{lang|fr|vouvoyer}}, the verb {{lang|et|teietama}} is used, and {{lang|et|teie}} is used when addressing a (new) customer or a patient, or when talking to a person in his/her function. In [[hierarchical organization]]s, like large businesses or armies, {{lang|et|sina}} is used between members of a same rank/level while {{lang|et|teie}} is used between members of different ranks. {{lang|et|Sina}} (the verb {{lang|et|sinatama}} is also used) is used with relatives, friends, when addressing children and with close colleagues. Borderline situations, such as distant relatives, young adults, customers in rental shops or new colleagues, sometimes still present difficulties.

==== Hungarian ====
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] provides numerous, often subtle means of T–V distinction:

The use of the second-person conjugation with the pronoun {{lang|hu|te}} (plural {{lang|hu|ti}}) is the most informal mode. As in many other European languages, it is used within families, among children, lovers, close friends, (nowadays often) among coworkers, and in some communities, suggesting an idea of brotherhood. Adults unilaterally address children this way, and it is the form used in addressing God and other Christian figures (such as Jesus Christ or the Blessed Virgin), animals, and objects or ideas. Sociologically, the use of this form is widening. Whereas traditionally the switch to {{lang|hu|te}} is often a symbolic milestone between people, sometimes sealed by drinking a glass of wine together ({{lang|hu|pertu}}), today people under the age of about thirty will often mutually adopt {{lang|hu|te}} automatically in informal situations. A notable example is the Internet: strangers meeting online use the informal forms of address virtually exclusively, regardless of age or status differences. &lt;!-- even [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] as a Prime Minister in office encouraged&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721110805/http://kapcsolat.hu/blog/februar_2-a_van._klaranak_a_felesegemnek_ma_van_a_szuletesnapja. Február 2-a van. Klárának, a feleségemnek ma van a születésnapja. (2006.02.02. 18:40)]. "Hadd kezdjem talán azzal, hogy számomra eléggé természetes, hogy tegeződünk, szerintem ennek semmi köze a miniszterelnök tekintélyéhez. Ne feszélyezzen benneteket, mert ha bárki is úgy érzi, akkor előbb-utóbb engem is feszélyezni fog, hogy én tegeződöm." ("Let me begin with mentioning that it's quite natural for me to use the informal way of addressing; I don't think it has anything to do with the Prime Minister's prestige. Don't let yourselves be embarrassed, because if anyone feels like that then sooner or later I'll also be embarrassed to do so.")&lt;/ref&gt; people in his [[blog]] to use ''te'' mutually when asking him. [[IKEA]] (or rather, its Hungarian team) was noted and practically unique in its choice of this way of addressing people in Hungary in its brochures; reactions were mixed. --&gt;

Nevertheless, formal forms of address are alive and well in Hungarian:
* The third-person verb conjugation is the primary basis of formal address. The choice of which ''pronoun'' to use, however, is fraught with difficulty (and indeed a common solution when in doubt is to simply avoid using any pronoun at all, using the addressee's name or title instead). &lt;!-- this is not restricted to the nominative. Consider things you might say to someone who just arrived in your city: ''Isten hozta'' [önt]; ''Milyen volt az útja?'' [önnek]; ''Remélem, tetszik a városunk'' [önnek]; (a taxiban) ''Hova vihetem?'' [önt]; etc.etc.etc. … --&gt;
** The pronoun {{lang|hu|maga}} (plural {{lang|hu|maguk}}), for instance, is considered the basic formal equivalent of "you", but may not be used indiscriminately, as it tends to imply an existing or desired personal acquaintance. (It would not, for instance, ordinarily be used in a conversation where the relative social roles are predominantly important – say, between professor and student.) Typical situations where {{lang|hu|maga}} might be used are, e.g., distant relatives, neighbours, fellow travellers on the train, or at the hairdresser's. If one already knows these people, they may even take offence if one were to address them more formally. On the other hand, some urbanites tend to avoid {{lang|hu|maga}}, finding it too rural, old-fashioned, offensive or even intimate. – Note that {{lang|hu|maga}} coincides with the [[reflexive pronoun]] (cf. him/herself), so e.g. the sentence {{lang|hu|Megütötte magát?}} can have three meanings: "Did he hit himself?", "Did he hit you?" or "Did you hit yourself?".
** {{lang|hu|Ön}} (plural {{lang|hu|önök}}) is the formal, official and impersonal "you". It is the form used when people take part in a situation merely as representatives of [[role|social roles]], where personal acquaintance is not a factor. It is thus used in institutions, business, bureaucracy, advertisements, by broadcasters, by shopkeepers to their customers, and whenever one wishes to maintain one's distance. It is less typical of rural areas or small towns, more typical of cities. It's often capitalized in letters.
** Other pronouns are nowadays rare, restricted to rural, jocular, dialect, or old-fashioned speech. Such are, for instance, {{lang|hu|kend}} and {{lang|hu|kegyed}}.
** There is a wide spectrum of third-person address that avoids the above pronouns entirely; preferring to substitute various combinations of the addressee's names and/or titles. Thus, for instance, a university student might ask {{lang|hu|mit gondol X. tanár úr?}} ("What does Professor X. think?", meant for the addressee) rather than using the insufficiently formal {{lang|hu|maga}} or the overly impersonal {{lang|hu|ön}}. If the difference in rank is not to be emphasized, it is perfectly acceptable to use the addressed person's first name instead of a second-person pronoun, e.g. {{lang|hu|Megkérném arra Pétert, hogy...}} ("I'd like to ask [you,] Peter to…"). (Note that these are possible because the formal second-person conjugation of verbs is the same as the third-person conjugation.)
* Finally, the [[auxiliary verb]] {{lang|hu|tetszik}} (lit. "it pleases [you]") is an indirect alternative (or, perhaps, supplement) to direct address with the third or even second person. In terms of grammar, it can only be applied if the addressed person is mentioned in the [[nominative]], otherwise it is replaced by forms with the name or {{lang|hu|maga}}. It is very polite (sometimes seen as over-polite) and not as formal as the {{lang|hu|Ön}} form. Children usually address adults outside their family this way. Adults may address more distant relatives, [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeepers]] and older persons using this form, and some men habitually address older or younger women this way (this is slightly old-fashioned).
&lt;!-- Please make it possible for the reader to comprehend the content and its key points by not making it longer than it already is --&gt;

It is important to keep in mind that formal conjugation doesn't automatically imply politeness or vice versa; these factors are independent of each other. For example, {{lang|hu|Mit parancsolsz?}} "What would you like to have?" (literally, "What do you command?") is in the informal conjugation, while it can be extremely polite, making it possible to express one's honour towards people one has previously established a friendly relationship with. On the other hand, {{lang|hu|Mit akar?}} "What do you want?" is expressed with the formal conjugation, nevertheless it may sound rude and aggressive; the formal conjugation does not soften this tone in any way.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{lang|hu|tanár úr}} is a form of addressing for professors (cf. "Sir"); {{lang|hu|tanár urat}} is the accusative. Other forms of addressing are also possible, to avoid specifying the {{lang|hu|maga}} and {{lang|hu|ön}} pronouns.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{lang|hu|Mari nénit}} is an example name in the accusative (cf. "Aunt Mary").

=== Turkic ===
==== Turkish ====
In modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the T–V distinction is strong. Family members and friends speak to one another using the second-person singular {{lang|tr|sen}}, and adults use {{lang|tr|sen}} to address minors. In formal situations (business, customer–clerk, and colleague relationships, or meeting people for the first time) the plural second-person {{lang|tr|siz}} is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, the double plural second-person {{lang|tr|sizler}} may be used to address a much-respected person. Rarely, the third-person plural form of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. Additionally, if there are two or more person {{lang|tr|siz}} or {{lang|tr|sizler}} could be used. For example, {{lang|tr|Siz seçildiniz}} or {{lang|tr|Sizler seçildiniz}} have same meaning that "You have been chosen". However, {{lang|tr|Siz seçildiniz}} are not certain whether plural or singular. It changes; formal speaking {{lang|tr|siz}} specifies one person or more but informal speaking it specifies only two or more person. In the imperative, there are four forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and second person double plural for very formal situations: {{lang|tr|gel}} (second person singular, informal), {{lang|tr|gelin}} (second person plural, formal), and {{lang|tr|geliniz}} (double second person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used in spoken Turkish, but is pretty common in written directives, such as manuals and warning signs.

==== Uyghur ====
[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] is notable for using four different forms, to distinguish both singular and plural in both formal and informal registers. The informal plural {{lang|ug-Latn|silär}} originated as a contraction of {{lang|ug-Latn|sizlär}}, which uses a regular plural ending. In [[Old Turkic]], as still in modern Turkish, {{lang|otk|𐰾𐰃𐰕}} ({{lang|otk-Latn|siz}}) was the original second-person plural. However, in modern Uyghur {{lang|ug|سئز}} ({{lang|ug-Latn|siz}}) has become restricted to the formal singular, requiring the plural suffix {{lang|ug-Latn|-lär}} for the plurals.

{{lang|ug-Latn|Siz}} as the formal singular pronoun is characteristic of the [[Ürümqi]] dialect, which is the Uyghur literary standard. In [[Turpan]] they say {{lang|ug|سئلئ}} ({{lang|ug-Latn|sili}}) and in [[Kashgar]] dialect, {{lang|ug-Latn|özlär}}. {{lang|ug-Latn|Sili}} is also used in other areas sometimes, while in literary Uyghur {{lang|ug-Latn|özlär}} as a singular pronoun is considered a "hyperdeferential" level of respect; the deferential plural form is {{lang|ug-Latn|härqaysiliri}}.

=== Northwest Caucasian ===

==== Ubykh ====
In the extinct [[Ubykh language]], the T–V distinction was most notable between a man and his mother-in-law, where the plural form {{lang|uby|sʸæghʷa}} supplanted the singular {{lang|uby|wæghʷa}} very frequently, possibly under the influence of [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The distinction was upheld less frequently in other relationships, but did still occur.

=== Semitic ===

==== Arabic ====
[[Modern Standard Arabic]] uses the [[majestic plural]] form of the [[grammatical person|second person]] ({{lang|ar|أنتم}} {{lang|ar-Latn|antum}}) in respectful address.{{cn|date=February 2017}} It is restricted to highly formal contexts, generally relating to politics and government. However, several [[varieties of Arabic]] have a clearer T–V distinction. The most developed is in [[Egyptian Arabic]], which uses {{lang|arz|حضرتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|ḥaḍritak}} (literally, "Your [[Grace (style)|Grace]]"), {{lang|arz|سعادتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|sa‘adtak}} and {{lang|arz|سيادتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|siyadtak}} (literally, "Your Lordship") as the "V" terms, depending on context, while {{lang|arz|أنت}} {{lang|arz-Latn|inta}} is the "T" term. {{lang|arz-Latn|Ḥaḍritak}} is the most usual "V" term, with {{lang|arz-Latn|sa‘adtak}} and {{lang|arz-Latn|siyadtak}} being reserved for situations where the addressee is of very high social standing (e.g. a high-ranking government official or a powerful businessman). Finally, the "V" term is used only with social superiors (including elders); unfamiliar people perceived to be of similar or lower social standing to the speaker are addressed with the ''T'' term {{lang|arz-Latn|inta}}.

==== Hebrew ====
In modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], there is a T–V distinction used in a set of very formal occasions, for example, a lawyer addressing a judge, or when speaking to rabbis. The second person singular {{lang|he|אַתָּה}} ({{lang|he-Latn|ʔaˈta}}, masculine) or {{lang|he|אַתְּ}} ({{lang|he-Latn|ʔat}}, feminine) are the usual form of address in all other situations, e.g. when addressing ministers or members of the [[Knesset]].

The formal form of address when speaking to a person of higher authority is the third person singular using the person's title without the use of the pronoun. Thus, a rabbi could be asked: {{lang|he|?כְּבוֹד הָרַב יִרְצֶה לֶאֱכֹל}} ({{lang|he-Latn|kəˈvod haˈʁav yiʁˈtse leʔeˈχol'}}, "would the honorable rabbi like to eat?") or a judge told: {{lang|he|כְּבוֹדוֹ דָּן בְּבַקָּשָׁתִי}} ({{lang|he-Latn|kəvoˈdo dan bəvakaʃaˈti}}, "his honour is considering my request").

Other persons of authority are normally addressed by their title only, rather than by name, using the second person singular. For example, officers and commanders in the army are addressed as {{lang|he|הַמְּפַקֵּד}} ({{lang|he-Latn|haməfaˈked}}, "the commander") by troops.

In non-Hebrew-speaking Jewish culture, the second-person form of address is similarly avoided in cases of higher authority (e.g., a student in a [[yeshiva]] would be far more likely to say in a classroom discussion "yesterday the Rav told us..." than "yesterday you told us..."). However, this usage is limited to more conservative (i.e. Orthodox) circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|he|אורי אורבך, סבא שלי היה רב, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dravidian===

==== Tamil ====
In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the second-person singular pronoun நீ {{IPA|[niː]}} and its derived forms are used to address children, (younger or very close) members of the family and to people who are younger than the speaker. The second person plural pronoun நீங்கள் {{IPA|[niːŋgʌɭ]}} is used to address elders (also within the extended family), teachers, people who are older than the speaker and anyone whom the speaker does not personally know, especially in formal situations.

=== Sino-Tibetan ===

==== Chinese ====
{{anchor|Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin|Shanghainese|Cantonese|Minnan}}
{{See also|Chinese honorifics|Chinese naming taboo}}
[[Chinese culture]] has taken [[Chinese names|naming]] and [[Chinese honorifics|forms of address]] very seriously, strictly regulating which people were permitted to use which terms in conversation or in writing. The extreme example is the 1777 execution of [[Wang Xihou]] and [[nine exterminations|his entire family]] and the confiscation of their entire estate as his penalty for writing the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s personal name as part of a criticism of the [[Kangxi Dictionary]]. Many honorifics and niceties of address fell by the wayside during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the late 1960s amid [[Mao Zedong]]'s campaign against the "[[Four Olds]]". This included an attempt to eradicate expressions of deference to teachers and to others seen as preserving "counter-revolutionary" modes of thought. The defeat of the Maoist [[Gang of Four]] in the late 1970s and continuing [[Chinese economic reform|reforms]] since the 1980s has, however, permitted a return of such traditional and regional expressions.

Historically, the T–V distinction was observed among the Chinese by avoiding ''any'' use of common pronouns in addressing a respected audience. Instead, third-person [[Chinese honorifics#Addressing or referring to others|honorifics]] and respectful titles were employed. One aspect of such respectful address was avoiding the use of the ''first''-person pronoun as well, instead choosing a (typically humble) [[Chinese honorifics#Referring to oneself|epithet]] in its place. The extreme of this practice occurred when [[Shi Huangdi]] abrogated the then-current first-person pronoun {{lang|zh|朕}} (''zhèn''); the present first-person pronoun {{lang|zh|我}} (''wǒ'') subsequently developed out of the habit of referring to "this [worthless] body", the character's original meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Zdic.net. {{lang|zh|《漢典》}} [''Chinese Dictionary'']. "[http://www.zdic.net/z/1a/js/6211.htm　{{lang|zh|我}}]". Accessed 21 August 2013. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important difference between the T–V distinction in Chinese compared with modern European languages is that Chinese culture considers the relative age of the speakers an important aspect of their [[social distance]]. This is especially strong within families: while the speakers of European languages may generally prefer forms of address such as "father" or "grandpa", Chinese speakers consider using the personal names of elders such a [[Chinese naming taboo|taboo]] that they may not even ''know'' the given names of grandparents who live in the same apartment. While strictures against writing the personal name of any ancestor of the last seven generations are no longer observed, it remains very uncommon to [[Chinese names|name children]] for any living relative: younger people using the name freely would disrespect the original bearer.

In the present day, the informal second-person pronoun is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你}}}} ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]: ''nǐ''; [[Minnan language|Minnan]]: ''lí'') and the honorific pronoun is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|您}}}} (Mandarin: ''nín''; Minnan: ''lín''). Much like European languages, the honorific form developed out of an earlier second-person plural: during the [[Jurchen Dynasty|Jin]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], the Mandarin dialects mutated {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你每}}}} (''nǐměi'') into {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你們}}}} (''nǐmen'') and then into {{lang|zh|您}}.&lt;ref&gt;Although modern Chinese now distinguishes between {{lang|zh|你们}} ("you" [plural]) and {{lang|zh|您}} ("you" [cherished, respectful]), the legacy of {{lang|zh|您}}'s origin is still retained in the rarity of observing the form {{lang|zh|{{linktext|您们}}}} in Mandarin Chinese. Native speakers employ indirect phrasing like "everybody"　({{lang|zh|{{linktext|大家}}}}, ''dàjiā'', lit. "big family") or "ladies and gentlemen" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|各位}}}}, ''gèwèi'', lit. "every seat") and {{lang|zh|您们}} only infrequently appears in [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] and among foreign students of the language.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A similar form {{ndash}} {{lang|zh|{{linktext|怹}}}}, ''tān'' {{ndash}} developed for the third-person singular but is now generally unused.) It is worth noting that the T–V distinction in Mandarin does ''not'' connote a distance or lack of intimacy between the speakers (as implied, e.g., in the French ''vous''). On the contrary, it is often noted that the respectful form contains the [[Chinese radical|radical]] for "heart" ({{lang|zh|心}}, ''xīn''); although this is actually for [[Chinese character#Rebus|phonetic reasons]], the implication is that the addressee is loved and cherished by the speaker.

Most [[Northern and southern China|southern dialects]], however, do not make this distinction in speech at all. [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] and [[Shanghainese language|Shanghainese]] speakers learn to ''[[written Chinese|write]]'' both forms in school but pronounce them identically: the Cantonese as ''nei''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and the Shanghainese as ''nóng''. Formality is still respected, but their languages {{ndash}} like [[#Japanese|Japanese]] and [[#Vietnamese|Vietnamese]] {{ndash}} retain the earlier Chinese tradition of employing epithets or honorifics instead of using any pronouns at all when showing formal respect.

=== Japonic ===

==== Japanese ====
{{Main|Japanese pronouns}}
{{See also|Japanese honorifics|Honorific speech in Japanese}}
Under heavy [[#Chinese|Chinese]] influence, traditional [[Japanese culture]] eschewed the use of common pronouns in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular {{lang|ja|朕}} ({{lang|ja|ちん}}, ''chin'') was arrogated to the personal use of the [[emperor of Japan|emperor]]. The formality of Japanese culture was such that its [[Japanese pronouns#Archaic personal pronouns|original pronouns]] have largely ceased to be used at all. Some linguists therefore argue that [[Japanese language|Japanese]] lacks ''any'' pronouns whatsoever, but {{ndash}} although it is a larger and more complex group of words than most languages employ {{ndash}} [[Japanese pronouns]] do exist, having developed out of the most common epithets used to express different relationships and relative degrees of social status. As in [[#Korean|Korean]], polite language encompasses not only these specific pronouns but also suffixes and vocabulary as well.

Most commonly, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|君}}}} ({{lang|ja|きみ}}, ''kimi'', &lt;small&gt;orig.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"prince", "lord") is used informally as the second-person singular and {{lang|ja|{{linktext|貴方}}}} ({{lang|ja|あなた}}, ''anata'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "dear one") is the most common polite equivalent, but is also commonly used by women towards an intimate as a term of endearment.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The pronoun {{lang|ja|{{linktext|貴様}}}} ({{lang|ja|きさま}}, ''kisama'') is illustrative of the complexity that can be involved, though, in that its literal meaning is quite flattering {{ndash}} &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "dear and honorable sir" {{ndash}} but its ironic use has made it a strong insult in modern Japanese. Similarly, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|御前}}}} ({{lang|ja|おまえ}}, ''omae'') {{ndash}} &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "(one who is) before (me)" {{ndash}} was traditionally a respectful pronoun used toward aristocrats and religious figureheads, but today is considered very informal and impolite, yet also commonly used by husbands towards their wives in an endearing manner.

=== Austro-Asiatic ===

==== Vietnamese ====
{{Main|Vietnamese pronouns}}
Under heavy [[#Chinese|Chinese]] influence, [[Vietnamese culture]] has eschewed the use of [[Vietnamese pronouns#true pronouns|common pronouns]] in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular {{lang|zh|朕}} (Vietnamese:&amp;nbsp;''trẫm'') was arrogated to the personal use of the [[emperor of Vietnam|emperor]].

In modern Vietnamese, only the first-person singular ''tôi'' is in common use as a respectful pronoun; any other pronoun should be replaced with the subject's name or with an appropriate epithet, title, or relationship in polite formal speech. Similar to modern Chinese (but to a much greater extent), modern Vietnamese also frequently replaces ''informal'' pronouns with [[Vietnamese pronouns#Kinship terms|kinship terms]] in many situations. The somewhat insulting second-person singular ''mày'' is also frequently used in informal situations among young Vietnamese.

=== Tai–Kadai languages ===

==== Thai ====
In [[Thai language|Thai]], first, second, and third person pronouns vary in formality according to the social standing of the speaker and the referent and the relationship between them. For a non-exhaustive list of Thai second person pronouns, see http://www.into-asia.com/thai_language/grammar/you.php.

=== Austronesian ===

==== Indonesian ====
In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the T–V distinction is extremely important; addressing a stranger with the pronoun ''kau'' or ''kamu'' (you) is considered rude and impolite (unless the stranger is, for example, a child). When addressing a stranger or someone older, typically ''Bu'' ('ma'am') or ''Pak'' ('sir') is used. People also use ''mas'' (Javanese for 'older brother') or ''mbak'' (Javanese for 'older sister') when addressing someone that is not old enough to be called ''Bu'' or ''Pak''. There are variations in different areas. If the situation is more formal, such as in meetings or news broadcasting, ''Anda'' is always used, even if those addressed would otherwise be addressed by ''kau'' or ''kamu'' in informal situations. A more informal pronoun, written ''lu'', ''lo'', or sometimes as ''loe'' (originated from Hokkien language) is considered very impolite. This is normally used by teenagers (particularly in urban centers) to their peers. Adults can sometimes be heard using this pronoun with their close friends or when they are angry.

# ''Lu siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in very informal situations without the presence of someone who has higher status.
# ''Kamu siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in either informal or formal situations without the presence of someone who has higher status.
# ''Anda siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in formal situations, between business partners, or with someone who has higher status.
# ''Apakah Anda siap?'' (Are you ready?): This form is used between friends in very formal situations, among strangers, or toward someone who has higher status. Note that ''Apakah'' is an optional question word that is used in close-ended questions (similar to the use of 'to be' and other auxiliary verbs to form close-ended questions in English). This is a form of ''Bahasa Baku''.

Similarly, ''kalian'' dan ''Anda''/''Anda sekalian'' are used.

==== Tagalog ====
In [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], the familiar second person is ''ikáw/ka'' (in the nominative case). This is replaced by ''kayó'' (which is actually the second person plural) when the situation calls for a more polite tone. The pronoun ''kayó'' is accompanied by the particle ''pô''. This form is generally used to show respect to close, older relatives. This is also the form expected when talking with the peers of parents or grandparents.

Traditionally, when a higher degree of formality is required, the third person plural (''silá'') is used instead. It is used when addressing people of higher social rank, such as government officials and senior clergymen. It may also be used when speaking to complete strangers as a matter of courtesy, such as when answering the door or an unknown caller.

# Sino ka? (Who are you?) [Used to ask for the identity of a peer or one of equal social rank, such as a student to a fellow student. Depending on intonation, this question may sound impolite.]
# Sino pô kayó? (Who are you?) [This form implies that the speaker believes the person addressed is a relative or an individual of a higher rank, and is thus used to confirm the relationship.]
# Sino pô silá? (Who are you, Sir/Ma'am?) [Though ''''pô'''' does not really translate as ''''Sir'''' or ''''Ma'am'''', this form implies that the person being addressed is a complete stranger and the speaker has no idea who they are.]

Younger Filipinos tend to mix these forms of address, resulting in questions such as ''Sino ka pô ba?'' in an attempt to sound polite towards a total stranger. This and other nonstandard variants are very widespread, especially in the [[Metro Manila|Manila]] dialect of Tagalog and its [[Greater Manila Area|surrounding suburbs]].

=== Other languages ===

==== Basque ====
{{See also|Basque grammar#Personal pronouns|l1=Basque grammar: Personal pronouns}}
[[Basque language|Basque]] has two levels of formality in every dialect, which are '''hi''' and '''zu'''; Nevertheless, in some areas of Gipuzkoa and Biscay, the respectful form '''berori''' is still used by some speakers, just as the familiar '''xu''' in some areas of the Eastern Low Navarrese dialect, when addressing children and close friends. Most speakers only use the ''zu'' form (''zuka'' level) and that is the usual one used in methods, slogans... although the ''hi'' form (''hika'') is very common in villages.

The neutral or formal one is ''zu'', which originally used to be the plural form of the second person. The informal one is ''hi'', whose use is limited to some specific situations: among close friends, to children (children never use it when addressing their parents, neither the spouses among them), when talking to a younger person, to animals (cattle, pets...), in monologues, and when speaking angrily to somebody. Their common plural form is ''zuek'', whenever the speaker is talking to a group of listeners who would all be individually addressed with the form ''zu'', or the form ''hi'', or both (a conversation where some listeners are addressed as ''zu'' —i.e., somebody's parents, for instance— and others as ''hi'' —the speaker's siblings—).

Unlike ''zu'', ''hi'' sometimes makes a distinction whether the addressed one is a male or a female. For example: ''duk'' (thou, male, hast) and ''dun'' (thou, female, hast). The use of the '''hika''' level requires the allocutive agreement (''hitano'' or ''zeharkako hika'', i.e., indirect ''hika'') in non-subordinate sentences to mark this distinction for the first and third person verbs. Those allocutive forms are found in the Indicative and Conditional moods, but never in the Subjunctive and Imperative moods, with the one exception of ''goazemak'' (let's go, said to a male) and ''goazeman'' (said to a female) in Western dialects, opposed to ''goazen'', the neutral form. For example:

* ''du'' (neutral, s/he has, neutral form), ''dik'' (s/he has, male thou) and ''din'' (s/he has, female thou), as in ''aitak ikasi du'' (polite: Dad has learned it), ''aitak ikasi dik'' (informal, said to a male), and ''aitak ikasi din'' (informal, said to a female).
* ''dio'' (neutral, s/he has it for him / her), ''ziok'' (familiar, s/he has it for him / her, said to a male), and ''zion'' (familiar, s/he has it for him / her, said to a female), as in ''aitak erosi dio'' (polite: Dad has bought it for him / her), ''aitak erosi ziok'' (informal, said to a male), and ''aitak erosi zion'' (informal, said to a female).
* ''nintzen'' (neutral, I was), ''ninduan'' (familiar, said to a male), and ''nindunan'' (familiar, said to a female), as in ''hona etorri nintzen'' (polite: I came here), ''hona etorri ninduan'' (informal, said to a male), and ''hona etorri nindunan'' (informal, said to a female).

Nevertheless, if any of the allocutive sentences becomes subordinate, the formal one is used: ''aitak ikasi duelako'' (because Dad has learned it), ''aitak erosi diolako'' (because Dad bought it for him / her), and ''hona etorri nintzenean'' (when I came here).

On the other hand, in past tense verbal forms, no distinction is made when the addressee is the subject or the direct object in the sentence. For example:

* ''hintzen'', in ''etxera joan hintzen'' (thou wentst home),
* ''huen'', in ''filma ikusi huen'' (thou sawst the film),
* ''hindugun'', in ''ikusi hindugun'' (we saw thee).

But if the familiar second-person appears in the verb, or if the verb is an allocutive form in a non-dependent clause, the masculine and feminine forms differ. For example:

* ''genian / geninan'' (we had something for thee, male / female): ''hiri eman genian, Piarres'' (we gave it to thee, Peter), and ''hiri eman geninan, Maddi'' (we gave it to thee, Mary).
* ''geniean / genienan'' (male allocutive / female allocutive, we had something for them): ''haiei eman geniean, Piarres'' (we gave it to them, Peter), and ''haiei eman genienan, Maddi'' (we gave it to them, Mary). Their corresponding neutral form is ''haiei eman genien''.
* ''banekian erantzuna'' (I knew the answer, said to a male), and ''banekinan erantzuna'' (I knew the answer, said to a female). Their corresponding neutral form is ''banekien erantzuna''.

The friendly ''xu'' form or '''xuketa''' resembles the ''zuka'' forms of the verbs, and includes another kind of allocutive, as ''hika'': cf. ''egia erran dut'' (formal: I told the truth), ''egia erran diat'' (informal, said to a male), ''egia erran dinat'' (informal, said to a female), ''egia erran dautzut'' (in formal Eastern Low Navarrese, I told ''you'' the truth) and ''egia erran dixut'' (''xuketa''). It is mainly used among relatives and close friends.

The ''berori'' form or '''berorika''' is very formal, and hardly used nowadays, mainly in some areas of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, to address priests, the elderly, judges and the nobility. Verbs are inflected in their singular third form, like in Italian (''(Lei) è molto gentile'', opposed to ''(tu) sei molto gentile'', you are very nice / thou art very nice) or the Spanish ''(usted) es muy amable'', opposed to ''(tú) eres muy amable'':

* neutral: ''zuk badakizu hori'' (you know it, formal), and ''zu, eser zaitez hemen'' (you, sit here),
* familiar: ''hik badakik hori'' (thou knowest that, said to a male), ''hik badakin hori'' (to a female), and ''hi, eser hadi hemen'' (sit here, for both genres),
* very formal: ''berorrek badaki hori'' (you know that: cf. ''hark badaki hori'', s/he knows that, neutral), and ''berori, eser bedi hemen'' (you, sit down here: cf ''hura, eser bedi hemen'', let him sit down here).

Unlike the ''hika'' level, ''berorika'' has no allocutive forms.

The extinct dialect of Erronkari or Roncal, spoken in the easternmost area of Navarre, presented a four-levelled system:

* neutral or ''zuketza'', the local equivalent of ''zuka'': ''etxeara xuan zra'' (you went home, you have gone home), ''etxeara xuan naz'' (I went home, I have gone home),
* informal or ''yiketza'', which corresponds to ''hika'': ''etxeara xuan yaz'', (thou wentst home, thou hast gone home), ''etxeara xuan nuk'' / ''etxeara xuan nun'' (I went home, I have been home, said to a male / to a female),
* familiar or ''tzuketza'', like the Eastern Navarrese ''xuka'': ''etxeara xuan nuzu'' (I went home, I have been home),
* and ''orika'', ''duka'' or ''duketza'', the local form of ''berorika'': ''ori etxeara xin da'' (you went home, you have been home).

=== Constructed languages ===

==== Esperanto ====
[[Esperanto]] is a T–V-distinguishing language, but usually ''vi'' is used for both singular and plural, just like ''you'' in modern English. An informal second person singular pronoun, ''ci'', indeed exists, but it is rarely used in practice. It is mainly intended to make the familiar/respectful distinction when translating (literature, for example) from languages that do have the T–V distinction.

Some have imagined ''ci'' as an archaic term that was used before and then fell out of common usage; however, this is not true. It has appeared only sometimes in experimental language. In standard Esperanto, ''vi'' has always been used since the beginning. For example, ''ci'' appears in neither the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto|Fundamenta Gramatiko]]'' nor the ''[[Unua Libro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dua persono |publisher= Bertilo |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/pronomoj/dua.html |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ''ci'' in practical language, mainly as the familiar and intimate singular, reserving ''vi'' for the plural and formal singular. Others use ''ci'' as singular and ''vi'' as plural regardless of formality.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==== Ido ====
In [[Ido (language)|Ido]], in theory ''tu'' is limited to friends and family, whereas ''vu'' is used anywhere else. However, many users actually adapt the practice in their own mother tongue and use ''tu'' and ''vu'' accordingly. In the plural, though, the only form in use is ''vi'', which does not distinguish between formal and informal address.

In all cases, an -n is added to the original pronoun to indicate a direct object that precedes its own verb: ''Me amoras tu'' (I love you) becomes ''Tun me amoras'' if the direct object takes the first place, for example for emphatic purposes.

==== Tolkien's High Elvish ====
In [[Quenya|High Elvish]], self-named '''Quenya''', there is a distinction between singular informal ''tyë'' and singular formal ''lyë''. The plural of both forms is ''lë''. The formal form is expected between all but family members and close friends. The appendices to ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' state that [[Westron]] followed a similar pattern, although the dialect of Shire had largely lost the formal form.

== Related verbs, nouns and pronouns ==
Some languages have a verb to describe the fact of using either a ''T'' or a ''V'' form. Some also have a related noun or pronoun. The English words are used to refer only to English usage in the past, not to usage in other languages. The analogous distinction may be expressed as "to use first names" or "to be on familiar terms (with someone)".

In [[mathematics]], an '''uncountable set''' (or '''uncountably infinite set''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UncountablyInfinite.html Uncountably Infinite — from Wolfram MathWorld]&lt;/ref&gt; is an infinite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that contains too many [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] to be [[countable set|countable]]. The uncountability of a set is closely related to its [[cardinal number]]: a set is uncountable if its cardinal number is larger than that of the set of all [[natural number]]s.

==Characterizations==

There are many equivalent characterizations of uncountability.  A set ''X'' is uncountable if and only if any of the following conditions hold:
* There is no [[injective function]] from ''X'' to the set of natural numbers.
* ''X'' is nonempty and for every ω-[[sequence]] of elements of ''X'', there exist at least one element of X not included in it. That is, ''X'' is nonempty and there is no [[surjective function]] from the natural numbers to ''X''.
* The [[cardinality]] of ''X'' is neither finite nor equal to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph-null]], the cardinality of the [[natural number]]s).  
* The set ''X'' has cardinality strictly greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The first three of these characterizations can be proven equivalent in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the [[axiom of choice]], but the equivalence of the third and fourth cannot be proved without additional choice principles.

==Properties==
* If an uncountable set ''X'' is a subset of set ''Y'', then ''Y'' is uncountable.

== Examples ==

The best known example of an uncountable set is the set '''R''' of all [[real number]]s; [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that this set is uncountable. The diagonalization proof technique can also be used to show that several other sets are uncountable, such as the set of all infinite [[sequence]]s of [[natural number]]s  and the set of all [[subset]]s of the set of natural numbers. The cardinality of '''R''' is often called the [[cardinality of the continuum]] and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} &lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; ([[cardinality of the continuum|beth-one]]).

The [[Cantor set]] is an uncountable subset of '''R'''.  The Cantor set is a [[fractal]] and has [[Hausdorff dimension]] greater than zero but less than one ('''R''' has dimension one). This is an example of the following fact: any subset of '''R''' of Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than zero must be uncountable.

Another example of an uncountable set is the set of all [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s from '''R''' to '''R'''. This set is even "more uncountable" than '''R''' in the sense that the cardinality of this set is &lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; ([[beth two|beth-two]]), which is larger than &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt;.

A more abstract example of an uncountable set is the set of all countable [[ordinal number]]s, denoted by Ω or ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The cardinality of Ω is denoted &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph-one]]). It can be shown, using the [[axiom of choice]], that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the ''smallest'' uncountable cardinal number.  Thus either &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of the reals, is equal to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; or it is strictly larger. [[Georg Cantor]] was the first to propose the question of whether &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;.  In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed this question as the first of his [[Hilbert's problems|23 problems]]. The statement that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 = \beth_1&lt;/math&gt; is now called the [[continuum hypothesis]] and is known to be independent of the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] for [[set theory]] (including the axiom of choice).

==Without the axiom of choice==
{{main|Dedekind-infinite set}}
Without the [[axiom of choice]], there might exist cardinalities [[Comparability|incomparable]] to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (namely, the cardinalities of [[Dedekind-finite]] infinite sets). Sets of these cardinalities satisfy the first three characterizations above but not the fourth characterization. Because these sets are not larger than the natural numbers in the sense of cardinality, some may not want to call them uncountable.

If the axiom of choice holds, the following conditions on a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent:
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa \nleq \aleph_0;&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa &gt; \aleph_0;&lt;/math&gt; and
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa \geq \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 = |\omega_1 |&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is least [[initial ordinal]] greater than &lt;math&gt;\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

However, these may all be different if the axiom of choice fails. So it is not obvious which one is the appropriate generalization of "uncountability" when the axiom fails. It may be best to avoid using the word in this case and specify which of these one means.

The '''Lewis model of economic growth''' analyses the process of [[economic expansion]] in a [[dual economy]]. [[W.A Lewis]] put forward his views systematically in his article "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=misra|first=puri|title=Economics of development and planning|year=2010|publisher=Himalaya publishing house|location=mumbai|isbn=978-81-8488-829-4|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis divides the economy of an underdeveloped country into two sectors:

'''The [[Capitalist]] Sector:'''
Defined as "that part of the economy which uses reproducible capital and pays capitalists thereof". The use of capital is controlled by the capitalists, who hire the services of [[Manual labour|labor]]. It includes [[manufacturing]], [[plantation]]s, [[mining|mines]], etc.

'''Warm-glow giving''' is an economic theory describing the emotional reward of giving to others. According to the original warm-glow model developed by [[James Andreoni|Andreoni]] (1989, 1990),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1989|title=Giving with Impure Altruism: Applications to Charity and Ricardian Equivalence|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833247|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1447–1458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1990|title=Impure Altruism and Donations to Public Goods: A Theory of Warm-Glow Giving|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2234133|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=100|issue=401|pages=464–477|doi=10.2307/2234133}}&lt;/ref&gt; people experience a sense of joy and satisfaction for "doing their part" to help others. This satisfaction - or "''warm glow"'' - represents the selfish pleasure derived from "doing good", regardless of the actual impact of one's generosity. Within the warm-glow framework, people may be "impurely altruistic", meaning they simultaneously maintain both altruistic and egoistic (selfish) motivations for giving. Whereas "pure altruists" (sometimes referred to as "perfect altruists")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohler|first=Stefan|date=2011|title=Altruism and fairness in experimental decisions|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2011.02.014|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=80|issue=1|pages=101–109|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2011.02.014|issn=0167-2681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are motivated solely by the desire to provide for a recipient, impure altruists are also motivated by the joy of giving (warm glow).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Importantly, warm glow is distinctly non-pecuniary,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Valmont Effect: The Warm-Glow Theory of Philanthropy|last=Elster|first=Jon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-973907-3|location=|pages=67-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feddersen|first=Timothy|date=2009|title=The Foundations of Warm-Glow Theory|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mrostek/warm-glowd%2010-08-09.pdf|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning it arises independent of the possibility of financial reward.

Taken together, these findings offered a strong rebuke of the assumption that public grants crowd-out private donations to public goods.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;
=== Original model ===
Andreoni's economic model of impure altruism considers a simplistic world with only two goods: a [[private good]] and a [[public good]]. A given individual, endowed with wealth &lt;math&gt;(w_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;faces the [[budget constraint]]: &lt;math&gt;w_{i} = x_{i} + g_{i}, &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;x_{i} &lt;/math&gt;represents consumption of a private good, and &lt;math&gt;g_{i}&lt;/math&gt;represents the contribution to the public good. To the extent that &lt;math&gt;g_i &lt;/math&gt;positively contributes to [[utility]], it may be interpreted as the degree of warm glow.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;It follows that the total provision of the public good, G, is simply: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}^{n} (g_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;and the total contributions to the public good from all other individuals is denoted as: &lt;math&gt;G_{-i} = \sum_{i \ne j}^n(g_{j}).&lt;/math&gt;Thus, the public good is the sum of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th} &lt;/math&gt;person's contribution &lt;math&gt;(g_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;along with the total contributions of all other individuals &lt;math&gt;G_{-i}. &lt;/math&gt;

'''(1) &lt;math&gt;G = g_{i} + G_{-i},&lt;/math&gt;'''where &lt;math&gt;g_i \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

All individuals in this naïve economy face the same [[utility function]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, given by:

'''(2)'''&lt;math&gt;U_{i} = U_{i}(x_{i},G,g_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;

where the utility functions represent the utility for private, egoistic consumption &lt;math&gt;U_{i}(x_{i});&lt;/math&gt;the utility derived from the public good &lt;math&gt;U_{i}(G);&lt;/math&gt;and the warm-glow utility of the contribution towards the public good &lt;math&gt;U_{i}(g_{i}).&lt;/math&gt;An altruist should derive no additional utility from the act of giving: &lt;math&gt;U_{altruist} = f(x_i, G),&lt;/math&gt;whereas a pure egoist derives pleasure only from the warm glow of giving, without care for the public good itself, hence &lt;math&gt;U_{egoist} = f(x_i,g_i).&lt;/math&gt;

From the budget constraint and utility function, one can derive the utility maximization function, &lt;math&gt;max U_{i}(w_{i}+G_{-i}-G, G, G - G_{-i}),&lt;/math&gt;which is the original utility function '''(2)''' transformed using the definition of the public good '''(1)'''.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Implications ===
Assuming a strategy of utility maximization, the model of warm glow offers many important economic predictions. Specifically, it presents three contrarian insights to those of classical economics under Ricardian equivalence.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; 

First, warm-glow theory predicts that income transfers will increase net giving only when income is transferred to more altruistic individuals. Second, it suggests that the provision of a public good is dependent upon the distribution of income within a population. Third, it suggests that public fund of public goods through lump-sum taxes will be more effective than relying upon altruism in the private sector.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Individually and collectively, these propositions are in stark contrast to the [[laissez-faire]] doctrine of Ricardian economics.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Following this original model, warm glow has conceptually evolved with new applications across disciplines to explain and encourage [[prosocial behavior]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Background in psychology ==
Many of the advances in warm glow research stem not from economics, but from psychology. In particular, research on motivations and affect have played a key role in defining and operationalizing warm glow for broad application.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== A motivational perspective ===
''"...a millionaire does not really care whether his money does good or not, provided he finds his conscience eased and his social status improved by giving it away..." -George Bernard Shaw.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=George Bernard|date=1896|title=Shaw On Socialism (1896)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.14452/mr-002-08-1950-12_5|journal=Monthly Review|volume=2|issue=8|pages=387|doi=10.14452/mr-002-08-1950-12_5|issn=0027-0520|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As illustrated in Shaw's quote, both intrinsic desires of conscience and extrinsic desires of social status may motivate giving.

==== Intrinsic warm glow ====
The most common and classically "correct" interpretation of warm glow is as a solely intrinsic phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evren|first=Ozgur|last2=Minardi|first2=Stefania|date=2013|title=Warm-Glow Giving and Freedom to Be Selfish|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2347111|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2347111|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language referring to the "joy of giving",&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1989|title=Giving with Impure Altruism: Applications to Charity and Ricardian Equivalence|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833247|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1447–1458}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the positive emotional experience from the act of helping others",&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Linden|first=Sander|date=2015|title=Intrinsic motivation and pro-environmental behaviour|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2669|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=7|pages=612–613|doi=10.1038/nclimate2669|issn=1758-678X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the moral satisfaction of helping others"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winterich|first=Karen Page|last2=Barone|first2=Michael J|date=2011|title=Warm Glow or Cold, Hard Cash?

==== Extrinsic warm glow ====
Much of the ambiguity surrounding the motivational processes of warm glow has arisen from the misclassification of extrinsic rewards to intrinsic processes.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Valmont Effect: The Warm-Glow Theory of Philanthropy|last=Elster|first=Jon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-973907-3|location=|pages=67-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonin|first=Mirco|last2=Vlassopoulos|first2=Michael|date=2010|title=Disentangling the sources of pro-socially motivated effort: A field experiment|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.08.011|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=94|issue=11-12|pages=1086–1092|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.08.011|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While intrinsic desires center upon emotional gains, extrinsic rewards may include recognition, identity signaling, and prestige. Extrinsic motivation may also take the form of punishment (negative warm glow), in the form of censure or blame&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Richard M.|last2=Deci|first2=Edward L.|date=2000|title=Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=68–78|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68|issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some research has explicitly focused on extrinsic warm glow, such as "relational warm glow".&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scharf|first=Kimberley|last2=Smith|first2=Sarah|date=2016|title=Relational altruism and giving in social groups|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.06.001|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=141|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.06.001|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area that has been frequently confused in the literature involves the classification of guilt, which is an introjected form of extrinsic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagné|first=Marylène|last2=Deci|first2=Edward L.|date=2005-04-14|title=Self-determination theory and work motivation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/job.322|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=26|issue=4|pages=331–362|doi=10.1002/job.322|issn=0894-3796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Importance of motivational classification ====
The classification of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has important ramifications for policy makers.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Amato|first=Alessio|last2=Mancinelli|first2=Susanna|last3=Zoli|first3=Mariangela|date=2014|title=Two Shades of (Warm) Glow: multidimensional intrinsic motivation, waste reduction and recycling|url=http://www.sustainability-seeds.org/papers/RePec/srt/wpaper/2114.pdf|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive body of literature on [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational crowding out]] suggests the efficacy of policies promoting altruistic behavior may be a function of whether pre-existing behavior is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Bruno S.|last2=Jegen|first2=Reto|date=2001|title=Motivation Crowding Theory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-6419.00150|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=15|issue=5|pages=589–611|doi=10.1111/1467-6419.00150|issn=0950-0804|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Deci|first=Edward L.|title=Conceptualizations of Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination|date=1985|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7_2|work=Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior|pages=11–40|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781489922731|access-date=2018-11-09|last2=Ryan|first2=Richard M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which extrinsic incentives may be substitutes for intrinsic motivations depends upon the motivational classification of the warm glow model. Furthermore, intrinsic warm glow may be more resilient to satiation effects than extrinsic warm glow.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonin|first=Mirco|last2=Vlassopoulos|first2=Michael|date=2013-03-27|title=An experimental investigation of intrinsic motivations for giving|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11238-013-9360-9|journal=Theory and Decision|volume=76|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1007/s11238-013-9360-9|issn=0040-5833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the expected magnitude of a warm glow will be a function of how it is characterized. Models assuming a purely intrinsic warm glow should report lesser warm glows than models also including extrinsic components.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Empathy and the psychological determinants of warm glow ===
[[File:Empathy_-_Design_Thinking.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Empathy_-_Design_Thinking.png|thumb|Empathy - Design Thinking]]
The phenomenon of warm-glow giving was originally introduced as an economic model.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1989|title=Giving with Impure Altruism: Applications to Charity and Ricardian Equivalence|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833247|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1447–1458}}&lt;/ref&gt; It its original form, the warm-glow model lacked a satisfactory explanation for the underlying psychological processes.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of warm glow were deliberately vague in attributing the experience to a cause.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/934199169|title=The economics of philanthropy and fundraising|last=editor.|first=Andreoni, James,|isbn=9781784713232|oclc=934199169}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent body of research has identified several important determinants of warm glow, including social distance,&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bohnet|first=Iris|last2=Frey|first2=Bruno S|date=1999|title=The sound of silence in prisoner's dilemma and dictator games|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-2681(98)00121-8|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=38|issue=1|pages=43–57|doi=10.1016/s0167-2681(98)00121-8|issn=0167-2681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003|title=Help a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1023/a:1022299422219|issn=0895-5646|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; vividness to the beneficiary, and guilt avoidance&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;.

==== Social distance ====
[[Social distance]] is an important determinant of warm glow, particularly in the framework of empathy.&lt;ref name=":192" /&gt; Prior research has examined the link between emotional arousal and social distance, finding that mutual suffering and shared joy both increase as a function of social similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krebs|first=Dennis|date=1975|title=Empathy and altruism.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.32.6.1134|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1134–1146|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.32.6.1134|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the "[[identifiable victim effect]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JENNI|first=KAREN|last2=LOEWENSTEIN|first2=GEORGE|date=1997|title=Explaining the identifiable victim effect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1007740225484|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=14|issue=3|pages=235–257|doi=10.1023/a:1007740225484|issn=0895-5646|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; research has shown that people express a greater willingness to help when others are known, as opposed to statistical.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;
==== Vividness to beneficiary ====
While the vividness of the beneficiary is captured in social distance,&lt;ref name=":222" /&gt; the vividness to the beneficiary refers to a beneficiary's ability to perceive that kindness has been done upon them. As a determinant of warm glow, vividness to the beneficiary operates on two levels. The primary level concerns whether a beneficiary is aware that kindness has been given to them, absent any attribution of the source. The secondary level involves the identifiability of the benefactor. Warm glow should be positively impacted by both levels for vividness.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; 

==== Guilt ====
Recent work has identified guilt avoidance as an important component of warm glow.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Some have even compared guilt as the "flip side" of warm glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giebelhausen|first=Michael|last2=Chun|first2=HaeEun Helen|last3=Cronin|first3=J.

Resolving this feeling comes either by giving and feeling good or by not giving and feeling guilt."''&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; In other notable overviews of warm glow, this phenomenon has been characterized as "personal distress"&lt;ref name=":172"&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=What Should a Billionaire Give—and What Should You?|date=2011-01-13|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199739073.003.0002|work=Giving Well|pages=13–24|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199739073|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In surveys of self-reported guilt, people experience roughly as much interpersonal and societal guilt as they do personal guilt. Furthermore, half of the survey respondents prefer to directly address and resolve their feelings of guilt. Taken together, these findings suggest a substantial component of guilt aversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Darren W.|last2=Honea|first2=Heather|last3=Manchanda|first3=Rajesh V.|date=2003|title=The Nature of Self-Reported Guilt in Consumption Contexts|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1027492516677|journal=Marketing Letters|volume=14|issue=3|pages=159–171|doi=10.1023/a:1027492516677|issn=0923-0645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ===

==== Corporate social responsibility ====
Supporting businesses engaged in [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) initiatives may give consumers a vicarious warm glow. However, recent research suggests that consumers may expect to overpay when companies engage in CSR due to perceptions of price fairness. The implication that "doing good" carries a financial burden for businesses leads consumers to infer general price markups. This body of research cautions that corporate warm glows may be coupled with "cold prickles" of extra costs.&lt;ref name=":292"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habel|first=Johannes|last2=Schons|first2=Laura Marie|last3=Alavi|first3=Sascha|last4=Wieseke|first4=Jan|date=2016|title=Warm Glow or Extra Charge?

==== Avoidance behaviors ====
[[File:IYC_Women_Bell_Ringers_2016_(31029903216).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IYC_Women_Bell_Ringers_2016_(31029903216).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|"Negative" warm glow may explain why empathetic individuals actively avoid charitable opportunities]]
Common phenomena such as avoiding eye contact with beggars or adjusting one's route to avoid a solicitor may be explained using the warm glow model.

One behavioral consequence of warm glow is strategic avoidance of giving opportunities. According to this hypothesis, individuals anticipate their warm glow upon identifying a future giving opportunity. Assuming a functional form that allows warm glow to be negative (driven by a ''guilt'' of not giving), people may strategically and effortfully avoid giving situations. The strategic incentive is easily understood through the utility function &lt;math&gt;U_i = U_{i}(x_{i},G,g_{i}), &lt;/math&gt;where the warm glow &lt;math&gt;(g_i),&lt;/math&gt;is positive for a donation (joy of giving) and negative for not giving (guilt). For an agent who would suffer a disutility of giving at their desired level &lt;math&gt;(g_i^*)&lt;/math&gt;because the marginal utility of private expenditure &lt;math&gt;(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;exceeds the marginal utility of warm-glow giving, they should prefer to give nothing &lt;math&gt;(g_i^0).&lt;/math&gt;Because giving nothing may be associated with guilt, the utility of &lt;math&gt;(g_i^0)&lt;/math&gt;will be negative. Therefore, for a rational agent who cannot justify giving, &lt;math&gt;U_i(x_i,G,g_i^*) &lt; U_i(x_i,G,g_i^0)       &lt;/math&gt;, can maximize their utility through avoiding a giving situation, effectively dropping the warm glow argument from their utility functions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Thus, &lt;math&gt;U_i(x_i,G,g_i^*) &lt; U_i(x_i,G,g_i^0) &lt; U_i(x_i, G, 0)&lt;/math&gt;suggests avoidance of giving opportunities is a preferred strategy for individuals who experience guilt as a negative warm glow. Economic models assign a cost of effort to avoidance, and predict that people will incur such effort whenever &lt;math&gt;U_{i0} - c_i &gt; U_{is},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;U_{i0}&lt;/math&gt;is the utility of not giving, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;is the cost of avoidance, and &lt;math&gt;U_{is}&lt;/math&gt;is the utility of giving to a solicitor, conditional upon not avoiding.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 

Through this lens, avoidance can be viewed as an economic [[commitment device]], where a person commits to avoiding a situation (being asked to give) in which they are likely to surrender to temptation (giving). Central to this avoidance hypothesis is that individuals can anticipate their behavior in high-empathy "hot states", while in low-empathy "cold states". While this model assumes a high degree of sophistication on the part of the individual, research by Andreoni, Rao, and Trachtman explores this very phenomenon by observing avoidance and donation behavior of customers entering a supermarket during the holidays. Customers often walked to a further entrance to avoid solicitors for the Salvation Army. According to their model, "empathetically vulnerable" individuals who are not be able to give (for budgetary reasons), faced the greatest incentive to avoid collectors because of the guilt they would experience upon saying "no".&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/934199169|title=The economics of philanthropy and fundraising|last=editor.|first=Andreoni, James,|isbn=9781784713232|oclc=934199169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Grouping behaviors ====
Charities may strategically employ categorical [[Donor recognition wall|donor recognition]]. For example, a charitable organization may distinguish any gift between $500-$999.99 by a title distinct from that awarded for gifts above $1,000. As a consequence, the social signaling component of the warm-glow effect (in extrinsic operationalizations of warm glow) suggests individuals should be motivated to make the minimum donation to acquire their desired categorical status. Consistent with this hypothesis, research has indicated significant grouping behavior of donors around category minimums.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harbaugh|first=William T|date=1998|title=What do donations buy?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0047-2727(97)00062-5|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=67|issue=2|pages=269–284|doi=10.1016/s0047-2727(97)00062-5|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Inefficiency in charitable allocation ====

A majority of those who choose to give some portion of their wealth to charity support multiple different causes. Rather than giving 100% of their cumulative donations to the same source, there exists a widespread preference to distribute funds across charities.&lt;ref name=":173"&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=What Should a Billionaire Give—and What Should You?|date=2011-01-13|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199739073.003.0002|work=Giving Well|pages=13–24|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199739073|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm glow model explains this be recognizing that givers receive multiple warm glows by giving to multiple causes, thus supporting the preference to make many smaller contributions. As a consequence, some scholars suggest an efficiency loss due to high volumes of small donations - which are less efficient to process - rather than fewer large donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Null|first=C.|date=2011|title=Warm glow, information, and inefficient charitable giving|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.06.018|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=95|issue=5-6|pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.06.018|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;mentions warm-glow givers in his 2015 book, ''[[The Most Good You Can Do]]''. Singer states that these types of donors "give small amounts to many charities [and] are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others." He references "empathetic concern" and "personal distress" as two distinct components of warm-glow givers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically.|last=Singer|first=Peter|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=pp. 5, 6, 77–80, 90.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inefficiency in charitable selection ====

Warm glow may offer an explanation for some of the observed inefficiencies in charitable giving. For example, United States citizens directed more than 60% of their total charitable contributions to religious groups, education institutions, art organizations, and foundations in 2017; compared to under 7% in foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://givingusa.org|title=Giving USA {{!}} A public service initiative of the Giving Institute|website=givingusa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to models of social justice&lt;ref name=":173" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/24/02/2014/donors%E2%80%99-dilemma-charity-social-justice|title='The Donors’ Dilemma' - From Charity to Social Justice {{!}} Global Policy Journal|website=www.globalpolicyjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economic [[Quality-adjusted life year|QALY]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; in which human lives are treated with equal dignity and equal respect - regardless of race, gender, or place of origin - the goal of charity should be to fight global poverty. Similarly, economic models, which attempt to place a monetary value on the human life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobalist.com/the-cost-of-a-human-life-statistically-speaking/|title=The Cost of a Human Life, Statistically Speaking - The Globalist|date=2012-07-21|work=The Globalist|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, highlight the inefficiency of all philanthropy not used to combat global poverty, which offers the highest marginal return.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/987462476|title=Doing good better effective altruism and a radical new way to make a difference|last=VerfasserIn.|first=MacAskill, William,|isbn=9781783350513|oclc=987462476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm-glow model accounts for such inefficiency because impure altruists may be insensitive to the actual cause, and more sensitive to the act of giving or size of the gift. Thus, warm-glow may generate philanthropic inefficiencies to the extent that it desensitizes potential donors to the marginal impact of a given charity. In response to this concern, [[William MacAskill|Willian MacAskill]] and colleagues have advanced a process of philanthropic allocation called "[[effective altruism]]".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This methodology seeks to leverage logic and responsibility to identify effective charitable opportunities, thus minimizing the effect of warm-glow in the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/the-warm-glow-of-giving-may-overshadow-doing-the-greatest-good.html|title=The “Warm Glow” of Giving May Overshadow Doing the Greatest Good|work=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Doing good better : how effective altruism can help you help others, do work that matters, and make smarter choices about giving back|last=2016|first=MacAskill, William,|publisher=|year=|isbn=1592409660|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=932001639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
=== Ad-hoc ===
A common criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it seems ad-hoc. Indeed, Andreoni, the father of the original model, stated that "putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly ''ad hoc'' fix".&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Citation|last=Andreoni|first=James|title=Chapter 18 Philanthropy|date=2006|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S1574-0714(06)02018-5|work=Handbook of the Economics of Giving, Altruism and Reciprocity|pages=1201–1269|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s1574-0714(06)02018-5|isbn=9780444521453|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the body of research has evolved over nearly 30 years - incorporating philosophical,&lt;ref name=":173" /&gt; psychological,&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003|title=Help a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1023/a:1022299422219|issn=0895-5646|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physiological insights&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; - it has become a better descriptive model of behavior.&lt;ref name=":104"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Self-delusion ===
An obscure criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it necessitates self-deception.&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt; This argument states that in order to reap the emotional reward of helping others, one must believe his actions to be motivated altruistically. Yet, the mere existence of a warm glow should then contradict the belief of pure altruism. A question arises as to whether prolonged self-delusion is sustainable and impervious to learning through [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bem|first=Daryl J.|date=1967|title=Self-perception: An alternative interpretation of cognitive dissonance phenomena.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0024835|journal=Psychological Review|volume=74|issue=3|pages=183–200|doi=10.1037/h0024835|issn=1939-1471}}&lt;/ref&gt;
