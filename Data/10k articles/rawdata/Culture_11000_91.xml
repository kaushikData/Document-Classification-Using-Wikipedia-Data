      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8337">'''Advanced Skills Teacher''' is a role in a [[state school|maintained school]] in England and Wales. Advanced Skills Teachers are judged through external assessment against a range of criteria to demonstrate excellent classroom teaching practice. They are employed in Advanced Skills Teacher posts in roles which include an element of work dedicated to supporting teaching colleagues in their own schools, and other schools in the area, to improve their own practice. The role was introduced in 1998 to reward excellent teachers who chose to stay working in classrooms, rather than following other routes to promotion through leadership.

==Introduction of the role==
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|general election of 1997]] included a statement that they would "create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best."&lt;ref name="labour"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/3labmaneduc.html |title=The Labour Party's Manifesto 1997 |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |year=1997 |work=BBC News 'Election 97' website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305141231/http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/3labmaneduc.html |archivedate=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was to ensure that teachers who excelled in the classroom were given both financial incentive and career-path options to allow them to continue in that role, providing a role model of high quality teaching.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm49/4990/4990-04.htm|title=Development of the pay and career structures|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=2001|author =School Teachers' Review Body|work=School Teachers' Review Body Tenth Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its election in May of that year, the new government brought forward the [[white paper]], ''Excellence in Schools'', which outlined proposals for the new grade of teacher.&lt;ref name="ucc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/RED/V63I0/630048.pdf|title=`Superteachers': The views of teachers and head teachers on the Advanced Skills Teacher grade|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|author1=Blake, D. |author2=Hanley, V. |author3=Jennings, M. |author4=Lloyd, M. |work=Research in Education|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Employment]], [[David Blunkett]], released additional details about the nature and pay relating to the posts in March 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/61246.stm|title= 'Super-teachers' to receive super salaries|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC News website | date=1998-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year, regulations were put in place to provide funding for the role,&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1998/19981741.htm|title=The Education (Grants for Education Support and Training) (England) Regulations 1998 (Amendment) Regulations 1998|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|year=1998|work=OPSI website}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the grade being formally introduced from September 1998.&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;

==Responsibilities of the role==
Advanced Skills Teachers (ASTs) are given additional non-teaching time to allow them to share their teaching skills with colleagues both within their own school, and in other schools in the local area. This time normally amounts to a minimum 20% of the working week.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ast/|title=Advanced Skills Teachers: Promoting Excellence|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=The Standards Site|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215341/http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ast/|archivedate=2008-12-18|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this time, ASTs are expected to undertake a range of tasks related to the raising of standards of teaching and learning in classrooms. These include, although are not limited to:
*supporting colleagues who are failing to meet high standards
*advising colleagues on pedagogical matters
*providing 'model' lessons to demonstrate excellent practice
*supporting the [[Induction (teachers)|induction]] of new teachers
*leading professional development of teachers.&lt;ref name="standards"/&gt;
It is expected that a considerable amount of this work will be undertaken in schools other than the teacher's own school as part of outreach schemes. This may involve working in liaison with the [[Local Education Authority]].&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/professionaldevelopment/ast/faqs/role/ |title=Frequently asked questions: Advanced Skills Teachers |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families |year=2006 |work=Teachernet Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804080059/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/professionaldevelopment/ast/faqs/role/ |archivedate=2008-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and appointment==
To become an Advanced Skills Teacher, a qualified teacher must first be assessed as meeting the professional standards of the role. In addition, they must be appointed to a specially-created Advanced Skills Teacher post.&lt;ref name="stpcd"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/12833/2008%20STPCD.pdf |title=School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=The Stationery Office |year=2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419144550/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/12833/2008%20STPCD.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be assessed as an AST, a teacher must demonstrate that they are able to meet the professional standards for the role. There are three stated standards relating to the role of AST, but in addition, applicants must also meet the subsumed standards of an Excellent teacher - a separate role as defined by government policy. There are a total of 28 standards to be met, falling under three main categories:
*Professional attributes
*Professional knowledge and understanding
*Professional skills

Teachers applying for AST posts must meet an external assessor who will judge the postholder against the criteria before being appointed to the post.&lt;ref name="astapp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/11903/3674%20AST_Main%20Scale%20form_Eng_2007.pdf |title=Advanced Skills Teacher (AST): Application for assessment for main scale teachers |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=Department for Children, Schools and families |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702081928/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/11903/3674%20AST_Main%20Scale%20form_Eng_2007.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pay and conditions==
When the role of AST was first introduced, it was accompanied by a 27-point pay scale separate from that of classroom teachers or school managers. In its review of school teachers' pay in 2004, the School Teachers' Review Body recommended a change to the scale with effect from September 2006. Since that time, Advanced Skills Teachers have been paid on a scale of 18 pay points, which is identical to the first 18 points range of the Leadership pay scale, which is used for [[Head teacher]]s, and Deputy and Assistant Headteachers.&lt;ref name="strb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/6282/strbreptmar04.pdf |title=School Teachers’ Review Body Thirteenth Report – Part 2 |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=The Stationery Office |year=2004 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701110359/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/6282/strbreptmar04.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike teachers employed on the main pay scale, Advanced Skills Teachers are not subject to the limits on working time of 195 days per academic year, or 1265 directed hours per year. Head teachers are, however, required to ensure that Advanced Skills Teachers have a reasonable work/life balance.&lt;ref name="stpcd"/&gt;

'''''Angel at the Fence: The True Story of a Love That Survived''''', written by [[Herman Rosenblat]], was a fictitious [[Holocaust]] memoir purporting to tell the true story of the author's reunion with, and marriage to, a girl who had passed him food through the barbed-wire fence when he was imprisoned at the [[Schlieben]] subcamp of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in World War II. The book was scheduled for publication by Berkley Books in February 2009; its publication was canceled on December 27, 2008 when it was discovered that the book's central events were untrue.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news| title=Anger, sadness over fabricated Holocaust story | date=Dec 27, 2008 | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28391083/ | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=February 8, 2015 | work=Publication of disputed Holocaust memoir canceled}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to being exposed as a fabrication, the film rights to the book were purchased for $25&amp;nbsp;million by Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures. Other fans of the story included [[Oprah Winfrey]] who described it as the single greatest love story she had heard in 22 years of doing her show. In June 2010, Atlantic Overseas Pictures and producer Harris Salomon signed a co-production agreement with Castel Film Studios, the largest film studio in Central and Eastern Europe and the studio for ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' and ''[[Borat (film)|Borat]]'', to produce a feature film on the Herman Rosenblat affair, based on an original screenplay by Ivo Marloh, to be shot in 2011.

==The story==
Fabricated by Rosenblat, the story states that, beginning in the winter of 1944, a nine-year-old Jewish girl posing as a Christian from a local farm, met him at the electrified perimeter fence of the Schlieben concentration camp and tossed him an apple over the fence. She continued passing him food for seven months until he was transferred to another camp. According to Rosenblat, they met in 1957 on a [[wiktionary:blind date|blind date]] at [[Coney Island, New York]], and, while relating their personal histories, discovered their shared past. Shortly afterwards, they married.&lt;ref name="TNR2"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Gabriel | last=Sherman | title=The Greatest Love Story Ever Sold | date=Dec 26, 2008 | url= http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=f458c2c8-0d4f-4dc7-8cba-15e465c2201a| work=[[The New Republic]] | accessdate=Dec 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity questioned==
Several Holocaust scholars including [[Deborah Lipstadt]] raised questions about “the central premise of his narrative — that a girl met him at the fence and that very girl became his wife,” and  suggested that that premise "is, at the very least, an embellishment, and at worst, a wholesale fabrication."&lt;ref name="TNR2"/&gt; According to an article published in the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'', Professor [[Kenneth Waltzer]], director of the Jewish Studies program at [[Michigan State University]], stated that maps of Schlieben indicate that neither prisoners nor civilians could have approached the perimeter fence as one could only obtain access immediately next to the SS barracks.&lt;ref name="TNR2"/&gt; Waltzer also determined that Mr. Rosenblat's wife and her family were hidden as Christians at a farm near [[Breslau]], 210 miles away from Schlieben.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Motoko| last=Rich | title=False Memoir of Holocaust Is Canceled | date=Dec 28, 2008 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/books/29hoax.html?_r=1| work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=Dec 30, 2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of researchers, including [[forensic]] [[genealogists]] [[Sharon Sergeant]] and [[Colleen Fitzpatrick (forensic genealogist)|Colleen Fitzpatrick]], as well as several Holocaust survivors, worked with Waltzer in uncovering the deception and bringing it to the attention of reporters.&lt;ref name="habermehl2009"&gt;{{cite news| title= MSU professor debunks couple’s Holocaust hoax| work=The State News | last= Habermehl |first= Kayla | date= January 14, 2009 | url= http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2009/01/msu_professor_debunkspcouples_holocaust_hoax }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rubin2009"&gt;{{cite news| last= Ribun |first= Neal | date= January 8, 2009| url= http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090108/OPINION03/901080333 | title= MSU prof spots Holocaust lie | newspaper=[[Detroit News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and family members also raised questions about the truth of statements in the book.

Rosenblat and the publisher, however, initially maintained that the story was truthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Dave | last=Itzkoff | title=Disputed Holocaust Memoir is Defended | date= December 26, 2008 | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/disputed-holocaust-memoir-is-defended/ | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate= December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkley Books subsequently stated that it was "canceling publication of ''Angel at the Fence'' after receiving new information from Herman Rosenblat's agent, Andrea Hurst," and "will demand that the author and the agent return all money that they have received for this work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Hillel |last=Italie |title=Publisher says it will cancel publication of disputed Holocaust memoir 'Angel at the Fence' |date=December 27, 2008 |url=http://www.blnz.com/news/2008/12/27/Publication_disputed_Holocaust_memoir_canceled_7823.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118023514/http://www.blnz.com/news/2008/12/27/Publication_disputed_Holocaust_memoir_canceled_7823.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=Bay Ledger News Zone |accessdate=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblat, who was in fact imprisoned in Schlieben, has acknowledged that the story of meeting his wife there was invented.&lt;ref name="npr2008"&gt;Conan, Neal (December 29, 2008).

A children's version of the story, entitled '''''Angel Girl''''' ({{ISBN|978-0822-58739-2}}), written by [[Laurie Friedman]] and illustrated by Ofra Amit, was published in September 2008 by [[Lerner Publishing Group#Carolrhoda Books|Carolrhoda Books]] of [[Lerner Publishing Group]].

A $25&amp;nbsp;million [[film adaptation]] of the book, titled ''Flower of the Fence'', was announced for production in spite of the cancellation of the story's publication.&lt;ref name="TNR"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Gabriel | last=Sherman | title=Wartime Lies | date=Dec 26, 2008 | url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books/wartime-lies | work=[[The New Republic]] | accessdate=Dec 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's intended producer, Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures, said the film would be a "loose and fictionalised adaptation" unaffected by issues with the memoir's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5409220.ece Herman Rosenblat's Holocaust memoir of love is exposed as a hoax] from ''[[The Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The film, however, was never made.

In August 2009, York House Press published a paperback by Penelope Holt titled ''The Apple: Based on the Herman Rosenblat Holocaust Love Story'' ({{ISBN|978-0979195648}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://theapplenovel.com/ The Apple] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922030613/http://theapplenovel.com/ |date=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4488">The [[Melodeon (accordion)]] playing vaudevillian '''Ann “Ma” McNulty''' (1887–1970), widowed in 1928 in the wake of the [[Great Depression]] and determined to support and keep together the small remaining family of herself and her 2 minor children, went to stage with these children, who were Eileen McNulty (1915–1989), a songstress and dancer, and Peter McNulty (1917–1960), a singer, dancer, violinist, pianist and, eventually, a composer of music and lyrics. The trio, who were known as ''“The McNulty Family’s Irish Showboat Revue”'', first appeared on stage as such in 1932-1933 and through Ma’s astute show business acumen became almost immediately and remained for decades an astounding success on the U.S. East Coast entertainment circuit. The trio eventually appeared regularly on radio and at such venues as the [[Rockefeller Center]]'s [[Radio City Music Hall]], the Yorkville Casino, [[New York City]]’s Leitrim House and at [[Rockaway Beach, Queens]]. For 16 consecutive years the trio of "Ma" McNulty, Eileen McNulty and Peter McNulty sold out the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]’s 2,109 seat Howard Gillman Opera House. In their near 2 decades of music recording for labels like [[Decca Records]], Standard and Copley from 1938-1956, the McNulty family’s ''“Showboat Revue”'' released 155 sides on [[78-rpm]] shellac &amp; vinyl. In 1953, they appeared through the then new entertainment venue of television on [[Milton Berle]]’s wildly popular [[Texaco Star Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://irishecho.com/?p=63589%20http://www.irishcentral.com/IrishAmerica/The-McNulty-Family-Irish-Show-Boat-Sails-Again-103053604.htm] Earle Hitchner “All Aboard The McNulty Family’s Irish Showboat” ''Irish Echo'' March 2, 2011 Arts &amp; Leisure&lt;/ref&gt;

“Ma” McNulty did not appear on stage during her children's earlier duo performances. In 1926, after one theater’s “professor” was unable to keep proper time for her children, “Ma” began, herself, keeping time for them from backstage on an old melodeon accordion. By 1928, she had been encouraged to perform on stage with her children. Though by the late 1930s,  radio and motion pictures had already there and throughout the nation eclipsed as popular entertainment [[vaudeville]], which had begun in the 1880s, the McNulty family managed to keep the art of Irish “vaudevillian” or variety theater alive on the U.S. East Coast well into the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Lee and M.R. Casey ''Making the Irish American'' New York: New York University Press 2006, p 399 {{ISBN|978-0-8147-5208-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The McNulty family had a powerful influence on the development of the [[Music of Newfoundland and Labrador#Modern era|Music of Newfoundland and Labrador in its modern era]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Eveylyn (2013) The most (imagined) Irish place in the world?: the interaction between Irish and Newfoundland musicians, electronic mass media, and the construction of musical senses of place (doctoral dissertation) Memorial University of Newfoundland, Abstract retrieved from http://research.library.mun.ca/6216/&lt;/ref&gt; Another testament to the popularity of the McNulty Family was the impressive number of recordings they made for Decca, Standard, and Copley: 155 sides on 78-rpm releases.&lt;ref name="IE"&gt;[http://irishecho.com/2011/03/all-aboard-the-mcnulty-family’s-irish-showboat-2/ The Irish Echo, ''All aboard the McNulty Family’s Irish Showboat'', accessed 19 August 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bigipedia''''' is a [[comedy]] [[sketch show]] broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] that first aired between 23 July and 13 August 2009. A second series of four episodes began on 12 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000319/bigipedia_given_second_series/|title=Bigipedia given second series|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's storyline revolves around "Bigipedia", a fictional website broadcast on radio and parody of [[Wikipedia]], the online [[encyclopedia]]. The series mocks Wikipedia and other aspects of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maume|first=Chris|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/bigipedia-radio-4-1761093.html|title=Bigipedia, Radio 4|publisher=''[[The Independent on Sunday]]''|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC Press Office described the show as "a unique experiment in 'broadwebcasting'".&lt;ref name="BCG Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/bigipedia/interview/|title=Interview With Nick Doody and Matt Kirshen|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Press Office"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/2009/wk29/thu.shtml#thu_radio4|title=Network Radio BBC Week 29: Thursday 23 July 2009|publisher=[[BBC]] Press Office|accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was created by co-star [[Nick Doody]], who also co-writes the show with [[Matt Kirshen]] and a wider team of writers. It is produced by [[Pozzitive Television|Pozzitive Productions]].

Critics have given ''Bigipedia'' positive reviews. The series was marketed by the [[BBC]] as "''[[The Sunday Format]]'' for the online age",&lt;ref name="BBC Press Office"/&gt; and critics have given ''Bigipedia'' favourable comparisons with its predecessor.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahoney|first=Elisabeth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jul/24/bigipedia-radio-review|title=Radio review: Bigipedia|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090730082247/http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/jul/24/bigipedia-radio-review| archivedate= 30 July 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the writing has also been praised.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; However, a few critics have expressed reservations about the way the show is presented.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heal|first=Clare|url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/116456/World-Wide-Web-of-wackiness-/|title=World Wide Web of Wackiness|publisher=''[[Sunday Express]]''|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first series of ''Bigipedia'' was made available to purchase as a [[download]] from [[Audible.com|Audible.co.uk]] from 1 December 2009. The second series was made available on AudioGo from 5 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/bigipedia/buy/|title='Bigipedia' Merchandise|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=9 December 2011|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Bigipedia'' is a website broadcast on the radio. Like Wikipedia, it contains articles and discussion pages about a range of different subjects, which can be edited by anyone. Among the similarities are [[Wikipedia:What is an article?|articles]], [[Wikipedia:Talk page|discussion pages]], [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation pages]], [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured articles]], a [[Wikinews|news section]] and a "[[WP:DYK|Did you know?]]" section for new articles.&lt;ref name="Episode 1"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 1|series=Bigipedia|airdate=23 July 2009|season=1|episode=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Episode 3"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 3|series=Bigipedia|airdate=6 August 2009|season=1|episode=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles cover a range of fictional celebrities, bands, films, television series, products and a [[running gag]] series of articles on [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animal characters from [[Uruguay]]an safety campaigns.

''Bigipedia'' differs from Wikipedia in some ways. For example, ''Bigipedia'' includes [[puzzle]]s and [[competition]]s, sells its own [[software]],&lt;ref name="Episode 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Episode 3"/&gt; has a range of [[screensaver]]s,&lt;ref name="Episode 2"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 2|series=Bigipedia|airdate=30 July 2009|season=1|episode=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a section for children called ''Bigikids'', which has had different names in the past which have all had to be changed for different reasons. For example, the name changed from ''Kidipedia'' "due to a misunderstanding",&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Episode 1"/&gt; ''Hanging at the School Gates'' "for reasons you may have seen in the news"&lt;ref name="Episode 2"/&gt; and ''Underage Fun'' "due to a copyright infringement".&lt;ref name="Episode 3"/&gt;

Also, while Wikipedia does not have [[Wikipedia:Advertising|advertising]], ''Bigipedia'' does and is also sponsored by a fictional [[wine]]-like drink called "Chianto" which is referred to as "this horrific drink".&lt;ref name="BCG Interview"/&gt; The ''Bigipedia'' article on Chianto says: "Over the years it has been sold as a hair remover, self-defence spray, hair restorer, and to farmers as a humane way of killing chickens – by putting it into the pig's feed and leaving the gate open. By morning not only were the chickens killed, but often plucked, too."&lt;ref name="Episode 1"/&gt;

The first series ended with ''Bigipedia'' attempting to take over the world, having crushed a rebellion in the [[Philippines]] and feeding nanobots into the heads of anyone listening to the programme.&lt;ref name="Episode 4"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 4|series=Bigipedia|airdate=13 August 2009|season=1|episode=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the second series, ''Bigipedia'' acknowledges that the original ''Bigipedia'', dubbed ''Bigipedia 1.0'' suffered from "security and sentient omniscience issues" and apologises for, "the temporary cyber enslavement of 88% of mankind and the forming of a ''BigiHuman'' hybrid [[Group mind (science fiction)|hivemind]] centred in the Philippines", in an incident they refer to as "The Glitch". The site has been updated and is now known as ''Bigipedia 2.0''.&lt;ref name="Episode 2.1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/bigipedia/episodes/2/1/|title=Bigipedia - Episode 2.1, What Is New In Bigipedia 2.0?|publisher=British Comedy Guide|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second series begins with reports of a gigantic Chianto slick in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], a parody of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]. At the end of the series, a mix of white and red Chianto in the slick result in the creation of a Chianto "[[ovum]]", which hatches at the bottom of the sea as a monstrous party-animal being called the Chianto Leviathan, which makes its way to the ''Bigipedia'' [[Server (computing)|servers]] in Mexico. The Leviathan attempts to gain all the world's knowledge by accessing the system. The programme ends with ''Bigipedia'' playing "prerecorded programmes" while they attempt to stop the Leviathan.&lt;ref name="Episode 2.4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/bigipedia/episodes/2/4/|title=Bigipedia - Episode 2.4, BigiHype!|publisher=British Comedy Guide|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The series was originally conceived by Doody, who was working with producer [[David Tyler (UK)|David Tyler]] on another BBC Radio 4 comedy series, ''[[Armando Iannucci's Charm Offensive]]''. Doody attended a meeting where people were discussing new ideas for radio shows, and Kirshen suggested the idea, and both he and Kirshen wrote the full proposal. Radio 4 liked the idea and a pilot was made.&lt;ref name="BCG Interview"/&gt; Tyler went on to produce and direct ''Bigipedia''.

Doody and Kirshen describe the show as "writing-heavy". Doody said in an interview with the [[British Comedy Guide]]: "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, "It's almost too much." I really like that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up."&lt;ref name="BCG Interview"/&gt;

Some of the sketches in ''Bigipedia'' are inspired directly by articles on Wikipedia. Kirshen said in the same interview: "There's a 'Bee Whisperer' in Episode 3 that came from clicking the "Random article" link on Wikipedia. I don't remember what the page we got was, but about three logical leaps later we landed on that idea."&lt;ref name="BCG Interview"/&gt;

It was revealed by Doody on his ''Doubling Up'' [[podcast]] with Rob Heeney that there was an extended edition of "The Line" sketch, which he broadcast on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://blog.doublingup.info/2009/11/16/season-02--ep04--the-radio-one.aspx |title=The Radio One |website=blog.doublingup.info |host=[[Nick Doody]] and Rob Heeney |date=11 November 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721200918/http://blog.doublingup.info/2009/11/16/season-02--ep04--the-radio-one.aspx |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The reviews of ''Bigipedia'' have been mainly positive. Before the series began, Scott Matthewman in ''[[The Stage]]'' compared ''Bigipedia'' to ''[[The Sunday Format]]'', saying: "Indeed, the comparison even makes it into the BBC's own press notes. Will this version, which takes the mickey out of online communication, deserve the comparison? That's something we'll have to wait and see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Matthewman |first=Scott |url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2009/07/turn-off-the-tv-radio-picks-july-18-24/ |title=Turn off the TV: Radio picks, July 18–24 |publisher=''[[The Stage]]'' |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720061140/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2009/07/turn-off-the-tv-radio-picks-july-18-24/ |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Maume in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' also commented that there are references to ''[[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]'', ''[[On the Hour]]'' and ''[[Brass Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

Elisabeth Mahoney in ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that she liked the Chianto running gag,&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; while [[Gillian Reynolds]] from the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented positively on ''Bigipedia'' saying it was, "the first late-night comedy in ages that has made me laugh, about computers and why I'm scared of them, about vile TV shows and meaningless commercials. Written by Nick Doody and Matt Kirshen, performed with zest by a sparkling cast. Bound to become a cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Gillian|authorlink=Gillian Reynolds|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/gillianreynolds/5603194/Todays-radio-highlights.html|title=Today's radio highlights|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|date=23 July 2009|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the second series [[Elizabeth Day]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' described ''Bigipedia'' as, "a hilariously mad portrayal of information overload in the computer age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jul/17/rewind-radio-phone-hacking-coverage|title=Rewind radio: Today; The World at One; PM; Richard Bacon; Ambridge Extra; Bigipedia – review|publisher=''[[The Observer]]''|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181021/http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/jul/17/rewind-radio-phone-hacking-coverage| archivedate= 18 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clare Heal in the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' gave a mixed review, saying that while she found it amusing, it was too similar to the Internet saying, "The programme's only failing was that on occasion it was a little to [sic] reminiscent of the real Internet, ie a virtual ocean full of morons willing to shout loudly about things even (or perhaps especially) if they know nothing about them. You wouldn't want more than half an hour of ''Bigipedia'', no matter how amusing it is."&lt;ref name="Express"/&gt;

[[File:Manglawar Stupa.JPG|thumb|Shakhorai Buddha]]
[[Manglawar]] (or Manglor) valley in Pakistan is situated about 9 Km to North East of [[Mingora]], at the point where a number of side valleys descend from the watershed range to the east. The valley has a number of Buddhist [[Relief sculpture|reliefs]] and sculptures, the best known of which is the Shakhorai Buddha.

== The valley's archaeological importance ==

The Swat Valley contained a large number of monasteries, forming a sacred landscape where images, sculptures and inscriptions welcomed pilgrims as they entered the valley.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1"&gt;(13 July, 2018). [https://tribune.com.pk/story/1756539/1-buddha-statue-restored-swat/ Buddha Statue Restored in Swat]. [[The Express Tribune]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that the valley is the site of [[Oddiyana]], a small medieval kingdom that played a crucial role in the development and dissemination of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and the homeland of the sages [[Indrabhuti|Indrabhūti]] and [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;Filigenzi, Anna (2015). [https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/art-and-landscape Buddhist Rock Sculptures of Late Antiqe Swat/Uddiyana]. Pub: VÖAW. {{ISBN|978-3-7001-7241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one enters the sub-valley of Manglawar its importance is immediately revealed with the huge and well known rock relief of the '''Shakhorai Buddha'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Tucci |G. Tucci]], ''Preliminary report on an archelogical survey in Swat,'' East and West, vol. 9, P:306&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of sub-valley Manglawar can be judged from the accounts of [[Aurel Stein|Sir. Aural Stein]], he says:
{{blockquote|Of all the Buddhist relieves found on the rock near Manglawar and miles up the valley the colossal image of a seated Buddha some thirteen feet in height is certainly the most striking. It is carved on the vertical face of a high reddish rock, high above the narrow terrace at its foot, and is a well-executed piece of work. This position, while it had saved the relievo from damage by pious vandals, has at the same time made it distinctly difficult to photograph. The hands of the true believers much often have itched as they saw this benign-faced heathen idol looking down towards Manglawar from its heights of some three hundred feet above Shakhorai hamlet"''”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurel Stein|A.Stein]], ''On Alexender track to Indus'', (1972), P:77-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139923538&amp;cid=CBO9781139923538A018 X - Buddhist Remains about Saidu and Manglawar]  pp. 72-80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This valley has much potential of Buddhist sacred areas, inscriptions and rock reliefs. Four areas were most of reliefs are concentrated have already been reported, among them are:
* Shaldara
* Kalkata
* [[Banjot, Swat|Banjot]]
* Jahanabad
* Nangriyal

This valley has a great potential for archeological antiquities and shows a number of Buddhist sacred areas. Kharosti inscriptions and rock reliefs. However, more numerous are the new discoveries of rock carvings at ''Shaldara'', ''Kalkata'', ''[[Banjot, Swat|Banjot]]'', ''Taghwan'' and of ''Nangriyal'' locations.

== Shaldara ==
The Shaldara sub-valley, enclosed by the surrounding mountains, slowly descends towards the plan of Manglawar. The rock carving is situated on the right side of ''Shaldara Khwar''. It is just below the Boy’s Primary School while the Girls Primary School is on the northeast. Following are the details of the rock engravings.

In [[First Battle of Swat|2007]] the Taliban tried to destroy the head of the relief with explosives, although ultimately only the top part of the Buddha’s head was damaged. The carving has since been restored by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Swat. A coating was applied to protect the damaged part of the carving in 2012, and next the face was restored in [[3D reconstruction|3D]] using laser surveys and old photographs. Finally, it was physically restored using parts of the original that had been picked up off the valley floor. The restoration was completed in October 2016, deliberately leaving some of the damage visible.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Ali, Syed (January 24, 2018).

The '''Carinthian dialect group''' (''koroška narečna skupina'', ''koroščina''&lt;ref name="Logar"&gt;Logar, Tine. 1996. ''Dialektološke in jezikovnozgodovinske razprave''. Ljubljana: SAZU.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}) is a group of closely related dialects of [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. The Carinthian dialects are spoken by [[Carinthian Slovenes]] in Austria, in [[Slovenian Carinthia]], and in the northwestern parts of [[Slovenian Styria]] along the upper [[Drava]] Valley, in the westernmost areas of [[Upper Carniola]] on the border with [[Italy]], and in some villages in the [[Province of Udine]] in Italy.

==Phonological and morphological characteristics==
Among other features, this group is characterized by late denasalization of *''ę'' and *''ǫ'', a close reflex of long [[yat]] and open reflex of short [[yat]], lengthening of old acute syllables and short neo-acute syllables, and an ''e''-like reflex of the long semivowel and ''ə''-like reflex of the short semivowel.&lt;ref&gt;Toporišič, Jože. 1992. ''Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika''. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caucasian Front''' ({{lang-ru|Кавказский фронт}}) also called '''Caucasus Front''' or the '''Caucasian [[Mujahadeen]]''', was formally established in May 2005 as an Islamic structural unit of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]'s armed forces by the decree of the [[separatism|separatist]] [[President of Chechnya]] [[Abdul-Halim Sadulayev]] during the [[Second Chechen War]].

==History==
The organisation united various rebel Jamaat groups across the [[North Caucasus]], including the [[Ingush Jamaat]], [[Shariat Jamaat]], [[Yarmuk Jamaat]] and [[Kataib al-Khoul]], to fight the [[Russia]]n rule not only in Chechnya but also in the rest of the Russian Caucasus. It was led by a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] commander [[Shamil Basayev]] until his death in July 2006 and since then by an ethnic [[Ingush people|Ingush]] [[Akhmed Yevloyev]]. Yevloyev was captured alive in June 2010. In October 2007 the Caucasian Front was subsumed into the [[Caucasus Emirate]], a self declared Islamic State that claims the North Caucasus of Russia.

While the anti-[[Russia]]n local [[insurgencies]] in [[North Caucasus]] started even before the formal creation of the Caucasian Front, two months after [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s death, the new Chechen separatist leader Abdul-Halim Sadulayev officially announced that they had formed a Caucasus Front within the framework of "reforming the system of military-political power." Along with the existing Chechen, [[Dagestan]]i and [[Ingushetia|Ingush]] "sectors", the [[Stavropol Krai|Stavropol]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria|Kabardin-Balkar]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Karachay–Cherkessia|Karachai-Circassian]], [[Ossetia]]n and [[Republic of Adygea|Adyghe]] jamaats were included in it, meaning that in theory most the regions of the south-west Russia's would be involved in hostilities. In October 2006, [[Dokku Umarov]] established two new fronts beyond the North Caucasus region – the [[Volga Region|Volga]] and the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] fronts.&lt;ref name=regroup&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39717&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=2a682e941925edf0f6d60cad3c46ac1b North Caucasus Conflict Spreads to Tatarstan], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 2 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Chechen separatist movement had taken on a new role as the official [[ideology|ideological]], [[logistics|logistical]] and, probably, financial hub of the new insurgency in the North Caucasus. Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local rebels continue in Dagestan and Ingushetia, while sporadic fighting erupts in the other southern Russia regions. Before the declaration of the [[Caucasus Emirate]], the movement had conducted two-large scale attacks, the [[2004 Nazran raid]] in Ingushetia (before the formal proclamation) and the [[2005 Nalchik raid]] in Kabardino-Balkaria. The movement also launched many smaller attacks such as the [[2006 Avtury ambush]] &amp; [[2007 Zhani-Vedeno ambush]].

==List of attacks==
*[[2004 Nazran raid]] (before the formal proclamation): 87 killed
*[[2005 Nalchik raid]]: 138 killed
*[[2006 Avtury ambush]]: 7 killed
*[[2007 Zhani-Vedeno ambush]]: 5 killed

The '''coins of Lundy''' are two unofficial issues of [[currency]] from the island of [[Lundy]], in the [[Bristol Channel]] off the west coast of [[England]]. In 1969 [[Jack Hayward]], a British millionaire, purchased the island for £150,000 and gave it to the British people.&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bruce, Colin R | title=Unusual World Coins | edition=2nd | publisher=Krause Publications | isbn=0-87341-116-1 | page=150 | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The coin issue of 1929 ==

The first issue was issued in 1929 by the self-declared 'King of Lundy', [[Martin Coles Harman]], who was an English businessman,  born 1885, Steyning, Sussex, who bought Lundy in 1925. There were two coins – the Half [[Puffin]] and the One Puffin,&lt;ref name="Purvey"&gt;{{cite book | author=Purvey, Frank | year=1963 | title=Collecting Coins | publisher=W. &amp; G. Foyle | page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were rated at the same nominal value as the British [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] and [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny]]. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the coins depict a portrait facing left with  'MARTIN.COLES.HARMAN'. The edges of the coins are lettered with the inscription 'LUNDY LIGHTS AND LEADS', a reference to the island's two [[lighthouse]]s. The reverse of the Half Puffin coin depicts a [[puffin]]'s head; half a Puffin. The reverse of the One Puffin coin depicts a puffin facing left on a rocky ledge. The unfussy and strong design of the coins is regarded as more than competent with significant modernist touches which foresee the high 1930s design school. The currency was called the puffin because the islanders had a long history of bartering puffin feathers for food and other commodities. The coins were made of [[bronze]], and landed Harman in trouble with the British authorities in 1930 for unauthorised [[mint (coin)|mint]]ing of [[money]].&lt;ref name="Boundy"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boundy, Wyndham S | year=1961 | title=Bushell and Harman of Lundy | publisher=Bideford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Agostini"&gt;{{cite book | author=De Agostini | year=2000 | title=Coins of the World | pages=327–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krause"&gt;{{numis cite SCWC | date=1980 |pages=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors from the island could exchange any remaining 'puffins' at the banks in Bideford, who then returned the Lundy coins to the island (Coin News 1999).  The coins were struck in [[Birmingham]] by [[Birmingham Mint|Ralph Heaton's Mint, Birmingham Ltd]]. The currency saw real, if limited use. Martin Coles Harman died in 1954.

50,000 bronze tokens about the size of a penny were minted by Ralph Heaton &amp; Sons, Birmingham in 1929, together with a similar number of articles about the size of a half-penny. The price was 50/9 per 1000 for the larger and 26/6 for the smaller, and there was a £100 fee for preparing the design and sinking the dies.&lt;ref name="Krause"/&gt;

Bronze pattern coins of the 1929 issue exist with a thicker flange and the lack of an edge inscription. The details on the obverse and reverse also differ slightly. The coins remain highly collectible to this day.

== The court cases ==
Harman had sent specimen coins to the [[Royal Mint]] and had been thanked for them, although they had warned him about Section 5 of the [[Coinage Act 1870|Coinage Act of 1870]]. Harman replied that Lundy was ''a little Kingdom in the British Empire, but out of England.'' He recognised [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] as the head of state, however he was adamant that Lundy was a  self-governing [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]]. This led to a visit from the Devon Constabulary and a Supt. Bolt and other officers reported seeing the coins (tokens) in use at the Marisco Tavern, mixed with standard British Imperial coinage. Harman lost his case at the Petty Sessions in Bideford and appealed to the [[High Court of Justice]] where he also lost and was fined £5, with fifteen guineas (£15 15s) costs.&lt;ref name="Boundy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Matthews, David | date=May 1999 | title=Eccentric Issues | journal=Coin News | issn=0958-1391 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some details of the court cases===
Sir Hugh N. Grenville Stucley was the presiding magistrate at the Petty Sessional Division court which tried the case of Supt. Bolt on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Martin Coles Harman, charged with on the 5th day of March, 1930, in the Island of [[Lundy]] in the County of Devon, did unlawfully as a token for money issue a piece of metal to the value of one half-penny, contrary to Section 5 of the Coinage Act of 1870.

The appeal trial was held on 13 January 1931 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, in London, and, it was hoped at the time, would settle the status of Lundy once and for all. It didn't – but it did show how utterly confused the situation was. In his defence, Mr Harman said he had every right to mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was "a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion," out of the realm for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port. The Attorney General, who was prosecuting Mr Harman, said that Lundy was surely a Utopia but that its inhabitants would be just as happy if the face of King George V, rather than of Mr Harman, were depicted on the place's currency. (Mr Harman's face was on the front of the coins, and that of a puffin on the back. There were two denominations, a one-puffin coin and a half-puffin coin, neatly convertible to a penny and a ha'penny at the legal rate of exchange.)&lt;ref name="Sack"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sack, John |authorlink=John Sack |year=2000 |title=[[Report From Practically Nowhere]] | isbn=0-595-08918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time (America) report for Monday, January 20th, 1930===
{{quote|Coins denominated the puffin and half-puffin—respectively worth a British penny and half-penny—have just gone into circulation among the 40 dwellers on Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel, also called "Puffin Island." Both half and whole puffins bear the likeness of Martin Coles Harman, Esq., London merchant, who bought Puffin Island in 1925 and plays at being its king. On the "tails" side of a puffin is the head of a puffin (sea bird with a parrotlike beak and white cheeks). Puffin Islanders also have puffin stamps. Red and green, in puffin and half-puffin denominations, each having a handsome steel engraving of a puffin perched on a rock.}}

== The 1965 issue of Lundy coinage ==
In 1965, a second issue of coins, made by John Pinches, was carried out. These were a [[:Category:Commemorative coins|commemorative issue]] to commemorate the 40th anniversary of [[Martin Coles Harman]]'s purchase of [[Lundy]]. The coins are of the same design as the 1929 issue coins, but have plain edges and the 1965 date. They were struck in [[Proof coinage|Proof]] sets, in [[bronze]], [[nickel]]-[[brass]], and [[gold]]. They were issued in a special case of which at least two varieties exist. 3000 of the base metal sets were issued and 25 of the gold sets. Apart from the sets, 25 each of the proof gold denominations were also issued for presentation purposes.&lt;ref name="Bruce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krause"/&gt; It has been reported that Lundy puffin forgeries may exist. This seems unlikely and it may be that confusion with the 'pattern coins' or between the 1929 and 1965 issues has resulted in an erroneous interpretation.  Unlike the 1929 issues, which did circulate, these are generally not considered numismatic items.

==1977 coins==
In 1977 Queen Elizabeth II visited Lundy Island as part of the celebrations of her [[Silver Jubilee]]. 1,977 Puffin and half Puffin proof grade copper tokens have been produced bearing this date. The designs are very similar if not identical to the 1929 and 1965 issues, however they do not carry the edge inscription. It is not clear when they were minted as they only came on to the numismatic market in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;The Phoenix, BK1419. 2014. Published : Coincraft. Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 coins==
A set of five 'fantasy' Lundy coins were put on sale in 2011. These five coins are dated 2011 and are in the Puffin denominations: half, one, two, four and six P. This set is distinct since only half and one puffin coins had been issued in the past. They carry the same edge inscription as the original 1929 coins, though the inscription is [[incuse]] rather than raised and a similar, less boldly engraved portrait of Martin Coles Harman. The half and one P are copper plated brass, the two and four are in a brass and the six P is copper nickel. The half and one puffin coins are smaller in size. The 1929 &amp; 1965 puffin is 29.29mm whilst the 2011 puffin is 27.3mm. &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces18005.html Retrieved : 2018-10-29&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catawiki.com/catalog/tokens-medals/types/fantasy-coins/5125392-lundy-1-puffin-2011-copper-plated-brass-prooflike] Retrieved : 2018-10-29&lt;/ref&gt; The half puffins are nearly identical in size. The two P has two puffins flying, the four P a Lundy lighthouse, and the six P has Tresco Castle on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofcoins.eu/forum/index.php?topic=11726.0 World of Coins] Retrieved : 2011-09-29&lt;/ref&gt; The six P coin has a reeded edge and is crown size. The quality of these coins is quite high.

== Thomas Bushell and coins of the Civil War ==
Another possible coinage connection exists through the activities of one [[Thomas Bushell (mining engineer)|Thomas Bushell]], friend of [[Francis Bacon]], a strong supporter of the Royalist cause during the [[First English Civil War]] and an expert on mining and coining. It has been argued that during his stay on Lundy he produced coinage for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], however definitive proof has not been found and it remains speculation. He held Lundy for the King and this was the last part of the king's lands to capitulate to the victorious Parliamentary forces after a siege lasting a year.&lt;ref name="Boundy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seaby"&gt;{{cite book | author=Seaby, Peter | year=1985 | title=The Story of British Coinage | publisher=Seaby | isbn=0-900652-74-8 | page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ColumbiaStahrArtwork.jpg|thumb|Personified Columbia in [[American flag]] gown and [[Phrygian cap]], which signifies freedom and the pursuit of liberty, from a [[World War I]] patriotic poster]]
'''Columbia''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|b|i|ə}}; {{respell|kə|LUM|bee-ə}}) is the [[personification]] of the [[United States]]. It was also a historical name used by some Europeans and Americans to describe the [[Americas]], the [[New World]]. It is also a name given to the "Spirit of the Frontier", used to illustrate [[manifest destiny]], among several other [[politics of the United States|American political causes]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It has given rise to the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions and companies; for example: [[Columbia University]], the [[District of Columbia]] (the national capital of the United States), and the ship ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'', which would give its name to the [[Columbia River]]. Images of the [[Statue of Liberty]] largely displaced [[anthropomorphism|personified]] Columbia as the female symbol of the United States by around 1920, although Lady Liberty was seen as an aspect of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Dewey|title=The Art of Ill Will: The Story of American Political Cartoons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNI9046BaRAC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2007|publisher=New York University Press|page=13|isbn=9780814719855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District of Columbia is named after the personification, as is the traditional patriotic hymn "[[Hail Columbia]]", which is the official vice presidential anthem of the [[United States Vice President]].

Columbia is a [[New Latin]] [[Toponymy|toponym]] in use since the 1730s for the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. It originated from the name of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] and from the ending ''-ia'', common in Latin names of countries (paralleling [[Britannia]], [[Gallia]], and others).

Massachusetts Chief Justice [[Samuel Sewall]] used the name Columbina (not Columbia) for the New World in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Schlereth, "Columbia, Columbus, and Columbianism" in ''The Journal of American History'', v. 79, no. 3 (1992), 939&lt;/ref&gt; The name Columbia for America first appeared in 1738&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=5&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1738.6.x.8.x.x.285a ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BaxpalYegj0C&amp;pg=PA159 Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Dec. 1885, pp. 159–65]&lt;/ref&gt; in the weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament in [[Edward Cave]]'s ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]''. Publication of Parliamentary debates was technically illegal, so the debates were issued under the thin disguise of ''Reports of the Debates of the Senate of Lilliput'' and fictitious names were used for most individuals and placenames found in the record. Most of these were transparent anagrams or similar distortions of the real names and some few were taken directly from [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]] while'' a few others were classical or neoclassical in style. Such were Ierne for Ireland, Iberia for Spain, Noveborac for New York (from [[Eboracum]], the Roman name for [[York]]) and Columbia for America—at the time used in the sense of "European colonies in the New World".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR13 ''Debates in Parliament'', Samuel Johnson.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was perhaps first coined by [[Samuel Johnson]], thought to have been the author of an introductory essay (in which Columbia already appears) which explained the conceit of substituting Lilliputian for English names; Johnson also wrote down the ''Debates'' from 1740 to 1743.  The name continued to appear in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' until December 1746.  Columbia seems an obvious [[calque]] on America,{{who says|date=November 2018}} substituting the base of the surname of the discoverer [[Christopher Columbus]] for the base of the given name of the somewhat less well-known [[Amerigo Vespucci]].{{fact|date=November 2018}} As the debates of Parliament, many of whose decisions directly affected the colonies, were distributed and closely followed in the British colonies in America, the name Columbia would have been familiar to the United States' founding generation.

In the second half of the 18th century, the American colonists were creating their own identity distinct from that of their British cousins. At that time, it was common for European countries to use a Latin name in formal or poetical contexts to confer an additional degree of respectability on the country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. "[[Gallia]]" for France, "[[Helvetia]]" for Switzerland, "[[Lusitania]]" for Portugal, "[[Caledonia]]" for Scotland, and "[[Hibernia]]" for [[Ireland]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, these nations were personified as pseudo-classical goddesses named with these Latin names. Located on a continent unknown to and unnamed by the Romans, Columbia was the closest that the Americans could come to emulating this custom.

By the time of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], the name Columbia had lost the comic overtone of its Lilliputian origins and had become established as an alternative, or poetic name for America. While the name America is necessarily scanned with four syllables, according to 18th-century rules of English versification Columbia was normally scanned with three, which is often more metrically convenient. For instance, the name appears in a collection of complimentary poems written by Harvard graduates in 1761 on the occasion of the marriage and coronation of King George III.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_P1v1mqnsOYC&amp;pg=PA310 Hoyt, Albert. "The Name 'Columbia'", ''The New England Historical &amp; Genealogical Register'', July 1886, pp. 310–13.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Behold, Britannia! in thy favour'd Isle;
:At distance, thou, Columbia! view thy Prince,
:For ancestors renowned, for virtues more;&lt;ref&gt;''Pietas et Gratulatio Collegii Cantabrigiensis apud Novanglos'', no. xxix. Boston, Green and Russell, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Columbia rapidly came to be applied to a variety of items reflecting American identity. A ship built in Massachusetts in 1773 received the name ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'' and it later became famous as an exploring ship and lent its name to new Columbias.

No serious consideration was given to using the name Columbia as an official name for the independent United States,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} but with independence the name became popular and was given to many [[Columbia County (disambiguation)|counties]], [[Columbia Township (disambiguation)|townships]], and towns as well as other institutions.
* In 1784, the former King's College in New York City had its name changed to [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], which became the nucleus of the present-day Ivy League [[Columbia University]].
* In 1786, [[South Carolina]] gave the name Columbia to [[Columbia, South Carolina|its new capital city]]. Columbia is also the name of at least nineteen other towns in the United States.
* In 1791, three commissioners appointed by President George Washington named the area destined for the seat of the United States government the Territory of Columbia. It was subsequently (1801) organized as the [[District of Columbia]].
* In 1792, the ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'' sailing ship gave its name to the [[Columbia River]] in the American Northwest (much later, the ''Rediviva'' would give its name to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]])
* In 1798, [[Joseph Hopkinson]] wrote lyrics for [[Philip Phile]]'s 1789 inaugural "President's March" under the new title of "[[Hail, Columbia]]". Once used as ''de facto'' national anthem of the United States, it is now used as the entrance march of the [[Vice President of the United States]].
* In 1865 [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', the spacecraft to the moon was fired from a giant [[Columbiad#In fiction|Columbiad]] cannon.

In part, the more frequent usage of the name Columbia reflected a rising American [[neoclassicism]], exemplified in the tendency to use Roman terms and symbols. The selection of the [[Bald eagle|eagle]] as the [[national bird]], the [[eagle (heraldry)#United States|heraldric use of the eagle]], the use of the term [[United States Senate|Senate]] to describe the [[upper house]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the naming of [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] and the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] were all conscious evocations of Roman precedents.

The adjective Columbian has been used to mean "of or from the United States of America", for instance in the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. It has occasionally been proposed as an [[Alternative words for American|alternative word for American]].

Columbian should not be confused with the adjective [[pre-Columbian]], referring to a time period before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492.

== Personification ==
[[File:ColumbiaHerselfSmall.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Personification]] of Columbia from a [[Columbia Records]] [[phonograph cylinder]] package]]
As a quasi-mythical figure, Columbia first appears in the poetry of African-American [[Phillis Wheatley]] starting in 1776 during the revolutionary war.
&lt;poem&gt;
:One century scarce perform'd its destined round,
:When Gallic powers Columbia's fury found;
:And so may you, whoever dares disgrace
:The land of freedom's heaven-defended race!
:Fix'd are the eyes of nations on the scales,
:For in their hopes Columbia's arm prevails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcol.umass.edu/academics/poetsofnewengland/wheatley.html Selections from Phillis Wheatley ''Poems and Letters''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060908153655/http://www.comcol.umass.edu/academics/poetsofnewengland/wheatley.html |date=2006-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Especially in the 19th century, Columbia was visualized as a [[Liberty (goddess)|goddess-like]] female [[national personification]] of the United States and of liberty itself, comparable to the British [[Britannia]], the Italian [[Italia Turrita]] and the French [[Marianne]], often seen in political cartoons of the 19th and early 20th century.  This personification was sometimes called Lady Columbia or Miss Columbia. Such iconography usually personified America in the form of an Indian queen or Native American princess.&lt;ref name=Virginia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/liberty/origins.html |title=
Origins: The Female Form as Allegory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StatuePacificCemetery.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Columbia at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]]
The image of the personified Columbia was never fixed, but she was most often presented as a woman between youth and middle age, wearing classically-draped garments decorated with stars and stripes. A popular version gave her a red-and-white-striped dress and a blue blouse, shawl, or sash, spangled with white stars. Her headdress varied and sometimes it included feathers reminiscent of a Native American headdress while other times it was a [[laurel wreath]], but most often it was a [[cap of liberty]].

[[File:WWI early Purple Heart issue.jpg|thumb|Lady Columbia recognized World War I [[Doughboy]] soldier as having suffered injury due to his willingness to serve humanity]]
Early in World War I (1914–1918) the image of Columbia standing over a kneeling "Doughboy" was issued in lieu of the Purple Heart Medal.  She gave "to her son the accolade of the new chivalry of humanity" for injuries sustained in "the" World War.

[[File:Columbia Calls - Enlist Now for U.S. Army - Halsted - Aderente.jpg|thumb|Columbia Calls – Enlist Now for U.S. Army, World War I recruitment poster by [[Vincent Aderente]]]]
In World War I, the name Liberty Bond for savings bonds was heavily publicized, often with images from the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The personification of Columbia fell out of use and she was largely replaced by the Statue of Liberty as a feminine symbol of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Nye|title=American Technological Sublime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrdbOJFxWIoC&amp;pg=PA266|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|page=266|isbn=9780262640343}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Columbia Pictures]] adopted Columbia as its [[Columbia Pictures#Logo|logo]] in 1924, she appeared (and still appears) bearing a torch—similar to the Statue of Liberty and unlike 19th-century depictions of Columbia.

Statues of the personified Columbia may be found among others in the following places.
* The 1863 [[Statue of Freedom]] atop the [[United States Capitol]] building, though not actually called Columbia, shares many of her iconic characteristics.&lt;ref name="hail-columbia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hailcolumbia.us/about-us/about-columbia/ | title=Hail Columbia | publisher=Hail Columbia | accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia-literata"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.orderwhitemoon.org/goddess/Columbia%20Level%203%20Project.htm | title=Columbia | publisher=The Order of the White Moon Goddess Gallery | year=2011 | accessdate=February 2, 2013 | author=Literata | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024080034/http://orderwhitemoon.org/goddess/Columbia%20Level%203%20Project.htm | archivedate=October 24, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Atop Philadelphia's [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], built 1876
* The replica [[Statue of the Republic]] (Golden Lady) in Chicago's [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] is often understood to be Columbia. It is one of the remaining icons of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]].
* In the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]], dedicated 1949.
* In the [[Angola, Indiana#The Monument|Monument]] of [[Angola, Indiana]].

Dick|title=The Merchant Prince of Poverty Row: Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CBS]]'s former legal name was the Columbia Broadcasting System, first used in 1928. The name derived from an investor, the Columbia Phonograph Manufacturing Company, owner of Columbia Records.
* The [[Command Module]] of the [[Apollo 11]] spacecraft, the first manned mission to land on the Moon, was called ''Columbia'' (1969).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Conceptual physics''' is an approach to teaching [[physics]] that focuses on the ideas of physics rather than the often daunting mathematics. It is believed that with a strong [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] foundation in physics, students are better equipped to understand the equations and formulas of physics, and to make connections between the concepts of physics and their everyday life. Early versions used almost no equations or math-based problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hewett |first=Paul G. |title=Conceptual Physics |edition=5th |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1985 |isbn=0-316-35974-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul G. Hewitt]] popularized this approach with his textbook ''Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment'' in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment|publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review at the time, Kenneth Ford noted the emphasis on logical reasoning and said "Hewitt's excellent book can be called physics without equations, or physics without computation, but not physics without mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Kenneth W.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to Your Environment|journal=Physics Today|date=October 1971|volume=24|issue=10|pages=54–55|doi=10.1063/1.3022390|bibcode = 1971PhT....24j..54H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt's wasn't the first book to take this approach. ''Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion'' by Jae R. Ballif and William E. Dibble was published in 1969.&lt;ref name="BallifDibble1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballif|first1=Jae R.|author2=William E. Dibble|title=Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zq7vAAAAMAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Hewitt's book became very successful. As of 2014 it is in its twelfth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewett|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics|year=2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-321-90910-7|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Hewitt wrote a version for high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: The High School Physics Program|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-133-64749-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of the conceptual approach to teaching physics broadened the range of students taking physics in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hehn|first=Jack|author2=Michael Neuschatz|title=Physics For All? A Million and Counting!|journal=Physics Today|volume=59|issue=2|date=February 2006|pages=37–43|doi=10.1063/1.2186280|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/million.pdf|bibcode = 2006PhT....59b..37H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrollment in conceptual physics courses in high school grew from 25,000 students in 1987 to over 400,000 in 2009. In 2009, 37% of students took high school physics, and 31% of them were in Physics First, conceptual physics courses, or regular physics courses using a conceptual textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Susan|author2=Casey Langer Tesfaye|title=High School Physics Courses and Enrollments|journal=Focus On|date=August 2010|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/highschool3.pdf|publisher=American Institute of Physics Statistical Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to teaching physics has also inspired books for science literacy courses, such as ''From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness'' by Sadri Hassani.&lt;ref name="Hassani2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hassani|first=Sadri|title=From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oypZ_a9pqdsC|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0849-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39340">In 1975 the Japanese government added a new chapter to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950) to provide for "traditional techniques or craftsmanship that are indispensable to the preservation of cultural property and for which preservation measures shall be taken". Preservation techniques are selected in relation to both [[Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan|tangible]] and [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible]] cultural properties and a holder or preservation body is recognized for each technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/natlaws/media/pdf/japan/japan_law_protectionproperty_entno.pdf |title=Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950, last amendment 2007) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/pdf/h21_chapter_06.pdf |title=Preservation and Utilization of Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |page=41 |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Architectural Preservation in Japan |author=Larsen, Knut Einar |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] International Wood Committee |year=1994 |pages=40f |ISBN=82-519-1432-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the {{nihongo|Selected Conservation Techniques|選定保存技術}}, the government provides funding for and conducts programmes relating to documentation, training, development, promotion and public education. Recognition is thus made and measures taken to combat some of the most serious conservation issues, namely the lack of specialist craftsmen, the loss of knowledge of traditional techniques, and the availability of suitable tools and materials. These issues are of particular relevance in Japan due to the sophistication and inherent susceptibility of much of its art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"/&gt;

The list below is compiled from the database of cultural properties maintained by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], with translations, glosses and listed holders (as of 2004) following those published by the Asia/Pacific Cultural Centre for [[UNESCO]] (ACCU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/index_pc.asp |title=Database of Cultural Properties |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/pdf/2004_Tokyo.pdf |title=2004 Workshop on Inventory-making for Intangible Cultural Heritage Management |publisher=Asia/Pacific Centre for [[UNESCO]] (ACCU) |pages=200–203 |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contract grading''' is a form of grading which results from cooperation between an instructor and his or her student, and entails contracted number of assignments of specified quality that correspond to specific letter grades.{{clarification needed|date=January 2016}} Contract grading may be contrasted with other [[Grade (education)|grading]] methods, such as grading on a curve or percentile systems.{{How|date=January 2016}}

==Overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In traditional grading, educators determine assignments, [[exams]], and [[projects]] before the course begins. Students are expected to follow the [[syllabus]] and complete the tasks presented. The grade the student receives is a reflection of how well he or she completed the pre-determined syllabus. In this system, students are expected to follow a path that reflects the syllabus.

However, the contract grading system allows each student to make his or her own path for the class, which allows students to pick and choose which assignments or projects they want to complete. Grades are assigned on the basis of the agreement between the student and the professor.  With contract grading, students have a say in their curriculum, as well as how their grade is ultimately assessed. For some students this grading system requires a more active role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the student decides what is to be accomplished throughout the course, similar to a [[contract]], both the student and professor must come to an agreement.  After students turn in their initial contract or proposal, the teacher may make revisions or require some changes be made before a final agreement is made. Similar to a contract, a contract grade must also be signed by both parties, confirming the agreement for a particular grade.  However, the contract grading system is not as binding as a business contract.  Should the student change his or her mind mid-semester, he or she may re-submit the contract provided the professor approves the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Dr. Scott Alberts, professor at [[Truman State University]], has implemented contract grading in a few of the courses he teaches, including his Junior Interdisciplinary Seminar class and Introductory Interdisciplinary class. While students have the freedom to choose which assignments they will complete, Dr. Alberts does implement some constraints. The contract used in his course consists of both required components, as well as optional components.  The required number of additional "optional" assignments for each letter grade is also clearly established.

For example, students must earn at least 10 +'s on required and optional assignments in order to receive an A in the class.  Therefore, students are able to decide what letter grade they wish to receive in the course and accordingly complete the additional, optional assignments that may warrant a certain number of +'s leading them toward their desired grade. That quality is also an intrinsic part of Dr. Alberts’ contract system because quantity alone cannot achieve the grade. Students, in addition to choosing the grade they desire and how many assignments they will complete, must also commit themselves to the completion of their contract.  Once the student determines the number of works he or she chooses to complete, contracts are then signed and agreed upon.  There is a [[grace period]] for changing of contracts, but it is ultimately up to the professor to accept or to reject any proposals.  The student then has the responsibility to complete and turn in the contracted assignments, with a few deadlines to meet.

==Student reaction==
A study published in 1990 received opinions about the contract grading system from 51 undergraduate education majors and 28 graduate students majoring in education at [[Acadia University]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].  Students at both education levels reacted to the contract grading system in a positive manner.  They agreed that the grading system and assignments were made clear from the beginning, that the system was appropriate, and that grades were assigned fairly. When asked to rank the effectiveness and importance of the various aspects of contract grading, students reported that the key elements were the control they felt they had by being able to determine their grades, the clearly stated expectations for performance in the course, criterion referencing of assignments, and the mastery approach to learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Contract grading can enable the student to progress at his or her own pace. In addition to placing time management more fully in the hands of the student, contract grading can also emphasize learning and reduce grade competition. Systems of this style also encourage a cooperative learning process.  By requiring instructor and student to work jointly, emphasis is added on the desires of the student and the goals he or she wishes to accomplish. According to Bucknell University, contract grading "facilitates the development of a partnership learning environment in which students are likely to retain more information, make better use of information, and be more highly motivated to learn than in teacher-directed learning environments." Due to the freedom allowed by the system, time management skills are acquired and exercised.

==Disadvantages==
Contract grading could be viewed as threatening to students who have relied upon structured grading processes.  Increased responsibility may cause anxiety for students expecting more common approaches.  In addition to concerns for the individual student, contract grading is largely dependent upon implementation by the instructor.  An instructor may, through this grading system, cause students to take on greater responsibility for learning and success while simultaneously restricting freedom.  Contract grading systems are susceptible to [[paternalism]] on the part of the instructor.  Whereas the students take on the responsibility of choosing assignments, they may not also actively determine expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Duplicating machines''' were the predecessors of modern document-reproduction technology. They have now been replaced by digital duplicators, [[image scanner|scanner]]s, [[laser printer]]s and [[photocopier]]s, but for many years they were the primary means of reproducing documents for limited-run distribution.

Like the [[typewriter]], these machines were products of the second phase of the [[industrial revolution]] which started near the end of the 19th century (also called the [[Second Industrial Revolution]])&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.northwestern.edu/jmokyr/files/2016/06/The-Second-Industrial-Revolution-1870-1914-Aug-1998-1ubah7s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This second phase brought to mass markets technologies like the small electric motors and the products of industrial chemistry without which the duplicating machines would not have been economical.  By bringing greatly increased quantities of paperwork to daily life, the duplicating machine and the [[typewriter]] gradually changed the forms of the office [[desk]] and transformed the nature of [[office]] work.

They were often used in [[school]]s, churches, and small organizations, where revolutionarily economical copying was in demand for the production of newsletters and worksheets.  Self-publishers also used these machines to produce [[fanzine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://p-dpa.net/tech/spirit-duplicator/ | title=Spirit Duplicator | accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mimeo.jpg|frame|Mimeograph machine&lt;br&gt;stencil duplicator]] --&gt;

A few alternatives to hand copying were invented between the mid-17th century and the late 18th century, but none had a significant impact in offices.

==Polygraphs==
In document duplication (as opposed to [[Polygraph|law enforcement]] and such), a '''[[Polygraph (duplicating device)|Polygraph]]''' is a mechanical device that moves a second pen parallel to one held by a writer, enabling the writer to make a duplicate of a document as it is written. Polygraphs appeared in the 17th century but did not become popular until 1800.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Hawkins &amp; Peale patented a polygraph in the US in 1803, and beginning in 1804 Thomas Jefferson collaborated with them in working on improvements in the machine. He used a polygraph for the rest of his life. However, polygraphs were not practical for most office purposes and were never widely used in businesses. Hawkins &amp; Peale lost money producing polygraphs. The problem was their "inherent instability, and constant need for repair and adjustment."

==Letter copying presses==


[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1951S00088.00001(1).jpg|thumb|A James Watt &amp; Co. copying press, in [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]]. ]]

[[File:Kopierpresse.jpg|thumb|Iron letter copying press, late 19th century, Germany]]
In 1780 [[James Watt]] obtained a patent for '''letter copying presses''', which James Watt &amp; Co. produced beginning in that year. Letter copying presses were used by the early 1780s by the likes of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[George Washington]], [[Henry Cavendish]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. In 1785, Jefferson was using both stationary and portable presses made by James Watt &amp; Co.

Using letter copying presses, copies could be made up to twenty-four hours after a letter was written, though copies made within a few hours were best. A copying clerk would begin by counting the number of master letters to be written during the next few hours and by preparing the copying book. Suppose the clerk wanted to copy 20 one-page letters. In that case, he would insert a sheet of oiled paper into the copying book in front of the first tissue on which he wanted to make a copy of a letter. He would then turn 20 sheets of tissue paper and insert a second oiled paper. To dampen the tissue paper, the clerk used a brush or copying paper damper. The damper had a reservoir for water that wet a cloth, and the clerk wiped the cloth over the tissues on which copies were to be made. As an alternative method of dampening the tissue paper, in 1860 Cutter, Tower &amp; Co., Boston, advertised Lynch's patent paper moistener.

Then letters were written with special copying ink which was not blotted.  The copying clerk arranged the portion of the letter book to be used in the following sequence starting from the front: a sheet of oiled paper, then a sheet of letter book tissue, then a letter placed face up against the back of the tissue on which the copy was to be made, then another oiled paper, etc.

Prior to the introduction of inks made with [[aniline dyes]] in 1856, the quality of copies made on letter copying presses was limited by the properties of the available copying inks. Some documents that were to be copied with copying presses were written with copying pencils rather than copying ink. The cores of copying pencils, which appear to have been introduced in the 1870s, were made from a mixture of graphite, clay, and aniline dye.

By the late 1870s, an improved method for moistening pages in copying books had been invented, and by the late 1880s it had been widely adopted. Rather than using a brush or damper to wet the tissues, the clerk inserted a thin moist cloth or pad between each oil paper and the following tissue.

In the late 1880s, adoption of improvements in office systems for filing unbound documents increased the demand for copying machines that made unbound copies of letters, as opposed to copies in bound books. In 1886, Schlicht &amp; Field of Rochester, N.Y., introduced the Rapid Roller Damp-Leaf Copier, a '''roller copier''', which used pressure supplied by rollers to copy letters onto a roll of dampened paper. After copies were pressed onto the paper, the paper entered the cabinet under the copier, where it dried on a large roller. An attachment was used to cut dried copies off the roll.

Copies could be made more quickly with a roller copier than with a letter copying press. It was claimed that nearly 100 papers could be copied in two minutes with a roller copier. Roller copiers competed with [[carbon paper]] technology. It was claimed that a roller copier could make a half dozen copies of a [[typewriter|typewritten]] letter if the letter was run through the copier several times. It could make a dozen copies if the letter was written with a pen and good copying ink.

The Process Letter Machine Co. of Muncie, Indiana, offered the New Rotary Copying Press, a '''loose-leaf copier''', in 1902.  This machine was similar to roller copiers but copied onto loose-leaf paper.

==Hectographs==

{{main|Hectograph}}
The [[hectograph]] introduced in 1876 or shortly before, was a technology in which a dye-impregnated master copy, not unlike a ditto master, was laid on top of a cake pan full of firm gelatin. After the dye soaked into the gelatin, sheets of paper could be laid on top of the gelatin to transfer the image. This was good for 50 copies at most. Hectography was slow and clunky, but it could inspire great intrepidity in its users.

While good-quality, reasonably rapid copies from a hectograph require fairly specific materials (Aniline dye is the most effective), passable copies can be produced from a bewildering array of improvised materials on makeshift equipment. Practically speaking, any dye that soaks into the gelatin and can then be drawn out by the available paper will work. This meant that improvised hectography assumed the role of reproducing nearly every sort of censored material from subversive literature to pornography. {{elucidate|date=August 2011}}

==Mimeographs==

{{main|Mimeograph}}
[[File:Mimeograph, 1918.png|right|thumb|250px|1918 illustration of a mimeograph machine.]]
The '''mimeo machine''' (mimeograph) invented by [[Albert Blake Dick]] in 1884 used heavy waxed-paper "stencils" that a pen or a typewriter could cut through.  The stencil was wrapped around the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, which forced [[ink]] out through the cut marks on the stencil. The [[paper]] had a surface texture (like bond paper), and the ink was black and odorless. A person could use special knives to cut stencils by hand, but handwriting was impractical, because any closed loop letterform would cut a hole and thus print as a black blob. The technology was soon refined to control this problem, also allowing the use of [[typewriter]]s to prepare mimeograph masters. If the user put the stencil on the drum wrong-side-out, the copies came out mirror-imaged.

{{main|Spirit duplicator}}
The '''ditto machine''' ([[spirit duplicator]]) sold by Ditto, Inc., used two-ply "spirit masters" or "ditto masters".  The top sheet could be typed, drawn, or written upon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The second sheet was coated with a layer of colored wax. The pressure of writing or typing on the top sheet transferred colored wax to its back side, producing a mirror image of the desired marks. (This acted like a reverse of [[carbon paper]].) The wax-supply sheet was then removed and discarded, and the other sheet (containing the images) was fastened onto the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, with the waxed (back, or reverse-image) side out.

The usual wax color was [[aniline]] purple, a cheap, moderately durable pigment that provided good contrast, though other colors were also available. Unlike mimeo, ditto had the useful ability to print multiple colors in a single pass, which made it popular with cartoonists. Spirit duplicators were incapable of double-sided printing, since the saturation of the paper with solvent inherent to the process would destroy a previously printed image. One well-made ditto master could at most print about 500 copies, far fewer than a mimeo stencil could manage. To produce further copies, an entirely new master would have to be reconstructed in the same way as the original master.

Notoriously, dittoed images would gradually fade with exposure to light{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, limiting their usability for permanent labels and signage. Dittoed copies now pose a serious challenge to [[archivist]]s responsible for document textual and artistic preservation.

==Comparison of mimeographs and spirit duplicators==

Ditto machines and mimeograph machines were competing and complementary technologies during the first half of the 20th century.  Mimeography was in general a more forgiving technology, and still survives in various forms into the 21st century.

Ditto machines required much finer operating tolerances and careful adjustments to operate correctly. Overall print quality of spirit duplicators was frequently poor, though a capable operator could overcome this with careful adjustment of feed rate, pressure, and solvent volume.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

During their heyday, tabletop duplicators of both sorts were the inexpensive and convenient alternatives to conventional typesetting and offset or letterpress printing. They were well suited for the short runs used for school worksheets, church newsletters, and [[amateur press association|apazines]].  Even the least technically minded teachers, professors, clergy, and self-publishers could make use of them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The machines owed most of their popularity to this relative ease of use, and in some cases, to their lack of a requirement for an external power source.

Mimeograph machines predated the spirit duplicator, had a lower cost per impression, superior print quality, finer resolution, and if properly adjusted could be used for multi-pass and double-sided printing. Also, mimeographed images were as durable as the paper they were printed on, and didn't bleach to illegibility if exposed to sunlight, the way that dittoed pages did. A good mimeo master could produce many more copies than the best ditto master.  As with ditto masters, mimeo stencils could be saved and reused for later print jobs.

There are still mimeography enthusiasts in the United States and Canada, and mimeo technology is still in everyday use in the [[Third World]], since many low-cost mimeograph machines do not require electricity to operate.

==Offset duplicators==

In the United States, an [[offset press]] with a sheet size smaller than {{convert|14|x|20|in|cm}} is classified as a duplicator.  In Europe, the distinction is made between presses that have cylinder bearings, and duplicators, which do not.  Duplicators were manufactured by [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberg]] (T-offset), [[American Type Founders]] (Chief and Davidson lines), [[A.B. Dick Company]], and [[Addressograph|Addressograph-Mulitilith]].

==Digital duplicators==
{{Main|Digital duplicator}}
In 1986, the RISO Kagaku Corporation introduced the digital duplicator.  It uses the basic mimeograph technology but improves on it, in that the operator does not have to create the stencil directly. The stencil, called a master, is made by use of a scanner and thermal print head.  A used master is automatically removed and placed in a disposal box, as a new one is created.  This way the operator should not have to touch the used master material that is coated in ink.

There are also cost advantages over a copier at higher volume. For smaller print runs, the main cost is in the master material. This ranges between 40 – 80 cents per master depending on the manufacturer. When spread over 20 or more copies, the cost per copy (2 to 4 cents) is close to photocopiers. But for every additional copy, the average cost decreases.  At 100 prints, the master cost per copy was only 0.4–0.8 cents per copy, and the cost of the paper printed upon will start to dominate.  A master is capable of making 4000–5000 prints, and then a new master easily be made if needed for further copies.

Other manufacturers have adapted the technology including:
*[[Riso Kagaku Corporation]]
*[[Gestetner]]
*[[Ricoh]]
* Duplo

===How digital duplicators work===
Like the mimeo machine, digital duplicators have a stencil (called a master), ink, and drum—but the process is all automated.

# The original is placed on a flat bed scanner or fed through a sheet feed scanner, depending on the model.
# When the start button is pressed, the image is scanned into memory by reflecting light off the original and into a [[charge-coupled device|CCD]].
# The image is burned onto the master material that is coated or laminated on one side, in a series of small holes by the thermal print head.
# As the new master is burning it is stored while the old master is removed.
# There is a clamp plate on the drum that opens by motor. The drum turns and the old master material is fed into the disposal rollers and into the disposal box.
# The new master is fed into the clamp which closes, then the drum is turned, pulling the master onto the drum.
# The outside of the drum is covered in screens and the inside is coated in ink. The screens make sure the ink flow is regulated.
# The paper is fed to the drum, and the ink only comes through the master material where there are holes.
# A pressure roller presses the paper to the drum and transfers the ink to the paper to form the image.
# The paper then exits the machine into an exit tray. The ink is still wet.

The primary goddess revered during Durga Puja is Durga, but her stage and celebrations feature other major deities of Hinduism such as goddess [[Lakshmi]] (goddess of wealth, prosperity), [[Saraswati]] (goddess of knowledge and music), [[Ganesha]] (god of good beginnings) and [[Kartikeya]] (god of war). In the Bengali traditions, the other deities next to her side are considered to be the children of Durga ([[Parvati]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley, David (1988). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hgTOZEyrVtIC Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions]''. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06339-2}}. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu god [[Shiva]], as Durga's husband, is also revered during this festival. The festival begins on the first day with ''Mahalaya'', marking Durga's advent in her battle against evil. Starting with the sixth day (''Sasthi''), the goddess is welcomed, festive Durga worship and celebrations begin in elaborately decorated temples and ''pandals'' hosting the statues.{{sfn|Cynthia Bradley|2012|p=214}}{{sfn| Encyclopedia Britannica | 2015}} Lakshmi and Saraswati are revered on the following days. The festival ends of the tenth day of ''Vijaya Dashami'', when with drum beats of music and chants, Shakta Hindu communities start a procession carrying the colorful clay statues to a river or ocean and immerse them, as a form of goodbye and her return to divine cosmos and Mount Kailash.{{sfn|Cynthia Bradley|2012|p=214}}{{sfn| Encyclopedia Britannica | 2015}}

The festival is an old tradition of Hinduism, though it is unclear how and in which century the festival began. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th century provide guidelines for Durga puja, while historical records suggest royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities since at least the 16th century.{{sfn|Rachel Fell McDermott|2001|pp=172-174}} The prominence of Durga Puja increased during the [[British Raj]] in its provinces of Bengal and Assam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Durga Puja|url=http://online.assam.gov.in/web/durga-puja}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cynthia Bradley|2012|p=214}} Durga Puja is a ten-day festival,{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|1999|p=306}}{{sfn|James G.

In [[West Bengal]], [[Assam|Bihar, Assam]] and [[Tripura]], Durga Puja is also called ''[[Akalbodhan]]'' (অকাল বোধন, "untimely awakening of Durga"), ''Sharadiya Pujo'' ("autumnal worship"), ''Sharodotsab'' ({{lang-bn|শারদোৎসব}}, ("festival of autumn")), ''Maha Pujo'' ("grand puja"), ''Maayer Pujo'' ("worship of the Mother"), ''Durga Pujo'', or merely ''Puja'' or ''Pujo''.

==History==
{{Further|Durga}}
Durga is an ancient deity of Hinduism, according to archeological and textual evidence available. However, the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities since at least the 16th century.{{sfn|Rachel Fell McDermott|2001|pp=172-174}} The 11th or 12th century Jainism text ''Yasatilaka'' by Somadeva mentions a festival and annual dates dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of a Durga Puja.{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=106-108}}
The word ''Durga'', and related terms appear in the Vedic literature, such as in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the ''[[Atharvaveda]]''.&lt;ref name=mmw487&gt;Monier Monier Williams (1899), Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Bloomfield (1906), [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/486/mode/1up A Vedic concordance], Series editor: Charles Lanman, Harvard University Press, page 486;&lt;br /&gt;Example Sanskrit original: "अहन्निन्द्रो अदहदग्निरिन्दो पुरा दस्यून्मध्यंदिनादभीके ।

A key text associated with Durga Puja observations is ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]'', which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely well established before the time this Hindu text was composed, which scholars variously estimate to between 400 and 600 CE.{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|p=77 note 28}}{{Sfn|Coburn|1991|pp=13}}{{Sfn|Coburn|2002|pp=1-7}} The ''Devi Mahatmya'' mythology describes the nature of demonic forces symbolized by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.{{sfn|Alain Daniélou|1991|p=288}}{{sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=215-219}}{{refn|group=note|In the Shakta tradition of Hinduism, many of the stories about obstacles and battles have been considered as metaphors for the divine and demonic within each human being, with liberation being the state of self-understanding whereby a virtuous nature and society emerging victorious over the vicious.{{sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=20-21, 217-219}}}}

Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Epics period of ancient India, that is the centuries around the start of the common era.{{sfn|Rachel Fell McDermott|2001|p=162}} Both [[Yudhisthira]] and [[Arjuna]] characters of the ''Mahabharata'' invoke hymns to ''Durga''.{{sfn|Rachel Fell McDermott|2001|pp=162-163}} She appears in ''Harivamsa'' in the form of Vishnu's eulogy, and in Pradyumna prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in this popular epics may have led to her worship.{{sfn|Rachel Fell McDermott|2001|pp=162-164}}{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=106-108}}{{sfn|David Kinsley|1997|pp=16-22, 30-35}}

The Indian texts that mention the Durga Puja festival are inconsistent. The King Suratha legend found in some version of the [[Purana]]s mention it to be a spring festival, while the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'' and two other Shakta Puranas mention it to be an autumn festival. The more ancient ''Ramayana'' manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of ''Ramayana'' found in North, West and South India describe the Hindu god Rama to be remembering the [[Surya]] (the Sun god) before his battle with the demon Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana such as by the 15th century Krttivasa describe Rama to be worshipping Durga.{{sfn|C. Mackenzie Brown|1990|pp=280 note 50, 274 notes 103, 107, 109-110}}

According to Pranab Bandyopadhyay, the worship of fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation [[Kali]], became very popular in Bengal region during and after the medieval era Muslim invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pranab Bandyopadhyay|title=Mother Goddess Kali|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mVMqAAAAYAAJ|year =1993|publisher =UW Press|isbn=978-81-85328-15-7|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture, states Patricia Monaghan, increased after Islamic armies conquered Indian subcontinent and attempted to deny iconographic representation of its male and female "idols".{{sfn|Patricia Monaghan|2009|pages=151–153}} According to Rachel McDermott, and other scholars such as Brijen Gupta, the persecution of Bengali Hindus in [[Bengal Sultanate]] and late medieval era religious politics led to a revival of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival that publicly celebrated the [[Durga|warrior goddess]].{{sfn|Rachel Fell McDermott|2001|p=330 notes 98-103}}

From the medieval period up through present day, the Durga Puja has celebrated the goddess with performance arts and as a social event, while maintaining the religious worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tithi Bhattacharya |title=Tracking the Goddess: Religion, Community, and Identity in the Durga Puja Ceremonies of Nineteenth-Century Calcutta |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=66 |number=4 |date=November 2007 |pages=919–962 |doi=10.1017/s0021911807001258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Durga Puja festival is a ten-day event, of which the last five mark the popular practices. The festival begins with ''Mahalaya'', a day where Shakta Hindus remember the loved ones who have died, as well the advent of Durga.{{sfn|Cynthia Bradley|2012|p=214}}{{sfn| Encyclopedia Britannica | 2015}} The next most significant day of Durga Puja celebrations is the sixth day, called Shashthi where the local community welcome the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. On the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami), the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship) with recitation of the scriptures, the legends of Durga in ''Devi Mahatmya'' and social visits by families to elaborately decorated and lighted up temples and ''pandals'' (theatre like stages).{{sfn| David R.

The Durga festival is, in part, a post-monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in [[Shaktism]] tradition of Hinduism, as those in its other traditions.{{sfn|Amazzone|2012|pp=55-59}}{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|p=111, Quote: "Durga puja is celebrated from the first through the ninth days of the bright half of the lunar month of Asvin, which coincides with the autumn harvest in North India, and in certain respects it is clear that Durga puja is a harvest festival in which Durga is propitiated as the power of plant fertility".}} The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called ''navapattrika'', as nature's symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance.{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=111-112}} The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. According to David Kinsley, a professor of Religious Studies specializing on Hindu goddesses, this probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is "not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation".{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=111-112}}

The festival is a major social and public event in eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates the religious life, with temporary stage (''pandal'') built in community squares, roadside shrines and large Durga temples. However, it is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private, home-based festival.{{sfn|Malcolm McLean|1998|p=137}}
The festival opens at twilight with prayers to [[Saraswati]], the Hindu goddess of knowledge, wisdom, music, poetry, independent thought, inner knowing and creativity.{{sfn| Amazzone|2012|pp=57-59, 63, 66}} She is believed to be another aspect of the same one multidimensional goddess [[Devi]] Durga, and who is the external and internal activity of all existence, in everything and everywhere. This is typically also the day that the eyes of all deities on the Durga Puja stage are painted, bringing them to a life like appearance.{{sfn| Amazzone|2012|pp=57-59, 63, 66}}{{sfn|Charles Russell Coulter|Patricia Turner|2013|pp=148, 158-159, 256-257, 301}} The day also marks prayers to [[Ganesha]] and visit to one or more Durga temples.{{sfn| Amazzone|2012|pp=58-60}}

The day two to five continue the remembrance and preparation to other aspects (manifestations) of goddess Durga, such as ''Kumari'' (goddess of fertility), ''Mai'' (mother), ''Ajima'' (grandmother), ''Lakshmi'' (goddess of wealth) and in some regions of the ''Saptamatrikas'' (seven mothers) or ''Navadurga'' (nine aspects of Durga).{{sfn| Amazzone|2012|pp=69-70, 83-84, 95-97, 115-117, 184}}{{sfn|Laura Amazzone|2011|pp=82-83}}{{sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=209-210}}

The sixth day launches the major festivities and social celebrations. It is called ''Sasthi'' (literally, sixth), the goddess is welcomed, festive Durga worship and celebrations begin in elaborately decorated temples and ''pandals'' hosting the statues.{{sfn|Cynthia Bradley|2012|p=214}}{{sfn| Encyclopedia Britannica | 2015}} The first nine days overlap with [[Navaratri]] festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.{{sfn|Robert S.

The puja rituals are long and complicated. Three days of Mantras (words for spiritual transformation), Shlokas (verse) chants and Arati (prayer) and offerings are made, which include Vedic chants and multiple recitations of the ''Devi Mahatmya'' text in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=ghosa40/&gt; Durga Slokas (which is also known as Devi Mantra)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Devi Mantra|url=http://www.indif.com/nri/mantras/devimantra.asp|publisher=indif.com|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; praises Durga as symbol of all divine forces. According to the sloka, Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfillment and peace.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=50, 150-151}}{{refn|group=note|Various versions of Devi mantra exist.{{sfn|C.

O blessed goddess Durga, come here, stay here, stay here, take up residence here, accept my worship. (Durga Avahana Mantra);{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|p=113}} etc.}} The specific practices vary by region.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=17-24, 31-39}} The following being most common:

[[File:Durga Puja sindoor khela before image immersion Vijaya Dashami.jpg|thumb|Playful smearing of vermilion on Vijaya Dasami of Durga Puja, West Bengal]]
* Preliminaries: the preparations before the actual Durga puja begins.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=71-74}}
* Bodhana: the rites to awaken and welcome the goddess to be a guest, typically done on the sixth day of the festival.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=38-44, 84-87}}
* Adhivasa: anointing ritual wherein many symbolic offerings are made to Durga, where each item represents a remembrance of subtle forms of her. Typically completed on the sixth day as well.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=44-45, 120-127}}
* Saptami: bathing of the goddess, selection of the priest, elaborate prayers (''arati''), recitation of texts describing Durga heading to war against evil done on the seventh day of the festival.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=46-54, 132-136}}
* Mahastami: similar to Saptami, more prayers, recitation and enactment of Durga legends and scriptures on the eighth day. The day is significant because the moment when it ends and ninth day begins is considered the moment Durga kills the buffalo demon, the good once again emerges victorious over evil.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=57-59, 194-197}}
[[File:Aarti-dance-bangalore-2009.jpg|thumb|Aarti dance on Mahanavami, Durga Puja in Bangalore (2009)]]
* Sandhi Puja: one of the most important rituals during Durga Puja, it is a forty eight minute high point that celebrates the climax of war which goddess Durga was engaged in. It is done at the exact time Mahashtami ends and Mahanavami begins, with rituals being performed for the last 24 minutes of Mahashtami and for the first 24 minutes of Mahanavami. The legend behind Sandhi Puja comes from when Durga was engaged in a fierce battle with Mahishasura and was attacked by the demons [[Chanda and Munda]]. Goddess [[Chamunda]] emerged from the third eye of Durga and killed Chanda and Munda at the cusp of Ashtami and Navami. In some regions, devotees sacrifice an animal such as a buffalo or goat, but in many regions there isn't an actual animal sacrifice and a symbolic remembrance substitutes it. The surrogate effigy is smeared in red vermilion to symbolize the blood spilled.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=277-278}} The goddess is then offered food (''bhog'') by women, and afterwards everyone eats. Major sites celebrating Durga Puja engage in a sixteen part devotional service. The community begins merry making, music, dancing and women playfully smear the faces of their companions with ''[[sindoor]]'' (vermilion), all as a mark of the victory of good over evil.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=210-213}}
* Mahanavami: the ninth day of festival observes rites similar to ''Saptami'', with the difference that the celebration is after Durga's victory and Vedic style [[Homa (ritual)|homa]] (fire oblation) rituals are now included. The other deities on the stage, such as Ganesha, Kartikeya, Lakshmi and Saraswati are remembered and prayers offered to them.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=62-63, 224-229}}
* Vijaya Dasami: the tenth and last day, begins with Sindoor Khela, where married women smear [[sindoor]] or vermillion on the Goddess' idol, on her forehead and feet, before smearing it on each other. Since sindoor is like an ornament for married women, this ritual signifies them wishing each other a happy married life. They also offer bhog to the goddess. It ends with a great procession where the clay statues are ceremoniously walked to a river or ocean coast for a solemn goodbye to Durga. It is an emotional day for some devotees, and the congregation sings emotional goodbye songs.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=244-245}}{{sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=168-169}} When the procession reaches the water, Durga is immersed, the clay dissolves, and she is believed to return to Mount Kailasha with Shiva and cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=66-67, 236-241, 246-247}} Some communities such as those near Varanasi mark the eleventh day, called ''ekadashi'', by visiting a Durga temple.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=67-68}}

Dhunuchi Naach, a dance performed with [[dhunachi]] (incense burner) is an integral part of the rituals. Drummers called ''[[dhaki]]s,'' carrying large leather-strung ''[[Dhak (instrument)|dhak]]'' create music, people dance and complete the final day of worship called ''[[aarati]]''.

===Decorations: sculptures and stages===
[[File:4 Durga puja decorations collage.jpg|thumb|Durga puja decorations]]

The entire process of creation of the sculptures ([[murti]]) from the collection of clay to the ornamentation is a ceremonial process. Though the festival is observed post monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the statues months before, during the summer. The process begins with prayer to [[Ganesha]] and to the materials such as bamboo frames in which the statue are cast.&lt;ref name="Chitgopekar2009p96"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nilima Chitgopekar|title=Book Of Durga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb64hva4qWYC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-306767-2|pages=95–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay, or local soil collected from different parts of the region, forms the base. This choice is a religious tradition wherein Durga, as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and everything in the universe.&lt;ref name="Chitgopekar2009p96"/&gt; In Kolkata, one custom is to include soil samples, in the clay mixture for Durga, from areas locals believe to be ''nishiddho pallis'' (forbidden territories, brothels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vikas Khanna|title=Indian Harvest: Classic and Contemporary Vegetarian Dishes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G70xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-63286-200-6|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clay base is combined with straw, kneaded then molded into cast made from bamboo. This is set like any clay pot, layered to a final shape, cleaned, and polished when ready. A layer of vegetable fiber called [[jute]], mixed in with clay, is attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex, and usually cast separately.&lt;ref name="Chitgopekar2009p96"/&gt; The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws.&lt;ref name="Chitgopekar2009p96"/&gt; Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the statues of Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, Kartikeya, the lion and the buffalo demon. The goddesses are dressed in fine silk saris, shown bejeweled and put into a pandal.&lt;ref name="Chitgopekar2009p96"/&gt;{{sfn|Amazzone|2012|p=57}}

The procedures and proportions of statue (''pratima'' or ''[[murti]]'') are described in arts-related Sanskrit text of Hinduism, such as the ''Vishvakarma sastra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saligrama Krishna Ramachandra Rao|title=Pratima Kosha: Descriptive Glossary of Indian Iconography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIzrAAAAMAAJ|year=1988|publisher=IBH Prakashana|pages=47–49, 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental impact====
The traditional idols, states Christopher Chapple, are made of biodegradable materials such as "straw, clay, resin, and wood".&lt;ref name=chapple490&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Chapple|title=Hinduism and ecology: the intersection of earth, sky, and water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VHuAAAAMAAJ |year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-945454-25-0|pages=490, 484–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the contemporary era, brighter colored statues have increased and diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.&lt;ref name=chapple490/&gt;

Brighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the historic tradition-based natural colors are typically more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phoebe Godfrey|author2=Denise Torres|title=Emergent Possibilities for Global Sustainability: Intersections of Race, Class and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fypqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-57017-2|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and local Indian governments have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent heavy metal pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ipsita | last=Pati | date=18 October 2012 | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Paint-with-toxic-chemicals-banned-during-Puja/article12562452.ece | title=Paint with toxic chemicals banned during Puja  |newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal sacrifice, symbolic sacrifice===
{{Further|Shaktism|Animal sacrifice in Hinduism}}

Shakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of buffalo demon and victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of ''[[asura]]'' demon made of flour, or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion to remember the blood that had necessarily been spilled during the war.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=277-278}}{{sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=204-205}} Other substitutes include a vegetal or sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Fell McDermott|title=Revelry, Rivalry, and Longing for the Goddesses of Bengal: The Fortunes of Hindu Festivals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggBeH_lmUu8C |year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-12919-0|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, Shaktism devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ira Katznelson|author2=Gareth Stedman Jones|title=Religion and the Political Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWYXdLW00UsC |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49317-8|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other communities, an actual animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples of Goddess such as Bhavani or Kali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghosha|first1=Pratápachandra|title=Durga Puja: with notes and illustrations by Pratápachandra|date=1871|publisher=Hindoo Patriot press|location=Calcutta|pages=60–65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OGZYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakti temples, to mark the legend{{sfn|Charles Phillips|Michael Kerrigan| David Gould| 2011|pp=98-101}} of goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon. This involves slaying of a fowl, [[goat]] or a male [[water buffalo]]. This practice is rare among Hindus, outside the region of Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and Assam.&lt;ref name="Fuller Christopher John 2004 83"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller Christopher John|first=|title=The camphor flame: popular Hinduism and society in India|url= http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7823.html| year=2004|publisher= Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12048-5|pages=46, 83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, even in these states, the festival season is primarily when significant animal sacrifices are observed.&lt;ref name="Fuller Christopher John 2004 83"/&gt;

Months before the start of Durga puja, youth members of a community organize as a team, collect donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build a theme-based stage called ''pandal''. The Durga statue is designed from clay and clothes and colors by the commissioned artisans. The design and decoration is a team effort involving artists, architects and community representatives hosting it. The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. These attract crowds of visitors. The preparations and the building of ''pandals'' are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=1-2, 10-11, 24-26, 351-352}}

The growth of competitiveness in theme pandals have escalated costs and scale of Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some communities question the billboards, the economic competition behind the Durga Puja between communities, and seek return to basics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090913/jsp/calcutta/story_11453289.jsp "Puja on the billboards"] ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]'', 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, a 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Have you ever seen a Durga Idol this tall|url=http://www.rediff.com/getahead/report/have-you-ever-seen-a-durga-idol-this-tall/20151008.htm|accessdate=3 November 2015|work=Rediff|publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Near stampede shuts down Deshapriya Park Durga Puja|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Near-stampede-shuts-down-Deshapriya-Park-Durga-puja/articleshow/49446378.cms|accessdate=3 November 2015|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TV and radio channels telecast Puja celebrations. Many Bengali/Assamese channels devote whole days to the Pujas. Bengali and Oriya weekly magazines bring out special issues for the Puja known as "Pujabarshiki" or "Sharadiya Sankhya". These contain the works of many writers both established and upcoming and are thus much bigger than the regular issues. Some notable examples are [[Anandamela]], Shuktara, Desh, Sarodiya [[Anandabazar Patrika]], Sananda, Nabakallol, Bartaman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharodiya Pujabarshiki|url=http://www.simindia.com/sarodiya.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; All major local news publications are closed on the last day of the festivities.

==Regional variations==
There is enormous variation in worship practices and rituals associated with Durga Puja, as is the case with other Hindu festivals.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|p=17}} Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different types of Durga Puja are readily practiced in the same neighborhood, as well as regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, pandals and within families.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=17-18}} The festival is most associated with Bengali Hindus, and even there the community grants freedom of variability and accepts differences. Some Puja are flamboyant, some are simple. There are differences in the Puja ambiences between theme-based pujas of cities and puja pandals of towns/villages, between family pujas and community (barowari) pujas of neighborhoods or apartments.  {{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=17-18}}

[[File:Varanasi India.jpg|thumb|Durga Kund Temple in Varanasi, a major Durga Puja venue.]]
The style and nature of the Puja varies from being Vedic, or Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=17-18}} The Bengali Durga Puja typically combines all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja tends to be essentially Vedic ([[srauta]]) wherein the melodies of Vedic hymns are sung, but it too incorporates esoteric elements making the Puja an example of a Vaidik-Tantric practice.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|p=18}}

Historical evidence suggests that the Durga Puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social and creative. The festival has been a domestic puja, a form of practice that remains popular. Durga Puja is also practiced in the ''sarvajanin'' (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and effort to set up ''pandals'', lighting decorations etc. and then celebrate the event as a megashow to share.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=18-19}} The origins of the latter variation are unclear, with some evidence suggesting a family in Kolkatta revived this celebration in 1411 CE. Another set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord named Kamsanarayan held a megashow in 1583, or by others in late 16th century Bengal.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=18-19}} Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th century Durga Puja manual manuscripts such as ''Durgotsavaviveka'', ''Durgotsava Prayoga'', ''Vasantaviveka'' and ''Kalaviveka''.{{sfn| McDermott|2011|pp=12-14}} The rituals associated with the Durga Puja migrated to other regions, from Bengal, such as those in [[Varanasi]], a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=20-27}} In contemporary India, Durga Puja is celebrated in numerous styles and forms.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=17-21}}

===West Bengal===
[[File:আহিরীটোলা সার্বজনীন দূর্গা পুজো ২০১৮.jpg|thumb|Durga Idol in Ahiritola, [[Kolkata]] (2018).]]
Durga Puja is the biggest and most widely celebrated festival of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Odhisa.{{sfn| McDermott|2011|p=11}} It is held over a five-day period. The city is decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play popular songs as well as recitation of mantras by priests, thousands of beautiful ''pandals'' are erected by communities in cities, towns and villages across the state, but particularly in Kolkata. The roads become overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of revellers, devotees and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on Puja days. It creates a chaotic traffic condition despite all efforts of traffic and crowd management. Shops, eateries, restaurants stay open all night; fairs are set up and cultural programmes are held.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=27-28}} People form organizing committees, which plan and oversee the ''pandal'' (temporary shrine and stage) for the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, biggest public spectacle and major art event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes known as ''thakur dalan'' for Durga Puja inside which the potters place Durga and then the dressers deck decorate it with home-dyed fabric, sola ornamentation and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like ''arati'' are performed and ''prasad'' is distributed after being offered to the gods. As a tradition, married daughters return to or revisit their parents and celebrate the Durga Puja together, a symbolism for goddess Durga who is believed to return to her parent's home for the festival.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=27-29}}

Durga Puja is a major gift-giving and shopping season in Bengal, with people buying gifts for not only the family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together to visit countless Puja pandals. Some people go to the places of tourist attractions during the Puja holidays, while others return home from their workplaces to spend the festive days with their family members. {{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=27-29}} Beyond being a family, social and religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political theatre. Major regional and national political parties have sponsored and leveraged Durga Puja to spread their ideologies given the festival's importance to the culture of Bengali Hindus.{{sfn| McDermott|2011|pp=138-143}}

The organizing committees of each pandal hires a ''purohita'' (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=27-30}} For the priests, the Durga Puja is a major time of activity, wherein he pursues the timely completion of a busy Vedic-Puranic-Tantric ritual sequence along timed to various offerings and fire oblations, in full public view, while the social festivities occur in parallel.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=27-30, 39-48, 58-64, 106-114}} The complex rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The third and fourth day of the Puja are increasingly complex, while hundreds of thousands of people visit to witness it. {{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=27-32}} On the day of Vijayadashami, the idols are carried out in grand immersion processions across Bengal and then the idols are ritually immersed into the rivers or waterbodies amid singing, water-throwing and fireworks. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after. {{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2003|pp=27-32, 64-75}}

====Colonial era immersion rituals====
According to Claire Alexander and other scholars, the ritual of immersing Durga idol into river attracted the attention of colonial era travelers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as [[Garcin de Tassy]] and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by Islamic community in Bengal as well. Shia Muslims observed [[Muharram]] over 10 days, took out processions in memory of their Imam [[Husayn ibn Ali]], and then cast a memorial Imam's cenotaph into a river on the 10th day. Further, stated Tassy, the Muslim rituals included the same offerings at their annual festival in the memory of their Imam during Muharram, as the Hindus did during Durga Puja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claire Alexander|author2=Joya Chatterji|author3=Annu Jalais|title=The Bengal Diaspora: Rethinking Muslim Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ_hCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-33593-1|pages=190 note 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aslam Syed, the immersion in water ritual by Hindus for Durga in Bengal, and Ganesh in the western states of India, may have grown because the Hindu leaders attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Islamic Muharram allowed by the colonial British government in the 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Jones|author2=Michele Marion|title=The Dynamics of Cultural Counterpoint in Asian Studies |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3wDkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 |year=2014|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-5191-6|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maharashtra===
[[Nashik]] holds four major celebrations – including: the Government of India Press grounds organised by Nashik Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee which is the oldest and biggest; the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (H.A.L)in Ojhar; at Artillery Station, Deolali; the industrial area of Satpur-Ambad. In recent years, places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati and Mahatmanagar also have set up Durga Puja mandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kumbh Mela delay fails to dampen Durga Puja preparations |author=Sumita Sarkar |newspaper=The Times Of India |date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delhi===
[[File:PA060139 cooperative.jpg|thumb|Durga Puja in New Delhi, 2008]]
In 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of [[British India]], the first ''Sarbojanin'' (community) puja in Delhi was organised near [[Kashmiri Gate (Delhi)|Kashmiri Gate]] by a group of expatriate Bengalis, including the doctor Hemchandra Sen. This group became the [[Delhi Durga Puja Samiti]], popularly known as the "Kashmere Gate Puja".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hindu|title=Durga Puja|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/08/06/stories/2009080650790100.htm|accessdate=1 October 2011|location=Chennai, India|date=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Timarpur]] puja (near Delhi University) started in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =        Making Delhi their own, religiously | author =       Sidhartha Roy | publisher =    Hindustan Times | url =          http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/Delhi100/Making-Delhi-their-own-religiously/newdelhi/SP-Article10-717800.aspx | date =         6 July 2011 | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20130513065908/http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/Delhi100/Making-Delhi-their-own-religiously/newdelhi/SP-Article10-717800.aspx | archive-date = 2013-05-13 | access-date =  4 October 2011}} on the early history of Durga puja in Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Bangladesh===
Durga Puja is widely celebrated by the Bangladesh's minority Hindu community. Some Bengali Muslims also take part in the ''pujo'' (Durga Puja).&lt;ref name=tripathi5&gt;{{cite book|author=Salil Tripathi|title=The Colonel Who Would Not Repent: The Bangladesh War and Its Unquiet Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcffCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |year=2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21818-3|page=5}}, Quote: "The intertwining of cultural traditions reinforced a society which was tolerant and the faiths borrowed from each other. (...) Many Bangladeshi Muslim women wear saris and bindis, or teeps, the dot on their forehead, usually seen only among Hindu women; they celebrate pujo, a Hindu festival for the goddess Durga, and they have no hestitation ushering in Poyla Baisakh, to celebrate the Bengali new year."&lt;/ref&gt; In Dhaka, the [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] and mandaps attract numerous visitors and devotees, and on Vijaya Dashami, the immersion processions head to Sadarghat (Dhaka's river port), where the idols are immersed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen London|title=Bangladesh |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yyREz0r7-BUC&amp;pg=PA38| year=2004| publisher=Gareth Stevens |isbn= 978-0-8368-3107-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Durga Puja Köln 2009 1.jpg|thumb|Durga puja pandal in Germany (2009)]]
Durga Puja is organised by Bengali communities in Europe. Although pandals are not constructed, the sculptures are imported from India. According to BBC News, for community celebrations in London in 2006, these "idols, belonging to a tableau measuring 18ft by 20ft, were made from clay, straw and vegetable dyes". At the end of the Durga Puja, these were immersed in River Thames, for the first time in 2006, after "the community was allowed to give a traditional send-off to the deities by London's port authorities". The Bengali community stated, per the BBC News report, that the immersion ceremony "is a very sentimental issue for us, everybody wanted to see the idols being given a proper immersion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Thames immersion for Hindu sculptures|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/5401122.stm|publisher=BBC UK|accessdate=4 October 2011|date=2 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Durgapuja is celebrated in several cities across the country. Some of the top mentions are "Duesseldorf Durgapuja", who have been celebrating this since 2012 with the same zeal and vigour as in India. The Indische Gemeinde Duesseldorf is the organization which manages this 4 day extravaganza with voluntary support from members of the club and first time visitors alike. The event consists of performing all rituals to the book, Prasad after the puja, Indian Lunch, Dinner and snacks every day for all visitors, Cultural programmes from members of the club as well as by performing artists flown out of India, and Sandhya Arati (Evening worship) along with the Dhak (traditional drum) and kansor (traditional metal disc).&lt;ref&gt;http://duesseldorf-durgapuja.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
The biggest Durga Puja in Germany is celebrated in Cologne Durga puja;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durgapuja.de/&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is also celebrated in Munich, Berlin and other German cities.

'''Elands Bay Cave''' is located near the mouth of the Verlorenvlei estuary on the Atlantic coast of [[South Africa]]'s [[Western Cape Province]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Archaeology Theories, Methods, and Practice|last1=Renfrew|first1=Colin|last2=Bahn|first2=Paul|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2012|isbn=|edition=6th |location=London|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate has continuously become drier since the habitation of hunter-gatherers in the [[Late Pleistocene|Later Pleistocene]]. The archaeological remains recovered from previous excavations at Elands Bay Cave have been studied to help answer questions regarding the relationship of people and their landscape, the role of climate change that could have determined or influenced subsistence changes, and the impact of [[pastoralism]] and agriculture on [[hunter-gatherer]] communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkington|first1=John|title=The Pleistocene/Holocene transition in the Western Cape, South Africa, observations from Verlorenvlei|journal=BAR International Series|date=1988 |volume=405 |pages=197–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Research ==
[[File:ElandsBay1979.jpg|thumbnail|Rock paintings at Eland's Bay Cave, South Africa Photo taken in 1979. From left to right, Merrick Posnansky, [[John Parkington]] and [[J. Desmond Clark]].]]
Renowned archaeologist [[John Parkington]] excavated Elands Bay Cave in the 1970s providing vast information of the cave's inhabitants. Parkington frequently used methods of comparing various characteristics in his findings in order to highlight phases of transformations at Elands Bay Cave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other archaeologists and specialists have analyzed the findings from Parkington. Parkington, Cartwright, Cowling, Baxter, and Meadows (2000), analyzed wood charcoal and pollen data from Elands Bay Cave to explain the environmental change. Klein, in 2001 studied fossil remains and faunal data to indicate hunter-gatherer behavioral and cultural adaptations. In 1999, Cowling, Cartwright, Parkington, &amp; Allsopp researched wood charcoal in order to explain environmental changes. Woodborne, Hart, &amp; Parkington (1995) researched seal bones to construct the timing and the duration of hunter-gatherer coastal journeys. Orton (2006) examined raw materials to produce a lithic sequence for the [[Later Stone Age]] in Elands Bay Cave.  Lastly, Matthews (1999) used [[taphonomy]] and previous research by Peter Andrews to understand the formation and interpretation of micromammals at Elands Bay Cave.

== Environment ==

The coastline of Elands Bay Cave has changed dramatically since the end of the Ice Age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A coastal plain once extended some 20&amp;nbsp;km west of Elands Bay Cave into the sea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Heavier rainfall and different ocean levels allowed Elands Bay Cave to be a lush environment in the past. Testing of faunal remains, bones, and wood charcoals provided evidence of wetter conditions in the terminal Pleistocene. During that time, the environment consisted of colder weather with heavier rain fall which created vegetation that was different than it is today.&lt;ref name="Parkington et al. 2000"/&gt; Now, it has become a drier environment with different species residing there. Rainfall from 9,600 to 13,600 years ago produced 400&amp;nbsp;mm comparable to today’s 300&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt; More recent environmental conditions near Elands Bay Cave are characteristic of mild weather with an approximated 200–250&amp;nbsp;mm per year of rainfall occurring every winter.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt;  Elands Bay Cave is in close proximity (approximately 3 kilometers) to a rich [[Intertidal zone|intertidal]] environment supporting numerous shellfish species, sea birds, [[kelp bed]]s, and [[marine mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Over time, the climatic atmosphere near Elands Bay Cave became drier and the soil conditions turned to sand. Dense shrubs are maintained by older sand creating patches of subtropical plants in the area.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt; These environmental changes resulted in a reduction of available resources such as fresh water, mussels, and shellfish.

Transitions from the last glaciation to the [[Holocene]] had a significant impact on the type of vegetation and wildlife that could be supported along the southern coast.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; Researchers suggest that because of increased aridity, the inhabitants of Elands Bay Cave abandoned the site and migrated elsewhere. Lack of archaeological remains concerning the dates of 8,000 to 4,400 and 4,000 BP support the theory of an occupation hiatus during these time frames.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt;

== Excavations ==

Archaeological excavations at Elands Bay Cave began in the 1970s. Scientific interest has focused on investigating coastal changes, subsistence and seasonal mobility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Faunal remains representing the time period of 13.600-12.000 years ago were left behind by the cave's occupants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The majority of the faunal assemblage consists of grazing animals and is indicative of a grassland environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The faunal remains were examined and compared to collections at the [[Iziko South African Museum|South Africa Museum]] in Cape Town. Few marine specimens were recovered from this time span and is indicative of the 12&amp;nbsp;km distance from the cave to the coast.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cartwright and Parkington (1997) excavated 6,700 fragments of wood charcoal that were retrieved through dry sieving large soil samples of 39 collections. Excavation of wood charcoal and pollen in the cave suggests that last [[Ice age|glacial maximum]] had wetter conditions with lush forests and [[Afromontane]] elements 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Parkington et al. 2000"/&gt; There were also varieties of charcoal tested from 20,000, 13,500, and 10,500 years ago. Researchers have also analyzed micromammals, such as mice, as paleoenvironmental indicators.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt; Micromammal remains were encountered during excavations and occur throughout the units dating from 13,260  to 300 years before present.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt; The micromammal specimens were recovered using 12mm and 3mm sieves, however, the researchers comment that this mesh size was likely too large to account for smaller faunal remains.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt; Understanding the [[Taphonomy|taphonomic]] processes that contributed to the deposition of the micromammal remains at Elands Bay Cave is important because it has identified a number of predators likely responsible for the accumulation of faunal material.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt; that became a great tool for formation of micromammal collection.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt; Excavations in Elands Bay Cave and surrounding areas support a hypothesis of migration in winter months. Assemblages of shellfish findings portray that the theory of shellfish changing in size during prehistoric times because of environment was overthrown and was replaced by consuming large amounts of shellfish at the time. Observations and excavations were done in Elands Bay Cave in order to properly identify species of fish bones with accurate representation in specific levels. Excavations that were conducted from 1970 to 1978 in Elands Bay Cave concluded that there was a stratified sequence of deposits that dated to the late Pleistocene.&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt; Between 8000 and 6000 years ago, the rise in sea level eventually resulted in the present location of Elands Bay Cave now on the coast.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Excavations after 4,000 BP revealed there were 13 different species of fish represented at the site, 6 of which are still found today in the aquatic milieus.&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt; These findings supported the conclusion that due to the close proximity to the coast, fishing activities were the dominant [[subsistence strategy]] practiced by the people who occupied Elands Bay Cave.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  With the coastline in its present-day location by about 6000 years ago, the inhabitants of the cave were thus in a favorable location to exploit marine resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Stratigraphy and Dating ==

There are 60 [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] that represent activity during the [[Holocene]], a large part of the terminal [[Pleistocene]], and also the last glacial maximum.&lt;ref name="Cartwright Parkington 1997"/&gt; [[Stratigraphy]] dating and the [[Middle Stone Age]] artifacts are at the base, then ashy loam's before 20,000 years ago BP, lastly topped with shell middens. Upper shell middens range from 3,800 to 300 BP, though there was a disturbance of accumulation from 7,900 years ago that stopped for about 4,000 years. Around 11,000 to 9,000 years ago the terrestrial fauna began to change. Shell middens from the Holocene are on top of Pleistocene soil that was accumulated from the last glacial period.&lt;ref name="Cartwright Parkington 1997"/&gt; Prior to 9,000 BP, seals do not appear to be seasonal at Elands Bay Cave. The seal collection was divided into two collections: upper ranging from 1,400 BP and lower ranging from 10,000 BP to 9,500 BP.&lt;ref name="Woodborne et al. 1995"/&gt; Charcoal that was 40,000 years old was studied. Proteoid fynbos was able to be harvested because of improved soils in 12,450 BP to 13,600 BP. In the terminal Pleistocene, approximately 16,000 to 8,000 years ago, ostrich egg shells and animal bones were introduced to the cave. Establishment of non-micro [[Lithic reduction|lithic]] industry was discovered to be from 10,000 BP continuing on to 8900 BP.&lt;ref name="Orton 2006"/&gt; It is found that major increase of formal tools took place in 9,500 BP.&lt;ref name="Orton 2006"/&gt; The transitions of tool assemblages in Elands Bay Cave are assumed to be from 8,800 to 8,500 BP.&lt;ref name="Orton 2006"/&gt; In 8,000 BP Holocene, Elands Bay Cave had [[microlith]]ics for the first time. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] dates indicate that Albany Industry was in use circa 13,000 and 9,000 BP.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Artefacts and Faunal Remains ===

Elands Bay Cave is perceived as the central site because it includes the largest sample sizes and covers more time spans.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; Elands Bay Cave has been used at different times for various purposes; evidence found at the cave suggests that there is a series of overlapping events that are in no constant order. The research that has been done in the cave concludes that people lived there around 4,400 to 3,000 years ago and that hunting and gathering activities persisted until the 17th century AD. Migration patterns were found due to shell midden evidence from marine resources archaeologists found displaying exploitation from that time. All the research contributes in various ways of monitoring stratigraphic anomalies within Elands Bay Cave.

=== Culture ===

Group sizes varied at different points, some were just a few families and at other times there could have been up to 100 people. Either way, a community was built. Hunter-gatherers became more advanced in the Later Stone age compared to the [[Middle Stone Age]]. Expansion of hearths found inside Elands Bay Cave illustrates that people were skillful with fire. It also indicates cultural evolution by gathering together when it was dark or cold outside. They also discovered that hunter-gatherers stored food  underground in containers and used ostrich eggs as portable water vessels. People from the Later Stone Age seemed to have gathered the most remains from fish and aerial birds which indicate artefactual observation conclusion of people fishing and fowling routinely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein, R.|title=Southern Africa and modern human origins|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|date=2001 |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |jstor=3630795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seal Bones ===

Seal mandibles that were found at the cave were compared to mandibles from South Africa Museum and Department of Sea Fisheries Collection. The upper division of seals collection explained that seals were hunted during winter and spring months. This implies that hunter-gatherers would purposefully plan to be at the Elands Bay Cave at those times. The lower collection finds that there was no seasonal correlation to habitation and that the seals were 2 years old. The study of seal mandibles aid in gaining understanding of deaths and predict probable seasonal migration. Through carbon isotope testing, upper level dating of seal bones were found to not be consistent with findings of human remains at the same time. These findings were all to demonstrate that the cave was accessible and used to easily capture seals pups. Animal bones demonstrate drastic change in vegetation. Seal bones are plentiful after 11,000 to 10,000 BP.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; Bones used to identify seals in Elands Bay Cave are mainly the remains of limb bones, such as the humeri. These bone types can be distinguished from other wildlife skeletal remains because they lack a marrow cavity.  During 11,000 to 10,000 BP sea levels rose, this allowed seals to be exploited through hunting.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt;

=== Wood and Pollen Findings ===

Before 4,000 BP people from Elands Bay Cave would gather wood from moister plants that would grow in different areas.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt; Pollen in small denominations is discovered from the last glacial maximum but none from past that time.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt; This is presented through the connection of higher moisture availability supporting fuel wood accessibility and variety. Samples of wood charcoal and pollen that are 17,000 to 20,000 years old (terminal Pleistocene) show a connection to vegetation rather than rainfall. Recent charcoal resembles xeric thicket and states that vegetation was more diverse.&lt;ref name="Parkington et al. 2000"/&gt; There is a drainage system that has gone through Elands Bay Cave, the [[Velorenvlei]]. It is speculated that the connection from that drainage system to Elands Bay Cave has a significant impact on the collection of pollen that is found in Elands Bay Cave.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt; It is revealed that the moisture in the soil has been deteriorating from at least 4,000 years ago; other observations conclude similar findings because of evidence from pollen and faunal remains from the same epochs.&lt;ref name="Cowling et al. 1999"/&gt;

=== Middens ===

The [[stratigraphy]] of Elands Bay Cave is dominated by shell midden as well as levels composed of ashy matrix interpreted as living floor features containing remnants of grasses possibly used as bedding, bone and shell.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkington|first=John|date=1972|title=Seasonal Mobility in the Later Stone Age|url=|journal=Africa Studies|issue=31|pages=223–43|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was 40 cubic meters of shell middens found from the Holocene period. Aside from mussel shells, middens consisted of ostrich shells and other marine shells.&lt;ref name="Parkington1976"/&gt; It was discovered that ostrich eggs, used as water containers, were sometimes repurposed as beads after breaking. Some wood charcoal from 40,000 years ago from the terminal Holocene (300 years ago) to early late Pleistocene revealed that it was beyond range of carbon dating. There was only 25-44 g/m3 microfaunal found.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt; In early Holocene, limpets were the dominant species represented within the midden levels. Four stratigraphic levels were observed throughout the middens and were documented. Stages 1,2, and 3 are the top three levels; they are believed to be dated to around 1,500 to 600 BP.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; The lower stage, level 4, is understood to be dated no older that 1,500 BP.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt;

=== Taphonomy ===

Archeological evidence supports [[taphonomy]] investigations in order to rule out assumptions of extinction or depletion of wildlife. It is important to identify who the predator is before environment analysis. It was found that the study of taphonomy was important because it allowed researchers to distinguish the factors responsible for the collection and establishment of habits and behaviors of different species. Researchers discovered that predator species contributed to micromammal accumulations and with this, helped recreate the environment they lived in. Remains from different predator birds show that the Barn Owl was not the only airborne wildlife using the cave as a shelter.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt; Additional suspect predators include different owl species such as the spotted eagle owl, the giant owl, the Cape eagle owl, as well the black backed jackal and the grey mongoose.&lt;ref name="Matthews1999"/&gt;

=== Bones ===

There were remains of sheep bones found at Elands Bay Cave between 2,000 and 1,500 BP. The first bone collectors in Elands Bay Cave were discovered to be people from the Stone Age.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; Some bones were gnawed and chewed, which predicted the habitation of carnivores and porcupines.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; Evidence suggests that mole rats could have been introduced by people bringing them when they migrated to Elands Bay Cave or, the more likely suggestion is that they were brought by [[Spotted eagle-owl|Eagle owls]] after 10,000 BP. There are fluctuations in evidence which are reflections of periods when the owls used the cave. Fossil samples from mole rat humeri’s were collected and tested. Jaws and foot bones are the most common bones used to identify species since they are long-lasting and easy to identify even when in pieces.&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; Over time there was a reduction in mole rat sizes in the collections, likely because of weather and environmental changes. This would explain the appearance of certain animals like hedgehogs since they favor wetter climates. Some animals such as the Cape horse became extinct and others like the hedgehog came about. This could be seen through fossils found in soil deposits.

=== Fish ===

Fish species within the faunal assemblage recovered from Elands Bay Cave increased over time and represent both estuary and marine varieties.&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt; This is a reflection of higher sea levels from the conversion of the last glaciation to the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref name="Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1987"/&gt; Excavations from 1970 to 1978, revealed that the [[white steenbras]] was the most prevalent fish species.&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt; The varying size of the white steenbras over time may reflect a fishing technology that employed the use of fish gorges.&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt; Layers where bone gorges were present typically were void of small age classes.&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt; Fish species remained relatively unchanged throughout the Holocene levels, with the most common type being the [[Sparidae]].&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt;

=== Shellfish ===

Shellfish remains discovered after 4,000 BP indicate an increase in marine resource exploitation and represents a shift away from mammals as the dietary staple.&lt;ref name="Poggenpoel 1987"/&gt; This was produced because the coastline became part of the cave’s basin. A high percentage, 90%, of shell middens from the Holocene period were black mussels.&lt;ref name="Buchanan et al. 1978"/&gt; These types of findings in an area would indicate a settlement with shellfish being a large portion of their daily nutritional intake. In Elands Bay Cave there were three main shell middens remains: Black mussels, and two different classes of limpets.&lt;ref name="Buchanan et al. 1978"/&gt; The shells that were found had not reached full adulthood within the cave, which leads archaeologists to believe that they were an essential part of their diet.&lt;ref name="Buchanan et al. 1978"/&gt; There were notable different sizes outside the cave but it is speculated that it is because of the consumption inside the cave that the mussels were accessible and therefore, there was a slim chance for the shellfish to reach mature age.

== Artefacts ==

=== Stone Tools ===

Until 9,000 years ago in the [[Late Pleistocene]] and early Holocene, stone tools were made out of [[quartz]]. There was an abundance of vein quartz, even if found in small forms like pebbles. Even though the principal material of the tools was quartz, other materials were also found in sizable quantities.&lt;ref name="Orton 2006"/&gt; These include a substantial amount of [[hornfels]], tough [[siltstones]], and [[dolerite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey, G., &amp; Parkington, J|title=The archaeology of prehistoric coastlines|date=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Great Britain|isbn=0 521 25036 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from quartz and silcrete, the other materials are unknown on how they got to the location. Quality raw materials are suspected to have been brought from other regions. It is also suggested that they could have manifested through trade or simply carried in from migration.

== Discussion ==

Elands Bay Cave was not always occupied. There are conflicting theories of seasonal migration to the cave just like in the Early Holocene. Yet, lack of evidence of seals in Elands Bay Cave at that time leads some to suggest that it was not a seasonal habitation. Since there are no signs of transitions even with the vast diverse archeologically evidence of faunal and artifact remains, it suggests to some that people did live there for a long time not just occasionally. Hunter-gatherers were able to understand and use the land at a local and regional scale. This is demonstrated with the large amount of seal evidence in faunal collection in the terminal Pleistocene. Migration could have been an occurrence because of harsh weather and less agricultural resources which would lead them to find a location that produced more dietary supplements.

Although charcoal analysis proved faunal diversity, more research is needed to close gaps in charcoal records. Changing behavior, creating culture, and emergence of new systems need to still be studied in depth in order to gain a greater sense of the historical Elands Bay Cave community.

An '''external render''' is, in its most basic form, a coating applied to the walls of a building, to provide a protective coating which would prevent rain penetration. It also acts as a decorative finish to enhance the appearance of a building.

== History ==

Rendering is a traditional craft that has evolved over many centuries. Basic rendering began as a method of excluding [[Air current|draughts]] and rain by using clay to fill in cracks and crevices, referred to as [[wattle-and-daub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prichett|first1=Ian|title=Wattle and Daub|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/wattleanddaub/wattleanddaub.htm|website=www.buildingconservation.com|publisher=The Building Conservation Directory|accessdate=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other renders, based on [[Lime (material)|lime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holmes|first1=Stafford|title=An Introduction to Building Limes|url=http://www.buildinglimesforum.org.uk/why-use-lime|website=www.buildinglimesforum.org|accessdate=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; binders were also used over the years. These materials had one significant disadvantage in that they were not very resistant to water.

The introduction of [[Portland cement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Henry|title=The Science and Art of the Manufacture of Portland Cement with observations on some of its constructive Applications.|date=1877|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant that durable [[Mortar (masonry)|mortars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factory produces lime: sand mortar for masonry|url=http://www.mortar.org.uk/documents/miadata01.pdf|website=www.mortar.org.uk|accessdate=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be produced and weather resistant renders resulted. Through the years technological advances have aided the development of cutting edge render systems that aim to improve the longevity of a buildings structural capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silicone Technology|url=http://www.k-rend.co.uk/why-k-rend/silicone-technology-krend|website=www.k-rend.co.uk|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture and production ==

Traditionally, a render would be manufactured on site by a plasterer mixing [[sand]], [[cement]] and sometimes lime material together with water to produce his render. This would then be applied to the walls, usually in either two or three coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snell|first1=David|title=How to..two-coat render a wall|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/3305786/How-to-.-.-.-two-coat-render-a-wall.html|work=The Telegraph|agency=The Telegraph|publisher=The Telegraph Media Group|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When painting, there is usually a primer, an undercoat and a topcoat. Similarly in renders there may be a stipple coat, then an undercoat (sometimes called a base coat) and finally a final coat (sometimes called a topcoat). The difference is that in renders, the final thickness is 15&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paints and Renders explained|url=http://www.self-build.co.uk/paints-renders-explained|website=www.self-build.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of a site mixed render is the factory made render.  All the render ingredients are dry blended together in a modern factory, creating a powdered product which can be supplied in bags.  When the product is delivered to site the plasterer just needs to mix the product with water and apply it to the wall.

The factory made render has an advantage over the site mixed render in that the composition of the render and all the raw materials are closely controlled and accurately measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factory produced mortar for External Rendering|url=http://www.mortar.org.uk/documents/miadata04.pdf|website=www.mortar.org.uk|accessdate=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supplying a render in this way allows the manufacturer to include performance enhancing additives into the formulation.  Whilst many site mixed renders are subsequently painted, factory made renders can be supplied as a wide variety of self-coloured products, eliminating the additional expense of painting.

== Application ==

There are two main methods of applying render, by hawk and [[trowel]] or by machine.  In the hawk and trowel method the product is first mixed with water to a workable paste and then the plasterer applies the wet paste render to the wall and levels it off, using a hawk and trowel.  Machine applied renders are usually factory made products.  The machine is essentially a mixing pump which mixes the product with water and pumps the paste to a nozzle which sprays it onto the wall.  The wet paste is than levelled off. Application of render using a machine is usually a much faster operation than by hand, meaning that larger areas can be rendered during a working day. The application of render has to be completed in the correct weather conditions. If the temperature is too low, moisture can be trapped within the render. If the temperature is too high, the render will dry out too quickly, leading to the formation of cracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allweathercoating.co.uk/rendering/how-to-repair-cracked-render/|title=How to Repair Cracked Render - All Weather Coating|website=www.allweathercoating.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Glamorama''''' is a 1998 novel by American writer [[Bret Easton Ellis]]. ''Glamorama'' is set in and satirizes the 1990s, specifically [[celebrity culture]] and [[consumerism]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' describes the novel as "a screed against models and celebrity."&lt;ref name=TimeMcInerney&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989182,00.html|title=Books: A Man of His Time|date=1998-09-28|last=Stein|first=Joel|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Ellis wanted to write a [[Stephen King]]-style ghost story novel, which would eventually become ''[[Lunar Park]]''; finding it difficult at the time, he began work on the other novel which he had in mind. This was a [[Robert Ludlum]]-style thriller, with the intention of using one of his own vapid characters who lack insight as the narrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2010/jul/26/bret-easton-ellis-guardian-book-club|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Guardian book club: John Mullan meets Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=2010-08-14|date=2010-06-08|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary devices, plot, and themes==
The novel is a satire of modern celebrity culture; this is reflected in its premise, which features models-turned-terrorists. A character remarks, "basically, everyone was a sociopath ... and all the girls' hair was [[Chignon (hairstyle)|chignoned]]." The novel plays upon the [[conspiracy fiction|conspiracy]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] conceit of someone "behind all the awful events", to dramatize the revelation of a world of random [[Horror and terror|horror]] .&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|title=Too Much Too Old: Glamorama so 1996|last=Sng|first=Daryl|date=1998-01-08|accessdate=2010-06-29|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/1/8/too-much-too-old-glamorama-so/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of resolution contributes to Ellis' artistic effect.&lt;ref name=StarTribune/&gt; The obsession with beauty is reflected in consistent namedropping; this satirizes (the main character) Victor's obsession with looks, and perhaps is indicative of the author's own attraction to glamor.&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt;

Ellis drops names in ''Glamorama'' so often that ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' describes "Nary a sentence ... escapes without a cameo from someone famous, quasi-famous, or formerly famous. In fact, in some sentences, Ellis cuts out those pesky nouns and verbs and simply lists celebrities."&lt;ref name=EW1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274145,00.html|title=Glamorama (1999)|last=Jacobs|first=A.J.|date=1999-01-22|accessdate=2010-06-30|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namedropping and commoditization have a depersonalizing effect (a world reduced to "sheen and brands"); as the reviewer for ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' observes, "When Victor undergoes a transformation to a law student, we know he is different because he now wears a [[Brooks Brothers]] suit and drinks [[Diet Coke]]. London and Paris become nothing more than a different collection of recognizable proper nouns ([[Notting Hill]] and [[Irvine Welsh]] in the first case; ''Chez Georges'' and [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] in the second)."&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; A writer for the ''[[New York Times]]'' observes "much of his prose consists of (intentionally) numbingly long lists of his characters' clothes and accouterments ... out of which his loft-dwellers somewhat hopefully attempt to assemble something like an identity". In speech, his writing demonstrates the ways in which his characters, too, have internalized the language of consumerist advertising and marketing.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/24/reviews/990124.24mendelt.html|title=Lesser Than Zero|last=Mendelsohn|first=Daniel|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1999-01-24|authorlink=Daniel Mendelsohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The Ledger|Lakeland Ledger]]'', ''Glamorama'' is something of a ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' [[allegory]] and a [[cautionary tale]] navigating the perils of dissolving identity.&lt;ref name=Ledger&gt;{{cite news |title='Glamorama' A Real Bore|first=Victoria A.|last=Bronsworth|newspaper=[[The Ledger|Lakeland Ledger]]|date=1999-02-28|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cposAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1PwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6644,5573481&amp;dq=glamorama&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parody of how people now think in modern terms, Ellis "annoying[ly]" lists "the songs that are playing in the background, or even quoting them, as he does with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]' "[[Champagne Supernova]]"; in effect, the novel is provided with a [[soundtrack|movie soundtrack]]. As such, the book feels at times like a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a [[snuff film]]. New technology such as [[photo manipulation]] software (e.g. "PhotoSoap for [[Windows 95]]")&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes hard to tell what is real in the 'modern' world.&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; As such, "meaningful identity is obliterated"; this furthers the recurring joke from ''American Psycho'' wherein "characters are always getting confused by their friends with other people, with no noticeable consequences".&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

The book prominently contains the conceit wherein Victor's life is being filmed by a camera crew "introduced a third of the way into the book".&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; As well as a [[postmodern literature|postmodern]] device to examine the questionable "reality" of the situation, it also functions as a "tidy commentary" on the advent of [[mass surveillance]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; ''EW'' interprets the scene to mean "Modern life has become a movie (a point made more cogently by [[Neal Gabler]]'s new book, ''Life the Movie'')."&lt;ref name=EW1/&gt; The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' took the same meaning from the conceit, and described it as a "not-so-deep observation" that "has no real pay-off".&lt;ref name=PG&gt;{{cite news |title=Ellis takes a wrong turn in 'Glamorama'|first=Kim|last=Gernosvek|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=1999-02-14|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3VsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PG8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2111,1601343&amp;dq=glamorama&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' felt it was a "halfhearted narrative device ... suggesting that the novel's action is actually part of a film that's being made."  The reviewer felt that allusions to ""the director" or to the fact that this or that scene is a "[[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]"" was used to retroactively suggest cohesion in the novel's plot.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

"As much as celebrity itself, our collective celebrity worship becomes the real target of Ellis' satire", writes the ''[[Star Tribune]]''. Models in the novel act as a [[synecdoche]] of the larger culture. Reviewer Eric Hanson writes, "Their [models'] selfishness and brutality, he implies, are simply an extreme manifestation of what consumer culture encourages in everyone."&lt;ref name=StarTribune&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Star Tribune]]|last=Hanson|first=Eric|title=Ellis dissects the glitterati in 'Glamorama'|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/11380706.html|date=1999-01-30|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor's own pursuit of being cool or too hip "destroys him". A [[CNN]] reviewer gives the example of Victor not wanting to explain his impersonator, "because the places he was seen were always hot spots he should have frequented."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/books/reviews/9909/29/glamorama/index.html|title=Review: Author is 'too hip for his own good'|last=Meagher|first=L.D.|date=1999-09-29|work=[[CNN|CNN Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
'''Victor Ward''' is the novel's lead character, who had previously appeared as Victor Johnson in ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (1987). In ''Glamorama'', now an "A-list model, would-be-actor and current "[[It girl|It boy]]",&lt;ref name=StarTribune/&gt; "an uberstereotype of the male model", Victor lives by his catchphrase mantra "the better you look, the more you see". As ''Harvard Crimson'' observes, "His lifestyle is the extreme of everything the current culture worships: he can't avoid thinking in brand names and image and speaks with lines from pop songs." Uncharacteristic for an Ellis protagonist, as the ''Crimson'' notes, Victor is "terrified by" the "coldbloodedness" he encounters when he becomes embroiled in international terrorism. As an unintelligent narrator, Victor (through his inability to comprehend his situation), underlines how "the world of celebrity in ''Glamorama'' is inescapable".&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; Compared to other Ellis protagonists, Victor is less "sensitive and insightful" than ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Clay, neither the "preening psychopath" that is ''[[American Psycho]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Patrick Bateman]]",&lt;ref name=StarTribune/&gt; he is nevertheless an "[un]sympathetic protagonist (in his own way, he's as morally bankrupt as ... Patrick Bateman)."&lt;ref name=EW1/&gt; As narrator, "Victor's perceptions" sum up "[the glamor world's] disconnection from what the rest of us consider "real life"... [where] Everything he sees is a brand name." CNN speculates when Victor begins speaking to the novel's "film crew" (one of its literary devices), that this could mean that the character is [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]].&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Victor comes across "oddly [[homophobia|homophobic]] for a member of the [[pansexuality|pansexual]] New York fashion scene";&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; when his gay assistant accuses "I know for a fact you've had sex with guys in the past", he retorts that he did "the whole hip bi thing for about three hours back in college".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Glamorama|last=Ellis|first=Bret Easton|authorlink=Bret Easton Ellis|year=2006 |origyear=1998|publisher=[[Pan MacMillan]]|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mysterious '''F. Fred Palakon''' first appears a quarter of the way into the novel, when he offers to pay Victor $300,000 to track down his former Camden classmate '''Jamie Fields''',&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; a double-agent working in the terrorist organisation with which Victor becomes involved. It is never clarified exactly which political organisation Palakon appears to be working for; he even appears alongside '''Senator Johnson''', Victor's father, a [[United States Senator]] with ambitions to become [[President of the United States|President]]. Of Palakon, 'the director' says "We've been through this a hundred times ... There is no Palakon. I've never heard that name.&lt;ref&gt;''Glamorama'', p.470&lt;/ref&gt; Victor's girlfriend '''Chloe Byrnes''' is a supermodel and a recovering drug addict.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; '''Alison Poole''', the main character from [[Jay McInerney]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Story of My Life (novel)|Story of My Life]]'', appears,&lt;ref name=EW1/&gt; having also previously appeared in ''American Psycho'' in 1992. In ''Glamorama'', Alison is "[Victor's] boss's girlfriend (another supermodel)",&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; "here playing [[Monica Lewinsky|Lewinsky]]".&lt;ref name=Ledger/&gt; '''Bobby Hughes''' is a successful male model and the leader of his international terrorist group. Victor engages in a bisexual [[threesome]] with him and with Jamie Fields.&lt;ref&gt;''Glamorama'', pp.334–340.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lauren Hynde''' from ''The Rules of Attraction'' also reappears, having become a successful actress with ties to Hughes' terrorist organisation; other ''Rules'' characters appear (e.g., in flashback) such as '''Bertrand''', who is now a terrorist also.

== Adaptations ==
In 1999, the contemporary Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]] wrote a composition for chamber ensemble entitled ''[[Glamorama Spies]]'', which was inspired by the novel.

{{quote|In ''Glamorama'' by Bret Easton Ellis, the main character is constantly spied on and, even before his consciousness becomes aware of it, he is constantly in an anxious state. Anxiolytics and some romantic intervals are not enough to stop the sensation that he's always late for something and that he's progressively losing his sense of reality. I was reading the book when [[Sentieri selvaggi]] asked me for this piece and going from reading to writing seemed almost inevitable. Therefore, if at times you feel some hints at emotion, think about the second to last sentence of the book: "The stars are real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cantaloupemusic.com/albums/acdc |title="AC/DC", Sentieri Selvaggi |publisher=[[Cantaloupe Music]] |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Lorenzo Ferrero}}

''[[Glitterati (film)|Glitterati]]'' is a [[2004 in film|2004]] film directed by [[Roger Avary]] assembled from the 70 hours of video footage shot for the European sequence of ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]''. It expands upon the minimally detailed and rapidly recapped story told by Victor Ward, portrayed by [[Kip Pardue]], upon his return to the United States after having travelled extensively around Europe. In regard to expanding upon those events, the film acts as a connecting bridge between ''The Rules of Attraction'' and the upcoming film adaptation set to be directed by Avary.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Avary has called ''Glitterati'' a "pencil sketch of what will ultimately be the oil painting of ''Glamorama''."{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 2009, [[Audible.com]] produced an audio version of ''Glamorama'', narrated by [[Jonathan Davis (audiobook narrator)|Jonathan Davis]], as part of its ''Modern Vanguard'' line of audiobooks.

In 2010, when a film adaptation of ''Glamorama'' was mentioned in an interview with Movieline.com, Bret Easton Ellis commented, "I think the days of being able to make that movie are over." From the same interview, Ellis mentioned that an idea for a mini-series adaptation was brought forth to [[HBO]] though it was ultimately declined and further stating the movie would be left in Roger Avary's hands if one was to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Kyle |date=19 May 2010 |url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/19/bret-easton-ellis-on-rules-of-attraction-and-its-sexy-illicit-spinoff-youll-never-see/ |title=Bret Easton Ellis on The Rules of Attraction and Its Sexy, Illicit Spinoff You'll Never See |publisher=[[Movieline]] |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2011, Bret Easton Ellis reported on Twitter the following: 

{{quote|Just finished reading [[Roger Avary]]'s adaptation of "Glamorama" which he will direct next year. Hilarious, horrific, sad. He's a mad genius.}}

===''Zoolander'' controversy===
Fans have noted similarities to the 2001 [[Ben Stiller]] comedy ''[[Zoolander]]''. Ellis stated that he is aware of the similarities, and went on to say that he considered and attempted to take legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationleafblower.com/blog/archives/2005/09/the_better_you_1.html |publisher=InformationLeafblower.com |accessdate=2013-08-06 |title=The Better You Look, The More You Blog |date=15 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis was asked about the similarities in a 2005 BBC interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A6127427 |publisher=[[Collective (BBC)]] |title=Bret Easton Ellis Interview |date=13 October 2005 |last=Aftab |first=Kalem |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the response to the question, he said that he is unable to discuss the similarities due to an out-of-court settlement.

==Reception==
Much criticism of the novel noted its length. ''Time''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Joel Stein noted "The idea—models so [[solipsism|solipsistic]] that they become terrorists—is a good-enough one for a short story of 15 pages, but it's unsustainable at 482." He describes the book's first 185 pages as "inanely repetitive".&lt;ref name=TimeEllis&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990096,00.html#ixzz0sHb8ZK00|title=Glamorama|last=Stein|first=Joel|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1999-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' opines "It's like reading [[society page|Page Six]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'', but for 482 pages."&lt;ref name=EW1/&gt; One reviewer found the opening scenes "funny enough" although noted that it "gets tired easily".&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; Contrarily, the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' felt "the satiric early half is Ellis in peak form, the thriller-style second half is less successful." In fact, the humour in the novel was praised by multiple critics. The ''Star Tribune'' notes Victor's lack of depth, [[malapropism]]s, overuse of the word "baby" and the novel's "enchantingly disaffected monotone" of "a been-there-done-that [[Valspeak|Valleyspeak]]". Hanson felt that the horror elements in the "labyrinthian" thriller section of the novel seemed "recycled from ''American Psycho''."&lt;ref name=StarTribune/&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' also state their preference for the "first 189 pages".&lt;ref name=EW1/&gt; Contrarily, the ''New York Times'' felt that the book was devoid of fun, where even the blackest satire (e.g. [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''Loved One'') are more humorous.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

''EW'' places ''Glamorama'' within an emerging tradition of celebrity satire, noting "the glitterati are the satirical target du jour, what with [[Woody Allen]]'s limp, oral-sex-filled film ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'', and Jay McInerney's clever novel ''Model Behavior''" (both 1998).&lt;ref name=EW1/&gt; McInerney (a friend of Ellis) noted the novel's comparative darkness to his own ''Model Behaviour'' (also about 90s nightlife and  supermodels), published the same year, saying "I deliberately wrote a comic novel because you don't go chasing butterflies with sledgehammers". (Regarding McInerney's novel, Stein had felt that the novelist's attempt at a [[zeitgeist]] novel was one "looking at the '90s through an '80s lens".)&lt;ref name=TimeMcInerney/&gt; ''Harvard Crimson'' noted, similar to McInerney, that "Celebrity by itself teeters so often into self-parody that it seems too easy to bash it" but remarks that "Fortunately, Ellis does more than that injecting ''Glamorama'' with a sharper plot than those of earlier novels, a plot which kicks in about a quarter of the way into the novel."&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; The ''New York Times'' question the choice of subject matter as well: "Ellis's satirical message is, essentially, a one-liner, and hardly an original one at that – celebrity culture is vapid, yes, and?" The reviewer furthermore suggested "''Glamorama'' is itself just another artifact of the culture it pretends to criticize."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

The book's style is summarized by one reviewer as "a book that reads like a movie",&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt; and another notes that Ellis' writing "can be sharp", and succeeds in creating a "creepy sense of dread about our culture". On its influence, ''Time'' felt that the novel's "contribution" to the world comes in Victor's catchphrase, which they describe as [[Tom Wolfe]]an.&lt;ref name=TimeEllis/&gt; In an otherwise damning review, the ''New York Times'' commented "[Ellis] has an uncannily keen eye for the tiny details of the lives of the abel-obsessed yuppies and would-be celebs he's sending up".&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; A CNN reviewer felt, upon reading the book, that "Bret Easton Ellis is a gifted writer"; he praised his "unflinching eye" in capturing the details of "the ensemble worn by a notorious clothes horse, or the grisly aftermath of a hotel bombing, or the graphic details of a [[Ménage à trois|menage a trois]] {{sic}}."&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; The world Ellis evokes, through the eyes of the male model, ''Harvard Crimson'' notes is one "where no one has any emotions beyond the visceral response, where all the sex scenes are described in purely pornographic terms."&lt;ref name=HarvardCrimson/&gt;

A.J. Jacobs of ''Entertainment Weekly'' did not enjoy the book's more "meta" conceits, and gives the novel a 'C'.&lt;ref name=EW1/&gt; Daniel Mendelsohn of the ''New York Times'' opines derisively that "Like its predecessors, ''Glamorama'' is meant to be a withering report on the soul-destroying emptiness of late-century American consumer culture, chichi downtown division; but the only lesson you're likely to take away from it is the even more depressing classic American morality tale about how premature stardom is more of a curse than a blessing for young writers."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; The CNN reviewer concludes "in the end, "Glamorama" is less than the sum of its parts".&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

Ellis himself has claimed that, as of 2018, the novel has failed to break even for its US publisher, Knopf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/bret-easton-ellis-future-fiction-olah/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Meda Dau Doka''''' or '''''God Bless Fiji''''' is the [[national anthem]] of [[Fiji]]. The melody was adapted from a 1911 hymn by [[C. Austin Miles|Charles Austin Miles]] entitled ''[[Dwelling in Beulah Land]]''. The lyrics and music were composed by Michael Francis Alexander Prescott and adopted upon independence in 1970.

The [[English language|English]] and [[Fijian language|Fijian]] lyrics are not translations of each other, and in fact have very little in common.

==English lyrics==

Blessing grant oh God of nations on the isles of Fiji&lt;br /&gt;
As we stand united under noble banner blue&lt;br /&gt;
And we honour and defend the cause of freedom ever&lt;br /&gt;
Onward march together&lt;br /&gt;
God bless Fiji

CHORUS:&lt;br /&gt;
For Fiji, ever Fiji, let our voices ring with pride&lt;br /&gt;
For Fiji, ever Fiji, her name hails far and wide,&lt;br /&gt;
A land of freedom, hope and glory, to endure what ever befalls&lt;br /&gt;
May God bless Fiji&lt;br /&gt;
Forever more!

Blessing grant, oh God of nations, on the isles of Fiji&lt;br /&gt;
Shores of golden sand and sunshine, happiness and song&lt;br /&gt;
Stand united, we of Fiji, fame and glory ever&lt;br /&gt;
Onward march together&lt;br /&gt;
God bless Fiji.

==Fijian lyrics- Translated==

Let us show our pride and honour our nation&lt;br /&gt;
Where righteous people reside&lt;br /&gt;
Where prosperity and fellowship may persevere&lt;br /&gt;
Abandon deeds that are immoral

CHORUS:&lt;br /&gt;
Let Fiji live on&lt;br /&gt;
And progress onwards&lt;br /&gt;
May our leaders be honourable men&lt;br /&gt;
Let them lead our people&lt;br /&gt;
To great things&lt;br /&gt;
And bring an end to all things immoral&lt;br /&gt;

Let us show pride and honour our nation&lt;br /&gt;
Where righteous people reside&lt;br /&gt;
Where prosperity and fellowship may persevere&lt;br /&gt;
Abandon deeds that are immoral

The burden of change lie on your shoulders youth of Fiji&lt;br /&gt;
Be the strength to cleanse our nation&lt;br /&gt;
Be wary and not harbour malice &lt;br /&gt;
For we must abandon such sentiments forever

==Fiji-Hindi Lyrics==
He jagdishwar, kripa karo tum Fiji desh pe apne&lt;br /&gt;
Ahle watan hum teri sharan mein, teri dhwaja ke neehe&lt;br /&gt;

Yeh Fiji, hamara Fiji &lt;br /&gt;
Hum sab mil gaate rahe&lt;br /&gt;

Dharti hai apni, azaadi, asha aur garva ki &lt;br /&gt;
Kripa rahe prabhu ki, Fiji par sarwada

==Proposed change==
In August 2008, the draft version of the ''[[People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress]]'', a government document intended to supplement the Constitution, recommended a change in the national anthem. It suggested that the national anthem should be in the country's three main languages: Fijian, [[Fiji Hindi|Hindi]] and English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=97186 "Charter proposes common name"], ''Fiji Times'', August 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''grindhouse'''  or '''action house'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=afsiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38&amp;lpg=PT38#v=onepage&amp;q=%22action+house%22+cinema|title=Dictionary of Jargon (Routledge Revivals)|first=Jonathon|last=Green|date=2 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American term for a theater that mainly shows [[exploitation film]]s. According to historian David Church, this theater type was named after the "grind policy", a film-programming strategy dating back to the early 1920s which continuously showed films at cut-rate ticket prices that typically rose over the course of each day. This exhibition practice was markedly different from the era's more common practice of fewer shows per day and graduated pricing for different seating sections in large urban theaters, which were typically studio-owned.

== History ==
Due to these theaters' proximity to controversially sexualized forms of entertainment like [[American burlesque|burlesque]], the term "grindhouse" has often been erroneously associated with burlesque theaters in urban entertainment areas such as [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=Church-11&gt;{{cite journal |author=Church, David |title=From Exhibition to Genre: The Case of Grind-House Films |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=50 |number=4 |date=Summer 2011 |url=https://www.academia.edu/6632128/From_Exhibition_to_Genre_The_Case_of_Grind-House_Films |accessdate=24 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511194513/http://www.academia.edu/6632128/From_Exhibition_to_Genre_The_Case_of_Grind-House_Films |archivedate=11 May 2018 |df= |doi=10.1353/cj.2011.0053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Church, David |url=https://www.academia.edu/6632405/Grindhouse_Nostalgia_Memory_Home_Video_and_Exploitation_Film_Fandom |title=Grindhouse Nostalgia: Memory, Home Video, and Exploitation Film Fandom |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |date=2015 |isbn= |accessdate=24 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511194513/http://www.academia.edu/6632405/Grindhouse_Nostalgia_Memory_Home_Video_and_Exploitation_Film_Fandom |archivedate=11 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where "[[:wikt:bump and grind|bump and grind]]" dancing and [[striptease]] were featured.&lt;ref name="grindhouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grindhouse.com |title=Grindhouse |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2014 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805062644/http://www.grindhouse.com/ |archivedate=5 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film ''[[Lady of Burlesque]]'' (1943) one of the characters refers to one such burlesque theatre on 42nd Street as a "grindhouse," but Church points out the primary definition in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is for a movie theater distinguished by three criteria:&lt;ref name=Church-11 /&gt;
# Shows a variety of films, in continuous succession
# Low admission fees
# Films screened are frequently of poor quality or low (artistic) merit

Church states the first use of the term "grind house" was in a 1923 ''Variety'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url= |title=Two-a-Day Policy Failure in Canadian Grind Houses |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 December 1923 |magazine=Variety |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may have adopted the contemporary slang usage of "grind" to refer to the actions of [[Barker (occupation)|barkers]] exhorting potential patrons to enter the venue.&lt;ref name=Church-11 /&gt;

Double, triple, and "all night" bills on a single admission charge often encouraged patrons to spend long periods of time in the theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/autobiography-channel/2010/feb/17/life-on-downtowns-grindhouse-theater-row-1978-1982/# |title=Last of the all-nighters — My life on downtown's Grindhouse Theater Row in the 70s and 80s |author=Sanford, Jay Allen |date=17 February 2010 |newspaper=San Diego Reader |accessdate=24 March 2017 |quote=I spent my first night in [[San Diego]] sleeping in the back row of '''the Cabrillo Theater'''.&lt;br /&gt;{{pad|1.0em}}In that pre-[[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego|Gaslamp]], pre-[[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] [[Downtown San Diego|downtown]] of 1978 or so, half a dozen wonderfully eclectic – if mildly disreputable – late night movie houses operated within a few blocks of each other.

Because grindhouse theaters were associated with a lower class audience, grindhouse theaters gradually became perceived as disreputable places that showed disreputable films, regardless of the variety of films&amp;nbsp;— including subsequent-run Hollywood films&amp;nbsp;— that were actually screened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2007/04/this_old_grindhouse.html |title=This Old Grindhouse |author=Hendrix, Grady |date=6 April 2007 |website=Slate |accessdate=24 March 2017 |quote=Because grindhouse theaters were nasty places, full of nasty people, and most of us wouldn't be caught dead in one. The few folks who were there for the actual movies were either poverty tourists or cinephiles who didn't notice anything except the flickering screen, and, in many cases, their cinephilia had burned out their sense of discrimination, because a lot of the movies that showed in grindhouses were bad. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325030908/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2007/04/this_old_grindhouse.html |archivedate=25 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar second-run screenings are held at [[discount theater]]s and [[neighborhood theatre]]s; the distinguishing characteristics of the "grindhouse" are its typical urban setting and the programming of first-run films of low merit, not predominantly second-run films which had received wide releases.

===Television pressure===
The introduction of [[television]] greatly eroded the audience for local and single-screen movie theaters, many of which were built during the cinema boom of the 1930s. In combination with [[urban decay]] after [[white flight]] out of older city areas in the mid to late 1960s, changing economics forced these theaters to either close or offer something that television could not. In the 1970s, many of these theaters became venues for exploitation films,&lt;ref name="grindhouse"/&gt; either adult [[Pornographic film|pornography]] and sleaze, or [[slasher film|slasher]] horror and dubbed [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] [[Cinema of Hong Kong|films from Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/features/94-fango-lifestyle/4154-cult-couture-the-grind-house.html|title=Cult Couture: THE GRIND-HOUSE|publisher=Fangoria|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014094105/http://www.fangoria.com/features/94-fango-lifestyle/4154-cult-couture-the-grind-house.html|archivedate=2009-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
{{main|Exploitation film}}
Films shot for and screened at grindhouses characteristically contain large amounts of sex, violence, or bizarre subject matter.  One featured genre were "roughies" or [[sexploitation film]]s, a mix of sex, violence and sadism. Quality varied, but low budget production values and poor print quality were common.  Critical opinions varied regarding typical grindhouse fare, but many films acquired cult following and critical praise.

===Decline===
By the 1980s, home video and cable movie channels threatened to render the grindhouse obsolete. By the end of the decade, these theaters had vanished from Los Angeles's [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]] and [[Hollywood Boulevard]], New York City's [[Times Square]] and San Francisco's [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]].

By the mid-1990s, these particular theaters had all but disappeared from the United States. Very few exist today.

==Homage==
The [[Robert Rodriguez]] film ''[[Planet Terror]]'' and the [[Quentin Tarantino]] film ''[[Death Proof]]'', which were released together as ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' in 2007, were created as an homage to the cinematic genre. Similar films such as ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]'' (also by Rodriguez), ''[[Chillerama]]'', ''[[Drive Angry]]'' and ''[[Sign Gene]]'' have appeared since.

''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'', ''[[The House of the Dead: Overkill]]'', ''[[Wet (video game)|Wet]]'',  ''[[Shank (video game)|Shank]]'', ''[[Rage (video game)|RAGE]]'', ''[[Shadows of the Damned]]'' and ''[[Zombie Hunter (film)|Zombie Hunter]]'' are several examples of video games that serve as homages to the grindhouse movies.

The author Jacques Boyreau released the book ''Portable Grindhouse: The Lost Art of the VHS Box'' in 2009 about the history of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34797/attend-portable-grindhouse-the-lost-art-vhs-box-launch-party-seattle|title=Attend the Portable Grindhouse: The Lost Art of the VHS Box Launch Party in Seattle|author=Heather Buckley|publisher=DreadCentral|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205035551/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34797/attend-portable-grindhouse-the-lost-art-vhs-box-launch-party-seattle|archivedate=2009-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is also the focus of the 2010 documentary ''[[American Grindhouse]]''.

The [[Syfy]] TV show ''[[Blood Drive (TV series)|Blood Drive]]'' takes inspiration from grindhouse, with each episode featuring a different theme.

The novel ''[[Our Lady of the Inferno]]'' is both written as an homage to grindhouse films and features several chapters that take place in a grindhouse theater.&lt;ref&gt;[https://diaboliquemagazine.com/fangoria-presents-to-reissue-our-lady-of-the-inferno/ Lee, Izzy.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''''indigitamenta''''' were [[List of Roman deities|lists of deities]] kept by the [[College of Pontiffs]] to assure that the correct divine names were invoked for public prayers. These lists or books probably described the nature of the various deities who might be called on under particular circumstances, with specifics about the sequence of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invocation]]. The earliest ''indigitamenta'', like many other aspects of Roman religion, were attributed to [[Numa Pompilius]], second [[king of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 69–71, with reference to [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 2.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|books of the Pontiffs]] are known only through scattered passages preserved throughout [[Latin literature]]. [[Varro]] is assumed to have drawn on direct knowledge of the lists in writing his now-fragmentary theological books, which were used as a reference by the [[Church Fathers]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular, Book 14 of the non-extant ''Antiquitates [[Res divina|rerum divinarum]]''; see Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; for their mocking catalogues of minor deities.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Johnson, "The Return of [[Mutunus Tutunus|Tutunus]]", ''Arethusa'' (1992) 173–179; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[William Warde Fowler]] noted,
&lt;blockquote&gt;the good Fathers tumbled the whole collection about sadly in their search for material for their mockery, having no historical or scientific object in view; with the result that it now resembles the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope, and can no longer be re-arranged on the original Varronian plan.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Religious Experience,'' p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Georg Wissowa]], however, asserted that Varro's lists were not ''indigitamenta'', but ''di certi'', gods whose function could still be identified with certainty, since by the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30 BC)|late Republic]] some of the most archaic deities of the Roman pantheon were not widely cultivated and understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Wissowa]], ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'' (unknown edition), vol. 13, p. 218 [https://books.google.com/books?id=069Znq8SPY0C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=indigitation+OR+indigitamenta+intitle:encyclopedia+intitle:of+intitle:religion+intitle:and+intitle:ethics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UoWaTOm4JcqdnAePg_Aa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=indigitation%20OR%20indigitamenta%20intitle%3Aencyclopedia%20intitle%3Aof%20intitle%3Areligion%20intitle%3Aand%20intitle%3Aethics&amp;f=false online.] See also [[Kurt Latte]], ''Roemische Religionsgeschichte'' (Munich, 1960), pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Another likely source for the [[patristic]] catalogues is the lost work ''De indigitamentis'' of [[Granius Flaccus]], Varro's contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''Div. inst.'' 1.6.7; [[Censorinus]] 3.2; [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "The Theological Efforts of the Roman Upper Classes in the First Century B.C.", ''Classical Philology'' 79 (1984), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]] collated the standard modern list of ''indigitamenta'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 1, pp. 187–233.&lt;/ref&gt; though other scholars may differ with him on some points.

==Form==
It is unclear whether the written ''indigitamenta'' contained complete prayer formularies, or simply an index of names.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Klinghardt, "Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion." ''Numen'' 46 (1999), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; If formulas of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invocation]], the ''indigitamenta'' were probably ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#precatio|precationum]] [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmina]]'', chants or hymns of address.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Religious Experience'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus]] defines them as ''incantamenta'', incantations, and ''indicia'', signs or intimations.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus, ''Festi epitome'' p. 101 (edition of Lindsay); see p. 84 in the 1832 [https://books.google.com/books?id=aVhAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=incantamenta+inauthor:Paulus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rR2STMXQEYKlnQe-0MHjCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=incantamenta%20inauthor%3APaulus&amp;f=false Teubner edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A further point of uncertainty is whether these names represent distinct minor entities, or [[epithets]] pertaining to an aspect of a major deity's sphere of influence, that is, an [[wikt:indigitation|indigitation]], or name intended to "fix" or focalize the action of the god so invoked.&lt;ref&gt;William Warde Fowler, ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; If the former, the ''indigitamenta'' might be described as indexing "significant names which bespoke a specialized divine function," for which the German term ''Sondergötter'' is sometimes used;&lt;ref&gt;[[Usener|H. Usener]], ''Goetternamen'' Bonn 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, [[Vagitanus]] gives the newborn its first cry ''(vagitus)''.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Feeney, ''Literature and Religion at Rome: Cultures, Contexts, and Beliefs'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; If the ''indigitamenta'' record invocational epithets, however, an otherwise obscure deity such as [[Robigalia|Robigus]], the red god of [[wheat rust]], should perhaps be understood as an indigitation of [[Mars (god)|Mars]], red god of war and agriculture;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', pp. 89–91 (on the [[Robigalia]]); Eli Edward Burriss, "The Place of the Dog in Superstition as Revealed in Latin Literature", ''Classical Philology'' 30 (1935), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], "a deity known apparently only to the priests and the learned," would be according to [[Macrobius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12 1.12.]&lt;/ref&gt; an indigitation of the [[Bona Dea]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roscher]], however, does not consider Robigus and Maia to have been part of the ''indigitamenta''.

==Roscher's list of ''indigitamenta''==
Many of the ''indigitamenta'' are involved in the cycle of conception, birth, and child development (marked &lt;small&gt;''[[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|BCh]]''&lt;/small&gt;); see [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities]]. Several appear in a list of twelve helper gods of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] as an agricultural goddess&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Georgics]]'' 1.21.&lt;/ref&gt; or are named elsewhere as having specialized agricultural functions (&lt;small&gt;''[[List of Roman agricultural deities|Ag]]''&lt;/small&gt;). Gods not appearing on either of those lists are described briefly here, or are more fully described in their own articles as linked.

An '''interpretation centre''', '''interpretive centre''', or '''visitor interpretive centre''' is an institution for dissemination of knowledge of [[natural heritage|natural]] or [[cultural heritage]]. Interpretation centres are a kind of new-style museum, often associated with [[visitor center|visitor centre]]s or [[ecomuseum]]s, and located in connection to cultural, [[historic site|historic]] or natural sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izquierdo Tugas|first1=Pere|last2=Juan Tresserras|first2=Jordi|last3=Matamala Mellin|first3=Juan Carlos, eds.|title=Heritage Interpretation Centres, The Hicira Handbook|url=http://www.diba.cat/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=63952a92-928c-4eb9-a698-587bea5cf637&amp;groupId=99058|publisher=Barcelona: Diputació de Barcelona|accessdate=August 20, 2014|date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maltainsideout"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Di Puccio|first1=Francesca|title=The Fortifications Interpretation Centre: a must-visit in Valletta|url=http://www.maltainsideout.com/24307/fortifications-interpretation-centre/|website=Malta Inside Out|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404105625/http://www.maltainsideout.com/24307/fortifications-interpretation-centre/|archivedate=4 April 2016|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation centres use different means of [[communication]] to enhance the understanding of heritage. To aid and stimulate the discovery process and the visitor's intellectual and emotional connection to heritage, the main presentation strategy tends to be user-friendly and interactive, and often use [[Scenography|scenographic]] exhibitions and [[multimedia]] programs. Many interpretation centres have temporary exhibitions related to a specific aspect of the site.&lt;ref name="maltaindepedent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|title=Exhibiting A forgotten national monument|publisher=[[The Malta Independent]]|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-02-28/news/exhibiting-a-forgotten-national-monument-270999/|date=28 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031071128/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-02-28/news/exhibiting-a-forgotten-national-monument-270999/|archivedate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maltesegovernment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortifications Interpretation Centre|url=https://restoration.gov.mt/en/fic/Pages/Fortifications-Interpretation-Centre.aspx|website=Restoration Directorate|publisher=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201214546/https://restoration.gov.mt/en/fic/Pages/Fortifications-Interpretation-Centre.aspx|archivedate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Whitehorse entrance Yukon Beringia.JPG|thumb|left|[[Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre]]]]
An interpretation centre can be a viable solution for effective communication of heritage information in municipalities and rural areas where resources may not exist to establish a traditional, full-scale [[museum]], and where heritage can be an important factor for tourism development.&lt;ref name="maltaindepedent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maltesegovernment"/&gt;

Unlike traditional museums, interpretation centres do not usually aim to collect, conserve and study objects; they are specialized institutions for communicating the significance and meaning of heritage. They work to educate and raise awareness. Non-core jobs as [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]] and [[research]] are services usually done by specialized, external entities.&lt;ref name="maltaindepedent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maltesegovernment"/&gt;

[[Image:The Hamptons.jpg|frame|right|James Merrill's childhood home was a 50-room mansion called "The Orchard," located in [[Southampton (village), New York|Southampton, New York]]]]

'''"Lost in Translation"''' is a [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[James Merrill]] (1926–1995), one of the most studied and celebrated of his shorter works. It was originally published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine on April 8, 1974, and published in book form in [[1976 in literature|1976]] in ''[[Divine Comedies]]''.

The poem opens with a description of a summer Merrill spent as a child in a great house in [[The Hamptons]], with his [[governess]], waiting patiently for a rented wooden [[jigsaw puzzle]] to arrive in the mail from an [[Upper East Side]] [[Manhattan]] puzzle rental shop.

"Lost in Translation" is Merrill's most anthologized poem, and has been widely praised by literary critics including [[Harold Bloom]].

==Background==

Merrill wrote in his lifetime mainly for a select group of friends, fans, and critics, and expected readers of "Lost in Translation" to have some knowledge of his biography. Born in New York City, Merrill was the son of the founder of [[Merrill Lynch|the world's largest brokerage firm]]. He enjoyed a privileged upbringing in economic and cultural terms, although his intelligence and exceptional financial circumstances often made him feel lonely as a child. Merrill was the only son of [[Charles E. Merrill]] and Hellen Ingram. (Merrill had two older half siblings from his father's first marriage.)

Given that his parents were often preoccupied, his father with [[business]], his mother with [[socialite|social obligations]], Merrill developed a number of close relationships with household staff. "Lost in Translation" describes a profound childhood bond with the woman who taught him [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. Merrill's parents would divorce in 1939, when Merrill was thirteen years old, in a scandal that was front-page news on the ''[[New York Times]]''.

Not only is "Lost in Translation" a poem about a child putting together a jigsaw puzzle, it is an interpretive puzzle, designed to engage a reader's interest in solving mysteries at various narrative levels.

The poem is dedicated to Merrill's friend, the distinguished poet, critic, and translator [[Richard Howard]]. It consists of 215 lines with an additional four line [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]. The poem is mainly in unrhymed [[pentameter]] but includes a section in [[Ruba'i|Rubaiyat]] [[quatrain]] [[stanza]]s. "Lost in Translation" may be classified as an [[autobiographical]] [[narrative]] or [[narrative poem]], but is better understood as a series of [[story within a story|embedded narratives (stories within a story)]].

== Epigraph ==
Unusual for Merrill, the poem bears a mysterious four-line epigraph in [[German language|German]], which is printed without [[translation]] or [[Attribution (journalism)|attribution]]:

: ''Diese Tage, die leer dir scheinen''
: ''und wertlos für das All,''
: ''haben Wurzeln zwischen den Steinen''
: ''und trinken dort überall.''

In [[James Merrill]]'s own English version of this epigraph (published in 1985 in ''[[Late Settings]]''), these four lines are translated into English as follows:

: ''These days which, like yourself,''
: ''Seem empty and effaced''
: ''Have avid roots that delve''
: ''To work deep in the waste.''

== Synopsis ==
[[Image:Alsace map.png|thumb|right|200px|'''"Mademoiselle does borders...."''' Merrill's childhood governess was from [[Alsace]], on the border between France and Germany.]]

In "Lost in Translation", the narrator's puzzle-making companion is his French [[governess]], whom he repeatedly refers to as ''Mademoiselle.'' Part mother, part teacher, part [[nanny]], part servant, she is described by Merrill as "stout, plain, carrot-haired, devout."

At one point in the poem, Mademoiselle speaks the same phrase in French and in German. In addition to playing with the boy's [[marionette]]s and doing jigsaw puzzles with him, Mademoiselle is teaching the young James Merrill languages which would be critical to making him the sophisticated and urbane [[lyric poet]] of later life. By giving name, in several languages, to objects and tasks around the home, Mademoiselle helps the young James Merrill come to understand a doubleness about language itself, that objects and activities can have different names and connotations across languages.

From the child's point of view, the "puzzle" goes well beyond what is taking place on the card table. Merrill is puzzling through the mystery of his existence, puzzling through the mystery of what the world is, what objects are, what people do in life. An unspoken puzzle is solved when the young Merrill determines what his relationship to Mademoiselle is, given the frequent absence of his own mother. Mademoiselle knows "her place", he writes, indicating his first consciousness of his own class privilege, as well as (perhaps) the limits placed on Mademoiselle's maternal role.

Yet other puzzles are not solved until later in life. At one point the narrator's voice modulates into that of an adult. We find out that Mademoiselle hid her true origins from the boy (and from his family) because of the political tensions leading up to 1939 and to the outbreak of World War II. Mademoiselle claimed to be French and hid her German or [[Alsace|Alsatian]] birth. She presumably gained a French [[family name]] through marriage to a soldier who died in the [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I (1914–1918). Mademoiselle could let no one know she was German for fear of losing her job and her employers' trust. This explains the fact that Merrill's own French, learned in imitation of his governess, was always spoken with a slight German accent. The boy finds out the full truth only as an adult, after a chance conversation with Mademoiselle's grown nephew, a [[United Nations]] [[Interpreting|interpreter]], who tells him the story of the governess's true origins.

The poem includes several other secondary narratives, including a section in which the puzzle itself is put together. Inspired by [[Omar Khayyám]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' quatrains, Merrill describes an imaginary [[harem]]-like 19th century [[orientalism|Orientalist]] painting, by an alleged follower of [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], that begins to appear as the puzzle pieces are put together. When the puzzle is nearly done, the piece that was missing the whole time is found under the table at the boy's feet. The missing piece is, in fact, an image of the boy's feet. When it is put in place, the portrait of the little boy in the puzzle is finally complete.

=== Puzzle ===
[[Image:rilke.jpg|thumb|200px|left|'''"This grown man reenters, wearing grey..."''']]

At the center of the poem is a mysterious sequence in which the poet, attending a present-day [[séance]], describes a [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]] who is able to divine that a piece of a wooden jigsaw puzzle has been concealed inside a box.

To understand "Lost in Translation", the reader must work out and solve a [[puzzle]] in the narrative text, revealed by a confession Merrill the adult makes at the end of the poem. The little boy has apparently kept a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, in the shape of a [[palm tree]], throughout his life. This fact has jogged the memory in Merrill of a poem called "Palme" by the French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist]] poet [[Paul Valéry]] (1871–1945), and that memory in turn has reminded Merrill of a German translation he has once seen of that same poem by poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926).

The poet knows that he has seen and read the Rilke translation before, because he can picture the words on the page. "The owlet umlaut peeps and hoots/ Above the open vowel", Merrill writes, in some of the poem's most quoted lines. Yet despite remembering the experience of reading the Rilke translation, he cannot locate a copy in [[Athens, Greece]] (where Merrill and his partner [[David Noyes Jackson|David Jackson]] were living six months of the year), and begins to doubt whether it exists except in his imagination. The poem "Lost in Translation" assumes the form of a letter to Richard Howard seeking an actual copy of that translation.

=== Solution ===
[[Image:1859-Martinique.web.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''"An inchling, innocently branching [[Arecaceae|palm]]..."''']]

But the translation turns out not to have been lost, or a figment of the poet's imagination, for it is used to write the poem "Lost In Translation." The German epigraph at the beginning of the poem offers the key clue here. The four lines come from that "lost" German translation by Rilke of Valéry's "Palme". (Merrill's own English translation of "Palme" is the source of the translated quatrain above. See Merrill's "Paul Valéry: ''Palme''" in ''[[Late Settings]]'', 1985.)

The original in French:

: ''Ces jours qui te semblent vides
: ''Et perdus pour l'univers
: ''Ont des racines avides
: ''Qui travaillent les déserts.

from Paul Valéry, Charmes (1922) [http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Palme Palme classical dizain 7th Stanza ]

The solution to the puzzle of the poem is hidden in plain sight all along. "Nothing's lost", Merrill suggests, when it comes to translating experience or memory, at least according to the way Merrill understands our human experience. The poem's coda salutes the power of the transformative imagination to recover meaning in the world from all we see and remember. Its language and phrasing offer a veiled tribute by Merrill to the poet he most admired from his father's generation, [[Wallace Stevens]] (author of "The Palm at the End of the Mind"):

:But nothing's lost. Or else: all is translation
:And every bit of us is lost in it...
:And in that loss a self-effacing tree,
:Color of context, imperceptibly
:Rustling with its angel, turns the waste
:To shade and fiber, milk and memory.

'''Mystery plays''' and '''miracle plays''' (they are distinguished as two different forms although the terms are often used interchangeably&lt;ref&gt;'Properly speaking, Mysteries deal with Gospel events only). Miracle Plays, on the other hand, are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' {{cite book|last=Ward|first=Augustus William|title=History of English dramatic literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, England|year=1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are among the earliest formally developed [[Play (theatre)|plays]] in [[medieval Europe]]. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of [[Bible]] stories in [[Church (building)|churches]] as [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] with accompanying [[antiphon]]al song. They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vernacular Drama | Medieval Drama." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208054447/https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |archive-date=8 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from ''[[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]]'' used in its sense of ''[[miracle]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=December 2009|chapter=mystery, n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an occasionally quoted derivation is from ''ministerium'', meaning ''[[craft]]'', and so the 'mysteries' or plays performed by the [[craft guilds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gassner|first=John|author2=Quinn, Edward|title=The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama|publisher=Methuen|location=London|year=1969|pages=203–204|chapter=England: middle ages|oclc=249158675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Mystery play 001.jpg|thumb|Mystery play, [[Flanders]], 15th century]]
As early as the fifth century living tableaux were introduced into sacred services.&lt;ref name=bellinger&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/medieval/bellinger001.html Bellinger, Martha Fletcher, "A Thousand Years Of Quiescence And The Beginnings Of Sacred Drama", ''A Short History of the Drama'', New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1927. pp. 115-21]&lt;/ref&gt;
The plays originated as simple ''[[Trope (religion)|tropes]]'', verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical dramas increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, as travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions organized by local communities became more common in the later Middle Ages.

The ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'' is the best known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his body.&lt;ref name=bellinger/&gt; These primitive forms were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Eventually the dramas moved from church to the exterior - the churchyard and the public marketplace. These early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.

In 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a [[Papal bull|papal edict]] forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play|Secunda Pastorum]]'' of the [[Wakefield Cycle]]. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.

These vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as [[York]], performed and produced by [[guild]]s, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin ''ministerium''&lt;!-- with 'i', misterium means mystery --&gt; meaning "occupation" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the establishment of the [[Church of England]] in 1534.

The mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play as well as provided actors with a dressing room as well as a stage&lt;ref&gt;"Mystery Play | Dramatic Genre." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 6 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as ''Corpus Christi cycles''. These cycles were often performed during the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] and their overall design drew attention to Christ's life and his redemption for all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.

==English mystery plays==
[[File:04b266 adamandeve.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise in a performance by the Players of St Peter]]
There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays;&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110111182223/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/medieval/mystery_plays.php ]&lt;/ref&gt; although these collections are sometimes referred to as "cycles," it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants; there are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at [[Wakefield]]; the [[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]], now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament [[Coventry Mystery Plays|cycle acted at Coventry]] and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of [[Mary Magdalene]], ''[[The Brome Abraham and Isaac]]'' and a sixteenth-century play of the ''Conversion of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'' exist, all hailing from [[East Anglia]]. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]], and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s. The York [[mercery|mercers]], for example, sponsored the ''Doomsday'' pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] from the carpenters' guild; the [[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and fishes]] miracle from the bakers; and the [[visit of the Magi]], with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on [[pageant wagon]]s. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the ''Second Shepherds' Play'' to [[Horbury|Horbery]] Shrogys &lt;ref&gt;http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?id=AnoTown&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=13&amp;division=div (line 454) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830231810/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?data=%2Flv1%2FArchive%2Fmideng-parsed&amp;division=div&amp;id=AnoTown&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;part=13&amp;tag=public |date=30 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is strongly suggestive. In "The London Burial Grounds" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to [[St Katherine Cree]] on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. [[Edmund Bonner]], Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncemeteries.co.uk/?page=holmes |title=The London Burial Grounds: Notes on their History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day -Mrs. Basil Holmes (St Katherine Cree) |publisher=Londoncemeteries.co.uk |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet "Wakefield Master" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing &amp;mdash; references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.

The best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is ''The Second Shepherds' Pageant'', a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', derived from the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.

The dramas of the [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods were developed out of mystery plays.

==Spanish mystery plays==

The [[Misteri d'Elx]] (in English, the [[Elx Mystery Play]] or [[Mystery Play of Elx]]) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of [[Elx]] (also known as [[Elche]]). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the [[Council of Trent]] eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

The oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a [[codex]] found in the library of the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the [[Biblical Magi]], three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/liturgical-drama |title=Liturgical drama: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spanish Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracle play==
Miracle plays, or ''Saint's plays,'' are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the [[saint]]s, particularly [[St. Nicholas]] or [[St. Mary]], into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|chapter=mystery play}}&lt;/ref&gt; however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances. [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], writing in the 19th century, notes that "especially in England, miracle [came] to stand for religious play in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite indeed book|last=Chambers|first=Robert|title=Cyclopaedia of English Literature|publisher=Robert Chambers|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|year=1844|oclc=311881902}}, quoted in {{cite book|last=Clopper|first=Lawrence M.|title=Drama, play, and game: English festive culture in the medieval and early modern period|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|pages=69–70|isbn=978-0-226-11030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornish language]] miracle plays were performed in [[plain-an-gwarry (theatre)|plain-an-gwarrys]]. To capture the attention of the audience, "the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining".&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/a2m/medieval/plain_an_gwarry/st_just/st_just.htm ''St Just Plain-an-Gwarry''.] Historic Cornwall. Retrieved 23 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern performances==
Mystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. The local cycles were revived in both [[York]] and [[Chester]] in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]], and are still performed by the local guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Margaret. [http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ The Plays and the Guilds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101125612/http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ |date=1 November 2015 }}, ''York Mystery Plays''&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the [[Lincoln mystery plays]],

In 1977 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] commissioned [[Tony Harrison]] to create ''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a re-working of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodsworth|first=Martin|date=9 January 1986|title=A poet in the land of as if|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]]), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison |first=Tony |authorlink= |title=The Mysteries |year=1985 |publisher=Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-13790-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions won [[Bill Bryden]] the "Best Director" title in both the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Theatre Awards]] and the [[Olivier Awards]] for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2011 as ''The Globe Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discovery-space/previous-productions/the-globe-mysteries The Globe Mysteries]. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Isango Ensemble]] produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London as ''The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso'', performing in a combination of the [[Xhosa language]], the [[Zulu language]], English, [[Latin]] and [[Afrikaans]]. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as ''The Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe.

The large cast also included [[Daniel MacPherson]], [[Thomas James Longley]] and [[Joseph McManners]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

[[File:Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional logotype.png|thumb|National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico) logo]]

The '''National Symphony Orchestra''' (''Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional'', OSN) is the most important [[classical music]] and [[symphonic]] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Torres-Chibras, Armando Ramon. 2002. "José Pablo Moncayo, Mexican Composer and Conductor: A Survey of His Life with a Historical Perspective of His Time." [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]] diss., [[University of Missouri]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. [[Ann Arbor]], MI: [[University Microfilms International]]. {{ISBN|0-493-66937-X}}, page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; With its origins traced back as 1881, it is the second-oldest symphony orchestra in the [[Americas|American]] continent along with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. The orchestra does not have a permanent venue but performs regularly in the Grand Hall of the Palace of Fine Arts ([[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]) in [[Mexico City]].

Not to be confused with the [[Orquesta Sinfónica del Estado de México]] (OSEM) or Symphony Orchestra of the State of Mexico, founded in 1971, the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, as a branch of the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]], was created by presidential decree of Miguel Alemán on 18 July 1947, under the name of National Conservatory Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name="Carlos Chávez 1950"&gt;Carlos Chávez, “La Sinfónica Nacional,” Nuestra Música 18 (Año 5, 1950): 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before that, however, there was a predecessor orchestra known as the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico (September 2, 1928 – March 8, 1949), a nonprofit organization founded and conducted by Mexican composer, conductor, teacher, journalist and visionary arts leader [[Carlos Chávez]]. On 1 August 1947, Chávez appointed Blas Galindo as the new director of the National Conservatory, official seat of the new orchestra. Chávez reports that the National Symphony Orchestra gave its first official performance on 30 October 1947 at the Palace of Fine Arts, under the baton of Eduardo Hernández Moncada, its first music and artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Sandi, Dos Años y Medio del INBA: Vol. II Departamento de música (Mexico City: Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes de la Secretaría de Educación Pública, 1950), 29–31. Carlos Chávez, as General Director of the INBA, was the person directly responsible for this report. He wrote the study about the OSN that appears in the first volume of this report (that dealt with the administrative structure of the INBA). Sandi, as head of the music department, signed the second volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another decree on April 25, 1949, changed the name of the ensemble to National Symphony Orchestra (Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional or OSN); first, to emphasize its professional character—it had the best musicians in the country—and to avoid confusing it with a student ensemble, despite Chávez's having from the very beginning considered the orchestra a national symphony, linked in some aspects to the most important music education institution, the National Conservatory; and second, Chávez wanted to highlight that “a National Symphony, by definition, is a State institution,” and the government had recognized the need to support an institution of public interest.&lt;ref name="Carlos Chávez 1950"/&gt;

==History of the Orchestra==
The social context that Mexico was living during the beginnings of the 20th century made the task of creating an orchestra difficult, so there were several attempts to form a national symphony orchestra.

===First period===
The [[orchestra]] has its roots back in 1881, when Alfredo Bablot, director of the [[Music]] [[College or university school of music|Conservatory]] (founded July 1, 1866) initiated the Conservatory Orchestra. When Bablot died, he was replaced by Carlos J. Menéses. In 1902 the orchestra had little support from the [[government]] of [[Porfirio Díaz]], but it suspended its activities in 1913, two years after Díaz's fall, because of the general instability in the country during the [[Mexican Revolution]].

===Second and third period===
After Gen. [[Venustiano Carranza]], took over the national government's seat back to Mexico City in 1915, the orchestra took the name of National Symphony, and depended from the Bellas Artes bureau, and its director during this period was Jesús Acuña, followed by composer [[Manuel M. Ponce]] but he declined and the orchestra suspended the concert seasons. Later, composer [[Julián Carrillo]], who was a very important figure in [[music history]] worldwide, was appointed as the Music Conservatory director, and took up the project for an orchestra again, and depended from the Conservatory, but because of lack of financial support from the government, the orchestra again finished its activities in 1924.

===Mexican Symphony Orchestra===
In 1928, the Mexican Symphony Orchestra was created, but the name changed shortly to Symphony Orchestra of Mexico (''Orquesta Sinfónica de México'') . This orchestra is more related to the current orchestra. Carlos Chávez was appointed as its first conductor, but it lacked of any financial support, besides that the orchestra wasn't being well administrated by the city's musician syndicate of that time. While Chávez conducted the orchestra, it meaning a flourishing period for the orchestral music in the country.

A private patronage was established and the orchestra could give its first concert. The date was September 2, 1928, and the place, the Iris Theatre. With 103 musicians on stage, the programme included [[Debussy]]´s ''[[Images pour orchestre|Ibéria]]'' [[Suite (music)|Suite]], Tello's ''[[Sonata]] [[Tragica]]'', [[Tchaikovsky]]´s ''[[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] in [[B-flat minor]]'' with Vilma Erenyi as [[Solo (music)|soloist]], and [[Strauss]]´ ''[[Don Juan]]''. Although the orchestra received financial support from the government, this was considered as a private one, not official, like it is constituted today. This is the most important point to consider the nature of this musical organization at the present time.

Mexican composer [[Silvestre Revueltas]], who was second in charge as assistant conductor, left the orchestra in 1935 to be the principal conductor of a newly created and short-lived National Symphony Orchestra that depended from the National Music Conservatory, but it closed in 1937 when Revueltas resigned.

===Creation of the INBA and establishment of the current orchestra===
On November 23, 1946, president [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]] proposed the creation of the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature (''Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura''), known by the acronym [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes|INBA]], and was formally opened on 1 January 1947, as a branch of the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]], (SEP) (Secretariat of Public Education). The first head of the INBA was Carlos Chávez, who created a new orchestra for the Conservatory (thus because the conservatory depended on the INBA administration). On January 19, 1949, Chávez resigned his job as conductor of the  Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, to spend more of his time composing and directing the INBA, but the orchestra didn't disappear, because Chávez succeeded in making the government recognize a national ensemble (working on this issue, since he was appointed as head of the INBA), so the actual organization known as National Symphony Orchestra of México was established, and Eduardo Hernández Moncada was designated its first conductor in 1947, José Pablo Moncayo replaced him in 1949.

===The orchestra from its creation to the present day===
Moncayo was succeeded in 1954 by Luis Herrera de la Fuente, who led the orchestra until 1972. During this period the orchestra had very important tours nationwide and worldwide, especially in Europe. In 1973 Chávez returned to conduct the orchestra but resigned in the first month due to internal conflicts with the orchestra members. This resulted in the formation of a new artistic administration by some of the musicians and representatives from the INBA called co-government. Under this arrangement there was no principal conductor; instead, the orchestra had host conductors for its seasons and a Mexican assistant director for off-season affairs.

After several years of this arrangement, the orchestra accepted to have a conductor again in 1979, appointing Sergio Cárdenas, who served until 1984. After him served Jose Guadalupe Flores from 1985 to 1986, followed by Francisco Savín from 1986 to 1988, and from 1989 to 1990 Luis Herrera de la Fuente returned. Participation in national festivals, music workshops, conferences, band concerts and chamber music concerts were offered by the orchestra during these years.

In May 1990, Enrique Arturo Diemecke was appointed as new conductor. He revived the tradition of touring promoted by Herrera de la Fuente during his first term, traveling to festivals in Portugal and Spain in 1992 and touring within Mexico and United States in 1999 and 2002. During his direction, the orchestra encouraged soundtrack concerts that consisted of playing music from films like the Mexican "Redes", music by [[Aaron Copland]] or ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' from [[Leonard Bernstein]] and several others. Didactic concerts for kids, concerts with worldwide renowned soloists like Jorge Federico Osorio, [[Frederica von Stade]] and [[violin]] [[virtuoso]] [[Itzhak Perlman]] were held by the orchestra in these years, and in 2002 the orchestra was nominated for [[Latin Grammy]] award for Best Classical Album. In 2003 the orchestra celebrated its 75th Anniversary with a concert in Mexico's [[National Auditorium]] performing the [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]´s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] (Choral), Op. 125 with an almost sold out locations. In November 2006, after 16 years of continuous works, Diemecke left the orchestra.

The orchestra's current musical director, Carlos Miguel Prieto, named at the end of 2007, has launched the orchestra on a new era, aiming to place it on a par with the world's leading ensembles. In early 2008 he led it on its first European tour in years, culminating with an acclaimed{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} concert at Amsterdam's renowned Concertgebouw Hall. Also in 2008 the orchestra celebrated its 80th Anniversary.

'''New York Live Arts''' (Live Arts) is a movement-focused arts organization in New York City that serves as the home of the [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]]. Its activities encompass commissioning, producing, and presenting works of dance, performance and music, together with allied education programming and services for artists. Live Arts is located in New York City’s [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood. Its building features a 184-seat theater, rehearsal studios and offices. The organization was formed in 2011 when [[Dance Theater Workshop]] (DTW) and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company merged. [[Bill T. Jones]] is Artistic Director of New York Live Arts.

==History==
New York Live Arts was created in 2011 through the merger of Dance Theater Workshop and The Bill T. Jones Arnie Zane Dance Company. The merger was conceived by the boards and staff of both organizations to address specific challenges each was facing around 2009. Dance Theater Workshop was struggling with capitalization and fundraising-capacity problems connected to substantial debt and operating costs it had assumed to develop its building, which opened in 2002. For its part, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company had been looking to establish its first studio/office facility and had recently been advised that its bid to become a tenant of a new building in Harlem had been rejected despite its having secured commitments of $13 million in public funding to support the development of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maciariello|first1=Catherine|title=The Innovation Lab for the Performing Arts: Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company/Dance Theater Workshop|date=2011|publisher=Emc Arts, Inc.|page=2|url=https://www.artsfwd.org/new-york-live-arts/6414/|accessdate=26 September 2017}} A similar text to the publication cited can be viewed at the URL embedded here. This reference is to the PDF version available at the same location.&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the possibility of a merger generated discussion within the New York City contemporary dance scene. DTW had been a vital part of New York City dance since 1965, helping nurture the careers of hundreds of dancers and companies. There was concern that having a single artist, [[Bill T. Jones]], at the head of the organization could alter the eclectic and inclusive spirit that had distinguished DTW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Felicia R.|title=Two Dance Visions in a Creative Pas de Deux|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/arts/dance/27dtw.html|accessdate=26 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a months-long process of discussions, community forums and negotiations, the boards of both organizations agreed that the shared values of the two entities and the complementary expertise of their staffs pointed to the possibility that a merger could address the immediate needs of both organizations and open new possibilities for the combined organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maciariello|first1=Catherine|title=The Innovation Lab for the Performing Arts: Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company/Dance Theater Workshop|date=2011|publisher=Emc Arts, Inc.|pages=2-3|url=https://www.artsfwd.org/new-york-live-arts/6414/|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jones organization committed to raising $3 million to pay down the bond debt on the DTW building as part of the merger agreement. Simultaneous with the merger announcement, the two entities unveiled the New York Live Arts name, noting that the omission of the word "dance" was meant to suggest potential future directions encompassing a wider range of art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Kate|title=Dance Theater Merges With Bill T.

==Governance and management==
New York Live Arts is overseen by an 18-member board. Bill T. Jones serves as Artistic Director, supported by Associate Artistic Director Janet Wong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Michael|title=Reshuffling at New York Live Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/arts/dance/new-york-live-arts-janet-wong-thomas-kriegsmann.html|accessdate=27 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Cullen is Executive Director overseeing day-to-day operations in concert with approximately 25 full-time staff members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Live Arts: Leadership &amp; Board|url=https://newyorklivearts.org/about/leadership-board/|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Live Arts' annual budget is approximately $5 million, supported by philanthropic contributions, earned income, and government support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Live Arts FY2015 IRS Form 990|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-6206608|website=Guidestar|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major programs==
The [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]] is the largest and most visible program of New York Live Arts. The company, founded in 1982, tours internationally and has long been considered a leading force in contemporary dance. It has been a primary vehicle for Bill T. Jones to realize his creative vision, and is noted for its engagement with political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Kirsten|title=Bill T. Jones|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/jones.html|website=Dance Heritage Coalition: 100 Dance Treasures|accessdate=27 September 2017|format=PDF|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company rehearses at New York Live Arts and occasionally performs there.

New York Live Arts mounts an annual season of performances at its theater that features of a range of artists and companies, presented both independently and in partnership with other organizations.

''Live Ideas'' is a humanities festival presented each spring that focuses on a single topic rooted in an aspect of thinking about the body that is explored through lectures, panel discussions, performances, films and other activities.

''The Randjelovic/Stryker Resident Commissioned Artist'' is a two-year residency for distinguished mid-career artists. The residency offers a salary and health benefits, in addition to studio space in which to develop a new work for premiere at New York Live Arts.

''Live Feed'' is a residency program in which select artists are given opportunities to undertake explorations of a new work, possibly for later commission by Live Arts, through rehearsal time, informal studio showings and public dialogues.

''Fresh Tracks'' is a professional development program and showcase for early-career artists. Each year five artists chosen through an open call receive 50-hours of studio time, a slot on a shared-evening bill in the Live Arts theater, and a range of professional-development sessions on the business and challenges of artistic careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Live Arts: Programs|url=https://newyorklivearts.org/programs/|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Live Core'' is a suite of artist services that includes fiscal sponsorship, consultations with Live Arts staff members, marketing support and other perquisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Live Arts: Live Core|url=https://newyorklivearts.org/program/live-core/|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
New York Live Arts occupies the basement and first three levels of an 11-story condominium tower. The basement and first level are dedicated to the 184-seat theater, lobby and supporting spaces. In the theater, a high-ceilinged black-box space with a 42 x 30 foot [[sprung floor]] abuts a steeply-raked fixed seating area on one side. When describing a similar theater layout in Dance Theater Workshop's original building, former DTW Executive Director David R. White characterized this configuration as "a formal, frontal black box theater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Leslie|last2=Morgan|first2=Roger|title=Space for Dance|date=1984|publisher=Publishing Center for Cultural Resources|location=Washington, D.C.|page=146|url=https://archive.org/details/spacefordancearc00arms|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second level of the building is devoted to offices and meeting rooms. The third level features two 1,200 square-foot windowed rehearsal studios, also with sprung floors, that can be combined to create a single space. This level also has two changing areas with lockers, showers and bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Starting a New Building so Dance Can Soar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/10/arts/starting-a-new-building-so-dance-can-soar.html|accessdate=27 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=March 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''paradox of fiction''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] problem about how people can experience strong [[Aesthetic emotions|emotions]] from purely [[fiction]]al things, such as art, literature, and imagination. The [[paradox]] draws attention to an everyday issue of how people are moved by things which, in some ways, do not exist. Although the [[ontology]] of fictional things in general has been discussed in philosophy since [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=paskow2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Paskow|first=Alan|title=The Paradoxes of Art : A phenomenological investigation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the paradox was first suggested by [[Colin Radford]] and Michael Weston in 1975.&lt;ref name=radwest1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=Colin|author2=Weston, Michael|title=How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina?|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes|date=January 1975|volume=49|pages=67–93|jstor=4106870}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Radford and Weston's original paper, they and others have continued the discussion by giving the problem slightly differing formulations and solutions.&lt;ref name="iep2012"&gt;{{cite web|last = Schneider|first = Steven|title = The Paradox of Fiction|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/|publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The paradox ==
The basic paradox is as follows:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;

# Most people have emotional responses to characters, objects, events etc. which they know to be fictitious.
# On the other hand, in order for us to be emotionally moved, we must believe that these characters, objects, or events, truly exist.
# But no person who takes characters or events to be fictional at the same time believes that they are real.

The paradox is that all three premises seem to be true, but can not logically be true at the same time. If any two points (e.g. 1 and 3) are taken to be true, then the third (e.g. 2) must either be false or else produce a contradiction.

==Proposed solutions==
The various proposed solutions to the paradox can be divided into three basic groups:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iep2012" /&gt;

* The ''pretend'' or the ''simulation theories'', proposed for example by [[Kendall Walton]].
:The pretend theories deny premise 1 and argue that with fiction we do not experience real emotions but rather something less intense. For example, when watching a horror movie where the monster makes an attack towards the viewer (towards the camera), the viewer can be startled but does not truly fear for his or her life.
* The ''thought theories'', for example from [[Peter Lamarque]], [[Noël Carroll]], and Robert J. Yanal.
:The thought theories deny premise 2 and claim that we can have genuine emotions from things even if we do not believe them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/philosophy-articles-friday-phil-colin-radford-paradox-of-fiction/|title = Why Stories Make Us Feel: Colin Radford’s So-called "Paradox of Fiction" and How Art Prompts Human Emotion|date = November 13, 2015|access-date = February 22, 2016|website = The Gemsbok|publisher = |last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Friday Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''illusion'' or ''realist theories'', for example from Alan Paskow.
:The illusion theories deny premise 3 and claim that, in a way, the fictional characters are real. They suggest that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was right saying that fiction involves a ''[[Suspension of disbelief|"willing suspension of disbelief"]]'', i.e. believing in the fiction while engaging with it.

[[File:Hameln1.jpg|thumb|300x|Postcard "Gruss aus Hameln" featuring the Pied Piper of Hamelin, 1902]]
The '''Pied Piper of Hamelin''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Rattenfänger von Hameln}}, also known as the '''Pan Piper''' or the '''Rat-Catcher of Hamelin''') is the [[titular character]] of a [[legend]] from the town of [[Hamelin]] (Hameln), [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]]. The legend dates back to the [[Middle Ages]], the earliest references describing a piper, dressed in multicolored ("[[wikt:pied|pied]]") clothing, who was a rat-catcher hired by the town to lure rats away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arynews.tv/en/pied-piper-hamelin-real | title=Was the Pied Piper of Hamelin real? | author=Anees | date=3 January 2015 | publisher=Ary Services | location=UK | accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his magic [[Pipe (instrument)|pipe]]. When the citizens refuse to pay for this service, he retaliates by using his instrument's magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Robert Browning]], among others.

There are many contradictory theories about the Pied Piper. Some suggest he was a symbol of hope to the people of Hamelin, which had been attacked by plague; he drove the rats from Hamelin, saving the people from the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hameln.de/de/der-rattenfaenger/die-rattenfaengersage/deutungsansaetze-zur-sage/ | title=Deutungsansätze zur Sage - Ein Funken Wahrheit mit einer Prise Phantasie | author= | date= | publisher=Stadt Hameln | accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pied piper.jpg|thumb|1592 painting of Pied Piper copied from the glass window of Marktkirche in Hamelin]] [[File:Palace Hotel Pied Piper Mural.jpg|thumb|1909 Maxfield Parrish mural of the Pied Piper of Hamlin at the Palace Hotel, San Francisco]]

The earliest known record of this story is from the town of Hamelin itself, depicted in a stained glass window created for the church of Hamelin, which dates to around 1300. Although the church was destroyed in 1660, several written accounts of the tale have survived.&lt;ref name="Marktkirche"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marktkirche-hameln.de/marktkirche/kirchenfenster.htm | title=Kirchenfenster | author= | date= | publisher= Marktkirche St. Nicolai Hameln | accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plots==
In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a [[rat]] infestation, a piper dressed in multicolored ("pied") clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The [[mayor]], in turn, promised to pay him for the removal of the rats. (According to some versions of the story, the promised sum was 1000 guilders.) The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the [[Weser|Weser River]], where all but one, which was deaf, drowned.&lt;ref name="UoP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/hameln.html#grimm245 | title =The Children of Hameln | publisher = University of Pittsburgh | date= |accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the piper's success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum (reputedly reduced to a sum of 50 guilders) even going so far as to blame the piper for bringing the rats himself in an extortion attempt. Enraged, the piper stormed out of the town, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint [[John and Paul]]'s day, while the adults were in church, the piper returned dressed in green like a hunter playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town's children. A hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a cave and were never seen again. Depending on the version, at most three children remained behind: one was lame and could not follow quickly enough, the second was deaf and therefore could not hear the music, and the last was blind and unable to see where he was going. These three informed the villagers of what had happened when they came out from church.&lt;ref name="UoP"/&gt;

Other versions relate that the Pied Piper led the children to the top of Koppelberg Hill, where he took them to a beautiful land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information | volume=12 |  page=876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a place called Koppenberg Mountain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/true-story-the-pied-piper-of-hamelin-never-piped.htm | title=True Story The Pied Piper of Hamelin Never Piped About the true story behind the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.

Some versions state that the Piper returned the children after payment, or that he returned the children after the villagers paid several times the original amount of gold.&lt;ref name="UoP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hameln.de/de/der-rattenfaenger/die-rattenfaengersage/die-sage-nach-den-bruedern-grimm/ | title =Die wohl weltweit bekannteste Version | publisher = Stadt Hameln  | date= |accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Rats of Hamelin.jpg|thumb|The rats of [[Hamelin]]. Illustration by [[Kate Greenaway]] for [[Robert Browning]]'s "The Pied Piper of Hamelin"]]

The earliest mention of the story seems to have been on a stained-glass window placed in the Church of Hamelin c. 1300. The window was described in several accounts between the 14th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oVQYl6QGq7IC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=earliest+mention+of+stained+glass+window+in+hamelin+pied+piper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VIVaUtXEEKTBigLSz4CIBg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=earliest%20mention%20of%20stained%20glass%20window%20in%20hamelin%20pied%20piper&amp;f=false "Reader's Digest the Truth about History: How New Evidence is Transforming the Story of the Past"], p. 294, Reader's Digest Association, 2004. Accessed 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was destroyed in 1660. Based on the surviving descriptions, a modern reconstruction of the window has been created by historian Hans Dobbertin. It features the colorful figure of the Pied Piper and several figures of children dressed in white.&lt;ref name="Marktkirche"/&gt;

This window is generally considered to have been created in memory of a tragic historical event for the town. Also, Hamelin town records start with this event. The earliest written record is from the town chronicles in an entry from 1384 which states: "It is 100 years since our children left."&lt;ref name="Shiela Harty Page 89"&gt;Shiela Harty, "Pied Piper Revisited", Essay published in: David Bridges, Terence H. McLaughlin (eds), ''Education And The Market Place'', Routledge, 1994, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-7507-0348-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research has been conducted for centuries, no explanation for the historical event is universally accepted as true. In any case, the rats were first added to the story in a version from c. 1559 and are absent from earlier accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museum-hameln.de/museum/rattenfaenger.php | title=Der Rattenfänger von Hameln - Wussten Sie schon, dass der Auszug der Kinder in historischen Quellen belegt wird, die Geschichte von den Ratten dagegen eine Erfindung des 16.

[[File:Pied Piper2.jpg|thumb|left|The Pied Piper leads the children out of Hamelin. Illustration by Kate Greenaway for Robert Browning's "The Pied Piper of Hamelin"]]

===Natural causes===
{{anchor|A plague}}
A number of theories suggest that children died of some natural causes such as disease or starvation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(65)92112-4/fulltext D. Wolfers M.B. Sydney, D.T.P.H., A PLAGUEY PIPER], ''The Lancet'', Volume 285, Issue 7388, pp. 756–757, 3 April 1965. Accessed via ScienceDirect 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Piper was a symbolic figure of [[Death (personification)|Death]].  Analogous themes which are associated with this theory include the [[Danse macabre|Dance of Death]], ''Totentanz'' or ''Danse Macabre'', a common medieval trope. Some of the scenarios that have been suggested as fitting this theory include that the children drowned in the river Weser, were killed in a [[landslide]] or contracted some disease during an epidemic. Another modern interpretation reads the story as alluding to an event where Hamelin children were lured away by a [[paganism|pagan]] or [[heresy|heretic]] [[sect]] to forests near [[Coppenbrügge]] (the mysterious ''Koppen'' "hills" of the poem) for ritual dancing where they all perished during a sudden landslide or collapsing [[sinkhole]].&lt;ref&gt;Hüsam, Gernot (1990). ''Der Koppen-Berg der Rattenfängersage von Hameln'' ("The ''Koppen'' hill of Pied Piper of Hamelin legend"), pamphlet published by Coppenbrügge Museum Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration theory===
Added speculation on the migration is based on the idea that by the 13th century the area had too many people resulting in the oldest son owning all the land and power ([[majorat]]), leaving the rest as serfs.&lt;ref name="borsch"&gt;Stuart J Borsch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRVKIcTQvywC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=black+death+causes+economic+expansion&amp;source=web&amp;ots=f0A5TkEtFH&amp;sig=LR68CeDnkHaBKw_as0cRb4rtcTo#PPA57,M1 ''The Black Death in Egypt and England: A Comparative Study''], [[University of Texas Press]] 2005, {{ISBN|0-292-70617-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that one reason the emigration of the children was never documented was that the children were sold to a recruiter from the Baltic region of Eastern Europe, a practice that was not uncommon at the time. In her essay "Pied Piper Revisited", Sheila Harty states that surnames from the region settled are similar to those from Hamelin and that selling off illegitimate children, orphans or other children the town could not support is the more likely explanation. She states further that this may account for the lack of records of the event in the town chronicles.&lt;ref name="Shiela Harty Page 89"/&gt;  In his book ''The Pied Piper: A Handbook'', Wolfgang Mieder states that historical documents exist showing that people from the area including Hamelin did help settle parts of [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder, ''The Pied Piper: A Handbook'', Greenwood Press, 2007, p. 67. {{ISBN|0-313-33464-1}}. Accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Transylvania had suffered under lengthy [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]] of Central Europe, led by two grandsons of [[Genghis Khan]] and which date from around the time of the earliest appearance of the legend of the piper, the early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/climate-probably-stopped-mongols-cold-hungary?tgt=nr | title= Climate probably stopped Mongols cold in Hungary | publisher=Sciencenews | accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the version of the legend posted on the official website for the town of Hamelin, another aspect of the emigration theory is presented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among the various interpretations, reference to the colonization of East Europe starting from Low Germany is the most plausible one: The "Children of Hameln" would have been in those days citizens willing to emigrate being recruited by landowners to settle in Moravia, East Prussia, Pomerania or in the Teutonic Land. It is assumed that in past times all people of a town were referred to as "children of the town" or "town children" as is frequently done today. The "Legend of the children's Exodus" was later connected to the "Legend of expelling the rats". This most certainly refers to the rat plagues being a great threat in the medieval milling town and the more or less successful professional ''rat catchers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hameln.com/tourism/piedpiper/rf_sage_gb.htm "The Legend of the Pied Piper"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/613PaM1MF?url=http://www.hameln.com/tourism/piedpiper/rf_sage_gb.htm |date=19 August 2011 }}, Rattenfängerstadt Hameln. Accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Sachsenspiegel-Ostsiedlung.jpg|thumb|Lokator, in hat]]
Historian Ursula Sautter, citing the work of linguist Jürgen Udolph, offers this hypothesis in support of the emigration theory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"After the defeat of the Danes at the [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)|Battle of Bornhöved]] in 1227," explains Udolph, "the region south of the Baltic Sea, which was then inhabited by Slavs, became available for colonization by the Germans." The bishops and dukes of Pomerania, Brandenburg, Uckermark and Prignitz sent out glib "locators," medieval recruitment officers, offering rich rewards to those who were willing to move to the new lands. Thousands of young adults from Lower Saxony and Westphalia headed east. And as evidence, about a dozen Westphalian place names show up in this area. Indeed there are five villages called Hindenburg running in a straight line from Westphalia to Pomerania, as well as three eastern Spiegelbergs and a trail of etymology from Beverungen south of Hamelin to Beveringen northwest of Berlin to Beweringen in modern Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sautter, "Fairy Tale Ending." ''Time International'', 27 April 1998, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Udolph favors the hypothesis that the Hamelin youths wound up in what is now Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/twist-in-the-tale-of-pied-pipers-kidnapping-1141174.html Twist in the tale of Pied Piper's kidnapping] by Imre Karacs, Independent, The (London), 27 January 1998. Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Genealogist Dick Eastman cited Udolph's research on Hamelin surnames that have shown up in Polish phonebooks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Linguistics professor Jürgen Udolph says that 130 children did vanish on a June day in the year 1284 from the German village of Hamelin (''Hameln'' in German). Udolph entered all the known family names in the village at that time and then started searching for matches elsewhere. He found that the same surnames occur with amazing frequency in the regions of Prignitz and Uckermark, both north of Berlin. He also found the same surnames in the former Pomeranian region, which is now a part of Poland.

Udolph surmises that the children were actually unemployed youths who had been sucked into the German drive to colonize its new settlements in Eastern Europe. The Pied Piper may never have existed as such, but, says the professor, "There were characters known as ''[[lokator]]s'' who roamed northern Germany trying to recruit settlers for the East." Some of them were brightly dressed, and all were silver-tongued.

Professor Udolph can show that the Hamelin exodus should be linked with the [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)|Battle of Bornhöved]] in 1227 which broke the Danish hold on Eastern Europe. That opened the way for German colonization, and by the latter part of the thirteenth century there were systematic attempts to bring able-bodied youths to Brandenburg and Pomerania. The settlement, according to the professor's name search, ended up near Starogard in what is now northwestern Poland. A village near Hamelin, for example, is called Beverungen and has an almost exact counterpart called Beveringen, near Pritzwalk, north of Berlin and another called Beweringen, near Starogard.

Local Polish telephone books list names that are not the typical Slavic names one would expect in that region. Instead, many of the names seem to be derived from German names that were common in the village of Hamelin in the thirteenth century. In fact, the names in today's Polish telephone directories include Hamel, Hamler and Hamelnikow, all apparently derived from the name of the original village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eogn.com/archives/news9806.htm Eastman's Online Genealogy Newsletter]: A Weekly Summary of Events and Topics of Interest to Online Genealogists, Vol. 3, No. 6, 7 February 1998, Ancestry Publishing—Pied Piper of Hamelin. Retrieved 5 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fourteenth-century Decan Lude chorus book===
[[Decan Lude]] of Hamelin was reported c. 1384, to have in his possession a [[chorus book]] containing a [[Latin]] verse giving an eyewitness account of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Willy Krogmann, ''Der Rattenfänger von Hameln: Eine Untersuchung über das werden der sage'', E. Ebering, 1934, p. 67. Original from the University of Michigan. Digitized 12 June 2007. Accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifteenth-century Lüneburg manuscript===
The Lüneburg manuscript (c. 1440–50) gives an early German account of the event, rendered in the following form in an inscription on a house in Hamelin:&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated in [[Rattenfänger von Hameln]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Smallcaps|
:anno 1284 am dage johannis et pauli war der 26. juni

&lt;span style="font-size:90%;"&gt;
:(In the year 1284 on the day of [Saints] John and Paul on 26th June
:130 children born in Hamelin were led away by a piper clothed in many colours 
:to [their] Calvary near the Koppen, [and] lost)
&lt;/span&gt;

According to author Fanny Rostek-Lühmann this is the oldest surviving account. ''Koppen'' ([[High German]] ''[[Kuppe]]'', meaning a knoll or domed hill) seems to be a reference to one of several hills surrounding Hamelin. Which of them was intended by the manuscript's author remains uncertain.&lt;ref name=Lühmann&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hinrich-luehmann.de/der-rattenf%C3%A4nger-von-hameln-f-r-l/ | title= Der Rattenfänger von Hameln | author=Fanny Rostek-Lühmann| date= | publisher=Hinrich Lühmann | accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century sources===
Somewhere between 1559 and 1565, Count [[Froben Christoph von Zimmern]] included a version in his ''[[Zimmern Chronicle|Zimmerische Chronik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;F. C. von Zimmern [attr.]: ''Zimmerische Chronik'', ed. K. A. Barack (Stuttgart, 1869), vol.&amp;nbsp;III, pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be the earliest account which mentions the plague of rats.  Von Zimmern dates the event only as "several hundred years ago" (''vor etlichen hundert jarn'' {{sic}}), so that his version throws no light on the conflict of dates (see next paragraph). Another contemporary account is that of [[Johann Weyer]] in his ''De praestigiis daemonum'' (1563).&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = https://books.google.de/books?id=TgQ6AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22De+praestigiis+daemonum%22&amp;cd=7&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = De Praestigiis Daemonum, Et Incantationibus ac veneficiis |author = Johannes Weyer |date =  |accessdate = January 14, 2018 |publisher = Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Some theories have linked the disappearance of the children to [[mass psychogenic illness]] in the form of [[dancing mania]]. Dancing mania outbreaks occurred during the 13th century, including one in 1237 in which a large group of children travelled from [[Erfurt]] to [[Arnstadt]] (about 20 km), jumping and dancing all the way,&lt;ref name = "Marks"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptjyzsF7tkgC |title=The Story of Hypnotism |first=Robert W. |last=Marks |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4191-5424-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in marked similarity to the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, which originated at around the same time.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite journal |author= Schullian, DM |year= 1977 |title= The Dancing Pilgrims at Muelebeek | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=315–9 |pmid=326865 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/xxxii.3.315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that the children left Hamelin to be part of a [[pilgrimage]], a [[child soldier|military campaign]], or even a new [[Children's crusade]] (which is said to have occurred in 1212) but never returned to their parents. These theories see the unnamed Piper as their leader or a recruiting agent.

[[William Manchester]]'s ''[[A World Lit Only by Fire]]'' places the events in 1484, 100 years after the written mention in the town chronicles that "It is 100 years since our children left",  and further proposes that the Pied Piper was a psychopathic [[paedophile]], although for the time period it is highly improbable that one man could abduct so many children undetected.  Furthermore, nowhere in the book does Manchester offer proof of his description of the facts as he presents them.  He makes similar assertions regarding other legends, also without supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ku2PNGO5Y6sC&amp;pg=PT63&amp;dq=pied+piper+of+hamelin+world+lit+by+fire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pdRWUpnzPMfxiwLopoCoCA&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pied%20piper%20of%20hamelin%20world%20lit%20by%20fire&amp;f=false A World Lit Only by Fire: The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance - Portrait of an Age by William Manchester], Hachette Digital, Inc., 2009.Accessed 10 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1803, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote a poem based on the story that was later set to music by [[Hugo Wolf]]. Goethe also incorporated references to the story in his version of ''[[Faust]]''. (The first part of the drama was first published in 1808 and the second in 1832.)
* [[Jakob Grimm|Jakob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], known as the [[Brothers Grimm]], drawing from eleven sources, included the tale in their collection ''Deutsche Sagen'' (first published in 1816).

The rest became the founders of Siebenbürgen ([[Transylvania]]).&lt;ref name=Lühmann/&gt;
* Using the [[Richard Rowlands|Verstegan]] version of the tale (1605: the earliest account in English) and adopting the 1376 date, [[Robert Browning]] wrote a poem of that name which was published in his ''[[Dramatic Lyrics]]'' (1842).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancsngfl.ac.uk/curriculum/literacy/lit_site/html/fiction/Pied_Piper/pages/master_frame_verse.htm |title=Pied Piper&amp;nbsp;– Verses |publisher=Lancsngfl.ac.uk |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browning's retelling in verse is notable for its humour, wordplay, and jingling rhymes.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{according to whom|date=July 2016}}

* In the anime adaptation of the Japanese light novel series, ''[[Problem Children Are Coming from Another World, Aren't They?]]'' (2013), a major story revolves around the "false legend" of Pied Piper of Hamelin.

It is stated that Weser, the representation of Natural Disaster, was the true Piper of Hamelin (meaning the children were killed by drowning or landslides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title=8.

==Allusions in linguistics==
In [[linguistics]], ''[[pied-piping]]'' is the common name for the ability of question words and relative pronouns to drag other words along with them when brought to the front, as part of the phenomenon called [[Wh-movement]]. For example, in "For whom are the pictures?", the word "for" is ''pied-piped'' by "whom" away from its declarative position ("The pictures are for me"), and in "The mayor, pictures of whom adorn his office walls" both words "pictures of" are pied-piped in front of the [[relative pronoun]], which normally starts the relative clause.

Some researchers believe that the tale has inspired the common English phrase "pay the piper",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deproverbio.com/DPjournal/DP,5,2,99/MIEDER/PIPER.htm | title="To pay the Piper" and the legend of "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" | first=Wolfgang | last=Mieder | work=De Proverbia Journal | volume=5 | issue=2 | date=1999 | accessdate=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the phrase is actually a contraction of the English [[proverb]] "he who pays the piper calls the tune" which simply means that the person paying for something is the one who gets to say how it should be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=He who pays the piper calls the tune.|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/he-who-pays-the-piper-calls-the-tune|website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modernity ==
The present-day City of Hamelin continues to maintain information about the Pied Piper legend and possible origins of the story on its website.  Interest in the city's connection to the story remains so strong that in 2009, Hamelin held a tourist festival to mark the 725th anniversary of the disappearance of the town's earlier children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110701001358/http://www.pied-piper-anniversary.com/eng/News/Goosebumps-and-romance-in-Hamelin Goosebumps and romance in Hamelin] Most famous German legend celebrates anniversary Thu 13 Nov 2008 Accessed online 13 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The eerie nature of such a celebration was enough to warrant an article in the ''[[Fortean Times]]'', a print magazine devoted to odd occurrences, legends, cryptozoology and all things strange which are known now as [[Forteana]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131208111608/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/3805/the_lost_children_of_hamelin.html The Lost Children of Hamelin: On 26 June, the German town of Hamelin celebrated Rat Catcher's Day. But what really happened there, and who was the mysterious Pied Piper?] By Maria J Pérez Cuervo FORTEAN TIMES MAGAZINE June 2010. Accessed online 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The article noted that even to this day, there is prohibition against playing music or dancing upon the Bungelosenstrasse ("street without drums"), the street where the children were purported to have last been seen before they disappeared or left the town. [[Pied Piper's House|The Rat Catcher's House]] is popular with visitors, although it bears no connection to the Rat-Catcher version of the legend.  Indeed, the Rattenfängerhaus is instead, associated with the story due to the earlier inscription upon its facade mentioning the legend.  The house was built much later in 1602 and 1603.  It is now a Hamelin City-owned restaurant with a pied piper theme throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelsignposts.com/Germany/sightseeing/rattenfangerhaus-hameln Rattenfängerhaus – The Rat Catcher's House in Hameln: RATTENFÄNGERHAUS – HAMELN’S RAT-CATCHER’S HOUSE IS NOW A RESTAURANT by Helen Page June 2012] from Travelsignposts.com. Accessed online 13 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The city also maintains an online shop with rat-themed merchandise as well as offering an officially licensed Hamelin Edition of the popular board game Monopoly which depicts the legendary Piper on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmtshop.dev4u.de/shop/monopoly-hameln.php Der Spieleklassiker als exklusive Hameln-Edition!!](the classic game as hamelin-edition) from the Hamelin webstore - viewed online 13 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the recent milestone festival, each year the city marks June 26 as "Rat Catcher's Day".  In the United States, a similar holiday for Exterminators based on Rat Catcher's Day has failed to catch on and is marked on July 22.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/07/0720_040720_rats.html Rat Catcher's Day Eludes Pest Control Industry] John Roach for National Geographic News Updated 21 July 2004 viewed online 13 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
{{Semiotics}}
'''Postmodernism''' is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across [[philosophy]], [[the arts]], [[architecture]], and [[criticism]] and that marked a departure from [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism|title=postmodernism: definition of postmodernism in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html American Heritage Dictionary's definition of "postmodern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |date=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also more generally been applied to the [[Postmodernity|historical era following modernity]] and the tendencies of this era.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; (In this context, "modern" is not used in the sense of "contemporary", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.)
 
While encompassing a wide variety of approaches, postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], [[irony]], or rejection toward the [[meta-narrative]]s and [[ideology|ideologies]] of modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment rationality]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Consequently, common targets of postmodern critique include [[universalism|universalist]] notions of [[objective reality]], [[moral universalism|morality]], [[truth]], [[human nature]], [[reason]], [[language]], and [[social progress]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duignan|first1=Brian|title=Postmodernism|website=[[Britannica]]|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] or [[social conditioning|socially-conditioned]] nature of [[knowledge]] claims and  [[value system]]s, situating them as products of particular political, historical, or cultural [[discourse]]s and [[hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to [[self-reference|self-referentiality]], [[epistemological relativism|epistemological]] and [[moral relativism]], [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], [[subjectivism]], and irreverence.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Postmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including [[cultural studies]], [[philosophy of science]],  [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[architecture]], [[feminist theory]], and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[Postmodern art|art movements]] in fields such as [[postmodern literature|literature]] and music. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as [[deconstruction]] and [[post-structuralism]], as well as philosophers such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Fredric Jameson]]. Some philosophers have criticized the term.

==History==
Postmodernism arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what is now called postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of artists such as [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and [[continental philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the [[virtual (philosophy)|virtual]] at the expense of [[the Real]] (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''.

{{Main article|Manifestations of postmodernism }}
[[Structuralism]] was a philosophical movement developed by French academics in the 1950s, partly in response to French [[Existentialism]]. It has been seen variously as an expression of [[Modernism]], [[High modernism]], or postmodernism {{By whom|date=July 2010}}. [[Post-Structuralism|"Post-structuralists"]] were thinkers who moved away from the strict interpretations and applications of structuralist ideas. Many American academics consider post-structuralism to be part of the broader, less well-defined postmodernist movement, even though many post-structuralists insisted it was not. Thinkers who have been called structuralists include the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], the linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], and the semiotician [[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Algirdas Greimas]]. The early writings of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] and the literary theorist [[Roland Barthes]] have also been called structuralists. Those who began as structuralists but became post-structuralists include [[Michel Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Gilles Deleuze]]. Other post-structuralists include [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]], and [[Luce Irigaray]]. The American cultural theorists, critics and intellectuals whom they influenced include [[Judith Butler]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Avital Ronell]], and [[Hayden White]].

Post-structuralism is not defined by a set of shared axioms or methodologies, but by an emphasis on how various aspects of a particular culture, from its most ordinary, everyday material details to its most abstract theories and beliefs, determine one another. Post-structuralist thinkers reject [[Reductionism]] and [[Epiphenomenalism]] and the idea that cause-and-effect relationships are top-down or bottom-up. Like structuralists, they start from the assumption that people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather than having ''intrinsic'' properties that can be understood in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lévi-Strauss|first1=Claude| |authorlink=Claude Lévi-Strauss| title=Structural Anthropology|date=1963|publisher=New York: Basic Books|location=USA|isbn=046509516X|page=324|edition=I}}&lt;br/&gt;Lévi-Strauss, quoting D'Arcy Westworth Thompson states: "To those who question the possibility of defining the interrelations between entities whose nature is not completely understood, I shall reply with the following comment by a great naturalist: In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself has to be left unanalyzed and undefined."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing [[Relativism]] and [[Social constructionism|Constructionism]]. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of their study might be described, reductively, as a set of ''essential'' relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude Lévi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in "The Structural Study of Myth"&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Anthropologie Structurale''. Paris: Éditions Plon, 1958.&lt;br/&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Structural Anthropology''. Trans. Claire Jacobson and Brooke Grundfest Schoepf (New York: Basic Books, 1963), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmeUknlauJAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=NJWcwczLLV&amp;dq=Structural%20Anthropology%20Basic%20Books&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=Structural%20Anthropology%20Basic%20Books&amp;f=false 228].&lt;/ref&gt;). Post-structuralists thinkers went further, questioning the existence of any distinction between the nature of a thing and its relationship to other things.

Postmodernist ideas in [[philosophy]] and the analysis of [[culture]] and [[society]] expanded the importance of [[critical theory]] and has been the point of departure for works of [[literature]], [[architecture]], and [[design]], as well as being visible in marketing/business and the interpretation of [[history]], [[law]] and [[culture]], starting in the late 20th century. These developments—re-evaluation of the entire Western value system ([[love]], [[marriage]], [[popular culture]], shift from [[industrial society|industrial]] to [[service economy]]) that took place since the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in the [[May 1968 in France|Social Revolution of 1968]]—are described with the term "[[postmodernity]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inst.at/trans/11Nr/luetzeler11.htm|title=TRANS Nr. 11: Paul Michael Lützeler (St. Louis): From Postmodernism to Postcolonialism|work=inst.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to ''Postmodernism'', a term referring to an opinion or movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Postmodernism has also been used interchangeably with the term post-structuralism out of which postmodernism grew; a proper understanding of postmodernism or doing justice to the postmodernist concept demands an understanding of the post-structuralist movement and the ideas of its advocates. Post-structuralism resulted similarly to postmodernism by following a time of structuralism. It is characterized by new ways of thinking through structuralism, contrary to the original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yilmaz | first1 = K | year = 2010 | title = Postmodernism and its Challenge to the Discipline of History: Implications for History Education | url = | journal = Educational Philosophy &amp; Theory | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 779–795 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-5812.2009.00525.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Postmodernist" describes part of a movement; "Postmodern" places it in the period of time since the 1950s, making it a part of [[contemporary history]].

One of the most well-known postmodernist concerns is "deconstruction," a theory for philosophy, literary criticism, and textual analysis developed by [[Jacques Derrida]]. The notion of a "deconstructive" approach implies an analysis that questions the already evident understanding of a text in terms of presuppositions, ideological underpinnings, hierarchical values, and frames of reference. A deconstructive approach further depends on the techniques of close reading without reference to cultural, ideological, moral opinions or information derived from an authority over the text such as the author. At the same time Derrida famously writes: "Il n'y a pas d'hors-texte (''there is no such thing as outside-of-the-text'')."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1967), Of Grammatology, Part II, Introduction to the "Age of Rousseau," section 2 "...That Dangerous Supplement...", title, The Exorbitant Question of Method, pp. 158–59, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida implies that the world follows the grammar of a text undergoing its own deconstruction. Derrida's method frequently involves recognizing and spelling out the different, yet similar interpretations of the meaning of a given text and the problematic implications of binary oppositions within the meaning of a text. Derrida's philosophy inspired a postmodern movement called [[deconstructivism]] among architects, characterized by the intentional fragmentation, distortion, and dislocation of architectural elements in designing a building. Derrida discontinued his involvement with the movement after the publication of his collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenman in ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman''.&lt;ref&gt;Benoît Peeters, ''Derrida: A Biography'', pp. 377–8, translated by Andrew Brown, [[Polity Press]], 2013, {{ISBN|9780745656151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between postmodernism, posthumanism, and cyborgism has led to a challenge of postmodernism, for which the terms "postpostmodernism" and "postpoststructuralism" were first coined in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/decon2/decon_leonardo_leon_36_4_285_0.pdf|title="Deconstructing Decontamination", LEONARDO, Vol. 36, No. 4, pp. 285–290, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Postcyborg Ethics: A New Way to Speak of Technology", Heidi A.

More recently [[metamodernism]], post-postmodernism and the "death of postmodernism" have been widely debated: in 2007 Andrew Hoberek noted in his introduction to a special issue of the journal ''Twentieth Century Literature'' titled "After Postmodernism" that "declarations of postmodernism's demise have become a critical commonplace". A small group of critics has put forth a range of theories that aim to describe culture or society in the alleged aftermath of postmodernism, most notably Raoul Eshelman (performatism), [[Gilles Lipovetsky]] ([[hypermodernity]]), [[Nicolas Bourriaud]] ([[altermodern]]), and Alan Kirby (digimodernism, formerly called pseudo-modernism). None of these new theories and labels have so far gained very widespread acceptance. Sociocultural anthropologist Nina Müller-Schwarze offers neostructuralism as a possible direction. &lt;ref&gt;Müller Schwarze, Nina

==Origins of term==
The term ''postmodern'' was first used around the 1880s. John Watkins Chapman suggested "a Postmodern style of painting" as a way to depart from French [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ihab Hassan|Hassan, Ihab]], ''The Postmodern Turn, Essays in Postmodern Theory and Culture'', Ohio University Press, 1987. p. 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt; J. M. Thompson, in his 1914 article in ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' (a quarterly philosophical review), used it to describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of [[religion]], writing: "The raison d'être of Post-Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] by being thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as [[theology]], to Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. M. "Post-Modernism," ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]''. Vol XII No. 4, July 1914. p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 and 1925, postmodernism had been used to describe new forms of [[art]] and [[music]]. In 1942 H. R. Hays described it as a new literary form. However, as a general theory for a historical movement it was first used in 1939 by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]: "Our own Post-Modern Age has been inaugurated by the general war of 1914–1918".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGQ9AQAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''A study of History'', Volume 5], Oxford University Press, 1961 [1939], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portland Building 1982.jpg|right|thumb|[[Portland Building]] (1982), by architect Michael Graves, an example of [[Postmodern architecture]]]]
In 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with [[modern architecture]], and led to the [[postmodern architecture]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and a response to the modernist architectural movement known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]]. Postmodernism in architecture was initially marked by a re-emergence of surface ornament, reference to surrounding buildings in urban settings, historical reference in decorative forms ([[eclecticism]]), and non-orthogonal angles.

[[Peter Drucker]] suggested the transformation into a post-modern world happened between 1937 and 1957 (when he was writing). He described an as yet "nameless era" which he characterized as a shift to conceptual world based on pattern, purpose, and process rather than mechanical cause, outlined by four new realities: the emergence of Educated Society, the importance of [[international development]], the decline of the nation state, and the collapse of the viability of non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=LoT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F.| authorlink=Peter Drucker |title=Landmarks of Tomorrow|date=1957|publisher=Harper Brothers|location=New York|url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/30294/XX_CNE-LIPSOR_1197.pdf.txt?sequence=3|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, in a lecture delivered at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, [[Mel Bochner]] described "post-modernism" in art as having started with Jasper Johns, "who first rejected sense-data and the singular point-of-view as the basis for his art, and treated art as a critical investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bochner|first1=Mel|authorlink=Mel Bochner| title=Solar System &amp; Rest Rooms: Writings and Interviews 1965--2007|date=2008|publisher=The MIT Press|location=USA|isbn=9780262026314|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Walter Truett Anderson]] described postmodernism as belonging to one of four typological world views, which he identifies as either (a) Postmodern-ironist, which sees truth as socially constructed, (b) Scientific-rational, in which truth is found through methodical, disciplined inquiry, (c) Social-traditional, in which truth is found in the heritage of American and Western civilization, or (d) Neo-Romantic, in which truth is found through attaining harmony with nature and/or spiritual exploration of the inner self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Fontana Postmodernism Reader]]|author=Walter Truett Anderson|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]] rejected the philosophical basis of the concepts of "subjectivity" and "objectivity" and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another. Instead of resisting the admission of this paradox in the search for understanding, Heidegger requires that we embrace it through an active process of elucidation he called the "[[hermeneutic circle]]". He stressed the [[historicity]] and cultural construction of concepts while simultaneously advocating the necessity of an [[wikt:atemporal|atemporal]] and [[immanence|immanent]] apprehension of them. In this vein, he asserted that it was the task of contemporary philosophy to recover the original question of (or "openness to") ''[[Dasein]]'' (translated as Being or Being-there) present in the [[Presocratic]] philosophers but normalized, neutered, and standardized since [[Plato]]. This was to be done, in part, by tracing the record of ''Dasein's'' sublimation or forgetfulness through the history of philosophy which meant that we were to ask again what constituted the grounding conditions in ourselves and in the World for the affinity between beings and between the many usages of the term "being" in philosophy. To do this, however, a non-historical and, to a degree, self-referential engagement with whatever set of ideas, feelings or practices would permit (both the non-fixed concept and reality of) such a continuity was required—a continuity permitting the possible experience, possible existence indeed not only of beings but of all differences as they appeared and tended to develop.

Such a conclusion led Heidegger to depart from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of his teacher [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of [[Ontology]], a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]] or between things in themselves (''[[de re]]'') and things as they appear (see [[qualia]]): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness to the process of ''Dasein''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in [[Rationalism]], [[Empiricism]], and [[methodological naturalism]], his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a [[nominalist]]), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[World view|Weltanschauung]], and [[social constructionism]]), and his [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] and [[Via Negativa|negativist]] notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also [[process philosophy]], [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[Instrumentalism]], [[Pragmatism]], and [[Vitalism]]).

===Jacques Derrida===
[[Jacques Derrida]] re-examined the fundamentals of writing and its consequences on philosophy in general; sought to undermine the language of "presence" or [[metaphysics]] in an analytical technique which, beginning as a point of departure from Heidegger's notion of [[Heideggerian terminology|''Destruktion'']], came to be known as [[Deconstruction]]. Derrida used, like Heidegger, references to Greek philosophical notions associated with the [[Skeptic]]s and the [[Presocratic]]s, such as [[Epoché]] and [[Aporia]] to articulate his notion of implicit circularity between premises and conclusions, origins and manifestations, but—in a manner analogous in certain respects to [[Gilles Deleuze]]—presented a radical re-reading of canonical philosophical figures such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Descartes]] as themselves being informed by such "destabilizing" notions.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]] introduced concepts such as '[[discourse|discursive regime]]', or re-invoked those of older philosophers like '[[episteme]]' and '[[Genealogy of Morals|genealogy]]' in order to explain the relationship between meaning, power, and social behavior within social orders (see ''[[The Order of Things]]'', ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'', ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''). In direct contradiction to what have been typified as [[modernist]] perspectives on [[epistemology]], Foucault asserted that rational judgment, social practice, and what he called "[[biopower]]" are not only inseparable but co-determinant. While Foucault himself was deeply involved in a number of progressive political causes and maintained close personal ties with members of the [[far-left]], he was also controversial with leftist thinkers of his day, including those associated with various [[Marxist]] tendencies, proponents of [[left-libertarianism]] (such as [[Noam Chomsky's political views|Noam Chomsky]]), and supporters of [[humanism]] (like [[Jürgen Habermas]]), for his rejection of what he deemed to be [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] concepts of freedom, liberation, [[self-determination]], and [[human nature]]. Instead, Foucault focused on the ways in which such constructs can foster [[cultural hegemony]], violence, and exclusion.

In line with his rejection of such "[[Positivism|positive]]" tenets of Enlightenment-era humanism, he was active—with [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]—in the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, considering much of institutionalized psychiatry and, in particular, Freud's concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] central to [[Psychoanalysis]] (which was still very influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s), to be both harmful and misplaced. Foucault was known for his controversial aphorisms, such as "language is oppression"{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, meaning that language functions in such a way as to render nonsensical, false, or silent tendencies that might otherwise threaten or undermine the distributions of power backing a society's conventions—even when such distributions purport to celebrate liberation and expression or value minority groups and perspectives. His writings have had a major influence on the larger body of postmodern academic literature.

===Jean-François Lyotard===
[[Jean-François Lyotard]] identified in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' a crisis in the "discourses of the human sciences" latent in modernism but catapulted to the fore by the advent of the "computerized" or "telematic" era (see [[Information Revolution|information revolution]]). This crisis, insofar as it pertains to academia, concerns both the motivations and justification procedures for making research claims: unstated givens or values that have validated the basic efforts of academic research since the late 18th century might no longer be valid—particularly, in social science and humanities research, though examples from mathematics are given by Lyotard as well. As formal conjecture about real-world issues becomes inextricably linked to automated calculation, information storage, and retrieval, such knowledge becomes increasingly "exteriorised" from its knowers in the form of information. Knowledge thus becomes materialized and made into a commodity exchanged between producers and consumers; it ceases to be either an idealistic end-in-itself or a tool capable of bringing about liberty or social benefit; it is stripped of its humanistic and spiritual associations, its connection with education, teaching, and human development, being simply rendered as "data"—omnipresent, material, unending, and without any contexts or pre-requisites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/lyotard.htm Lyotard, Jean-François. The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. Les Éditions de Minuit, 1979. English Translation by Geoffrey Bennington and Brian Massumi. Manchester University Press, 1984. See Chapter 1, The Field: Knowledge in Computerised Societies.]//&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the "diversity" of claims made by various disciplines begins to lack any unifying principle or intuition as objects of study become more and more specialized due to the emphasis on specificity, precision, and uniformity of reference that competitive, database-oriented research implies.

The value-premises upholding academic research have been maintained by what Lyotard considers to be quasi-mythological beliefs about human purpose, human reason, and human progress—large, background constructs he calls "[[metanarrative]]s". These metanarratives still remain in Western society but are now being undermined by rapid [[Informatization]] and the commercialization of the university and its functions. The shift of authority from the presence and intuition of knowers—from the good faith of reason to seek diverse knowledge integrated for human benefit or truth fidelity—to the automated database and the market had, in Lyotard's view, the power to unravel the very idea of "justification" or "legitimation" and, with it, the rationale for research altogether, especially in disciplines pertaining to human life, society, and meaning. We are now controlled not by binding extra-linguistic value paradigms defining notions of collective identity and ultimate purpose, but rather by our automatic responses to different species of "language games" (a concept Lyotard imports from [[J. L. Austin]]'s theory of [[speech act]]s). In his vision of a solution to this "vertigo", Lyotard opposes the assumptions of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]], consensus, and generality that he identified within the thought of humanistic, [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers like [[Jürgen Habermas]], and proposes a continuation of experimentation and diversity to be assessed pragmatically in the context of language games rather than via appeal to a resurrected series of transcendentals and metaphysical unities.

===Richard Rorty===
[[Richard Rorty]] argues in ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' that contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of [[representationalism]] and [[correspondence theory]] that rely upon the independence of knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of [[anti-foundationalism]] and anti-essentialism within a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of [[conventionalism]] and [[relativism]], but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to [[social liberalism]].

===Jean Baudrillard===
[[Jean Baudrillard]], in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', introduced the concept that reality or the principle of "[[The Real]]" is short-circuited by the interchangeability of signs in an era whose communicative and semantic acts are dominated by electronic media and digital technologies. Baudrillard proposes the notion that, in such a state, where subjects are detached from the outcomes of events (political, literary, artistic, personal, or otherwise), events no longer hold any particular sway on the subject nor have any identifiable context; they therefore have the effect of producing widespread indifference, detachment, and passivity in industrialized populations. He claimed that a constant stream of appearances and references without any direct consequences to viewers or readers could eventually render the division between appearance and object indiscernible, resulting, ironically, in the "disappearance" of mankind in what is, in effect, a virtual or holographic state, composed only of appearances. For [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]], "simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or a reality: a [[hyperreality|hyperreal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Luke, T. W. (1991). Power and politics in hyperreality: The critical project of Jean Baudrillard. Social Science Journal, 28(3), 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fredric Jameson===
[[Fredric Jameson]] set forth one of the first expansive theoretical treatments of postmodernism as a historical period, intellectual trend, and social phenomenon in a series of lectures at the [[Whitney Museum]], later expanded as ''Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'' (1991). Eclectic in his methodology, Jameson has continued a sustained examination of the role that [[periodization]] continues to play as a grounding assumption of critical methodologies in [[humanities]] disciplines. He has contributed extensive effort to explicating the importance of concepts of [[Utopia]] and Utopianism as driving forces in the cultural and intellectual movements of [[modernity]], and outlining the political and existential uncertainties that may result from the decline or suspension of this trend in the theorized state of postmodernity. Like [[Susan Sontag]], Jameson served to introduce a wide audience of American readers to key figures of the 20th century [[continental European]] intellectual left, particularly those associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], [[structuralism]], and [[post-structuralism]]. Thus, his importance as a "translator" of their ideas to the common vocabularies of a variety of disciplines in the Anglo-American academic complex is equally as important as his own critical engagement with them.

===Douglas Kellner===
In ''Analysis of the Journey'', a journal birthed from postmodernism, [[Douglas Kellner]] insists that the "assumptions and procedures of modern theory" must be forgotten. His terms defined in the depth of postmodernism are based on advancement, innovation, and adaptation. Extensively, Kellner analyzes the terms of this theory in real-life experiences and examples. Kellner used science and technology studies as a major part of his analysis; he urged that the theory is incomplete without it. The scale was larger than just postmodernism alone; it must be interpreted through cultural studies where science and technology studies play a huge role. The reality of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States of America is the catalyst for his explanation. This catalyst is used as a great representation due to the mere fact of the planned ambush and destruction of "symbols of globalization", insinuating the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].

{{Clarify|reason=Unclear what exactly is being said here, as if crucial information is omitted.|text=One of the numerous yet appropriate definitions of postmodernism and the qualm aspect aids this attribute to seem perfectly accurate.|date=March 2017}} In response, Kellner continues to examine the repercussions of understanding the effects of the September 11 attacks. He questions if the attacks are only able to be understood in a limited form of postmodern theory due to the level of irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lule | first1 = Jack | year = 2001 | title = The Postmodern Adventure (Book) | url = | journal = Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 78 | issue = 4| pages = 865–866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In further studies, he enhances the idea of [[semiotics]] in alignment with the theory. Similar to the act of September 11 and the symbols that were interpreted through this postmodern ideal, he continues to even describe this as "[[semiotics|semiotic systems]]" that people use to make sense of their lives and the events that occur in them. Kellner's [[Wikt:adamancy|adamancy]] that signs are necessary to understand one's culture is what he analyzes from the evidence that most cultures have used signs in place of existence.{{Citation needed|reason=Strong Statement with significant implications. Likely point for user to seek source material|date=February 2015}} Finally, he recognizes that many theorists of postmodernism are trapped by their own cogitations. He finds strength in theorist Baudrillard and his idea of [[Marxism]]. Kellner acknowledges Marxism's end and lack of importance to his theory.

The conclusion he depicts is simple: postmodernism, as most use it today, will decide what experiences and signs in one's reality will be one's reality as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danto | first1 = AC | year = 1990 | title = The Hyper-Intellectual | url = | journal = New Republic | volume = 203 | issue = 11/12| pages = 44–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Postmodernism in [[architecture]] began as a response to the perceived blandness and failed Utopianism of the Modern movement. [[Modern Architecture]], as established and developed by [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Le Corbusier]], was focused on the pursuit of a perceived ideal perfection, and attempted harmony of form and function,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Louis. "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered," published Lippincott's Magazine (March 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; and dismissal of "frivolous ornament,"&lt;ref&gt;Loos, Adolf. "Ornament and Crime," published 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tafuri, Manfredo, 'Architecture and Utopia: Design and Capitalist Development', Cambridge: MIT Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as arguing for an architecture that represented the spirit of the age as depicted in cutting-edge technology, be it airplanes, cars, ocean liners or even supposedly artless grain silos.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Towards a New Architecture''. Dover Publications, 1985/1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of modernism argued that the attributes of perfection and minimalism themselves were subjective, and pointed out [[anachronism]]s in modern thought and questioned the benefits of its philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Definitive postmodern architecture such as the work of [[Michael Graves]] and [[Robert Venturi]] rejects the notion of a 'pure' form or 'perfect' architectonic detail, instead conspicuously drawing from all methods, materials, forms and colors available to architects.

Modernist [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] is associated with the phrase "[[Minimalist architecture|less is more]]"; in response [[Robert Venturi|Venturi]] famously said, "Less is a bore." 

The intellectual scholarship regarding postmodernism and architecture is closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-architect [[Charles Jencks]], beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay "The rise of post-modern architecture" from 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, Charles, "The rise of Post-Modern architecture", ''Architecture Association Quarterly'', No.4, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''magnum opus'', however, is the book ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'', first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions. Jencks makes the point that Post-Modernism (like Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not just a reaction to Modernism but what he terms ''double coding'': "Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects."&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, Charles. "The Language of Post-Modern Architecture", Academy Editions, London 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Post-Modern architects would for economic reasons be compelled to make use of contemporary technology, hence distinguishing such architects from mere revivalists. Among the Post-Modern architects championed by Jencks were [[Robert Venturi]], [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]], [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Leon Krier]], and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]].

===Urban planning===
Postmodernism is a rejection of 'totality', of the notion that planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational. In this sense, Postmodernism is a rejection of its predecessor: Modernism. From the 1920s onwards, the Modern movement sought to design and plan cities which followed the logic of the new model of industrial [[mass production]]; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation and [[prefabricated]] design solutions (Goodchild 1990). Postmodernism also brought a break from the notion that planning and architecture could result in [[social reform]], which was an integral dimension of the plans of Modernism (Simonsen 1990). Furthermore, Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475). The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993). In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which [[capitalism]] could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).

Considering Modernism inclined urban planning to treat buildings and developments as isolated, unrelated parts of the overall [[urban ecosystem]]s created fragmented, isolated, and homogeneous urban landscapes (Goodchild, 1990). One of the greater problems with Modernist-style of planning was the disregard of resident or [[public opinion]], which resulted in planning being forced upon the majority by a minority consisting of affluent professionals with little to no knowledge of real 'urban' problems characteristic of post-[[Second World War]] urban environments: [[slum]]s, overcrowding, deteriorated [[infrastructure]], [[pollution]] and disease, among others (Irving 1993). These were precisely the 'urban ills' Modernism was meant to 'solve', but more often than not, the types of 'comprehensive', 'one size fits all' approaches to planning made things worse., and residents began to show interest in becoming involved in decisions which had once been solely entrusted to professionals of the built environment. [[Urban planning#Advocacy planning|Advocacy planning]] and [[Participatory modeling|participatory model]]s of planning emerged in the 1960s to counter these traditional [[elitist]] and [[technocratic]] approaches to urban planning (Irving 1993; Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007). Furthermore, an assessment of the 'ills' of Modernism among planners during the 1960s, fuelled development of a participatory model that aimed to expand the range of participants in urban interventions (Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007, 21).

[[Jane Jacobs]]' 1961 book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when [[Pruitt Igoe]]; a housing development for low-income people in [[St. Louis]] designed by [[architect]] [[Minoru Yamasaki]], which had been a prize-winning version of [[Le Corbusier]]'s 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and [[disadvantaged]] groups (Goodchild 1990). Urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of [[Fordism|Fordist]]-[[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] paradigm of mass, standardized production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, [[labor market]]s and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, B 1990, 'Planning and the Modern'Postmodern Debate', in The Town Planning Review, vol. 61, no. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;119–137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatuka, T &amp; D'Hooghe, A 2007, 'After Postmodernism: readdressing the Role of Utopia in Urban Design and Planning', in Places: Forum of Design for the Public Realm, vol. 19, Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–27/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving, A 1993, 'The Modern/Postmodern Divide and Urban Planning', in The University of Toronto Quareterly, vol. 62, no. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;474–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonsen, K 1990, 'Planning on 'Postmodern' Conditions', in Acta Sociologica, vol. 33, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;51–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

{{Main article|Postmodern literature}}
Literary postmodernism was officially inaugurated in the United States with the first issue of ''[[boundary 2]]'', subtitled "Journal of Postmodern Literature and Culture", which appeared in 1972. [[David Antin]], [[Charles Olson]], [[John Cage]], and the [[Black Mountain College]] school of poetry and the arts were integral figures in the intellectual and artistic exposition of postmodernism at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''The origins of postmodernity'', London: Verso, 1998, Ch.2: "Crystallization".&lt;/ref&gt; ''boundary 2'' remains an influential journal in postmodernist circles today.&lt;ref&gt;''boundary 2'', Duke University Press, [http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/ Boundary2.dukejournals.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Arab-American scholar [[Ihab Hassan]] published ''The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature,'' an early work of literary criticism from a postmodern perspective, in which the author traces the development of what he calls "literature of silence" through [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], Beckett, and many others, including developments such as the [[Theatre of the Absurd]] and the [[nouveau roman]]. In 'Postmodernist Fiction' (1987), [[Brian McHale]] details the shift from modernism to postmodernism, arguing that the former is characterized by an epistemological dominant, and that postmodern works have developed out of modernism and are primarily concerned with questions of ontology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian McHale|McHale, B.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ec2HAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Postmodernist Fiction''] ([[Abingdon-on-Thames]]: [[Routledge]], 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Constructing Postmodernism'' (1992), McHale's second book, he provides readings of postmodern fiction and of some of the contemporary writers who go under the label of [[cyberpunk]].

===Music===
[[File:Henryk Mikołaj Górecki Polish composer.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Henryk Górecki]].]]
{{Main article|Postmodern music|Postmodern classical music|Art pop}}

[[Postmodern music]] is either music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of the [[modernism|modernist]]. Because of this, postmodern music is mostly defined in opposition to [[Modernism (music)|modernist music]], and a work can either be modernist, or postmodern, but not both. [[Jonathan Kramer]] posits the idea (following [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]) that postmodernism (including ''musical'' postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an ''attitude''.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

The postmodern impulse in classical music arose in the 1960s with the advent of musical [[minimalism]]. Composers such as [[Terry Riley]], [[Henryk Górecki]], [[Bradley Joseph]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[Lou Harrison]] reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably [[John Cage]] challenged the prevailing [[narrative]]s of beauty and objectivity common to Modernism. Some composers have been openly influenced by popular music and world ethnic musical traditions.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Postmodern classical music as well is not a musical ''style'', but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. It bears the same relationship to postmodernist music that postmodernity bears to postmodernism. Postmodern music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]]—that is, art that comes ''after'' and reacts ''against'' modernism.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Though representing a general return to certain notions of music-making that are often considered to be classical or romantic{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, not all postmodern composers have eschewed the experimentalist or academic tenets of modernism. The works of Dutch composer [[Louis Andriessen]], for example, exhibit experimentalist preoccupation that is decidedly anti-romantic. Eclecticism and freedom of expression, in reaction to the rigidity and aesthetic limitations of modernism, are the hallmarks of the postmodern influence in musical composition.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Author on postmodernism, Dominic Strinati, has noted, it is also important "to include in this category the so-called '[[art rock]]' musical innovations and mixing of styles associated with groups like [[Talking Heads]], and performers like [[Laurie Anderson]], together with the self-conscious 'reinvention of [[disco]]' by the [[Pet Shop Boys]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Theories of Popular Culture|last=Strinati|first=Dominic|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=234|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic design=== 
[[File:AprilGreiman.jpg|thumb|April Greiman]]
[[Graphic design]] in the postmodern age brought forth ideas that challenged the orderly feel of [[modernism]]. Graphic designers created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. Designers began experimenting with how shapes, forms and typography could react with one another effectively and interestingly in a less rigid way even if the design was rendered illegible. Some graphic design styles that emerged in the postmodernist era were [[New Wave (design)|New Wave]] Typography, retro and vernacular design, playful design inspired by the Italian [[Memphis Group]], punk rock styles and explorative digital design from the late 1980's.  Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that "retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Graphic Design History|last = Drucker|first = Johanna and [[Emily McVarish]]|publisher = Pearson|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0132410755|location = |pages = 305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched for more and more ways to go against the system. Postmodernism did not seek rules but only creative solutions and innovative ideas. The clean orderly grid-based designs of [[International Typographic Style]] were interrupted for more exploration and innovation in color, composition, visual communication, and typography. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include [[Wolfgang Weingart]], [[April Greiman]], [[Jayme Odgers]], [[Tibor Kalman]], [[Dan Friedman (graphic designer)|Dan Friedman]], [[Paula Scher]], [[Neville Brody]], [[Michael Vanderbyl]] and [[Jamie Reid]].

==Criticisms==
{{Main article|Criticism of postmodernism}}
Criticisms of postmodernism are intellectually diverse, including the assertions that postmodernism is meaningless and promotes [[obscurantism]]. For example, [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals do not respond like people in other fields when asked, "what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc.?...If [these requests] can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to Hume's advice in similar circumstances: 'to the flames'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bactra.org/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html|title=Noam Chomsky on Post-Modernism|work=bactra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] has noted "The idea that we live in a postmodern culture is a myth. In fact, a postmodern culture is an impossibility; it would be utterly unliveable. People are not relativistic when it comes to matters of science, [[engineering]], and technology; rather, they are relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and [[ethics]]. But, of course, that's not postmodernism; that's [[modernism]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=William Lane| |authorlink=William Lane Craig| title=God is Not Dead Yet|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/july/13.22.html|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal, academic critiques of postmodernism can also be found in works such as ''[[Beyond the Hoax]]'' and ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''.

However, as for [[continental philosophy]], American academics have tended to label it "postmodernist", especially practitioners of "French Theory". Such a trend might derive from U.S. departments of Comparative Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uninomade.org/italian-theory-english|title=Italian Theory|work=UniNomade|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]], often considered a "postmodernist", rejected its theoretical assumptions by arguing that the structuralist and postmodernist visions of the world were not flexible enough to seek explanations in psychological, social and environmental domains at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guattari|first1=Felix|title=The three ecologies|journal=New formations|date=1989|url=http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/newformations/08_131.pdf|page=134|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] declared, "Postmodernism, the school of 'thought' that proclaimed 'There are no truths, only interpretations' has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for 'conversations' in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster."&lt;ref&gt;DENNETT ON WIESELTIER V. PINKER IN THE NEW REPUBLIC http://edge.org/conversation/dennett-on-wieseltier-v-pinker-in-the-new-republic&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel A. Farber]] and [[Suzanna Sherry]] criticised Postmodernism for reducing the complexity of the modern world to an expression of power and for undermining truth and reason: "If the modern era begins with the European Enlightenment, the postmodern era that captivates the radical multiculturalists begins with its rejection. According to the new radicals, the Enlightenment-inspired ideas that have previously structured our world, especially the legal and academic parts of it, are a fraud perpetrated and perpetuated by white males to consolidate their own power. Those who disagree are not only blind but bigoted. The Enlightenment's goal of an objective and reasoned basis for knowledge, merit, truth, justice, and the like is an impossibility: "objectivity," in the sense of standards of judgment that transcend individual perspectives, does not exist. Reason is just another code word for the views of the privileged. The Enlightenment itself merely replaced one socially constructed view of reality with another, mistaking power for knowledge. There is naught but power."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Farber and Suzanne Sherry, Beyond All Reason
The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law, New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/farber-reason.html&lt;/ref&gt;

H. Sidky pointed out what he sees as several "inherent flaws" of a postmodern antiscience perspective, including the confusion of the authority of science (evidence) with the scientist conveying the knowledge; its self-contradictory claim that all truths are relative; and its strategic ambiguity. He sees 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudo-scientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, as rooted in a postmodernist "decades-long academic assault on science:" "Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards. Sadly, they forgot the lofty ideals of their teachers, except that science is bogus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sidky |first1=H. |title=The War on Science, Anti-Intellectualism, and ‘Alternative Ways of Knowing’ in 21st-Century America |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=38-43 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606170145/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/e_war_on_science_anti-intellectualism_and_alternative_ways_of_knowing_in_21 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Power Rangers Dino Thunder''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[children's television]] series, the twelfth season of the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise.
As with all ''Power Rangers'' series, it was adapted from a series from the long running [[Japan]]ese [[Super Sentai]] franchise, in this case the 27th entry, ''[[Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FOR YOUNG VIEWERS; Those Mighty Power Rangers Just Keep On Morphing|work= The New York Times|date=2004-02-29|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/29/tv/for-young-viewers-those-mighty-power-rangers-just-keep-on-morphing.html?scp=9&amp;sq=Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-07 | first=Ben | last=Sisario}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dino Thunder'' was also the subtitle of the [[Korean language|Korean]] dub of ''Abaranger'' in [[South Korea]] and had a similar/identical logo to the American version as well.
The series is notable as it features the return of [[Jason David Frank]] to a starring role. This was the first season since ''[[Power Rangers: Wild Force]]'' to have an African American ranger back to the series due to production move from Los Angeles to New Zealand and shift to Non-SAG talent actors during [[Power Rangers Ninja Storm|the previous season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Power Rangers Dino Thunder - Legacy of Power |publisher= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/12284/power-rangers-dino-thunder-legacy-of-power/|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Power Rangers Dino Thunder - Day of the Dino |publisher= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/11007/power-rangers-dino-thunder-day-of-the-dino/|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first ''Power Rangers'' series to be aired on the new block, [[Jetix]], and [[Toon Disney]].

==Plot==
{{main|List of Power Rangers Dino Thunder characters|List of Power Rangers Dino Thunder episodes}}
A [[soccer]] player, a computer expert, a singer, an artist, and a teacher with a long history of such situations join forces to become [[Power Rangers]] and help save the Earth from the scheming of [[Mesogog]], a dinosauric villain who wishes to eradicate all human life and return Earth to the age of [[dinosaur]]s.

In this season, [[Tommy Oliver]], from ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' to ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]'' fame, returns as a [[paleontology]] professor in Reefside, California. When he is assigned three detention students, [[Conner McKnight|Conner]], [[Dino Thunder Power Rangers#Ethan James|Ethan]], and [[Kira Ford|Kira]], they end up finding the Dino Gems, paving the way for them to become the Dino Rangers. Conner gains the power of the Tyrannozord (based on the [[Tyrannosaurus]]), as well as super-speed; Ethan gains the power of the Tricerazord (based on the [[Triceratops]]), as well as the ability to make his skin invulnerable; and Kira gains the power of the Pterazord (based on the [[Pteranodon]]), as well as a sonic scream. Tommy (known often as Dr. O) himself once again becomes a Power Ranger by joining the team as the Black Dino Ranger with the power of invisibility, and they are also later joined by [[Trent Mercer]] as the White Dino Ranger, with the power of camouflage. Trent must deal with the inner struggle of good and evil, as Tommy himself once had to do as the evil Green Ranger, because he gained his powers from a raw Dino Gem in Mesogog's lab, with the powers originally intended to be Mesogog's. Mesogog is in fact, Trent's adopted father Anton Mercer, who, in a faulty lab experiment, began to mutate into Mesogog. Trent later sides with good and saves his father from the mutation.

During the course of the series, the team adds the following to its arsenal of Zords: Cephalozord (based on the [[Pachycephalosaurus]]), Dimetrozord (based on the [[Dimetrodon]]), Stegozord (based on the [[Stegosaurus]]), Parasaurzord (based on the [[Parasaurolophus]]), and Ankylozord (based on the [[Ankylosaurus]]). The Stegozord later combines with Trent's zord, the Dragozord (based on the [[Tupuxuara]]), to form the Dino Stegozord. Tommy pilots the Brachiozord (based on the [[Brachiosaurus]]), the carrier for all the other Zords. Conner is also given the power to become the Triassic Ranger, and pilots the Mezodon Rover/Megazord (based on the [[Styracosaurus]]), which can combine with the Cephalo, Dimetro, Parasaur and Ankylozords to form the Triceramax Megazord.

At the end of the series, the Rangers destroy Mesogog with their raw Dino Gem power, but the gems are burned out in the process. Just before this, they are also forced to sacrifice all the Zords in their last battle with Zeltrax, one of Mesogog's strongest minions.Finally they return to their normal lives.

==Production==
Due to the mention that Power Rangers solely existed as a comic book in ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]'', many fans believed that series existed in a different universe than that of the original Power Rangers series. (However, [[Power Rangers in Space]] had previously mentioned a Ranger-based comic book in its crossover with [[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]). Fans also believed this due to the lack of a ''Ninja Storm''/''[[Power Rangers Wild Force|Wild Force]]'' team-up episode, partly due to the actors refusing to come since much of the production crew had been laid off as well as the change in hands of the Power Rangers franchise from [[Saban Entertainment|Saban]] to [[Disney]] and filming locations from [[United States]] to [[New Zealand]]. Executive producer [[Douglas Sloan (television producer)|Douglas Sloan]] also received heavy criticism for not tying ''Ninja Storm'' in with the original universe.

To tie up all of the loose ''Ninja Storm'' ends, and to try to bring in a larger audience, Sloan brought back [[Jason David Frank]] and his original character, the once evil turned hero, green, white, red, and now black ranger from ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' through ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]'', [[Tommy Oliver]], a legendary Power Ranger, as a mentor for the new team as well as a fellow Power Ranger. Jason Frank has said that he did the show as a favor for Sloan. Through the episodes "[[Legacy of Power]]" (the 500th episode overall), a look back on all of the previous Power Rangers series; "[[Back in Black (Power Rangers)|Back in Black]]", giving Tommy new Power Ranger powers; "[[Fighting Spirit (Power Rangers)|Fighting Spirit]]", seeing Tommy encounter his previous Ranger forms and airing on the eleventh anniversary of ''Power Rangers'' no less; and "Thunder Storm", a team-up arc between ''Dino Thunder'' and ''Ninja Storm'', all previous series were included in the original Power Rangers universe.

Also in the season premiere "[[Day of the Dino]]", [[Mesogog]] knew of [[Lothor]] as he mentioned Reefside would believe he had returned to town, although Blue Bay Harbor was Lothor's target in Ninja Storm.
However considering Conner's twin brother attended the Wind Ninja Academy it is possible the two towns are relatively nearby one another, explaining Mesogog's statement.

''Dino Thunder'' also was the first Power Rangers series to overtly acknowledge its [[Super Sentai]] roots with an episode entitled "Lost and Found in Translation," which featured a Japanese show based on the Power Rangers dubbed in English. In actuality, the footage used in that episode was from episode 10 ("Abare League Bind") of ''Dino Thunder'''s source series, ''[[Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger]]'', dubbed in a manner similar to the comedic parody dub of ''[[Kagaku Sentai Dynaman]]'' in the late 1980s.

==Video games==
There were two games produced for ''Dino Thunder''. On the [[Game Boy Advance]], there was a sidescrolling game, which was a platformer involving fighting several villains from the series. The other game was produced for the [[PlayStation 2]] and the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. This was the first Power Rangers game produced on a [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation console]]. All the action takes place inside the zords. This game also had some inconsistencies with the television series to allow the action to take place in the zords while battling the regular enemies who were human size.

== Home media ==
Currently, 23 of the 38 episodes are available in various volumes on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]], whereas a complete box set was released in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] on July 14, 2008. [[Shout! Factory]] has released the entire series as part of their "Seasons 8 – 12" [[DVD]] box set. The complete Region 1 season is now available individually as of October 2016.

'''Princess and dragon''' is a generic premise common to many [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and [[chivalric romance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' p 83 {{ISBN|0-226-35992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Northrop Frye]] identified it as a central form of the [[quest]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]].

The story involves an upper class woman, generally a princess or similar high-ranking nobility, saved from a [[dragon]], either a literal dragon or a similar danger, by the virtuous hero (see [[Damsel in distress]]). She may be the first woman endangered by the peril, or may be the end of a long succession of women who were not of as high birth as she is, nor as fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 189, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the princess ends up married to the dragon-slayer.

The motifs of the hero who finds the princess about to be sacrificed to the dragon and saves her, the [[false hero]] who takes his place, and the final revelation of the true hero, are the identifying marks of the [[Aarne–Thompson]] folktale type 300, the Dragon-Slayer. They also appear in type 303, the Two Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 24-5, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  These two tales have been found, in different variants, in countries all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 27, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The "princess and dragon" scenario is given even more weight in popular imagination than it is in the original tales; the stereotypical hero is envisioned as slaying dragons even though, for instance, the [[Brothers Grimm]] had only a few tales of dragon and giant slayers among hundreds of tales.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 282, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest example of the motif comes from the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] tale of [[Perseus]], who rescued the princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], a sea monster often described as resembling a serpent or dragon. This was taken up into other [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], such as [[Heracles]], who rescued the princess [[Hesione]] of [[Troy]] from a similar sea monster.  Most ancient versions depicted the dragon as the expression of a god's wrath: in Andromeda's case, because her mother [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]] had compared her beauty to that of the sea [[nymph]]s, and in Hesione's, because her father had reneged on a bargain with [[Poseidon]]. This is less common in fairy tales and other, later versions, where the dragon is frequently acting out of malice.
[[Image:Yoshitoshi Nihon-ryakushi Susanoo-no-mikoto.jpg|thumb|right|''Susanoo'' slaying the ''Yamata no Orochi'', by [[Yoshitoshi]]]]

The Japanese legend of [[Yamata no Orochi]] also invokes this motif. The god Susanoo encounters two "Earthly Deities" who have been forced to sacrifice their seven daughters to the many-headed monster.  Susanoo is able to kill the dragon after getting it drunk on [[sake]] (rice wine).

Another variation is from the tale of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. The tale begins with a dragon making its nest at the [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] which provides a [[city-state]] with water. Consequently, the citizens had to temporarily remove the dragon from its nest in order to collect water. To do so, they offered the dragon a daily [[human sacrifice]]. The victim of the day was chosen by drawing lots. Eventually in this [[lottery]], the lot happened to fall to the local princess. The local [[monarch]] is occasionally depicted begging for her life with no result. She is offered to the dragon but at this point a traveling [[Saint George]] arrives. He faces and defeats the dragon and saves the princess; some versions claim that the dragon is not killed in the fight, but pacified once George ties the princess' sash around its neck. The grateful citizens then abandon their ancestral [[paganism]] and convert to [[Christianity]].

When the tale is not about a dragon but a [[troll]], [[Giant (mythology)|giant]], or [[ogre]], the princess is often a captive rather than about to be eaten, as in ''[[The Three Princesses of Whiteland]]''. These princesses are often a vital source of information to their rescuers, telling them how to perform tasks that the captor sets to them, or how to kill the monster, and when she does not know, as in ''[[The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body]]'', she frequently can pry the information from the giant. Despite the hero's helplessness without this information, the princess is incapable of using the knowledge herself.  

[[Image:Orlando Furioso 20.jpg|thumb|right|Ruggiero Rescuing Angelica, an illustration for ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
Again, if a [[False hero|false claimant]] intimidates her into silence about who actually killed the monster as in the [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Two Brothers]]'', when the hero appears, she will endorse his story, but she will not tell the truth prior to them; she often agrees to marry the false claimant in the hero's absence.  The hero has often cut out the tongue of the dragon, so when the false hero cuts off its head, his claim to have killed it is refuted by its lack of a tongue; the hero produces the tongue and so proves his claim to marry the princess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Lüthi]], ''Once Upon A Time: On the Nature of Fairy Tales'', p 54, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., New York, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  In some tales, however, the princess herself takes steps to ensure that she can identify the hero&amp;mdash;cutting off a piece of his cloak as in ''[[Georgic and Merlin]]'', giving him tokens as in ''[[The Sea-Maiden]]''&amp;mdash;and so separate him from the false hero.

This dragon-slaying hero appears in [[Romance (heroic literature)|medieval romances]] about [[knight-errant|knights-errant]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' p 84 {{ISBN|0-226-35992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Russian ''[[Dobrynya Nikitich]]''. In some variants of [[Tristan and Iseult]], [[Tristan]] wins [[Iseult]] for his uncle, King [[Mark of Cornwall]], by killing a dragon that was devastating her father's kingdom; he has to prove his claim when the king's steward claims to be the dragon-slayer.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Wilson, ''Traditional Romance and Tale'', p 46, D.S. Brewer, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Ipswitch, 1976, {{ISBN|0-87471-905-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ludovico Ariosto]] took the concept up into ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' using it not once but twice: the rescue of [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] by Ruggiero, and [[Orlando (character)|Orlando]] rescuing Olimpia. The monster that menaced Olimpia reconnected to the Greek myths; although Ariosto described it as a legend to the characters, the story was that the monster sprung from an offense against [[Proteus]]. In neither case did he marry the rescued woman to the rescuer. [[Edmund Spenser]] depicts St. George in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', but while Una is a princess who seeks aid against a dragon, and her depiction in the opening with a lamb fits the iconography of St. George pagents, the dragon imperils her parents' kingdom, and not her alone. Many tales of dragons, ending with the dragon-slayer marrying a princess, do not precisely fit this cliché because the princess is in no more danger than the rest of the threatened kingdom.

An unusual variant occurs in [[Child ballad]] 34, ''[[Kemp Owyne]]'', where the dragon ''is'' the maiden; the hero, based on [[Ywain]] from Arthurian legend, rescues her from the [[Shapeshifting|transformation]] with three kisses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis James Child]], ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 306, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern versions==
[[Image:За единую Россію.jpg|right|thumb|Russian civil war [[propaganda]] poster: &lt;br&gt; [[White movement|White Russian]] knight is fighting the &lt;br&gt;[[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Red Russian]] dragon]]

In ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', [[Walt Disney]] concluded the tale by having the [[wicked fairy godmother]] [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]] transform herself into a dragon to withstand the prince, converting the fairy tale to one with the princess and dragon theme.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Sleeping Beauty" p 874 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'', both the book and film versions feature a tank in the shape of a dragon that protects Dr. No's island from superstitious intruders.  [[James Bond]] and [[Honey Rider|Honeychile Rider]] are menaced by the dragon, do battle with it, have their friend Quarrel killed and are captured by the crew of the Dragon tank.  Ann Boyd's 1967 book ''The Devil with James Bond'' explores the theory of the updating of the Princess and dragon genre.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

In modern [[fantasy]] works, the dragon may hold the princess captive instead of eating her. [[Patricia Wrede]] spoofed this concept in ''[[Dealing with Dragons]]''.

A subversion of the concept for young readers is [[Robert Munsch]]'s ''[[The Paper Bag Princess]]'', in which a princess outwits a dragon to save a prince (her betrothed, whom she proceeds ''not'' to marry upon him insulting her makeshift clothing instead of thanking her).

In Jay Williams's tale ''The Practical Princess'', a dragon demands that a king should sacrifice his daughter to him so that he will leave the rest of the kingdom alone. But the princess saves herself by making a "princess dummy" out of straw, and filling it with boiling pitch and tar. The princess dresses the dummy in one of her own gowns, then goes to the dragon's cave where she offers herself as a sacrifice. The unwitting dragon swallows the straw dummy whole, and the pitch and tar explodes inside the dragon's stomach, killing him. Afterwards, the princess observes, "Dragons are not very smart."

In the [[Isaac Asimov]] short story ''[[Prince Delightful and the Flameless Dragon]]'', it is revealed that Dragons used to be slain as part of a passage from princehood to adulthood, though after a while, they became a protected species. Contrary to popular myth, they don't eat princesses as they tend to smell of cheap perfume and give indigestion.

==Diversions==

In some stories, mostly in more recent literary works, the cliche involving princesses and dragons is somehow twisted to create a more exciting or humorous effect. For example, in ''[[The Paper Bag Princess]]'', the princess came to realize that her prince was even more obnoxious than the dragon, and refused to go with him, preferring to skip off into the setting sun alone instead. In some versions, the princess may also befriend, tame, personally defeat, or even be turned into a dragon herself. Indeed, there are a few examples when a curse or spell transforms a princess into a dragon or similar creature (e.g. an alligator, giant bird, or fictional reptile species). In such stories, the transformed princess usually aids her sweetheart in a battle against a force of evil. In ''[[The Swan Princess]]'', for example, Princess Odette is transformed into a [[swan]], and she helps her lover triumph in a battle against the sorcerer Rothbart, who has the power to transform himself into a hideous beast (a manifestation of a [[lion]], [[wolf]], and [[bear]]).

The '''''Saga of Cuckoo''''' is a series of [[science fiction]] novels by American writers [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]]. It consists of two novels, '''''Farthest Star''''' and '''''Wall Around a Star'''''.

The books feature an [[interstellar teleporter]] that leaves the original being behind and sends only a duplicate.  When a person is duplicated, the original can just pass out of the machine without a second thought.  The copies can be also be "edited" at destination.

==''Farthest Star''==

''Farthest Star'' was published by [[Ballantine Books]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/p/frederik-pohl/farthest-star.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[fix-up]] of the 1973 novella "Doomship" and the 1974 serial "The Org's Egg".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?3512&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the novel, engineer Ben Charles Pertin is selected to be humanity's representative in a multi-race mission to reach "Object Lambda", a mysterious object traveling towards the galaxy at 1/6th lightspeed. Since the object is still approaching, Ben and the others are transported to the probeship Aurora by a matter duplication transporter. While the original goes on with his life, the duplicate (Ben James) and his Companion, Doc Chimp, work with the rest of the beings to construct a faster drone to get a transporter in orbit of the object, racing against time as the ionizing radiation from the ship's fusion drive is slowly killing them. After a struggle, the drone is successfully launched, killing all on board.

The drone performs as planned and an orbiting habitat called Cuckoo Station is constructed. A new duplicate arrives, Ben Linc.

==''Wall Around a Star'' ==

''Wall Around a Star'' was published by [[Del Rey Books]] on January 12, 1983. The cover art for the 1983 edition was done by [[David Burroughs Mattingly|David Mattingly]].&lt;ref name="IBL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iblist.com/book19581.htm  | title = Book Information: Wall Around a Star  | publisher = Internet Book List  | accessdate = 2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In this novel linguist Jen Babylon is called on to translate alien records which may explain the nature of "Cuckoo", a sphere built around a star, and thus save the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickerson|first=Susan L|title=Wall Around a Star (book)|journal=Library Journal|date=1983-02-15|volume=108|issue=4|page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elementary school spelling bee, December 2011.jpg|thumb|right|A spelling bee at an elementary school, with a speller addressing an audience and a judge, with other contestants behind them]]

A '''spelling bee''' is a [[competition]] in which contestants are asked to [[spelling|spell]] a broad selection of words, usually with a varying degree of difficulty. The concept is thought to have originated in the [[United States]],{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and spelling bee events, along with variants, are now also held in some other countries around the world.
The first winner of an official spelling bee was [[Frank Neuhauser]], who won the 1st National Spelling Bee (now known as the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]]) in Washington, D.C. in 1925 at age eleven.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Margalit|last=Fox|title=Frank Neuhauser, a Speller's Speller, Dies at 97 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23neuhauser.html?_r=1 |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Historically the word ''bee'' has been used to describe a get-together for [[communal work]], like a husking bee, a quilting bee, or an apple bee. According to [[Etymology|etymological]] research recorded in dictionaries, the word probably comes from dialectal ''been'' or ''bean'' (meaning "help given by neighbors"), which came from [[Middle English]] ''bene'' (meaning "prayer", "boon" and "extra service by a tenant to his lord").
&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com
Also, bees draw out figures and alphabets when flying; hence the appropriate use of bees to describe a competition with extensive use of alphabets.
[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bee?s=t Bee] Retrieved March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bee%5B3%5D |title=Definition of BEE |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Norman Rockwell - Cousin Reginald Spells Peloponnesus (Spelling Bee) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|"Cousin Reginald Spells Peloponnesus." ([[Norman Rockwell]], 1918)]]
The earliest known evidence of the phrase ''spelling bee'' in print dates back to 1850, although an earlier name, ''spelling match'', has been traced back to 1808.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/spelling_bee_spelling_match/ Barry Popik, "Spelling Bee (Spelling Match)," The Big Apple (April 13, 2013; accessed April 16, 2013)].&lt;/ref&gt;  A key impetus for the contests was [[Noah Webster]]'s spelling books. First published in 1786 and known colloquially as "The Blue-backed Speller," Webster's spelling books were an essential part of the curriculum of all elementary school children in the United States for five generations. Now the key reference for the contests is the [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]].&lt;ref name = official/&gt;

The United States National Spelling Bee was started in 1925 by ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'', the newspaper of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]]. In 1941, the [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps Howard News Service]] acquired sponsorship of the program, and the name changed to the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee|Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee]] (later simply "Scripps National Spelling Bee"). Besides competitors from the 50 U.S. states, several come from Canada, the Bahamas, New Zealand and European countries.

In the United States, spelling bees are annually held from local levels up to the level of the Scripps National Spelling Bee which awards a cash prize to the winner. The National Spelling Bee is sponsored by English-language newspapers and educational foundations; it is also broadcast on [[ESPN]]. Since 2006, the National Spelling Bee's championship rounds have been broadcast on ABC live. In 2005, contestants came from the Bahamas, Jamaica, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Canada, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and a German military base, as well as the United States. This was the first year that spellers from Canada and New Zealand attended the competition. The final authority for words is the ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=official&gt;[http://spellingbee.com/contest-rules-2014-scripps-national-spelling-bee Contest rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011141742/http://spellingbee.com/contest-rules-2014-scripps-national-spelling-bee |date=2016-10-11 }}. spellingbee.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual study list is available from Scripps, either online or in print.

The National Senior Spelling Bee started in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], Wyoming in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-2007/spelling_beed.html "AARP's 12th Annual National Senior Spelling Bee to Take Place June 16 in Cheyenne, Wyoming"]. 2007-06-12. aarp.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by the Wyoming AARP, it is open to contestants 50 and older. Maria Dawson is the only contestant to ever win two back-to-back titles at the National Senior Spelling Bee.

The [[South Asian Spelling Bee]] is another spelling bee platform in the US. This annual contest takes place across the US each summer in search of the next South Asian-American spelling champ between the ages of 8 and 14 years old. Launched in 2008, the [[South Asian Spelling Bee]] will tour 10 US cities in 2011 and is broadcast globally via the satellite channel, [[Sony Entertainment Television Asia]].

Holding spelling bees in English, with its irregular spelling, makes more sense than in languages that have much more regular spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McWhorter|first1=John|title=English is not normal|url=https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages|website=[[Aeon (digital magazine)]]|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other regions, countries and communities==

===Africa===
In Africa, a spelling bee is organized by the African Spelling Bee, which holds an Annual Spelling Bee contest for children between the age of 6 and 16  across the continent. The first competition took place in July 2016, bringing together nine different countries.

There are several countries that run their own national spelling bees, including Uganda which holds the National Spelling Bee organized by enjuba in 10 different languages, including 8 local languages, sign language and English.

Nigeria's spelling bee is called the Nigeria Spelling Bee organized by the Bee Spelling Competition Initiative in states across the federation of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Botswana, Nigeria, [[Kenya]], [[South Africa]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Malawi]], and [[Rwanda]] are also part of the African Spelling Bee with the number of countries still growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanspellingbee.com African Spelling Bee Consortium]. africanspellingbee.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

In Asia, a spelling bee is being conducted up to the international level by [[MaRRS Spelling Bee]]. The competition involves learning the correct spelling of words, their use insentences and in multiple contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/05/12/stories/2010051253520300.htm |title=Tamil  Chennai News : Being a spelling bee pays off |publisher=The Hindu |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is being held in [[India]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Ajman]], [[Bahrain]], [[Dubai]], [[Fujairah]], Ras-al-Khaima, [[Sharjah]], and [[Umm al-Quwain|Umm-Al-Quwain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marrsspellingbee.com/about.php |title=About MaRRS International Spelling Bee |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511012142/http://marrsspellingbee.com/about.php |archivedate=May 11, 2016
|accessdate=May 3, 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Bahrain, an annual spelling bee contest named ''Spellbound Bahrain'' is conducted for the school children by KEEN4, an association of Kerala Engineers.

In Malaysia, the annual NST-RHB Spell-it-Right Challenge is open to primary and secondary school students under the Malaysian education syllabus. The competition is carried out in three rounds: the Preliminary Challenge, State Challenge and National Challenge. The preliminary challenge is a written spelling test, from which the top 100 spellers will be chosen to compete in the State Challenge, where the competition is carried out orally. The 1st prize winner from this stage will then represent their states to compete for the title of National Spell-it-Right Champion in the National Challenge.

In Taiwan, the National Spelling Bee Championship is a contest held by Bugstation.tv for young English learners. Thousands of young applicants join this contest each year. Another organisation that promotes the love of the English language is Horizons Unlimited, which in 2011 organized an India Spelling Bee contest for children in the southern state of [[Kerala]] in India.

The annual [[Asia Spelling Cup]] is held in different cities throughout Asia, and uses mobile pre-selection testing to identify finalists.

=== Australia ===
In Western Australia, a spelling bee is held by the [[State Library of Western Australia|State Library Foundation of Western Australia]], for children in school years 5, 6, 7 and 8. The early stages of the competition are held online, and the final spell-off in front of a live audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Spelling Bee|url=http://www.spellingbee.org.au/About-us.aspx|work=spellingbee.org.au|publisher=[[State Library of Western Australia|State Library Foundation of Western Australia]]|accessdate=2013-06-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410031354/http://www.spellingbee.org.au/About-us.aspx|archivedate=2013-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major prizes are awarded: one for a Junior Winner (Years 5-6) and the other for a Senior Winner (Years 7-8).  Further prizes are given to the teacher and school class of each major prize winner, and to the most improved speller each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prizes|url=http://www.spellingbee.org.au/Prizes.aspx|work=spellingbee.org.au|publisher=State Library Foundation of Western Australia|accessdate=2013-06-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411005341/http://www.spellingbee.org.au/Prizes.aspx|archivedate=2013-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
Starting in 2012, [[Bangladesh]]'s English daily newspaper, [[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] and e-Learning portal Champs21 have been organizing a televised spelling bee on [[Channel i]] for the students of class six to ten from Bengali and English medium backgrounds, who compete through their schools and the Champs21 website. The spelling bee team visits 7 divisional cities ([[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rangpur City|Rangpur]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]] &amp; [[Barisal]]) to test top 1% speller and top 96 speller of the season participate in the television show. The competition is the first such arrangement in Bangladesh. The champion is rewarded with a trip to Washington, DC. The winners of season 2 met the honorable president of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Advocate [[Abdul Hamid (politician)|Abdul Hamid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = winners meet the president|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/winners-meet-president/|website = The Daily Star|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
The ''Postmedia [[Canspell National Spelling Bee]]'' is the only Scripps affiliated Canadian spelling bee held annually nationwide in [[Canada]] since 2005. The bee is affiliated with the [[United States]]-based [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] and uses similar rules and word lists, and competes in all 10 Canadian provinces to provide a Canadian National Champion for the penultimate [[Scripps National Spelling Bee|Scripps]] competition.

It should not be confused with another organization, calling itself the [[Spelling Bee of Canada]], which started in 1987 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and is now celebrating its 25th anniversary, and hosting a Canadian Invitational Bee in 2012, as well as organizing Provincial Bees across Canada, and the world.

=== Kuwait ===
In the school year 2008–2009, Mrs. Wijdan Alawadhi (senior teacher) and Mrs. Mona Yehia (teacher of English) started the spelling bee contest in Mubarak al-Kabir Educational Area (one of the biggest Kuwaiti Governorates). They started the contest as an experiment contest in their school (Thabet Bin Zaid Primary School for Boys) with the fourth and fifth grades. It was a successful experiment which was faced with a lot of appreciation from Mrs. Aisha Al Awadhi, ELT Senior Supervisor of English Language supervision. Then they decided to hold the competition among the whole educational area (Mubarak Al-Kabeer Educational area). In 2010–2011, the contest was held with 27 schools (12 schools for boys and 15 for girls - around 2700 pupils). Each school nominated a pupil from the fifth grade to participate.

In 2012–2013, 30 schools participated. All the 30 pupils participated anxiously to win the competition with 200 words. It becomes officially an authorized contest in Mubarak Al-Kabeer Educational Area (Kuwaiti Spelling Bee) in [[Kuwait City|Kuwait]]. In the school year 2013–2014 the competition was held in Al-Imam Al-Shafie primary school for boys with 31 schools and the words list contained 260 words.

In 2014–2015 with the patronage of Mr. Talaq Al-Hiem the director of Mubarak Al-Kabeer Educational Area the competition held with the participation of 33 schools (16 girls, 15 boys and 2 LD) in Sabah AL-Salem Primary school with the help of its principal Mrs. Amira Baqer. Mrs. Aisha Al-Awadhi and the success of the competition convinced the ELT General supervision to decide the competition as Kuwait National Spelling Bee for the coming year 2015–2016.

The Nigeria Spelling Bee is organized in across states of the federation with national finalists drawn after qualifying from their respective states and either of the 6 geo-political zones of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nigeriaspellingbee.com|title=Nigeria Spelling Bee|website=Nigeria Spelling Bee|language=en-NG|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigeria Spelling Bee which is the widest spelling bee competition in the country has so far been conducted in more than 25 states across Nigeria by the organizers (Bee Spelling Competition Initiative&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nigeriaspellingbee.com/about-us|title=About Us|date=2013-05-30|work=Nigeria Spelling Bee|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-NG}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which has been endorsed by the [[Federal Ministry of Education (Nigeria)|Federal Ministry of Education]], Ministry of Culture and other states ministries of Education.

Winners of the Nigeria Spelling Bee competition win up to N1,000,000 in scholarship and participate in the annual African Spelling Bee which is a continental event organized by the African Spelling Bee Consortium as the official Nigerian delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvcontinental.tv/2016/08/18/13-year-old-nigerian-shines-continental-spelling-bee/|title=13-year old Nigerian shines in continental Spelling Bee - COMPLETE ENTERTAINMENT|date=2016-08-18|work=COMPLETE ENTERTAINMENT|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition is for students in any registered school in Nigeria from the ages of 9years to 16 years who have to register on the competition's website.

===Nepal===
In 2010, Spelling bee was held for the first time in Nepal organized by Rotaract Club of Charumati. Where Benish Shrestha, Grade 10, Galaxy Public School who came first, Bibek Rauniyar, Grade 10, Gillette International Boarding School who came second and Arnav Singh from Grade 9 Little Angels School who secured third position.

Now Spelling Bee-Nepal is going Organize by Evention Master.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the spelling bee competition is promoted by Dawn,{{Clarify|reason=What is Dawn?|date=November 2016}} and it takes place every year in October. There are three stages: district, regional and national. National is held in [[Islamabad]]. Dawn Spelling Bee is conducted in three stages. District and pool rounds are the first stage of the competition which are held across the districts and cities all across Pakistan. District champions compete in the Regional Championships which are held in 3 regions: [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], and [[Islamabad]]. Three regional winners from each group consisting of the regional champion, first runner up and second runner up compete in the national finals in Islamabad. Karachi Grammar School, EMS High School. Beaconhouse School System, Lahore Grammar School has won the competition several times. Laiba Ejaz of Roots School System, Saud Afzal Shafi of Beaconhouse School System, Saad-uz-Zaman Adhami of Aitchison College and Jazim Nadeem of EMS High School have made it several times to finals in Islamabad and emerged as winners.

===United Arab Emirates===
Sylvan Learning Center, a supplemental education organization from the United States, has organized an annual competition for Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah-area schools.  The Sylvan Spelling Challenge is held annually in December and February for students in grades 3-8.  The Sylvan competition expects to attract nearly 1,000 participants from 30 schools in its inaugural year.

Abu Dhabi University sponsors the largest Spelling Bee in the United Arab Emirates, attracting students from both public and private institutions for the past three years. The Abu Dhabi University Spelling Bee is heralded as the most challenging and well-known spelling competition in the United Arab Emirates.

===Saudi Arabia===
 
The English Language Department in Jeddah conducted a spelling bee competition, Spell Saudia, in 2017 and 2018. The competition has three rounds:
Round One: held at the educational offices level and the best 3 spellers from each group are nominated to round 2. 
Round Two:18 spellers from each stage compete against each other and the best six spellers are nominated for the final round which takes place at the ELDJ Closing Ceremony at the end of the academic year.

=== Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas ===
Different companies/schools organize and participate in different, independent spelling bees, but the largest company in Latin America to organize annual international spelling bees since 2015 is Advanced Methods Corporation (Amco), a U.S. based company that promotes learning English as a second language. Schools from Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, Honduras, and El Salvador enrolled to the Amco system are eligible to participate in the annual Amco Spelling Bee, consisting of 3 stages: school (selection of students to participate in the regional, repeats with the next stages), regional, and international. The international one is always set in Guadalajara, Jalisco, in Expo Guadalajara, and is almost always held in the last days of May or beginnings of June.&lt;ref&gt;=== http://es.amco.me/blog/hello-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 1876 there were newspaper reports of spelling bees in a number of towns in the [[United Kingdom]]. Since 2009, ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper has run a spelling bee for schools: [[Times Spelling Bee|The Times Spelling Bee]].

===United States of America===
{{Main|Scripps National Spelling Bee}}

Serious spelling bee competitors in the United States will study [[affix]]es and etymologies, and often foreign languages from which English draws, in order to spell challenging words. Several preparatory materials have been published, including some in connection with the Scripps National Spelling Bee and those created by independent organizations not related to Scripps.

For the first several decades of publication, the Scripps annual study booklet was named ''Words of the Champions'', which offered 3,000 words in a list separated into beginning, intermediate &amp; expert groupings. In the mid-1990s the annual study list changed to ''[[Paideia]]'' (from the Greek word meaning education and culture), which ultimately contained more than 4,100 words, then again in 2006 to the shorter list, entitled ''Spell It!'', the 2009 edition having 1155 words (911 basic words and 244 challenge words).

The ''Consolidated Word List'', also published by Scripps and available on the National Spelling Bee website, consists of all words used in the National Bee as far back as 1950. It is organized into three sections: Words Appearing Infrequently, Words Appearing with Moderate Frequency, and Word Appearing Frequently. Nearly 800 pages and 24,000 words long, the ''Consolidated Word List'' is intended for those who have mastered the basics and already gone through ''Spell It!''. Spelling bee participants in the United States also use other reference books and tutoring materials are becoming available on the web.

==School spelling bees==
Spelling bee students usually start competition in [[elementary school]] ([[primary school]]) or [[middle school]]. Classes compete against other classes in the same grade, or level, and the winning class is determined by the score of each class.  On an individual level, school spelling bees determine which child will represent his or her school at district, state and national competitions.

In Uganda, School Spelling Bees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spellingbee.ug|title=Uganda Spelling Bee - Words Change the World|website=Uganda Spelling Bee - Words Change the World|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; start in the classroom, where a teacher introduces new words during normal lessons. In preparation for the School Spelling Day, these children compete against each other to get the winners who then go on to compete with others to determine the School team, which normally has 3 students for the English category and 1 for local language. The winners here go on to the district competition and the regional competition.

'''Structural linguistics''' is an approach to [[linguistics]] originating from the work of Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and is part of the overall approach of [[structuralism]]. Structural linguistics involves collecting a [[Speech corpus|corpus of utterances]] and then attempting to classify all of the elements of the corpus at their different linguistic levels: the [[phoneme]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[Lexical category|lexical categories]], [[noun phrase]]s, [[verb phrase]]s, and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] types.&lt;ref name="Searle1972"&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/19720629.htm John R. Searle, "Chomsky's Revolution in Linguistics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911081630/http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/19720629.htm |date=2013-09-11 }}, ''New York Review of Books'', June 29, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saussure's ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', published posthumously in 1916, stressed examining language as a static system of interconnected units. He is thus known as a father of modern linguistics for bringing about the shift from [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] (historical) to [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] (non-historical) analysis, as well as for introducing several basic dimensions of [[semiotic]] analysis that are still important today. Two of these are his key methods of [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] and [[paradigmatic analysis]] (or 'associations' as Saussure was still calling them),&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand de Saussure, ''Course in General Linguistics'', Open Court House.&lt;/ref&gt; which define units [[Syntax|syntactically]] and [[Lexicon|lexically]], respectively, according to their contrast with the other units in the system.

== History ==
Structural linguistics begins with the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' in 1916, which was compiled from lectures by his students. The book proved to be highly influential, providing the foundation for both modern linguistics and [[semiotics]]. Structuralist linguistics is normally seen as giving rise to independent European and American traditions.

===European structuralism===
In [[Europe]], Saussure influenced: (1) the [[Geneva School]] of [[Albert Sechehaye]] and [[Charles Bally]], (2) the [[Prague School]] of [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], whose work would prove hugely influential, particularly concerning [[phonology]], (3) the [[Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen School]] of [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and (4) the Paris School of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].&lt;ref&gt;Siobhan Chapman and Christopher Routledge (eds.), ''Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 107: "Algirdas Greimas".&lt;/ref&gt; Structural linguistics also had an influence on other disciplines in Europe, including [[anthropology]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Marxism]], bringing about the movement known as [[structuralism]].

===American structuralism===
First, in America, linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield|Leonard Bloomfield's]] reading of Saussure's course proved influential, bringing about the Bloomfieldean phase in American linguistics that lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. Bloomfield "bracketed" all questions of [[semantics]] and meaning as largely unanswerable, and encouraged a mechanistic approach to linguistics. Those working in more or less the tradition of Bloomfield included [[Charles Hockett]], [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]], and [[Zellig Harris]]. Bloomfieldean linguistics in America was challenged by [[generative grammar]], initially articulated in the publication of [[Noam Chomsky|Noam Chomsky's]] ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' in 1957.

== Basic theories and methods ==
The foundation of structural linguistics is a ''[[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]'', which in turn has two components: a "signified" is an idea or concept, while the "signifier" is a means of expressing the signified. The "sign" is thus the combined association of signifier and signified. Signs can be defined only by being placed in contrast with other signs, which forms the basis of what later became the paradigmatic dimension of semiotic organization (i.e., collections of terms/entities that stand in opposition). This idea contrasted drastically with the idea that signs can be examined in isolation from a language and stressed Saussure's point that linguistics must treat language synchronically.

Paradigmatic relations hold among sets of units that (in the early Saussurian renditions) exist in the mind, such as the set distinguished phonologically by variation in their initial sound ''cat, bat, hat, mat, fat'', or the morphologically distinguished set ''ran, run, running''. The units of a set must have something in common with one another, but they must contrast too, otherwise they could not be distinguished from each other and would collapse into a single unit, which could not constitute a set on its own, since a set always consists of more than one unit. Syntagmatic relations, in contrast, are concerned with how units, once selected from their paradigmatic sets of oppositions, are 'chained' together into structural wholes.

One further common confusion here is that syntagmatic relations, assumed to occur in time, are anchored in speech and are considered either diachronic (confusing syntagmatic with historical) or are part of parole ("everyday speech": confusing syntagmatic with performance and behaviour and divorcing it from the linguistic system), or both. Paradigmatic and syntagmatic organizations  both belong to the abstract system of language ''[[langue (linguistics)|langue]]'' (French for "Language;" or an abstract, Platonic ideal). Different linguistic theories place different weight on the study of these dimensions: all structural and generative accounts, for example, pursue primarily characterisations of the syntagmatic dimension of the language system (syntax), while functional approaches, such as [[systemic linguistics]], focus on the paradigmatic. Both dimensions need to be appropriately included, however.

Syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations provide the structural linguist with a tool for categorization for phonology, morphology and syntax. Take morphology, for example. The signs ''cat'' and ''cats'' are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of ''cat''. Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an ''S'' to the end of the word. Likewise, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the syntax of sentences. For instance, contrasting the syntagma {{lang|fr|je dois}} ("I should") and {{lang|fr|dois je?}} ("Should I?") allows us to realize that in French we only have to invert the units to turn a statement into a question. We thus take syntagmatic evidence (difference in structural configurations) as indicators of paradigmatic relations (e.g., in the present case: questions vs. assertions). The most detailed account of the relationship between a paradigmatic organisation of language as a motivator and classifier for syntagmatic configurations is that set out in the systemic-network organization of [[systemic functional grammar]], where paradigmatic relations and syntagmatic configurations each have their own separate formalisation, related by realization constraints. Modern linguistic formalisms that work in terms of lattices of linguistic signs, such as [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], similarly begin to separate out an explicit level of paradigmatic organization.

Saussure developed structural linguistics, with its idealized vision of language, partly because he was aware that it was impossible in his time to fully understand how the human brain and mind created and related to language: 
:Saussure set out to model language in purely linguistic terms, free of psychology, sociology, or anthropology. That is, Saussure was trying precisely ''not'' to say what goes on in your or my mind when we understand a word or make up a sentence. ... Saussure was trying to de-psychologize linguistics.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent perceptions of structuralism==
Those working in the generativist tradition often regard Structuralist approaches as outdated and superseded. For example, Mitchell Marcus writes that structural linguistics was "fundamentally inadequate to process the full range of natural language".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Mitchell, (1984) "Some Inadequate Theories of Human Language Processing." ''Talking Minds: The Study of Language in Cognitive Science''. Eds. Thomas G. Bever, John M. Carroll, and Lance A. Miller. Cambridge MA: MIT P, 1984. 253–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Holland&lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt; writes that Chomsky had "decisively refuted Saussure". Similar views have been expressed by [[Jan Koster]],&lt;ref&gt;"Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language," Koster, Jan. (1996) "Saussure meets the brain", in R. Jonkers, E. Kaan, J. K. Wiegel, eds., ''Language and Cognition'' '''5'''. Yearbook 1992 of the Research Group for Linguistic Theory and Knowledge Representation of the University of Groningen, Groningen, pp. 115–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Turner,&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Mark. 1987. ''Death is the Mother of Beauty: Mind, Metaphor, Criticism''. University of Chicago Press, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;Fabb, Nigel. (1988) "Saussure and literary theory: from the perspective of linguistics". ''Critical Quarterly'' '''30''':2 (June 1988), 58–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan. (2005) "From Lacan to Darwin", in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2005, pp. 38–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others however stress the continuing importance of Saussure's thought and Structuralist approaches. In 2012, [[Gilbert Lazard]] dismissed the Chomskyan approach as passé while applauding a return to Saussurrean structuralism as the only course by which linguistics can become more scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Lazard. "The case for pure linguistics." ''Studies in Language'' '''36''':2 (2012), 241–259. doi 10.1075/sl.36.2.02laz&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthews (2001) notes the existence of many "linguists who are structuralists by many of the definitions that have been proposed, but who would themselves vigorously deny that they are anything of the kind", suggesting a persistence of the structuralist paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Peter. ''A Short History of Structural Linguistics'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of structuralist linguistics upon other disciplines==
In the 1950s Saussure's ideas were appropriated by several prominent figures in [[Continental philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and from there were borrowed in [[literary theory]], where they are used to interpret novels and other texts. However, several critics have charged that Saussure's ideas have been misunderstood or deliberately distorted by continental philosophers and literary theorists and are certainly not directly applicable to the textual level, which Saussure himself would have firmly placed within parole and so not amenable to his theoretical constructs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Tallis|Tallis, Raymond]]. Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory, Macmillan Press 1988, 2nd ed. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Raymond. ''Theorrhoea and After'', Macmillan, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Elisa Esposito ([[Sally Hawkins]]) who was found abandoned as a child by the side of a river with wounds on her neck, is [[Muteness|mute]] and communicates through [[Sign language|sign language]]. She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema and works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, at the height of the [[Cold War]]. Her only friends are her [[Closeted|closeted]] next-door neighbor Giles ([[Richard Jenkins]]) a middle-aged struggling advertising illustrator and Zelda ([[Octavia Spencer]]) a co-worker who serves as her interpreter.

The facility receives a mysterious creature captured from the [[Amazon River]] by Colonel Richard Strickland ([[Michael Shannon]]) who is in charge of the project to study it. Believing it is just a wild beast, Strickland treats it brutally, repeatedly shocking it with his electric [[Cattle prod|cattle prod]]. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a male humanoid amphibian ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]). She begins visiting him in secret and the two form a close bond as she teaches him sign language.

Seeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for an American advantage in the [[Space Race|space race]], General Frank Hoyt ([[Nick Searcy]]) is eventually persuaded by Strickland to [[Vivisection|vivisect]] it. One scientist, Robert Hoffstetler ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]) - who is really a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy named Dimitri Mosenkov - pleads unsuccessfully to keep the Amphibian Man alive for further study and, at the same time, is ordered by his Soviet handlers to [[Euthanasia|euthanize]] the creature. When Elisa overhears the American plans for the Amphibian Man, she persuades Giles to help her free him. Hoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to help her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in the successful escape.

Elisa keeps the Amphibian Man in her bathtub. She plans to release him into a nearby canal when it rains to give access to the ocean in several days' time. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but learns nothing. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring one of his cats. Startled, the Amphibian Man slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs, luckily empty of patrons, before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. He touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm, and the next morning Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. After initially walking away, Elisa has sex with the Amphibian Man in her shower. For a later encounter, she fills the bathroom completely with water, which eventually begins to cause water to drip into the theater below. The upset theater owner alerts Giles, who then enters the apartment and opens the bathroom door, interrupting the tryst.

Hoyt unexpectedly arrives and asks for the status of the case. When Strickland questions how much experimentation is enough, he is told he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told he will be [[Extraction (military)|extracted]] in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health starts deteriorating. Hoffstetler goes to meet his handlers with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by a handler before Strickland kills him and then continuously tortures Hoffstetler for information (knowing he is a spy by virtue of having heard him speak Russian to his handler) while asking for the name and rank of who has the creature. Before dying, Hoffstetler implicates Elisa and Zelda. Strickland savagely threatens Zelda in her home until her husband Brewster (Martin Roach) reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man (having overheard her conversations). After Strickland's departure, Zelda immediately calls Elisa, warning her to get the creature out immediately. An enraged Strickland arrives and searches Elisa's empty apartment until he finds a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.

At the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man quickly heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on Elisa's neck, they open to reveal [[Gill|gills]] like his; she jolts back to life, and the two embrace. In a closing [[Voice-over|voice-over]] narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after in love" with the Amphibian Man.

Del Toro set the film during the 1960s Cold War era to counteract today's heightened tensions, specifying, "if I say once upon a time in 1962, it becomes a fairy tale for troubled times. People can lower their guard a little bit more and listen to the story and listen to the characters and talk about the issues, rather than the circumstances of the issues."&lt;ref name=MNDaily&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bennett |first=Haley |authorlink=Haley Bennett|title='Review: The Shape of Water' Mermaid film noir sounds like a fishy genre, but director Guillermo del Toro navigates it with skill.|url=http://www.mndaily.com/article/2017/12/a-review-the-shape-of-water|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=December 15, 2017 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===

A fan of her performances in ''[[Happy-Go-Lucky]]'' and ''[[Fingersmith (TV serial)|Fingersmith]]'', Del Toro wrote the script with [[Sally Hawkins]] in mind for the part and pitched the idea to her while intoxicated at the [[2014 Golden Globes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Lee|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/how-guillermo-del-toro-cast-sally-hawkins-in-shape-of-water.html|title=How Guillermo del Toro Got Drunk at a Golden Globes After-party and Made Sally Hawkins the Star of The Shape of Water|publisher=Vulture|date=November 30, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710101859/http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/how-guillermo-del-toro-cast-sally-hawkins-in-shape-of-water.html#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkins prepared for the role by watching films of silent comedians [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]] and was told by Del Toro to watch [[Stan Laurel]] from [[Laurel and Hardy]], whom Del Toro thought was capable of doing a "state of grace without conveying it verbally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/guillermo-del-toro-the-shape-of-water-fairy-tale-sally-hawkins-richard-jenkins-complete-interview-transcript-news|title=Guillermo del Toro ('The Shape of Water'): 'A fairy tale for troubled times' [Complete Interview Transcript]|last=Beachum|first=Chris|last2=Dixon|first2=Marcus James|date=December 26, 2017|website=GoldDerby|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102211/https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/guillermo-del-toro-the-shape-of-water-fairy-tale-sally-hawkins-richard-jenkins-complete-interview-transcript-news/#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Giles was originally written with [[Ian McKellen]] in mind and Del Toro was inspired to do so by his performance as the real-life closeted gay filmmaker [[James Whale]] who directed ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', who found himself unemployable in his later years. When McKellen proved unavailable, Del Toro sent an e-mail to [[Richard Jenkins]], who accepted the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Shanley|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water|title='Shape of Water' Star Richard Jenkins on Getting Cast Via Email|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=February 22, 2018|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610181536/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water#|archive-date=June 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shannon]] was cast as Richard Strickland, the villain of the film. According to an interview with Vanity Fair, Shannon and Del Toro had early conversations about the notion that Strickland would have been the hero of the film if it had been made in the 1950s, something that fascinated the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Julie|last=Miller|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water|title=For Michael Shannon, the Clothes Made the Man in The Shape of Water|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=December 5, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610181536/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water#|archive-date=June 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Octavia Spencer]], who played the role of Elisa's co-worker, friend and interpreter Zelda found it funny that the people Del Toro used to speak for the mute main character were people who represent very disenfranchised groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Beachum|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/octavia-spencer-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins-complete-interview-transcript-video-news/|title=Octavia Spencer ('The Shape of Water'): 'Otherworldly and beautiful' themes are 'very relevant for today' [Complete Interview Transcript]|publisher=GoldDerby|date=December 28, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102032/https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/octavia-spencer-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins-complete-interview-transcript-video-news/#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visuals===

According to an interview with ''[[The Wrap]]'', Guillermo Del Toro was torn between making the film in color or in black and white, and was at one point leaning toward the latter. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] offered Del Toro either a $20 million budget to make the film in color or a $17 million budget to shoot it in black and white. "That was honestly a battle I was expecting to lose," Del Toro said to ''The Wrap''. "I was of two minds. On one hand I thought black and white would look luscious, but on the other hand I thought it would look postmodern, like I was being reflective rather than immersed. It's good, because it got me three million more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Pond |url=https://www.thewrap.com/how-guillermo-del-toro-made-five-movies-in-one-with-the-shape-of-water/ |title='Guillermo del Toro on How 'The Shape of Water' Was Almost Shot in Black and White |publisher=The Wrap |date=January 23, 2018 |access-date=July 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102012/https://www.thewrap.com/how-guillermo-del-toro-made-five-movies-in-one-with-the-shape-of-water/# |archive-date=July 10, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and calling it "a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel" and, referring to Hawkins's role in ''[[Maudie (film)|Maudie]]'', described people with disabilities as "defective creatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/12/review-sally-hawkins-sinks-in-guillermo-del-toros-the-shape-of-water/|title=One Star: ''The Shape of Water'' Is a Loopy, Lunkheaded Load of Drivel|publisher=[[New York Observer]]|first=Rex|last=Reed|authorlink=Rex Reed|date=December 19, 2017|access-date=January 7, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171220220654/http://observer.com/2017/12/review-sally-hawkins-sinks-in-guillermo-del-toros-the-shape-of-water/#|archive-date=December 20, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed's review was criticized for referring to Sally Hawkins' mute character as "mentally handicapped" and for erroneously crediting actor [[Benicio del Toro]] as the film's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/guillermo-del-toro-rex-reed-shape-of-water-review-benicio-1201909629/|title=Rex Reed's Negative 'The Shape of Water' Review Goes Viral After Crediting Benicio del Toro as Director|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=December 20, 2017|access-date=March 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306023706/https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/guillermo-del-toro-rex-reed-shape-of-water-review-benicio-1201909629/#|archive-date=March 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
{{see also|List of accolades received by The Shape of Water}}
''The Shape of Water'' received 13 nominations at the 90th [[Academy Awards]], the most of any film in the 2018 race. It won in four categories: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], Best Original Score, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

The film also spawned some debate about whether the fact that it was filmed in Canada, with a predominantly Canadian crew and many Canadian actors in the supporting roles, should have made it eligible to be nominated for the [[Canadian Screen Awards]]. Under [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]] rules, to qualify for CSA nominations under the rules for international coproductions at least 15 per cent of a film's funding must come from a Canadian film studio. Even the film's Canadian co-producer, [[J. Miles Dale]], stated that he supports the rules and does not believe the film should have been eligible.&lt;ref name="toocanadian"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/08/are-the-canadian-screen-awards-too-canadian.html "Are the Canadian Screen Awards too Canadian?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309140451/https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/08/are-the-canadian-screen-awards-too-canadian.html# |date=March 9, 2018 }}. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit alleging plagiarism===
In February 2018, the estate of [[Paul Zindel]] initiated a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against director Guillermo del Toro and associate producer Daniel Kraus, alleging that ''The Shape of Water'' "brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes" of Zindel's 1969 work ''[[Let Me Hear You Whisper (play)|Let Me Hear You Whisper]]'', which depicts a cleaning lady bonding with a dolphin and attempting to rescue it from a secret research laboratory's nefarious uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach|title='Shape Of Water' Creators Sued Over Plagiarism Claims As Oscars Approach|publisher=|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223144801/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach#|archive-date=February 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint spends more than a dozen pages detailing alleged "overwhelming similarities" between the works.&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Berman, [http://time.com/5170613/shape-of-water-plagiarism-controversy/ Everything to Know About the Shape of Water Plagiarism Controversy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305053610/http://time.com/5170613/shape-of-water-plagiarism-controversy/# |date=March 5, 2018 }}, ''Time'' (March 1, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro denied the claim of the Zindel estate, saying that "I have never read nor seen the play. I'd never heard of this play before making ''The Shape of Water,'' and none of my collaborators ever mentioned the play." Distributor [[Fox Searchlight]] also denied the claim and said that it would "vigorously defend" itself in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Colin Dwyer|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach|title='Shape of Water' Creators Sued Over Plagiarism Claims As Oscars Approach|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=February 23, 2018|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223144801/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach#|archive-date=February 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit and stated that del Toro and Fox Searchlight were entitled to recover their legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|title=Judge Dismisses 'Shape Of Water' Lawsuit Waged During Final Oscar Voting Against Guillermo Del Toro's Best Picture Winner|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/shape-of-water-lawsuit-dismissed-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-best-picture-copyright-1202432680/|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=July 24, 2018|access-date=July 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724215810/https://deadline.com/2018/07/shape-of-water-lawsuit-dismissed-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-best-picture-copyright-1202432680/#|archive-date=July 24, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shape of Water was also accused by a French director of [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/10/director-oscar-favourite-shape-water-accused-copying-scenes/ copying scenes] from the romantic comedy Amelie and the cult classic Delicatessen&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/10/director-oscar-favourite-shape-water-accused-copying-scenes/&lt;/ref&gt;.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s black comedy Delicatessen was released in 1991 and quickly became a cult classic, but it was his whimsical take on life and love in the picturesque Paris district of Montmartre, Amelie, that gave him his first global hit.

He claims fellow director Guillermo del Toro was clearly plagiarising one of his scenes in The Shape of Water when he has the characters played by British actor Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins perform a two-step dance while sitting on a sofa watching an old Hollywood movie.

There are some very strong similarities in the saturation of the colours, overall art direction and the use of anthropomorphic objects. The music is reminiscent of Yann Tiersen's soundtrack for Amelie.

"When [Guillermo del Toro] steals the scene of the couple sitting on the edge of the bed dancing with their feet, with the musical on telly in the background, it is so cut and pasted from Delicatessen that there’s a moment when I say to myself that he lacks self-respect," said Mr Jeunet.
“It is obvious that he had ‘Delicatessen’ in mind,” he said.

“I’m not going to sue him for plagiarism, that’s not my style. But Guillermo has enough talent not to be doing things like that,” he told Ouest-France newspaper&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ouest-france.fr/culture/la-forme-de-l-eau-jean-pierre-jeunet-accuse-guillermo-del-toro-de-copier-coller-delicatessen-5548366&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mr Jeunet said he emailed the Mexican director to ask him why he was stealing his ideas.
“He replied.. that he did not steal from others, that it was [American director] Terry Gilliam who influenced all of us,” he said

'''''The Sorrows of an American''''' is [[Siri Hustvedt]]'s fourth novel. It was first published in 2008 and is about a [[Norwegian American]] family and their troubles. The novel is partly [[autobiography|autobiographical]] in that Hustvedt herself is of Norwegian descent and in that passages from her own deceased father's journal about the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in America and the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of war]] during World War II are scattered through the book.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the "Acknowledgments" at the end of the novel.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sorrows of an American'' operates on several time levels and depicts the difficult times of four generations of the fictional Davidsen family. At the core of the novel lies a long-kept family secret which the [[First-person narrative|first person narrator]], a middle-aged [[psychiatrist]] called Erik Davidsen who lives and works in New York, sets out to unearth together with his sister. However, the novel abounds in [[subplot]]s which focus on the present rather than the past.

==Plot summary==

On the death of their father Lars, a retired Professor of History, Erik Davidsen and his sister Inga, a philosopher, clean out his home office in rural [[Minnesota]] and, while going through his copious papers, find a cryptic note written and signed by someone they do not know called Lisa which suggests to them that as a boy back in the 1930s their father was involved in some illicit act and that he has kept his promise never to tell anyone about it. The siblings decide to investigate the matter further, if only half-heartedly at first. For the time being, Erik Davidsen is preoccupied reading his father's journals, which the latter completed only shortly before his demise. For Erik, all this will mean that in the months to come he will not only be haunted by the ghosts of the present but also of the past.

It has been pointed out that none of the characters in ''The Sorrows of an American'' leads a carefree, untroubled existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Salter Reynolds]]: [http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/books/la-bk-reynolds6apr06,1,67116.story "''The Sorrows of an American'' by Siri Hustvedt"], ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' (April 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Kaminski]]: [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/10/DD4GVR0RO.DTL&amp;type=books "Review: Hustvedt's ''Sorrows''"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' (April 10, 2008) E-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator himself suffers from a slight form of depression triggered by his recent divorce, childless state, and subsequent feeling of loneliness but still finds satisfaction in attempting to cure his patients of the complaints he occasionally recognizes in himself. His sister Inga has had [[absence seizure]]s from childhood and [[migraine]]s all her adult life. What is more, when the novel opens she is being harassed by a female journalist who states her intention to publicize hitherto unknown facts about Inga's deceased husband, a cult author and filmmaker, and who demands that she be co-operative without telling her what exactly she is aiming at or planning to do. Inga's 18-year-old daughter Sonia suffers from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], having witnessed, from the windows of her [[Manhattan]] school, the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the collapse of the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Lars Davidsen, the long-term patriarch of the family, was a [[Fugue state|fugueur]].

But also the characters outside the family show neurological symptoms. Whereas the journalist who is harassing Inga only bears an age-old personal grudge against her (of which the latter is unaware) and is out for straightforward revenge, Erik's friend and colleague Bernard Burton, apart from [[hyperhidrosis|sweating excessively]], has not been able to cope with the fact that Inga is not in love with him and, without her realizing it, has kept a watchful eye on her over the years in a way which might be construed as stalking. Edie Bly, a former actress who is now impoverished, is a recovering substance abuser who has an illegitimate son by Inga's deceased husband and appears to be in an unstable psychological condition. Finally, the real stalker in the novel, a photographer and [[installation art]]ist called Jeffrey Lane, displays various signs of [[compulsive behavior|compulsive behaviour]], for example the urge to document virtually everything in his life by taking photos. He crosses the psychiatrist's path while pursuing his former girlfriend, a [[Jamaica]]n-born beauty who has recently rented, and moved into, the downstairs apartment of Erik's now too large [[Brooklyn]] [[brownstone]].

Erik Davidsen is immediately drawn towards Miranda, the young woman from Jamaica, and Eglantine, her pre-school daughter by Jeffrey Lane. He soon falls head over heels in love with the dark-skinned woman while at the same time watching what he perceives to be the slow but steady deterioration of his own self. Gently rejected by Miranda, he has enough willpower left to go on a date with a sexy colleague and, for purely physical reasons, starts an affair with her. As the story progresses, however, he is more and more pulled into the quagmire of events surrounding Miranda, Inga, and himself. At one point he catches a burglar in his empty house at night, is surprised to see it is Lane, confused when the escaping Lane takes a photo of him wearing nothing much but wielding a hammer, and shocked when, months later, he recognizes the image at one of Lane's exhibitions with a caption saying, ''Head Doctor Goes Insane''.

Most of the mysteries are cleared up in the end. Erik and Inga succeed in tracking down the mysterious &amp;mdash; and now dying &amp;mdash; Lisa, and it turns out that all those years ago a young Lars Davidsen helped her bury her illegitimate, stillborn child, in all secrecy, somewhere on his family's farm. The reputation of Inga's deceased husband is not smeared either when the existence of a batch of letters to Edie Bly can be established without doubt but when it turns out at the same time that they have no sensational value because they belong to the realm of fiction&amp;mdash;they are addressed to the character Bly played in one of the author's films rather than Bly the actress and mother of his child. Bernard Burton proves instrumental in procuring the letters without succumbing to the temptation to actually read them, in a chivalric act in which he dresses up as a frightful [[homelessness|bag lady]] in order not to reveal his identity, a scene which also provides some comic relief. The conclusion of the novel is a four-page [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]]-like recapitulation of the story's images racing through Erik's mind, and the assurance that the characters' fragmented lives will remain that way.

==Reviews==

''The Sorrows of an American'' was published to almost unanimously positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Hustvedt claims that she does not read reviews or profiles: "It's not the mean things, it's the things which wind up casually wrong." Cf. [[John Freeman (journalist)|John Freeman]]: [http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_9044851 "Life in the Public Eye"], ''[[The Denver Post]]'' (April 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]] calls it "a radically [[Postmodern literature|postmodern novel]] that wears its po-mo credentials with unusual grace; even at its strangest moments, it never radiates the chilly [[distancing effect|alienation]] that marks, say, the work of Hustvedt's husband, [[Paul Auster]]." &lt;ref&gt;Ron Charles: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/03/AR2008040303143.html "Whose Life Is It Anyway? A Family Revelation Sparks a Psychiatrist's Identity Crisis"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (April 6, 2008) BW07.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Sylvia Brownrigg]], "the erudite Hustvedt" explores "larger questions of art and [[insanity|madness]], mind and spirit, and the [[Social constructionism|construction of the self]]" &lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Brownrigg: [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Brownrigg-t.html?8bu&amp;emc=bua2l "What Used to Be"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (April 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; through the dialogues of her intellectually minded characters and the [[Internal monologue|interior monologues]] of her narrator. True, little use is made of the [[vernacular]], which prompts [[Haley Edwards]] to state that "Hustvedt writes very well, but her prose has all the flair of your Aunt Olga's dinner rolls. Sometimes Erik says things about the [[human condition]] that are wonderfully perceptive and incredibly poignant, but he seems to say them as if he's observing the human condition, rather than experiencing it himself." &lt;ref&gt;Haley Edwards: [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2004385840_sorrows04.html "Among the "Sorrows" and Secrets, Much Insight But Little Heartfelt Emotion"], ''[[The Seattle Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

What some critics found disappointing is that "the secrets Inga and Erik pursue don't yield the drama or meaning they have hoped for, suffusing the scenes of revelation with an air of anticlimax. This may be intentional&amp;mdash;Hustvedt may be warning us of the folly of hoping for neat resolutions in our explorations of past pains&amp;mdash;but it means the narrative slackens somewhat toward the end." &lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Brownrigg: "What Used to Be". Cf. similar objections raised in 2007 in connexion with [[Graham Swift]]'s novel, ''[[Tomorrow (novel)|Tomorrow]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three-act structure.svg|thumb|500px|A visual representation of the three-act structure]]

The '''three-act structure''' is a model used in [[narrative]] fiction that divides a story into three parts ([[act (drama)|acts]]), often called the Setup, the Confrontation and the Resolution.

== Structure ==
'''The first act''' is usually used for [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], to establish the main characters, their relationships and the world they live in. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident occurs, known as the ''[[inciting incident]]'', or ''catalyst'', that confronts the main character (the [[protagonist]]), and whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first plot point, which (a) signals the end of the first act, (b) ensures life will never be the same again for the protagonist and (c) raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the film. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, (Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?).&lt;ref name="trottier"&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pp. 5–7. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The second act''', also referred to as "rising action", typically depicts the protagonist's attempt to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to find themselves in ever worsening situations. Part of the reason protagonists seem unable to resolve their problems is because they do not yet have the skills to deal with the forces of [[Antagonist|antagonism]] that confront them. They must not only learn new skills but arrive at a higher sense of awareness of who they are and what they are capable of, in order to deal with their predicament, which in turn changes who they are. This is referred to as ''character development'' or a ''[[character arc]]''. This cannot be achieved alone and they are usually aided and abetted by mentors and co-protagonists.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

'''The third act''' features the resolution of the story and its subplots. The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] is the [[Scene (drama)|scene]] or sequence in which the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question answered, leaving the protagonist and other characters with a new sense of who they really are.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

'''Transparency of media ownership''' refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about [[mass media|media]] ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies.
[[File:Axel Springer Gebäude und Logo.JPG|thumb|Axel Springer logo]]
Transparency of media ownership is an essential component of any democratic media system. Experts, European organisations and NGOs agree that transparency of media ownership is crucial for [[media pluralism]] and democracy&lt;ref name="blogs.lse.ac.uk"&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2013/12/11/the-transparency-of-media-ownership/ Mark Thompson, Media Plurality Series: The Transparency of Media Ownership, 11 December 2013. Retrieved 31 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; as, for instance, it provides the knowledge to take steps to address [[Concentration of media ownership|media concentration]] and [[conflict of interest]]s. Moreover, public knowledge of media owners' identities can prevent abuses of media power, such as corruption in the media system, opaque [[media privatisation,]] undue influences over the media, etc., and makes possible that such abuses are recognised, assessed, publicised, debated and prevented.&lt;ref name="access-info.org"&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/TMO_Recommendations_05_November_2013.pdf Access-Info Europe, Ten recommendations on transparency of media ownership, 4 November 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency also ensures that ordinary citizens can be informed about the identity, interests and influences behind contents and news they consume, and that media market can function on a fair basis, especially, for instance, for new entrants in the market.&lt;ref name="blogs.lse.ac.uk"/&gt; Moreover, transparency of media ownership facilitates the public knowledge on the media environment; makes possible a critical assessment of the contents produced and strengthens debate on the way the media system operates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/TMO_Recommendations_05_November_2013.pdf Access-Info Europe, Ten recommendations on transparency of media ownership. 4 November 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of transparency of media ownership for any democratic and pluralist society has been broadly recognised by the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission's High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism]]&lt;ref name="blogs.lse.ac.uk"/&gt; and the [[Council of Europe]]. In the last years, there has been an unprecedented debate at the global level around company ownership transparency which has been addressed, for example, by the [[Open Government Partnership]] and by the [[Group of Eight|G8]] governments in a 2014 statement setting the principles on media ownership transparency.&lt;ref name="moorestephens.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.moorestephens.co.uk/MediaLibsAndFiles/media/MooreStephensUK/Documents/Tax-Making-beneficial-ownership-transparent.pdf Moore Stephens, Making Beneficial ownership transparent: factsheet, June 2016. Retrieved 29 August, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, following the so-called "[[Panama Papers]]" scandal, the lack of records held by the Panama-based legal firm Mossack Fonseca, transparency of company ownership gained momentum in the public debate.&lt;ref name="transparencyinternational.eu"&gt;[http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/2016/06/after-the-panama-papers-its-time-for-beneficial-ownership-transparency/ Transparency International, 28 June 2016, After the Panama Papers it's time for beneficial ownership transparency (Laure Brillaud), 28 June 2016. Retrieved 29 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that the public knows who effectively owns and influences the media, national legal frameworks should ensure the disclosure of at least the following essential basic information: name and contact details of the media outlets; constitutional documents; size of shareholdings over a given threshold; name and contact details of direct owners with a given percentage of shareholding; identity of the persons with indirect control or have a significant interest in a given media company; citizenship/residence status of individuals with at least a certain shareholding percentage; country of domicile of company with at least a given shareholding percentage. Importantly, to understand who really owns and controls a specific media outlet it is necessary to check who is beyond the official shareholdings and scrutinise indirect, controlling and beneficial ownership which refers on shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/TMO_Recommendations_05_November_2013.pdf Access-Info Europe, 4 November 2013, Ten recommendations on transparency of media ownership, 4 November 2013.

To be meaningful and easily accessible by the citizens and national media authorities, this information should be updated, searchable, free and reusable.&lt;ref name="access-info.org"/&gt;

Transparency of media ownership remains difficult to fulfill in most of European countries.&lt;ref name=SLO&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 2016 |title= Media ownership and concentration in Europe: a comparative analysis |url= http://www.akos-rs.si/files/Elektronski_mediji/Medijska_ucilnica/Raziskave_in_analize/WH-20150126-ownership-concentration-report-final.pdf |journal= SPRL Wagner-Hatfield |access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some EU member States have legislation ensuring transparency of media ownership in compliance to the best international standards, such legislation is still lacking in many member States and in some cases national legislation allows for hidden or indirect media ownership. A recent 2015 resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], notes with concern that media outlets are frequently owned and controlled in an opaque-manner. This is due either to the lack of national transparency provisions or to non-transparent indirect or hidden ownership schemes, often linked to political, economic or religious interests and affiliations.&lt;ref name=SLO/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] students demonstrate in favour of transparency in school administration, 2010]]

Transparency of media ownership corroborates some constitutional guarantees and individual rights which are strictly related to the inclusiveness and openness of the democratic process, in particular [[media pluralism]] and [[Freedom of Expression]]. Even if media ownership transparency is not directly addressed in key international human rights charters, transparency is a basic precondition for the effective exercise of freedom of expression and the right to obtain information enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)]], and Article 11.1 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.]] Indeed, access to information is crucial for the good functioning of democratic societies as it enables citizens to make informed decisions and choices on social, political, economic issues affecting personal and collective life. Specifically, transparency of media ownership contributes to make the public to establish who provides the information on which to shape personal and collective choices as, for instance, knowledge of the identity and interests of the messenger can help individuals in appraising the information spread through the media.

Guidelines and milestones on what media ownership transparency might entails can be found in non-binding [[Council of Europe]] documents, in particular on the ''Committee of Ministers' Recommendation R(94) 13 on Measures to Promote Media Transparency and Recommendation (2007)2'' on ''Media Pluralism and Diversity of Media Content''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&amp;Ref=CM/Rec(2007)2&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&amp;BackColorIntranet=FDC864&amp;BackColorLogged=FDC864&amp;direct=true Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)2 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on media pluralism and diversity of media content, adopted 31 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this recommendations, to understand who and how effectively owns or control the media the public should be in the condition of accessing the following information:
* data concerning the persons or bodies participating in the structure of the media; the nature and share of such participation and, where possible, the ultimate beneficiaries of such participation;
* information on the nature and extent of the interests held by persons and bodies participating in a media structure in other media and in other economic sectors;
* information on the persons and bodies in the position to exercise a meaningful influence on the editorial policy of a given media;
* information regarding the support measures benefiting media organisations.
Another non-binding document on media ownership transparency is a 2008 Resolution from the [[European Parliament]] which encourages the "disclosure of ownership of all media outlets to help achieve greater transparency regarding the aims and background of the broadcasters and publishers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0459+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN European Parliament resolution of 25 September 2008 on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union (2007/2253(INI), adopted on 25 September 2008. Retrieved 2 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to experts and organisation advocating for media ownership transparency, such as [[Access-Info Europe]], a human rights NGO dedicated to promoting the [[right to access to information]] in Europe, to understand who and how effectively owns or control the media, it is crucial that information provided to comprehend and assess media ownership structures are regularly updated, consistent and searchable.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, citizens should be able to get information on all types of media actors in a given countries, whether print, broadcast, or online, foreign or domestic.

In Europe, transparency of media ownership is infrequently addressed directly in domestic constitutions, and even when this happens, as in the case of Italy, Romania or Turkey, constitutional provisions do not impose a specific positive obligation on the state to ensure that citizens have access to information on media ownership. The lack of ''ad hoc'' legal provisions on media ownership transparency is partially explained with the fact that often the existing laws have been established with the aim of fulfilling other regulatory objectives, such as providing information to [[media regulators]] or for company law purposes. In many European countries, [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information legislation]] provides the basis for requesting information from competent agencies and public bodies. As a consequence, often media ownership transparency aimed at fulfilling the objective of primarily informing the public on media ownership structure is therefore often a byproduct of other measures.

When assessing the state of media ownership transparency, five dimensions should be taken into account to establish who and how controls the media in a given country:

* Constitutional provisions relating to media ownership transparency;
* Media-related provisions regulating the disclosure of ownership information to public authorities;
* Media-related provisions regulating the disclosure of ownership information directly to the citizens;
* General non-media specific transparency requirements regulating disclosure rules for company ownership, such as conflict of interest rules;
* Other sources providing media ownership information.

Operationally many options are possible to guarantee the disclosure of information on media ownership. A simple approach is to call upon media outlets to publish relevant ownership information on an accessible website displayed or linked in the organisation's publications, transmissions or website. Alternatively, or in addition, an accessible, easy-to-navigate and searchable online database on transparency of media ownership can be developed by an independent body. In both cases, to be effective and functional, databases should be regularly updated. Also, to make possible comparisons across countries, a systematic approach to collect, record and share information should be set up, connections and interoperability among national databases should be pursued and shared standards for exchanging data on transparency of media ownership should be developed.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership, media pluralism and media concentration==
[[File:International_newspaper,_Rome_May_2005.jpg|thumb|International newspapers]]
Transparency of media ownership is deeply interrelated with the concepts of [[media pluralism]] and [[Concentration of media ownership|media concentration]] and is an essential component of government obligations to guarantee a diverse and plural media environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership. Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, media ownership transparency is crucial for promoting [[media pluralism]], a principle set forth in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) which entails a positive obligation for the state to "put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework to guarantee effective pluralism".&lt;ref&gt;[See the sentence of the European Court of Human Rights Application no. 38433/09, Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. And Di Stefano v. Italy, judgement 7 June 2012, para. 134. Available at http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=001-111399&amp;filename=001-111399.pdf Retrieved 2 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"&gt;[https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/Transparency_Media_Ownership_Europe_20121217_0.pdf Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership in Europe. A report for the High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism, 2014. Retrieved 2 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the way for guaranteeing media pluralism is to ensure a wide diversity of media ownership, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for pluralism. Media ownership is also important in terms of pluralism as it might affects media outputs and contents while transparency empowers readers to detect and appraise owners influences on the media and its contents. The [[European Commission]]'s study on Indicators for Media Pluralism (2009) recognises transparency of media ownership and/or control as a key indicators of media pluralism. Also, media ownership transparency is essential for preventing concentration of media power which can unduly influence public opinion and the political debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/media_taskforce/doc/pluralism/pfr_report.pdf Independent Study on Indicators for Media Pluralism in the Member States – Towards a Risk-Based Approach. Prepared for the European Commission Directorate-General Information Society and Media, April 2009. Retrieved 2 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Precisely, transparency of media ownership is a precondition for assessing levels of concentration or other dimensions of diversity in a given media system.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"/&gt; Indeed, if readers don't know who the real owners of media companies are, it is difficult to envisage measures to address [[Concentration of media ownership|media concentrations]] as well as [[conflict of interest]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership and beneficial ownership==

The need to collect and make available to the public crucial information on media ownership, in particular [[beneficial ownership]] which in this context refers on shares of a media company held on behalf of another person, is frequently debated in Europe, but there are no agreed standards or binding commitments. In June 2013, governments of the [[Group of Eight|G8]] Group adopted the "Lough Erne Declaration" which included a commitment to make transparent the [[beneficial ownership]] of companies recognising the need to make this information available to relevant authorities to prevent misuse of companies. The declaration was followed by a November 2014 statement by [[G20]] leaders setting the principles on media ownership transparency. In April 2016, following the lack of records held by the Panama-based legal firm [[Mossack Fonseca]] (the "[[Panama Papers]]"), the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain reached an agreement for easing the automatic exchange of information of [[beneficial ownership]] of companies and trusts. The five countries concerned also urged the remaining G20 countries calling for progress towards a global system for exchanging such information, to be developed, for instance, by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref name="moorestephens.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="transparencyinternational.eu"/&gt; Even if these commitments are not specifically related to the media sector, they are important steps towards the disclosure of beneficial owners of companies, including the media ones. At the [[European Union]] level, the [[European Commission]] is working to improve the beneficial ownership provisions included in the [[4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive]], adopted in 2015 and currently in the process of being transposed by [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]] into national law.&lt;ref name="transparencyinternational.eu"/&gt;

==Sources of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Europe==

===Transparency of media ownership and domestic constitutions===

There is a group of three constitutional provisions that are relevant when it comes to transparency of media ownership:
* provisions which directly address media ownership transparency;
* provisions which are related to [[freedom of speech]], and
* provisions concerning [[access to public information]]. 
Constitutional provisions recognising freedom of speech and access to information are widely included in national constitutions across Europe, and, even if they are general in nature and scope, they potentially lay the ground for media ownership transparency legislation. For instance, this is the case of [[Norway]] that shaped the [[Norwegian Media Ownership Act]] on the basis of the obligations enshrined in the constitution. In addition, constitutional provisions, which vary from country to country, do not ensure transparency of media ownership as this depends on how broadly they are construed and then implemented. This is particular relevant when the constitution does not impose a positive obligation upon the state, but simply provides the option of disclosing media ownership transparency data. Constitutions, in some cases, are more focused on disclosure of information to the government or other public body than disclosure directly to the citizens. In this case, the [[right to access information]] becomes highly relevant as it is the ground for accessing media ownership data.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Media-related provisions regulating the disclosure of media ownership information to public authorities===

There is a noticeable variation across Europe concerning the extent and the type of the media sectors involved (i.e. the broadcasting sector; print and online sectors) in the provisions regulating media ownership disclosure to public bodies, which in many cases is a dedicated media authority. A crucial issue for media ownership transparency is whether and how the information provided to public authorities is comprehensive, meaningful, updated and easily accessible to the wider public.

Given the variability of such provisions in Europe, and given the fact that in many countries the required data disclosure is not conceived for directly addressing media transparency, the information provided are in many cases inadequate and does not serve the objective of effectively assessing whether domestic ownership limits or prohibitions are being respected. More specifically, there are at least five reasons explaining why effective media ownership transparency is limited despite the existence of specific legislation.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

First, European countries legislation is not homogeneous in requiring disclosure from all three media sectors (i.e. broadcasting; print and online). This, also, creates a patchwork of databases containing different type of information, making data comparison complicated.

Second, in Europe disclosure is often made to public media authorities, but in some cases disclosure is required to a specific ministry (such as the Ministry of Culture in [[Bulgaria]], or the Ministry of Justice in [[Azerbaijan]]). This can be problematic because public bodies can have discretion in authorising media services, so any links between media authorities and executive branches should be carefully reviewed to ensure their independence from political power.

Third, disclosure legislation varies extensively across Europe also in terms of the type of information required to be released (e.g. details of shareholders and size of their holdings; interests of affiliated individuals; indirect interests; interests in other media companies; sources of revenues; etc.), including different thresholds and application to different media sectors.

Forth, even if media ownership transparency information released to public authorities can in principle be accessed also by the public through freedom of information legislation, in practice, however, in many cases freedom of information is not fully implemented or reliance on it may be perceived by citizens to be excessively complex and even confrontational.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

Checks on the data provided and on its regular updating and accuracy, as well as sanctions for failure in reporting or updating it, can help improve the quality of recorded data, which are crucial for assessing media ownership transparency. There is great variability on these sanctions across Europe, but what is common is that sanctions are rarely implemented for a series of reasons: lack of sufficient resources; lack of expertise in the authorities that should check; an unwillingness to check organisations that might have powerful political or commercial influences, etc.

Also in terms of public accessibility there are considerable variations across Europe: for instance, countries like [[Norway]] and Germany developed good practices in terms of online, updated searchable databases. In particular, in Germany the competent media authorities release annual lists with data on national media outlets, including the participating interests, and publish such information on the website of the KEK, the independent Commission on Concentration of the Media. The KEK also publishes reports that are distributed to media, politicians, universities, libraries, etc. In turn, the public use of available databases depends not only on their effective accessibility, but also on factors such as public awareness and confidence in starting and handling requests.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Media-related provisions regulating the disclosure of ownership information directly to the citizens===

Disclosure of media ownership transparency information directly to the public can be implemented through public registers or by posting data on a media organisation's website. In Europe, disclosure directly to the citizens is often determined not for the sake of controlling or avoiding media concentration, but rather for [[consumer protection]] purposes, resulting in the disclosure of information that are badly suited for revealing the true state of media ownership. In addition, as in the case of disclosure to public authorities, some problems impede the full implementation of the existing rules, in particular, lack of enforcement, inadequate oversight and minimal requirements.

Overall, the different national regimes in place in Europe, do not properly perform the function of making clear to the citizens relevant data for meeting citizens' interests in media ownership transparency.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Non-media specific transparency requirements===

Non media-related specific transparency rules can be found in other legislative acts, such as domestic and [[European Union competition law|EU competition rules]], that can indirectly strengthen media ownership transparency, or company laws that require the disclosure of [[Shareholder|shareholdings]] interests in private companies. However, while these rules can provide useful insights into company ownership, usually they do not provide real information on who actually owns and controls a media company, in particular [[beneficial ownership]]). This is because the primary objective of rules that are not media-specific is not media ownership transparency.

Generally, these kind of provisions require to disclose data on the name and nationality of the owner's; address; shareholdings; founding capital, etc., but the exact rules, percentages and thresholds vary from country to country. Failure to provide the requested information generally leads to fines and sanctions, and invalidation of the company registration.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

Disclosure rules vary remarkably from country to country, and within each country for different types of companies. Consequently, the available data is both fragmented and incoherent, often technical in nature, thus making difficult for the public to understand and for experts to compare data across countries.

===Other sources of information on media ownership transparency===

Several organisations provide valuable information on media ownership to the public. For example, in Italy, the Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM) publishes annual reports, which are presented to the parliament, explaining market shares and the main stakeholders in the media market. In the [[Netherlands]], the Commissariat for the Media (CvdM) publishes online an annual report with information on trends and developments in the [[media market]], including data on ownership, market shares, [[media pluralism.]]

At the [[European Union]] level, the [[MAVISE|MAVISE database]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mavise.obs.coe.int MAVISE Database]&lt;/ref&gt; powered by the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]] provides information on television companies operating in Europe with the aim of enhancing transparency in the television sector.

In many European countries, academics, NGOs and civil society carry out research and mapping of media ownership, and publish ''ad hoc'' publications on the topic. For instance, in Spain the platform ''Portal de la Comunicación''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalcomunicacion.com/ Portal de la Comunicación] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; run by the [[University of Barcelona]] effectively monitors the media providing data and statistics to the public. Similarly, in [[Romania]] the [[Mediaindex]], managed by the [[Centre for Independent Journalism]], provides useful information on media ownership.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

There are also cases of media company voluntarily providing information on their financial sources and ownership structure directly to the public through their websites. This is the case, for instance, of [[Il Fatto Quotidiano]] newspaper in Italy, [[the Guardian]] in the UK, and DV in [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

Finally, professional and trade organisations, such as the [[Norwegian Press Organisations]] or the [[Swiss Press Council]], establish self-regulation provisions, [[Code of ethics in media|codes of ethics]] and guidelines calling for ownership transparency. However, they usually do not provide sufficient stimulus to reveal information that can be politically and commercially sensitive.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

Overall, the information provided through these kind of sources and organisations, is not enough systematic or detailed for providing an adequate account of media ownership transparency.&lt;ref name="research.ed.ac.uk"/&gt;

==The European Union and media ownership transparency==

{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}

At the EU level, the legislative competence concerning media ownership transparency is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt AJ (2015). Media plurality: what can the European Union do?. In Barnett S, Townend J (Eds.) Media Power and Plurality: from Hyperlocal to High-level Policy, London: Palgrave. http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137522832.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmpf.eui.eu/Documents/CMPFPolicyReport2013.pdf Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom, European Union Competencies in Respect of Media Pluralism and Media Freedom, EUI RSCAS PP, 2013/01. Retrieved 2 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[European Commission]] has promoted a number of initiatives to improve citizens' awareness of media pluralism, such as the [[Media Pluralism Monitor]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://monitor.cmpf.eui.eu/ Media Pluralism monitor: monitoring risks in EU Member States. Retrieved 2 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; a monitoring tool for assessing risks and threats for [[media pluralism]] in the EU member states on the basis of a set of legal, economic and socio-cultural indicators. According to the [[Media Pluralism Monitor]] the lack of media ownership transparency is identified as a risk for media plurality. The European Commission's High Level Group on media freedom and pluralism identified “the lack of media ownership transparency” as a key recommendation in its 2013 report&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/media_taskforce/doc/pluralism/hlg/hlg_final_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Then a 2014 European Council meeting stated "transparency of media ownership and of funding sources (be) essential with a view to guaranteeing media freedom and pluralism" in guidelines issued in a 2014 Foreign Affairs Council meeting. Under the section on actions, the guidelines state that “d) Support actions by third countries to improve transparency of media ownership, the adoption of measures against media concentration and fair and transparent licencing allocation as the associated risks have grown more acute in the digital age”&lt;ref&gt;http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9647-2014-INIT/en/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Tsat''', also known as '''Utsat''', '''Utset''', '''Hainan Cham''', or '''Huíhuī''' ({{zh|s=回辉语|t=回輝語|p=Huíhuīyǔ}}), is a language spoken by 4,500 [[Utsul]] people in Yanglan ({{zh|羊栏}}) and Huixin ({{zh|回新}}) villages near [[Sanya]], [[Hainan]], [[China]]. Tsat is a member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] group within the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family, and is one of the [[Chamic languages]] originating on the coast of present-day [[Vietnam]].

Unusually for an Austronesian language, Tsat has developed into a solidly [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language, probably as a result of areal linguistic effects and contact with the diverse tonal languages spoken on Hainan including [[varieties of Chinese]] such as [[Hainanese]] and [[Standard Chinese]], [[Tai–Kadai languages]] such as the [[Hlai languages]], and [[Hmong–Mien languages]] such as [[Kim Mun language|Kim Mun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBGYb84A7SAC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=tsat+li#v=onepage&amp;q=tsat%20li&amp;f=false|title=From ancient Cham to modern dialects: two thousand years of language contact and change : with an appendix of Chamic reconstructions and loanwords|author=Graham Thurgood|year=1999|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|edition=|location=|page=239|isbn=0-8248-2131-9|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Valencian [[Statute of Autonomy]], the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua|Valencian Academy of the Language]] (''Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL'') has been established as its [[List of language regulators|regulator]]. The AVL, in agreement with the criteria of the scientific community, considers ''Valencian'' and ''Catalan'' to be simply [[names of the Catalan language|two names for the same language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avl.gva.es/img/EdicionsPublicacions/AcordsGenerals/NOMENTITAT.pdf ''"Dictamen de l'Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua sobre els principis i criteris per a la defensa de la denominació i l'entitat del valencià"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217124928/http://www.avl.gva.es/img/EdicionsPublicacions/AcordsGenerals/NOMENTITAT.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}.

Some of the most important works of [[Catalan literature|Valencian literature]] experienced a golden age during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[the Renaissance]]. Important works include [[Joanot Martorell]]'s [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', and [[Ausiàs March]]'s poetry. The first book produced with [[movable type]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was printed in the Valencian variety.&lt;ref&gt;''Trobes en llaors de la Verge Maria'' ("Poems of praise of the Virgin Mary") 1474.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|2009|pp=6–7}} The earliest recorded [[chess]] game with modern rules for moves of the [[queen (chess)|queen]] and [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] was in the Valencian poem ''[[Scachs d'amor]]'' (1475).

==Official status==
The official status of Valencian is regulated by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]] and the Valencian [[Statute of Autonomy]], together with the [[:ca:Llei d'Ús i Ensenyament del Valencià|Law of Use and Education of Valencian]].

Article 6 of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy sets the legal status of Valencian, providing that:&lt;ref name="estatuto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=79&amp;tipo=2&amp;ini=1&amp;fin=7&amp;ini_sub=1&amp;fin_sub=1|title=Título I. La Comunitat Valenciana - Estatuto Autonomía|website=Congreso.es|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*''The official language of the Valencian Community is Valencian.''&lt;ref&gt;"La lengua propia de la Comunitat Valenciana es el valenciano."&lt;/ref&gt;
:*''Valencian is official within the Valencian Community, along with Spanish, which is the official language nationwide. Everyone shall have the right to know it and use it, and receive education in Valencian.''
:*''No one can be discriminated against by reason of their language''.
:*''Special protection and respect shall be given to the recuperation of Valencian''.
:*''The Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua shall be the normative institution of the Valencian language''.

The [[:ca:Llei d'Ús i Ensenyament del Valencià|Law of Use and Education of Valencian]] develops this framework, providing for implementation of a [[bilingual education|bilingual educational system]], and regulating the use of Valencian in the public administration and judiciary system, where citizens can freely use it when acting before both.

Valencian is recognized under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] as "Valencian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/EvaluationReports/SpainECRML2_es.pdf|format=PDF|title=Aplicación de la Carta en España, Segundo ciclo de supervisión.

== Distribution and usage ==

=== Distribution ===
Valencian is not spoken all over the [[Valencian Community]]. Roughly a quarter of its territory, equivalent to 10% of the population (its inland part and areas in the extreme south as well), is traditionally [[Spanish language|Castilian-speaking]] only, whereas Valencian is spoken to varying degrees elsewhere.

Additionally, it is also spoken by a reduced number of people in [[Carche]], a rural area in the [[Region of Murcia]] adjoining the Valencian Community; nevertheless Valencian does not have any official recognition in this area. Although the Valencian language was an important part of the history of this zone, nowadays only about 600 people are able to speak Valencian in the area of Carche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=D. Martínez|title=Una isla valenciana en Murcia|url=http://www.abc.es/20111226/comunidad-valencia/abcp-isla-valenciana-murcia-20111226.html|website=ABC.es|accessdate=13 July 2017|location=Alicante|language=es|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge and usage ===
[[Image:Coneixement del valencià (domini promig)-Cens del 2001.png|thumb|right|200px|
Knowledge of Valencian according to the 2001 census. Note that the light green areas inland and in the southernmost part are not historically Valencian speaking ([[Media:Coneixement del valencià (domini promig)-Cens del 2001.png|large]]).]]

In 2010 the [[Generalitat Valenciana]] published a study, ''Knowledge and Social use of Valencian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gva.es/polin/docs/sies_docs/encuesta2010/index.html |title=''Servei d’Investigació i Estudis Sociolingüístics'' (Knowledge and Social use of Valencian language)|year=2010 |publisher=Servei d’Investigació i Estudis Sociolingüístics |accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included a survey sampling more than 6,600 people in the provinces of Castellón, Valencia, and Alicante.  The survey simply collected the answers of respondents and did not include any testing or verification.  The results were:

Valencian was the language "''always, generally, or most commonly used''":
* at home: 31.6%
* with friends: 28.0%
* in internal business relations: 24.7%

For ability:
* 48.5% answered they speak Valencian "perfectly" or "quite well" (54.3% in the Valencian-speaking areas and 10% in the Castilian-speaking areas)
* 26.2% answered they write Valencian "perfectly" or "quite well" (29.5% in the Valencian-speaking areas and 5.8% in the Castilian-speaking areas)

The survey shows that, although Valencian is still the common language in many areas in the Valencian Community, where slightly more than half of the Valencian population are able to speak it, most Valencians do not usually speak in Valencian in their social relations. The statistics hide the fact that in the areas where the language is still strong, most people use Valencian in preference to Castilian in all everyday situations.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Moreover, according to a survey in 2008, there is a downward trend in everyday Valencian users. The lowest numbers are in the major cities of [[Valencia]] and [[Alicante]], where the percentage of everyday speakers is in single figures. All in all, in the 1993–2006 period, the number of speakers fell by 10 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.levante-emv.com/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2008092600_19_499615__COMUNITAT-VALENCIANA-poblacion-habla-valenciano-bajado |title=El uso del valenciano cae siete puntos y ya sólo lo habla la mitad de la población |date=26 September 2008 |publisher=levante-emv.com |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors cited is the [[Immigration to Spain|increase in the numbers of immigrants from other countries]], who tend to favour using Spanish over local languages; accordingly, the number of residents who claim no understanding of Valencian sharply increased. One curiosity in the heartlands mentioned above, is that most of the children of immigrants go to public school and are therefore taught in Valencian and are far more comfortable speaking this with their friends. However, some children of Valencian speakers go to private schools run by the church where the curriculum is in Castilian and consequently this becomes their preferred language.

== Features of Valencian ==
Note that this is a list of features of the main forms of Valencian as a group of dialectal varieties that differ from those of other Catalan dialects, particularly from the Central variety of the language. For more general information on the features of Valencian, see [[Catalan language]]. Note also that there is a great deal of variety within the Valencian Community, and by no means do the features below apply to every local version.

* Valencian has a system of seven stressed vowels {{IPA|/i, u, e, o, ɛ, ɔ, a/}}.
** The vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (i.e. {{IPA|[i̽]}}) and {{IPA|/u/}} ({{IPA|[u̽]}}) are more open and centralised than in Castilian.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
** The vowel {{IPA|/e/}} is retracted and {{IPA|/o/}} is advanced both in stressed and unstressed syllables. {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} can be realised as mid vowels in some cases. This occurs more often with {{IPA|/o/}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
** The so-called "[[mid-open vowel|open vowels]]" (''vocals obertes''), {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, are generally as low as {{IPA|/a/}} in most Valencian dialects. The phonetic realisations of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} approaches {{IPAblink|æ}} (as in American English ''b'''a'''d'') and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is as open as {{IPAblink|ɒ}} (as in traditional [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] ''d'''o'''g''). This feature is also found in [[Balearic dialect|Balearic]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*** {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is slightly more open and centralised before liquids {{IPA|/l, r/}} and in monosyllabics.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*** {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is most often a back vowel. In some dialects (including Balearic) it can be unrounded like in American English.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
** The vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is slightly more fronted and closed than in Central Catalan (but less fronted and closed than in Majorcan). The precise phonetic realsation of the vowel {{IPA|/a/}} in Valencian is {{IPA|[ɐ ~ ä]}}, this vowel is subject to assimilation in many instances.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*** {{IPA|/a/}} can be retracted in contact with velar consonants, and fronted in contact with palatals.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*** Final unstressed {{IPA|/a/}} may be {{IPA|[ɐ ~ ä]}}, depending on the preceding sounds and/or dialect, e.g. ''taula'' {{IPA|[ˈtɑ̟wɫɐ ~ ˈtɑ̟wɫä]}} 'table'.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
** All vowels are phonetically nasalised between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal.
** Vowels can be lengthened in some contexts.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* While unstressed vowels are more stable than in Eastern Catalan dialects, there are many cases where they merge
** In some Valencian subvarieties, unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} are realised as {{IPA|[ʊ]}} before labial consonants (e.g. ''c'''o'''berts'' {{IPA|[kʊˈbæ̈ɾ(t)s]}} 'cutlery'), before a stressed syllable with a high vowel (e.g. ''s'''o'''spira'' {{IPA|[sʊsˈpiɾä]}} or {{IPA|[sʊsˈpiɾæ̈]}} 'he/she sighs'), in contact with palatal consonants (e.g. ''J'''o'''sep'' {{IPA|[dʒʊˈzæp]}} 'Joseph') and in monosyllabic clitics (e.g. ''m'''o'''n'' {{IPA|[mʊn]}} 'my') (note also in many colloquial speeches initial unstressed {{IPA|/o ~ ɔ/}} are often reduced to {{IPA|[ɑ̈w]}} or {{IPA|[äw]}} (also {{IPA|[ʊ]}} in fewer cases), such as '''''o'''lor'' {{IPA|[ɑ̈wˈɫo̞ɾ]}}) 'smell (n)'). Similarly, unstressed {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} are realised as {{IPA|[a]}} in contact with palatals, approximants or before certain sounds (e.g. '''''e'''ixam'' {{IPA|[ajˈʃam]}} 'swarm', ''cl'''e'''vill'' {{IPA|[kɫaˈʋiʎ]}} 'crevice', ''t'''e'''rròs'' {{IPA|[taˈrɒ̈s]}} 'clod',) and ({{IPA|[ɑ̈]}} or {{IPA|[ä]}})) in fewer cases near velars  (e.g. '''''e'''nclusa'' {{IPA|[ɑ̈ŋˈkɫuzɑ̈]}} or {{IPA|[ɑ̈ŋˈkɫuzæ̈]}} 'anvil').{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Likewise, unstressed  {{IPA|/e ~ ɛ/}} merges with {{IPA|/i/}} ({{IPA|[ɪ]}}) in contact with [[alveolo-palatal consonant|palatal consonants]] (e.g. ''g'''e'''noll'' {{IPA|[dʒɪˈno̞ʎ]}} 'knee'), and especially in lexical derivation with the suffix -''ix'''e'''ment'' (e.g. ''coneix'''e'''ment'' {{IPA|[konejʃɪˈment]}} 'knowledge'). In the Standard all these reductions are accepted ({{IPA|/e, ɛ/}} → {{IPA|[ɪ]}} is only accepted in words with the suffix ''-ixement'').{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
** Many Valencian subdialects, especially Southern Valencian, feature some sort of [[vowel harmony]] (''harmonia vocàlica''). This process is normally progressive (i.e. preceding vowels affect those pronounced afterwards) over the last unstressed vowel of a word; e.g. ''h'''o'''r'''a''''' {{IPA|/ˈɔɾa/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈɒɾɒ̈]}} 'hour'. However, there are cases where regressive metaphony occurs over pretonic vowels; e.g. ''t'''o'''v'''a'''ll'''o'''l'''a''''' {{IPA|/tovaˈʎɔla/}} &gt; {{IPA|[tɒ̈ʋɒ̈ˈʎɒɫɒ̈]}} 'towel', '''''a'''f'''e'''ct'''a''''' {{IPA|/aˈfɛkta/}} &gt; {{IPA|[æ̈ˈfæktæ̈]}} 'affects'. Vowel harmony differs greatly from dialect to dialect, while many subvarieties alternate {{IPA|[æ̈]}} and {{IPA|[ɒ̈]}}, according to the previous stressed vowel (e.g. ''terra'' {{IPA|[ˈtæræ̈]}} 'Earth, land' and ''dona'' {{IPA|[ˈdɒnɒ̈]}} 'woman'); others will favor just one realisation (either {{IPA|[æ̈]}} in all, or some, instances; or {{IPA|[ɒ̈]}}), thus, ''terra'' and ''dona'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈtæræ̈]}} and {{IPA|[ˈdɒnæ̈]}} (by those who favour {{IPA|[æ̈]}}) or {{IPA|[ˈtærɒ̈]}} and {{IPA|[ˈdɒnɒ̈]}} (by those who favour {{IPA|[ɒ̈]}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*** In a wider sense, vowel harmony can occur in further instances, due to different processes involving palatalisation, velarisarion and labialisation.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
**An epethentic vowel (usually pronounced {{IPA|[ɐ]}} or {{IPA|[ɜ]}}, but transcribed here as {{IPA|[ə]}}) may be inserted in some environments in the coda in some accents:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*** ''Eh tu! Vine ací'' {{IPA|[ˈeː ˈtuːə̯ {{!}} ˈvine äˈsiːə̯]}} "Hey you! Come here".

In the table below, the vowels are transcribed in a very narrow transcription. In the rest of the article, the symbols {{IPA|[a̠, ɑ̝, ɑ̝̈, ɒ̝̈, e̠, ɪ̞, i̞, ɒ̝, o̟, ʊ̞, u̞]}} are written {{IPA|[a, ɑ, ɑ̈, ɒ̈, e, ɪ, i, ɒ, o, ʊ, u]}} for the sake of simplicity.

* The [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stops {{IPA|/d, ɡ/}} are [[lenition|lenited]] to approximants {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ð̞|ð}}, {{IPA link|ɰ|ɣ}}]}} after a [[continuant]], i.e. a vowel or any type of consonant other than a [[stop consonant|stop]] or [[nasal consonant|nasal]] (exceptions include {{IPA|/d/}} after [[lateral consonant]]s). These sounds are realised as voiceless plosives in the coda in standard Valencian.
** {{IPA|/b/}} can also be lenited in betacist dialects.
** {{IPA|/d/}} is often elided between vowels following a stressed syllable (found notably in feminine participles); e.g. ''fideuà'' {{IPA|[fiðeˈwɑ̈ː]}} ( &lt; ''fideua'''d'''a'') ' [[fideuà]]'.
** Unlike other Catalan dialects, the clusters {{IPA|/bl/}} and {{IPA|/ɡl/}} never geminate or fortify in intervocalic position (e.g. ''po'''b'''le'' {{IPA|[ˈpɒbɫe]}} 'village').
*The velar stops {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are fronted to pre-velar position before [[front vowel]]s.
* Valencian has preserved in most of its subvarieties the mediaeval [[voiced alveolo-palatal affricate]] {{IPAslink|dʑ|dʒ}} (similar to the ''j'' in English "jeep") in contexts where other modern dialects have developed [[fricative consonant]]s {{IPA|/ʒ/}} (like the ''si'' in English "vision"); this is a feature shared with modern Ribagorçan. Nonetheless, the fricative {{IPAblink|ʑ|ʒ}} may appear as a voiced [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/ʃ/}} before vowels and voiced consonants; e.g. ''pe'''ix''' al forn'' {{IPA|[ˈpejʒ ɑ̈ɫ ˈfo̞ɾn]}} 'oven fish' (literally 'fish to the oven').
* {{IPA|/v/}} occurs in Balearic,{{sfn|Carbonell|Llisterri|1992|p=53}} [[Alguerese]], standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia.{{sfn|Veny|2007|p=51}} It has [[betacism|merged]] with {{IPA|/b/}} [[Catalan language#Consonants|elsewhere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Max W. |date=2005 |title= The Phonology Of Catalan |place=Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press|page=13|isbn=978-0-19-925814-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deaffrication of {{IPA|/dz/}} in verbs ending in -''itzar''; e.g. ''anali'''tz'''ar'' {{IPA|[ɑ̈nɑ̈ɫiˈzɑ̈ɾ]}} 'to analise'.
* Most subvarieties of Valencian preserve final stops in clusters (e.g. {{IPA|/mp/, /nt/, /nk/ ([ŋk])}}, and {{IPA|/lt/}}): ''ca'''mp''''' {{IPA|[kɑ̈mp]}} (a feature shared with modern [[Balearic dialect|Balearic]]). Dialectally, all final clusters can be simplified.
* {{IPA|/l/}} is normally [[velarization|velarised]] ({{IPA|[ɫ]}}), save for some dialects.
** {{IPA|/l/}} is generally [[elision|dropped]] in the word ''altre'' ({{IPA|[ˈɑ̈tɾe]}} 'other'), as well as in derived terms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Morphology ===
* The present first-person singular of verbs differs from Central Catalan; e.g. -''ar'' infinitive: ''parlar'' 'to speak' gives ''parle'' 'I speak' as opposed to ''parlo'', -''re'' infinitive: ''batre'' 'to beat' gives ''bat'' 'I beat' as opposed to ''bato'', -''er'' infinitive: ''témer'' 'to fear' give ''tem'' 'I fear' as opposed to ''temo'', and -''ir'' infinitive: ''sentir'' 'to feel' gives ''sent'' (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈseŋk]}} in colloquial Valencian) 'I feel' as opposed to ''sento'' (all those forms without final -''o'' are more akin to mediaeval Catalan and contemporary Balearic Catalan), and inchoative -''ir'' verbs: ''patir'' 'to suffer' gives ''patisc'' or ''patesc'' ('I suffer') as opposed to ''pateixo''.
* Present subjunctive is more akin to mediaeval Catalan and Spanish; -''ar'' infinitives end {{angle bracket|e}}, -''re'', -''er'' and -''ir'' verbs end in  {{angle bracket|a}} (in contemporary Central Catalan present subjunctive ends in {{angle bracket|i}}).
* An exclusive feature of Valencian is the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] imperfect morpheme -''ra'': ''que ell vinguera'' ('that he might come').
* Valencian has -''i''- as theme vowel for inchoative verbs of the third conjugation; e.g. ''servix'' ('s/he serves'), like North-Western Catalan. Although, again, this cannot be generalized since there are Valencian subdialects that utilize -''ei''-, e.g. ''serveix''.
* In Valencian the simple past tense (e.g. ''cantà'' 'he sang') is more frequently used in speech than in Central Catalan, where the periphrastic past (e.g. ''va cantar'' 'he sang') is prevailing and the simple past mostly appears in written language. The same, however, may be said of the Balearic dialects.&lt;ref name="badia" /&gt;
* The second-person singular of the present tense of the verb ''ser'' ('to be'), ''ets'' ('you are'), has been replaced by ''eres'' in colloquial speech.

;Clitics
* In general, use of modern forms of the determinate article (''[[wikt:el#Catalan|el]], [[wikt:els#Catalan|els]]'' 'the') and the third-person unstressed object pronouns (''[[wikt:el#Catalan|el]], [[wikt:els#Catalan|els]]'' 'him, them'), though some subdialects (for instance the one spoken in [[Vinaròs]] area) preserve etymological forms ''[[wikt:lo#Catalan|lo]]'', ''[[wikt:los#Catalan|los]]'' as in [[Lleida]]. For the other unstressed object pronouns, etymological old forms (''[[wikt:me#Catalan|me]]'', ''[[wikt:te#Catalan|te]]'', ''[[wikt:se#Catalan|se]]'', ''[[wikt:ne#Catalan|ne]]'', ''[[wikt:mos#Catalan|mos]]'', ''[[wikt:vos#Catalan|vos]]''...) can be found, depending on places, in conjunction with the more modern reinforced ones (''[[wikt:em#Catalan|em]]'', ''[[wikt:et#Catalan|et]]'', ''[[wikt:es#Catalan|es]]'', ''[[wikt:en#Catalan|en]]'', ''[[wikt:ens#Catalan|ens]]'', ''[[wikt:us#Catalan|us]]''...).
** Several variations for ''[[wikt:nosaltres#Catalan|nosaltres]]'', ''[[wikt:vosaltres#Catalan|vosaltres]]'' ('we, you'): ''mosatros, moatros, natros; vosatros, voatros, vatros''; also for the weak form ''mos''/-''mos'' instead of standard ''ens''/''-nos'' ('us').
* The adverbial pronoun ''[[wikt:hi#Catalan|hi]]'' ('there') is almost never used in speech and is replaced by other pronouns. The adverbial pronoun ''[[wikt:en|en]]'' ('him/her/them/it') is used less than in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.&lt;ref name="badia"&gt;{{cite book|first=Antoni M.|last=Badia i Margarit|title=Gramática de la llengua catalana: Descriptiva, normativa, diatópica, diastrática|publisher=Proa|location=Barcelona|year=1995|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Catalan personal pronouns|Combined weak clitics]] with ''[[wikt:li#Catalan|li]]'' ('him/her/it') preserve the ''li'', whereas in Central Catalan it is replaced by ''hi''. For example, the combination ''li'' + ''el'' gives ''li'l'' in Valencian (''l'hi'' in Central Catalan).
* The weak pronoun ''[[wikt:ho#Catalan|ho]]'' ('it') is pronounced as {{IPA|[ew]}} more often than in other dialects, especially when coming after another pronoun (e.g. ''m'ho dóna'' {{IPA|[mew ˈðona]}}, ''dóna-m'ho'' {{IPA|[ˈdonamew]}} 's/he gives it to me'). However, when preceding a verb on its own it is pronounced as {{IPA|[u]}}: ''ho dóna'' {{IPA|[u ˈðona]}} 's/he gives it'. Moreover, after a verb ending in a vowel it is pronounced as {{IPA|[w]}} (e.g. ''dóna-ho'' {{IPA|[ˈdonaw]}} 'you give it'); while, when following a verb ending with a consonant it is pronounced as {{IPA|[o]}}: ''donar-ho'' {{IPA|[doˈnaɾo]}} 'to give it'.
* The personal pronoun ''[[wikt:jo#Catalan|jo]]'' ('I') and the adverb ''[[wikt:ja#Catalan|ja]]'' ('already') are not pronounced according to the spelling, but to the etymology ({{IPA|[ˈjɒ]}} and {{IPA|[ˈja]}}, instead of {{IPA|/ˈ(d)ʒɔ/}} and {{IPA|/ˈ(d)ʒa/}}). Similar pronunciations can be heard in North-Western Catalan and Ibizan.
* The preposition ''[[wikt:amb#Catalan|amb]]'' ('with') merges with ''[[wikt:en#Catalan|en]]'' ('in') in most Valencian subdialects.
* Valencian preserves the mediaeval system of demonstratives with three different levels of demonstrative precision (''[[wikt:este#Catalan|este]]'' or ''[[wikt:aquest#Catalan|aquest]]''/''[[wikt:açò#Catalan|açò]]''/''[[wikt:ací#Catalan|ací]]'', ''[[wikt:eixe#Catalan|eixe]]'' or ''[[wikt:aqueix#Catalan|aqueix]]''/''[[wikt:això#Catalan|això]]''/''[[wikt:aquí#Catalan|ahí]]'', ''[[wikt:aquell#Catalan|aquell]]''/''[[wikt:allò#Catalan|allò]]''/''[[wikt:allí#Catalan|allí]]'' or ''[[wikt:allà#Catalan|allà]]'', where "aquest" and "aqueix" are almost never used) (feature shared with modern Ribagorçan and Tortosí).

=== Vocabulary ===

Valencian vocuabulary contains words both restricted to the Valencian-speaking domain, as well as words shared with other Catalan varieties, especially with [[Northwestern Catalan|Northwestern ones]]. Words are rarely spread evenly over the Valencian community, but are usually contained to parts of it, or spread out into other dialectal areas. Examples include ''hui'' 'today' (found in all of Valencia except transitional dialects, in Northern dialects ''avui'') and ''espill'' 'mirror' (shared with Northwestern dialects, Central Catalan ''mirall''). There is also variation within Valencia, such as 'corn', which is ''dacsa'' in Central and Southern Valencian, but ''panís'' in Alicante and Northern Valencian (as well as in Northwestern Catalan). Since Standard Valencian is based on the Southern dialect, words from this dialect are often used as primary forms in the standard language, despite other words traditionally being used in other Valencian dialects. Examples of this are ''tomaca'' 'tomato' (which is ''tomata'' outside of Southern Valencian) and ''matalaf'' 'mattress' (which is ''matalap'' in most of Valencia, including parts of the Southern Valencian area).

Below are a selection of words which differ or have different forms in Standard Valencian and Catalan. In many cases, both standards include this variation in their respective dictionaries, but differ as to what form is considered primary. In other cases, Valencian includes colloquial forms not present in the IEC standard. Primary forms in each standard are shown in bold (and may be more than one form). Words in brackets are present in the standard in question, but differ in meaning from how the [[cognate]] is used in the other standard.

== Varieties of Valencian ==

=== Standard Valencian ===

The [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua|Academy of Valencian Studies]] (''Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua'', AVL), established by law in 1998 by the [[Generalitat Valenciana|Valencian autonomous government]] and constituted in 2001, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian.&lt;ref&gt;Statute of Autonomy of the Valencian Community, article 6, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the majority of people who write in Valencian use this standard.{{sfn|Lledó|2011|p=339}}

Standard Valencian is based on the standard of the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|Institute of Catalan Studies]] (''Institut d'Estudis Catalans'', IEC), used in [[Catalonia]], with a few adaptations.{{sfn|Lledó|2011|p=338}} This standard roughly follows the [[Normes de Castelló|Rules of Castelló]] (''Normes de Castelló'') from 1932,{{sfn|Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua|2005}} a set of othographic guidelines regarded as a compromise between the essence and style of [[Pompeu Fabra]]'s guidelines, but also allowing the use of Valencian idiosyncrasies.

=== Valencian subdialects ===
[[Image:Subdialectes del valencià.svg|thumb|200px|Subdialects of Valencian]]
* '''Transitional Valencian''' (''valencià de transició'' or ''tortosí''): spoken only in the northernmost areas of the province of [[Castellón (province)|Castellón]] in towns like [[Benicarló]] or [[Vinaròs]], the area of [[Matarranya]] in [[Aragon]] (province of [[Teruel (province)|Teruel]]), and a southern border area of [[Catalonia]] surrounding [[Tortosa]], in the province of [[Tarragona (province)|Tarragona]].
** Word-initial and postconsonantal {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (Catalan {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/~/ʒ/}}) alternates with {{IPA|[(j)ʒ]}} intervocalically; e.g. ''joc'' {{IPA|[ˈdʒɒk]}} 'game', but ''pitjor'' {{IPA|[piˈʒo]}} 'worse', ''boja'' {{IPA|[ˈbɒjʒa]}} 'crazy' (Standard Valencian {{IPA|/ˈdʒɔk/}}, {{IPA|/piˈdʒoɾ/}}; {{IPA|/ˈbɔdʒa/}}; Standard Catalan {{IPA|/ˈʒɔk/}}, {{IPA|/piˈdʒo/}} and {{IPA|/ˈbɔʒə/}}).
** Final {{angle bracket|r}} {{IPAblink|ɾ}} isn't pronounced in infinitives; e.g. ''cantar'' {{IPA|[kanˈta]}} (instead of {{IPA|/kanˈtaɾ/}}) 'to sing'.
** Archaic [[article (grammar)|articles]] ''lo, los'' ('the') are used instead of ''el, els''; e.g. ''lo xic'' 'the boy', ''los hòmens'' 'the men'.
* '''Northern Valencian''' (''valencià septentrional'' or ''castellonenc''): spoken in an area surrounding the city of [[Castellón de la Plana]].
** Use of {{IPA|[e]}} sound instead of standard {{angle bracket|a}} {{IPA|/a/}} in the third person singular of most verbs; e.g. ''(ell) cantava'' {{IPA|[ˈkantave]}} (instead of {{IPA|/kanˈtava/}}) 'he sang'. Thus, Northern Valencian dialects contrast forms like ''(jo) cantava'' {{IPA|[kanˈtava]}} 'I sang' with ''(ell) cantava'' {{IPA|[kanˈtave]}} 'he sang', but merges ''(jo) cante'' {{IPA|[ˈkante]}} 'I sing' with ''(ell) canta'' {{IPA|[ˈkante]}} 'he sings'.
** Palatalization of  {{angle bracket|ts}} {{IPA|/ts/ &gt; [tʃ]}} and {{angle bracket|tz}} {{IPA|/dz/ &gt; [dʒ]}}; e.g. ''pots'' {{IPA|/ˈpots/ &gt; [ˈpotʃ]}} 'cans, jars, you can', ''dotze'' {{IPA|/ˈdodze/ &gt; [ˈdodʒe]}} 'twelve'.
** Depalatalization of {{IPA|/ʃ/}} to {{IPA|[sʲ]}}; e.g. ''caixa'' {{IPA|[ˈkajʃa] &gt; [ˈkajsʲa]}} 'box'.
* '''Central Valencian''' (''valencià central'' or ''apitxat''), spoken in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] city and its area, but not used as standard by the Valencian media.
** Sibilant merger: all voiced sibilants are devoiced ({{IPA|/dʒ/ &gt; [tʃ]}}, {{IPA|/dz/ &gt; [ts]}}, {{IPA|/z/ &gt; [s]}}); that is, ''apitxat'' pronounces ''casa'' {{IPA|[ˈkasa]}} ('house') and ''joc'' {{IPA|[ˈtʃɒk]}} ('game'), where other Valencians would pronounce {{IPA|/ˈkaza/}} and {{IPA|/ˈdʒɔk/}} (feature shared with [[Ribagorçan]]).
** [[Betacism]], that is the merge of {{IPA|/v/}} into {{IPA|/b/}}; e.g. ''viu'' {{IPA|[ˈbiw]}} (instead of {{IPA|/ˈviw/}}) 'he lives'.
** Fortition (gemination) and vocalisation of final consonants; ''nit'' {{IPA|[ˈnitːë]}} (instead of {{IPA|/ˈnit/}}) 'night'.
** It preserves the strong simple past, which has been substituted by an analytic past (periphrastic past) with {{smallcaps|vadere}} + [[infinitive]] in the rest of modern Catalan and Valencian variants. For example, ''aní'' instead of ''vaig anar'' 'I went'.
* '''Southern Valencian''' (''valencià meridional''): spoken in the contiguous ''[[comarques of the Valencian Community|comarques]]'' located in the southernmost part of the Valencia province and the northernmost part in the province of Alicante. This subdialect is considered as Standard Valencian.
** [[Vowel harmony]]: the final syllable of a disyllabic word adopts a preceding open {{angle bracket|e}} {{IPA|[æ]}} or {{angle bracket|o}} {{IPA|[ɒ]}} if the final vowel is an unstressed  -{{angle bracket|a}} or -{{angle bracket|e}}; e.g. ''terra'' {{IPA|[ˈtæræ]}} ('earth, land'), ''dona'' {{IPA|[ˈdɒnɒ]}} ('woman').
** This subdialect retain geminate consonants ({{angle bracket|tl}} {{IPA|/lː/}} and {{angle bracket|tn}} {{IPA|/nː/}}); e.g. ''guatla'' {{IPA|[ˈɡwalːa]}} 'quail', ''cotna'' {{IPA|[ˈkonːa]}} 'rind'.
** Weak pronouns are "reinforced" in front of the verb (''em, en, et, es'', etc.) contrary to other subdialects which maintains "full form" (''me, ne, te, se'', etc.).
* '''Alicante Valencian''' (''valencià alacantí''): spoken in the southern half of the province of [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]], and the area of [[Carche]] in [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]].
** Intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} elision in most instances; e.g. ''roda'' {{IPA|[ˈrɒa]}} 'wheel', ''nadal'' {{IPA|[naˈal]}} 'Christmas'.
** Yod is not pronounced in {{angle bracket|ix}} {{IPA|/jʃ/ &gt; [ʃ]}}; e.g. ''caixa'' {{IPA|[ˈkaʃa]}} 'box'.
** Final {{angle bracket|r}} isn't pronounced in infinitives; e.g. ''cantar'' {{IPA|[kanˈta]}} 'to sing'.
** There are some archaisms like: ''ans'' instead of ''abans'' 'before', ''manco'' instead of ''menys'' 'less', ''dintre'' instead of ''dins'' 'into' or ''devers'' instead of ''cap a'' 'towards'.
** There are more interferences with Spanish than other dialects: ''assul'' (from ''azul'') instead of ''blau'' (or ''atzur'') 'blue', ''llimpiar'' (from ''limpiar'') instead of ''netejar'' 'to clean' or ''sacar'' (from ''sacar'') instead of ''traure'' 'take out'.

== Media in Valencian ==
{{Main article|Ràdio Televisió Valenciana}}
[[File:RTVVexecutada.jpg|thumb|Employees demonstrate in front of the RTVV headquarters in [[Burjassot]] the day of its closure]]
Until its dissolution in November 2013, the public-service Ràdio Televisió Valenciana (RTVV) was the main broadcaster of radio and television in Valencian language. The Generalitat Valenciana constituted it in 1984 in order to guarantee the [[freedom of information]] of the Valencian people in their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ugtrtvv.net/cms/PDFS/MATERIALES/LleiCreacioRTVV.pdf|title = Ley de Creación de la Entidad Pública Radiotelevisión Valenciana|date = 1984|accessdate =1 April 2015|website = UGT RTTV|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its dissolution, the administration of RTVV under the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) had been controversial due to accusations of ideological manipulation and lack of plurality. The news broadcast was accused of giving marginal coverage of the [[Valencia Metro derailment]] in 2006 and the indictment of President de la Generalitat [[Francisco Camps]] in the [[Gürtel case|Gürtel]] scandal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vertele.com/video-articulo/los-escandalos-de-canal-9-rescatados-por-el-intermedio/|title = Los escándalos de Canal 9|date = 2013|accessdate = 1 April 2015|website = vertele.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supervisors appointed by the PP were accused of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3735055/20100528/sanz-destituit-secretari-general-rtvv-assetjament-sexual.html|title = Sanz, destituït de secretari general de RTVV per assetjament sexual|date = 2010|accessdate =1 April 2015|website = Vilaweb|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In face of an increasing debt due to excessive expenditure by the PP, RTVV announced in 2012 a plan to shed 70% of its labour. The plan was nullified on 5 November 2013 by the [[National Court of Spain|National Court]] after trade unions appealed against it. On that same day, the President de la Generalitat [[Alberto Fabra]] (also from [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]) announced RTVV would be closed, claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/11/05/valencia/1383648718_498928.html|title = El fracaso de Fabra acaba con el PP|date = 2013|accessdate = 1 April 2015|website = El País|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November, the legislative assembly passed the dissolution of RTVV and employees organized to take control of the broadcast, starting a campaign against the PP. Nou TV's last broadcast ended abruptly when Spanish police pulled the plug at 12:19 on 29 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25154669|title = Polic evict staff in Spain after closure of station|date = 2013|accessdate = 1 April 2015|website = BBC|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having lost all revenues from advertisements and facing high costs from the termination of hundreds of contracts, critics question whether the closure of RTVV has improved the financial situation of the Generalitat, and point out to plans to benefit private-owned media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.levante-emv.com/comunitat-valenciana/2014/06/19/coste-cierre-rtvv-asciende-144/1127465.html|title = El coste del cierre de RTVV asciende a 144,1 millones|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 April 2015|website = Levante-EMV|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the availability of media in the Valencian language is extremely limited. All the other [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities in Spain]], including the monolingual ones, have public-service broadcasters, with the Valencian Community being the only exception despite being the fourth most populated.

== Linguistic controversy ==
{{Further|Valencian language controversy|Language secessionism|Blaverism|Anti-Catalanism}}
Linguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian community, the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua|Valencian Language Academy]] (''Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua,'' AVL) considers Valencian and Catalan to be two names for the same language.&lt;ref name="dictalmen AVL"&gt;[http://ca.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictamen_sobre_els_principis_i_criteris_per_a_la_defensa_de_la_denominaci%C3%B3_i_l%27entitat_del_valenci%C3%A0 ''"Dictamen de l'Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua sobre els principis i criteris per a la defensa de la denominació i l'entitat del valencià"''].

[[File:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|right|300px]]

The AVL was established in 1998 by the PP-[[Valencian Union|UV]] government of [[Eduardo Zaplana]]. According to [[El País]], [[Jordi Pujol]], then president of Catalonia and of the [[CiU]], negotiated with Zaplana in 1996 to ensure the linguistic unity of Catalan in exchange for CiU support of the appointment of [[José María Aznar]] as [[Prime Minister of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pujol revela que pactó con Zaplana para avanzar con discreción en la unidad del catalán|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2004/11/10/cvalenciana/1100117884_850215.html|publisher=El País|accessdate=13 July 2017|location=Barcelona / Valencia|language=es|date=10 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaplana has denied this, claiming that "[n]ever, never, was I able to negotiate that which is not negotiable, neither that which is not in the negotiating scope of a politician. That is, the unity of the language".{{efn|"Nunca, nunca, pude negociar lo que no se puede negociar, ni aquello que no está en el ámbito de la negociación de un político. Es decir la unidad de la lengua."}}

The AVL orthography is based on the [[Normes de Castelló]], a set of rules for writing Valencian established in 1932. A rival set of rules, called ''Normes del Puig'', were established in 1979 by the association RACV (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana), which considers itself a rival language academy to the AVL, and promotes an alternative orthography. Compared to Standard Valencian, this orthography excludes many words not traditionally used in the Valencian Country, and also prefers spellings such as ⟨ch⟩ for /tʃ/ and ⟨y⟩ for /j/ (as in [[Spanish language|Castilian]]). It is mainly used by private individuals. The position of the RACV is supported by a minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racv.es/vcia/vista-listado-academicos-numero|title=List of RACV academics|website=Racv.es|accessdate=12 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214031455/http://www.racv.es/vcia/vista-listado-academicos-numero|archivedate=14 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Valencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia ([[Province of Lleida]] and most of the [[Province of Tarragona]]).{{sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5}}{{sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=2–3}} The various forms of Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible (ranging from 90% to 95%)&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian (1989 R. Hall, Jr.), cited on [http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=cat Ethnologue].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004&lt;ref name="lavanguardia.mobi"/&gt; showed that the majority (65%) of the Valencian people (both Valencian and Spanish speakers) consider Valencian different from Catalan: this position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly.{{sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207}} Furthermore, the data indicate that younger people educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. According to an official poll in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Presidència de la Generalitat Valenciana |date=2014 |title=Baròmetre d'abril 2014 |url=http://www.argos.gva.es/fileadmin/argos/Documentos/Encuestas/201404A_cruce.pdf |publisher=Presidència de la Generalitat Valenciana |access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 52% of Valencians considered Valencian to be a language different from Catalan, while 41% considered the languages to be the same. This poll showed significant differences regarding age and level of education, with a majority of those aged 18–24 (51%) and those with a higher education (58%) considering Valencian to be the same language as Catalan. This can be compared to those aged 65 and above (29%) and those with only primary education (32%), where the same view has its lowest support.

The ambiguity regarding the term Valencian and its relation to Catalan has sometimes lead to confusion and controversy. In 2004, during the drafting of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], the regional governments of Spain where a language other than Spanish is co-official were asked to submit translations into the relevant language in question. Since different names are used in Catalonia ("Catalan") and in the Valencian Community ("Valencian"), the two regions each provided one version, which were identical to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel I Vilar, Ferran.

The '''virtual world framework''' ('''VWF''') is a means to connect robust 3D, immersive, entities with other entities, [[virtual world]]s, content and users via [[web browser]]s.  It provides the ability for client-server programs to be delivered in a lightweight manner via web browsers, and provides synchronization for multiple users to interact with common objects and environments.  For example, using VWF, a developer can take video lesson plans, component objects and [[avatars]] and successfully insert them into an existing virtual or created landscape (such as EDGE&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.bigworldtech.com%2Fbwblog%2F2011%2F12%2Fus-armys-edge-program-leveraging-bigworld-tech%2F&amp;ei=W3uqT7KWKYP20gHQs6D6BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpB0rb_GcQb03pS3210vkYuY8Nkw&amp;cad=rja "US Army's Edge Program Leveraging Bigworld"]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[OpenSimulator|Open Sim]]), interacting with the native objects and users via a VWF interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtualworldframework.com/web/about.html “Virtual World Framework homepage”]&lt;/ref&gt;

VWF further opens the door to interface different training content, simulations, objects, users and locations; which will extend and expand the scope of training and education. (Imagine running a tank simulation with aviation assets, provided by two different simulations suites, but executed together and passing imagery and sensor data between them, working over a common landscape and feeding a constructive mapping simulation run on a third platform, all seamlessly and transparent to remote users via their browsers).  The VWF is meant as a useful tool to interact with differing types of entities (objects, avatars, simulations, spaces). As an open-source tool protected under the Apache II license, VWF is free and accessible to any number of developers who can create content and expand its scope and functionality. The VWF delivers its interactivity using the web, creating an opportunity to align mismatched objects or environments.  VWF is under development to work with Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games ([[MMORPG]]) such as EDGE, and ideally will be developed to interface with the latest object encodings (such as ''Unity'' and ''MP4''), environments (such as ''OpenSim'' MOSES) and other simulations platforms in order to create a truly agnostic interfacing tool.

== Myths ==

Even though it has a suggestive name, the VWF is not a [[virtual world]].  Nor is it a virtual world generation tool.  Can the VWF produce a virtual space and content to fill it?  Yes, it can, and it absolutely can be used to provide additional objects and interactions to augment/interact with entities to which it connects.  VWF isn’t a [[simulator]].  The VWF is meant to extend the use of active client-server simulations in order that they can be accessed via a web browser.  It is also meant to add extra dimensions to existing simulations or to create simulation content to add to an existing virtual space (such as MOSES) or a spontaneously generated space.  The VWF has the capability to create fully functional simulations but is not meant to be a complete simulator on its own.

VWF is not an avatar, nor does it require an avatar to run.  The VWF does not require a virtual space in order to work; it can be used to generate a virtual space within the web browser or locally on the host machine.  The VWF does not need an avatar to function, and does not necessarily generate avatars for use with virtual worlds, but can be used to produce or interact with avatars.

== Raison d'etre ==

The United States Department of Defense (DoD) cannot continue to do business as usual.  In FY05, the DoD spent $9.1B in Modeling and Simulation related activities.  Approximately 40% of that budget was used for simulators, war gaming, and modeling.&lt;ref&gt;IDA Model &amp; Simulation Study, R. Rolfe and R. Atwell, October 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The vision of the VWF is to reduce the funding used to support M&amp;S activities in direct support of pressure to reduce spending and increase efficacy of existing / emerging technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense.aol.com/2012/02/23/army-goes-world-of-warcraft-will-emphasize-virtual-training-be/ “Army Goes World of Warcraft to cope with Spending Cuts in M&amp;S Training”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DoD needs a tool to tie together its myriad, stove-piped, specialty simulations solutions. It needs a tool to extend and expand its ability to train an increasing number of personnel across ever-widening distances.  DoD stresses a need to reduce and reuse technology and to find more cost-efficient means to provide the most advanced technological and pedagogical systems of training.  It’s not just about training DoD personnel however.

We are surrounded by immersive, personalized social media and technology (such as [[Smart Phones]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Pandora Radio]], [[Project Glass]] and augmented reality sites such as Layar).  Traditional education systems do not allow for the pace of information sharing and immersion that media, games and the internet provide to youth on a regular basis and modernization/customization of education is becoming absolutely essential to its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedigitalshift.wikispaces.com/Augmented+Reality+In+The+Classroom “Digital Shift to Augmented Reality in the Classroom”]&lt;/ref&gt;  The intersection of technologies and the speed/volume of data delivery create a perfect storm of possibility for this system to provide the most good at the best cost.

As with the Internet, which started out as ARPAnet, the VWF is intended to develop into an open, robust platform that revolutionizes how we perceive and interact with the world.  With the VWF and the use of mobile / web enabled devices, users will be able to interact with their world on a grand scale; VWF capitalizes on the same technologies that enable 3D apps to view augmented reality, and will port their capabilities via the web on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[This is a forward-looking statement based on the vision of the creators, and is not a statement of fact at this time]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intended audience ==

The VWF is for developers of simulations, education systems, training content, games, information sharing, private individuals, really anyone with an interest in sharing information with multiple users in a lightweight fashion using a web browser as a delivery mechanism.  The VWF is for users to be able to access information, training, or content no matter where they are or what their hardware or [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] restrictions may be, as long as they have a secure link to the training server through the internet.  The VWF is to provide rapidly available content to those who need it most, when they need it, in a fashion which is accessible and low-overhead.

== Significance for business and government ==

VWF means a massive savings in preventing redundancy, in linking different systems and in building economies of scale and scope.  It means access to unprecedented complexity of training content and a huge flexibility in its delivery.  It means faster and more thoroughly trained personnel. It means platform-independent computing solutions for passing any type of data quickly and efficiently.  It means highly adaptive, rapid prototypes independent of the platforms which created them. It means staying at the forefront of the computing trends in information sharing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1810848 “Towards Platform Independent Adaptive Session Mobility”], ACM Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;   It means a rapid means of generating customized training solutions.  It means spontaneous meeting spaces and a method for delivering increased complexity and speed of intelligence to those who need it.

=== Ownership ===
The DoD owns the rights to the source code of the VWF; however, as it is licensed using Apache II, it is freely usable by any and all as long as original attribution is given to the creators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defensenews.com/print/article/20120127/TSJ01/301270004/New-Tool-Aims-Slash-Costs-Creating-Virtual-Worlds&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Licensing ===
The framework is licensed under the Apache II license, which essentially states that the user of the software is granted a royalty-free license to use, modify, and sell derivative works of, the software as long as the original license and attribution file(s) are included in the distribution of any and all subsequent works.  The original work is licensed “as is” and contains no warranties of any kind.

=== Content rights ===
Content rights are managed via the provisions contained in the Apache 2 license. The current content version control is affected by the primary engineers through github, with the latest stable builds published under unique serial numbers.

=== Designers ===
The designers are [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)]] (Lockheed Martin Chief Innovation Officer – project oversight, design, architecture), David Easter (LM Engineer - Development/Architecture), Richard Boyd (Lockheed Martin Virtual world Labs Chief Architect - governance and ecosystem design), Allison Corey (LM Engineer – development), Scott R. Haynes (LM Engineer - Development), Michael J. Vacirca (LM Engineer - Development), Steven D. Carr (LM Engineer - Development), Cynthia L. Moore (contractor, OSD(P&amp;R) TRS – design, future specs, governance), Carlton Rosengrant OSD(P&amp;R) TRS – overall Program Manager, Frank C. DiGiovanni (Director, OSD(P&amp;R)TRS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://prhome.defense.gov/bios/frankDigiovanni.aspx “Frank C. DiGiovanni, Director, Training Readiness &amp; Strategy”]&lt;/ref&gt; Coles/RDECOM (Edge interfacing), Robert Chadwick (ADL – code efficiency and applications), and emerging partners as new functions and libraries are proposed.

=== Contributing ===
VWF is posted on github,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/virtual-world-framework “Virtual World Framework github”]&lt;/ref&gt; and is open to any and all developers who wish to contribute forks, projects, suggestions or build-outs for the framework. The original creators especially seek major platform developers who wish to add interfacing to their platform for use with VWF, such as MMOs, simulations designers, terrain mapping providers, 3D modeling, virtual landscapes, etc. The paper "A Virtual World Ecosystem Framework", presented at the IITSEc conference in 2012, explains the philosophy of contribution to the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncnewschools.org/2012stemconference/CONF_PDFs/The_Virtual_World_Ecosystem_Framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development path ==

=== Evolution  ===

The VWF is managed via github and developer inputs through a loose consortium of the original creators.  In time, the community will stand up a non-profit governing organization, in order to conduct full-time partnerships and version control of the software.  Through the use of the latest codecs, interfacing partnerships with major content, object and texture providers, and a persistent location, it is additionally the goal of the creators that VWF will evolve into the standard for interfacing content with users on the web.

=== Availability to web applications ===

The VWF is available for use in web applications, and there are a few minor applications/demonstrations already constructed as proofs of concept.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.github.com/virtual-world-framework  and can be found in the public directory]&lt;/ref&gt;  As the community extends the robustness of the VWF, increases the libraries and finalizes the toolkits, these applications will gain in complexity as well.  Developers are welcome to construct web applications with the existing code and examples.  There is nothing special required to run completed applications outside of having access to a compatible browser with WebGL and potentially web sockets capability depending on the location of the source objects and interactions.

=== A framework among frameworks ===

There are many applications available which advertise themselves as [[Thin Clients]] or web interfaces.  There are no open source development tools in widespread use that interface different entities in a persistent, secure manner using a thin client through web-browsers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/Mgt/PIC/PIC.htm “Platform Independent Computing”].  This article was written in 2006 and search results display few successful efforts that are not highly specialized, do not involve significant plug-ins, client-side obligations for processing, or lag to date&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are many tools available, many of them are highly specialized and require proprietary software installed on both the client and server side.  There are still other tools which produce virtual environments, avatars, and content, but none of the ones known tie them together, spontaneously create interfaces among them or provide seamless communications to all of the entities regardless of their timing and without a heavy burden in bandwidth or processing power for the client.  VWF does this and will do more as it continues its evolution. VWF utilizes web sockets and [[WebGL]], directly providing a content link between entities and build 3D objects in the quickest, most efficient manner possible.  Other virtual interfacing programs utilize Flash which also provides direct content, but does so in a less efficient manner.

=== Additional resources ===

VWF information is available on two sites: [http://www.virtualworldframework.com   Virtual World Framework Homepage] (mirrored on [http://virtual.wf   vwf mirror site]) and [https://www.github.com/virtual-world-framework   github] (search virtual-world-framework).

== VWF applications ==

=== Training tsks &amp; timeline ===

VWF can be applied to content to train on most tasks which do not require solely live training.  Specifically: Curriculum facilitated through simulations, classroom training, augmented reality, mixed media training, and games are the ideal candidates for VWF.  Augmented reality content delivered to classrooms, or augmented additions to mobile devices such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beEtQslC6ds  this one] Also simulations which combine live training with simulated content are good candidates for VWF.  The complexity of the training and the number of trainees largely dictates the date by which this VWF capability will be delivered.  For delivery of classroom-type training the VWF is capable of being used to develop content.  For simulations-type training, following the persistence and synchronization elements of the VWF being developed in the next 6 months (by fall 2012), this capability of the VWF should be possible.  For augmented reality and truly immersive gaming, VWF will be under development with critical partners and hopes to have this capability in the coming 24 months, depending on current technologies and partnerships.

=== LVC exercises ===

Ideally, VWF will be used in [[live, virtual, and constructive]] simulation (LVC) exercises as a primary or secondary delivery mechanism.  LVC is ideal for VWF delivery due to its large virtual/digital component and its need to be delivered to myriad audiences in a variety of locations/platforms.

=== Live training &amp; VWF ===

Live objects such as aircraft, weapons and vehicles will pass data to the simulator through  sensors (read off of the radar/weapons/sensors on the live equipment directly into the simulation and then the input/output data passed through VWF to the myriad participants), data streaming through interfacing servers (in the case of personnel/equipment trackers such as [[Blue Force Tracking]]) and through information injection through constructive simulations (such as placing live units on a map and manually tracking their status/positions).

=== Constructive simulation &amp; VWF ===

Simulations do not take place “in” the Virtual World Framework.  The VWF is a tool to help interface different entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtualworldframework.com/web/about.html “Virtual World Framework Homepage About section”]&lt;/ref&gt; constructive simulations, in which simulated people operate simulated systems, are stimulated using human inputs.  Ostensibly the VWF would provide the interface (via the web) for some or all of these humans who would be inputting data into the system, then would receive the simulation results from the program executing on the server machine/cloud/locally-determined-host, and would display the results in some fashion via web interface.

=== Required tools to use the VWF ===

Developers use the VWF to build simulations using Java script and functionality provided through the VWF.  The VWF generates the appropriate display and manipulation files at the time of compilation.  As the VWF develops a construction environment will be developed in order to allow users to drag and drop content and manipulate it, greatly reducing production time/complexity.  This environment is under construction, and is anticipated to be completed at the end of 2012.

== Security considerations ==

=== Web security issues ===

The web is agnostic to content.  The VWF is not secure or unsecure.  The use of secure socket layer encryption ([[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]), [[virtual private networks]] (VPN), [[public key encryption]] (PKI), proprietary encryption, hardware secured network systems, etc. provides the security needed to secure any simulations produced and interfaced using the VWF.  With the use of [[IPv6]], bit-wise security protocols are available that were previously not available to data transport.  A potential additional security method is to add a security bit header to the data transported via VWF in order to provide an additional layer of security.  This measure has not yet been added to the current build.

=== Problems with web sockets and their solutions ===

The problem with opening a continuous connection between two computers via a web browser using Web sockets is that it potentially opens up the link to something called cache poisoning, in which someone can directly introduce viruses or other malware to the link, compromising the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg04744.html  (description of the attack here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Here is a summary of other weaknesses:  [http://blog.kotowicz.net/2011/03/html5-websockets-security-new-tool-for.html   Security tool for Web Sockets]).  Originally, potential security issues led Mozilla and Opera to discontinue support for Web Sockets until the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) could produce a standardized Web Sockets protocol as part of HTML5.  A work around based on Connect based handshakes (as opposed to upgrade- based handshakes) proved to be secure.  The semantics of the handshake as coded into VWF will take this into account.  Since late 2011 this has been largely addressed with latest builds and standards, and many web platforms do support Web Sockets.

== WebGL ==

=== What is WebGL? ===

[[WebGL]] (web graphics library) is a JavaScript [[Application Programming Interface]] (API) for rendering interactive 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without using plug-ins.  WebGL programs include control code (written in Java Script) and shader code which is executed on the graphics processing unit on the video card (GPU).  WebGL is designed and maintained by the non-profit Khronos Group.

=== Browsers supporting WebGL ===

Mozilla Firefox 6.0 onward, Opera 11 onward, Google Chrome 9 onward (native support), Safari 5.1 onward.  So far, Internet Explorer does not support WebGL and has not announced any plans to support WebGL.  Chrome Frame and IEWebGL plug-ins support WebGL for IE 6.0 onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[WebGL|“webGL standards”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard setting bodies ===

The WebGL standard is affected by the Khronos Group, Mozilla, Apple and Google along with influence from United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team which raises security concerns to which the WebGL consortium (headed by the Khronos Group) react.&lt;ref&gt;[[WebGL|Web GL and standards]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devices supporting capable browsers ===

Most PCs, laptops, and tablets support WebGL capable browsers.  Mobile support for WebGL is nascent.  Expectations are that current mobile bindings for JavaScript and WebGL are not good enough&lt;ref&gt;[http://codeflow.org/entries/2012/apr/25/webgl-statistics-and-the-state-of-webgl-html5/#webgl-on-ie “WebGL Statistics and the State of WebGL”]&lt;/ref&gt;  but there is an Android version of Firefox with WebGL (only about 10% of potential users access content via mobile device requiring WebGL support).  Opera also supports WebGL on Android platforms. iPhone does not support WebGL yet.

===Microsoft support for WebGL===

Microsoft does not have plans to support WebGL due to security concerns over handshake vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2011/06/16/webgl-considered-harmful.aspx “Microsoft Security Research &amp; Defense Blog 16 June 2011”]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two plug-ins for Internet Explorer which support WebGL interfaces:  Chrome Frame and IEWebGL.  It is true that native support tends to run better than plug-in support, and not all security organizations will support the installation of additional plug-ins to web browsers.

== JavaScript ==

===What is JavaScript?===

[[Java Script]] is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed, general purpose and supports object oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.  This means that JavaScript enables the programmer to build a series of prototypes and interact with them using a mostly literal syntax based on C. Due to its ease of use and widespread appeal, JavaScript quickly became one of the most popular programming languages for web applications.

=== Java Script vs. Java or C# ===

Java Script runs locally in the browsers, does not require additional plug ins or environments (like the Java runtime environment) to run, and does not require compilation or .exe files to be run on the client machine in order to work.  It is faster, more efficient, and simpler to build and execute than both Java and C#.

== Standards ==

=== Current standards supported by VWF ===

HTML 5.0, ECMAScript5, WebGL, Web Sockets, Collada (or other later file formats), and others as the tool matures.

== Community and governance ==

=== Contributing code to VWF ===

Developers can download the latest build of VWF from github and submit their recommendations, code and applications directly on the site. Github allows users to create their own forks, submit pull requests, and leave questions, comments and support related items in the issue tracker.

=== Coalition partners ===

VWF is available freely and openly on github to any and all persons, regardless of origin.  VWF content specifically designed for operations will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on the content, training objectives, and coalition goals being exercised.  There is no standing reason why VWF cannot be shared and there are no security restrictions on the original code.&lt;ref&gt;As an open source program, there are no restrictions to anyone downloading the original source code [https://www.github.com/virtual-world-framework “github virtual world framework”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business models ==

=== Commercial products from VWF ===

Can commercial entities build services or games with the VWF?  Absolutely.  The VWF is meant to interface content via the web, but it also contains construction pieces enabling the creation of games or communications services wholly executable within the web browser. VWF is licensed using Apache II, but this allows for a commercial repackaging of the open-source portions as part of a larger work.  These games and services would capitalize on the direct link between entities facilitated by the VWF, while the company would determine where the resources were located. For example: A game company might use VWF to create an online game using their proprietary graphics, and store both the graphics and the program files on their own servers while delivering that content through the web; a teleconference company might more efficiently create an e-classroom with the VWF to take their own streaming media codec and pass their video through the web to a digital classroom environment created wholly with the VWF, complete with avatars and interactive objects.

== Advisors ==

=== Current advisors ===

There is a multitude of partners and advisors for the VWF project.  There are the creators (mentioned earlier), as well as partnerships with [[Mark P. McCahill]] from Duke University, Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL), Doug Maxwell (for MOSES) and Cole Corporation (for the Edge military MMO).  All of these personnel provide advisory support to the VWF.  The creators encourage additional partnerships meant to expand the scope and scale of VWF.

[[File:BurmeseZayat.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a traditional Burmese zayat]]
A '''zayat''' ({{MYname|MY=ဇရပ်|MLCTS=ja. rap}}; {{IPA-my|zəjaʔ|IPA}}; from [[Mon language|Mon]] {{my|ဇြပ်}}) is a [[Burma|Burmese]] building found in almost every village.  It serves primarily as a shelter for travelers, at the same time, is also an assembly place for religious occasions as well as  meeting  for the villagers to discuss the needs and plans of the village.  [[Theravada]] buddhist monks use zayats as their dwelling place while they are exercising precepts on sabath days.  [[Vihara|Buddhist monasteries]] may have one or more zayats nearby.  Donors mostly build Zayats along main roads aiming to provide the exhausted travelers with water and shelter.  Beginning with [[Adoniram Judson]]'s construction of one in 1818 Christian missionaries have also adopted their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Henry | last=Howe | title=Adventures and Achievements of Americans | publisher=Geo.

[[File:Thudhama Zayats.jpg|thumb|The ''Thudamma'' Zayats in [[Mandalay]] were built during the [[Konbaung Dynasty]].]]

Contributions, in money or labor, towards the construction, running or elaboration of a zayat are seen as [[dāna]] (meritorious charity). Thus zayats are generally built in a more durable and costly manner than most private houses. The labor is normally provided by locals, while the financing may be local or remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=William and Robert | last=Chambers | title=Chambers's Information for the People, Vol. II | publisher=J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co. | location=Philadelphia | year=1857}} as seen at [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0RUPTL2ZMD-nsZ&amp;id=DfhpWjE5r-YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA407&amp;lpg=RA1-PA407&amp;dq=Zayat+teaching+OR+buddhist+OR+buddhism+OR+religion+OR+architecture+OR+building+-rabbit+-russian+-russia+-El-Zayat+-Al-Zayat Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Community Service - A Myanmar Tradition | work=Community Service - A Myanmar Tradition | url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp1997/12-97/tra12-97.htm | accessdate=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some zayats have evolved other functions over time.  For example, the Jivitadana Sangha Hospital for Buddhist monks and nuns began as a clinic at a zayat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Health and Helplines | work=The Yangon Directory | url=http://www.yangondirectory.com.mm/ydg_GeneralInfo/Health_N_Helplines.asp | accessdate=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature in English==
Because of the importance of ''zayat'' based evangelism to Adoniram Judson's mission, and the prominence that his first wife [[Ann Hasseltine Judson|Ann Hasseltine's]] letters gave his work, many Christian missionaries in Burma constructed and used one or more zayats, and their letters and journals were widely published by missionary boards and societies in the United States.

The first [[Fu Manchu]] story entitled ''The Zayat Kiss'' was published as a stand-alone magazine story in 1912.  This and the next nine stories were combined into the novel ''The Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu'' in 1913, which was titled ''The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu'' when published four months later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Foreword | work=The Bookshelf | url=http://thenostalgialeague.com/fsfh/text/fuman.html | accessdate=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
