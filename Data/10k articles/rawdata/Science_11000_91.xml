The '''American Institute of Physics''' ('''AIP''') promotes science, the profession of physics, publishes physics journals, and produces publications for scientific and engineering societies. The AIP is made up of various member societies. Its corporate headquarters are at the American Center for Physics in [[College Park, Maryland]], but the institute also has offices in [[Melville, New York]] and [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=home&gt;[http://www.aip.org/aip/about-aip About AIP]. American Institute of Physics. July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core activities==
The focus of the AIP appears to be organized around a set of core activities. The first delineated activity is to support member societies regarding essential society functions. This is accomplished by annually convening the various society officers to discuss common areas of concern. A range of topics is discussed which includes scientific publishing, public policy issues, membership-base issues, philanthropic giving, science education, science careers for a diverse population, and a forum for sharing ideas.&lt;ref name=home/&gt; 

Another core activity is publishing the science of physics in research journals, magazines, and conference proceedings. Member societies continue nevertheless to publish their own journals.

Other core activities are tracking employment and education trends with six decades of coverage, being a liaison between research science and industry, historical collections and [[physics outreach]] programs, and supporting science education initiatives and supporting undergraduate physics. One other core activity is as an advocate for science policy to the U.S. Congress and the general public.&lt;ref name=home/&gt;

==Historical overview==
The AIP was founded in 1931 as a response to lack of funding for the sciences during the [[Great Depression]]. It formally incorporated in 1932 consisting of five original "member societies", and a total of four thousand members. A new set of member societies was added beginning in the mid-1960s. As soon as the AIP was established it began publishing scientific journals.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[//www.aip.org/aip/history "History of AIP"]. American Institute of Physics. July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''asymptotic gain model'''&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, RD: ''Design-oriented analysis of feedback amplifiers''; Proc. of National Electronics Conference, Vol. XX, Oct. 1964, pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenstark&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenstark, Sol|title=Feedback amplifier principles|page=15|year=1986|publisher=Collier Macmillan|location=NY|isbn=0-02-947810-3|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0029478103}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the '''Rosenstark method'''&lt;ref name=Palumbo&gt;{{cite book|author1=Palumbo, Gaetano  |author2=Salvatore Pennisi |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Feedback amplifiers: theory and design|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Boston/Dordrecht/London|isbn=0-7923-7643-9|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0792376439|pages=§3.3 pp. 69–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a representation of the gain of [[negative feedback amplifier]]s given by the asymptotic gain relation:
:&lt;math&gt;G = G_{\infty} \left( \frac{T}{T + 1} \right) + G_0 \left( \frac{1}{T + 1} \right) \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[return ratio]] with the input source disabled (equal to the negative of the [[loop gain]] in the case of a single-loop system composed of [[Amplifier#Unilateral or bilateral|unilateral]] blocks), ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the asymptotic gain and ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the direct transmission term. This form for the gain can provide intuitive insight into the circuit and often is easier to derive than a direct attack on the gain.
[[Image:Asymt feedback.png|thumb|300px|right| Figure 1: Block diagram for asymptotic gain model&lt;ref name=Gray-Meyer&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R. Gray, Hurst P J Lewis S H &amp; Meyer RG|title=Analysis and design of analog integrated circuits|year=2001|edition=Fourth|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-32168-0|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-471-32168-0|nopp=true|pages=Figure 8.42 p. 604}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Figure 1 shows a block diagram that leads to the asymptotic gain expression. The asymptotic gain relation also can be expressed as a [[Signal-flow graph#Example 3 Asymptotic gain formula|signal flow graph]]. See Figure 2. The asymptotic gain model is a special case of the [[extra element theorem]].
[[Image:Modified SFG for feedback amplifier.PNG|thumbnail|300px|Figure 2: Possible equivalent signal-flow graph for the asymptotic gain model]]

==Definition of terms==
As follows directly from limiting cases of the gain expression, the asymptotic gain ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is simply the gain of the system when the return ratio approaches infinity:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{\infty} = G\ \Big |_{T \rightarrow \infty}\ , &lt;/math&gt;

while the direct transmission term ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the gain of the system when the return ratio is zero:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{0} = G\ \Big |_{T \rightarrow 0}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

==Advantages==
* This model is useful because it completely characterizes feedback amplifiers, including loading effects and the [[Electronic amplifier#Unilateral or bilateral|bilateral]] properties of amplifiers and feedback networks.
* Often feedback amplifiers are designed such that the return ratio ''T'' is much greater than unity. In this case, and assuming the direct transmission term ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is small (as it often is), the gain ''G'' of the system is approximately equal to the asymptotic gain ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;''.
* The asymptotic gain is (usually) only a function of passive elements in a circuit, and can often be found by inspection.
* The feedback topology (series-series, series-shunt, etc.) need not be identified beforehand as the analysis is the same in all cases.

==Implementation==
Direct application of the model involves these steps:
# Select a [[dependent source]] in the circuit.
# Find the [[return ratio]] for that source.
# Find the gain ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' directly from the circuit by replacing the circuit with one corresponding to ''T'' = ∞.
# Find the gain '' G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' directly from the circuit by replacing the circuit with one corresponding to ''T'' = 0.
# Substitute the values for ''T, G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' and '' G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' into the asymptotic gain formula.

These steps can be implemented directly in [[SPICE]] using the small-signal circuit of hand analysis. In this approach the dependent sources of the devices are readily accessed. In contrast, for experimental measurements using real devices or SPICE simulations using numerically generated device models with inaccessible dependent sources, evaluating the return ratio requires [[Return ratio#Other Methods|special methods]].

==Connection with classical feedback theory==
Classical [[Negative feedback amplifier#Classical model|feedback theory]] neglects feedforward (''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). If feedforward is dropped, the gain from the asymptotic gain model becomes

::&lt;math&gt;G = G_{\infin} \frac {T} {1+T} =\frac {G_{\infin}T}{1+\frac{1} {G_{\infin}} G_{\infin} T} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

while in classical feedback theory, in terms of the open loop gain ''A'', the gain with feedback (closed loop gain) is:

::&lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{FB} = \frac {A} {1 + {\beta}_\mathrm{FB} A} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Comparison of the two expressions indicates the feedback factor ''β''&lt;sub&gt;FB&lt;/sub&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt; \beta_\mathrm{FB} = \frac {1} {G_{\infin}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

while the open-loop gain is:

::&lt;math&gt; A = G_{\infin} \ T \ . &lt;/math&gt;

If the accuracy is adequate (usually it is), these formulas suggest an alternative evaluation of ''T'': evaluate the open-loop gain and ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' and use these expressions to find ''T''. Often these two evaluations are easier than evaluation of ''T'' directly.

==Examples==
The steps in deriving the gain using the asymptotic gain formula are outlined below for two negative feedback amplifiers. The single transistor example shows how the method works in principle for a transconductance amplifier, while the second two-transistor example shows the approach to more complex cases using a current amplifier.

===Single-stage transistor amplifier===
[[Image:Mosfbamp.png|thumb|Figure 3: FET feedback amplifier|300px|right]]
Consider the simple [[FET]] feedback amplifier in Figure 3. The aim is to find the low-frequency, open-circuit, [[Electronic amplifier#Input and output variables|transresistance]] gain of this circuit ''G'' = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; / ''i''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; using the asymptotic gain model.

[[Image:Transresistance Amplifier.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Figure 4: Small-signal circuit for transresistance amplifier; the feedback resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is placed below the amplifier to resemble the standard topology]]
[[Image:Return Ratio.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Figure 5: Small-signal circuit with return path broken and test voltage driving amplifier at the break]]

The [[small-signal]] equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4, where the transistor is replaced by its [[hybrid-pi model]].

====Return ratio====
It is most straightforward to begin by finding the return ratio ''T'', because ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' are defined as limiting forms of the gain as ''T'' tends to either zero or infinity. To take these limits, it is necessary to know what parameters ''T'' depends upon. There is only one dependent source in this circuit, so as a starting point the return ratio related to this source is determined as outlined in the article on [[return ratio]].

The [[return ratio]] is found using Figure 5. In Figure 5, the input current source is set to zero, By cutting the dependent source out of the output side of the circuit, and short-circuiting its terminals, the output side of the circuit is isolated from the input and the feedback loop is broken. A test current ''i&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' replaces the dependent source. Then the return current generated in the dependent source by the test current is found. The return ratio is then ''T'' = −''i&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; / i&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. Using this method, and noticing that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is in parallel with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T'' is determined as:
:&lt;math&gt;T = g_\mathrm{m} \left( R_\mathrm{D}\ ||r_\mathrm{O} \right) \approx g_\mathrm{m} R_\mathrm{D} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where the approximation is accurate in the common case where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;. With this relationship it is clear that the limits ''T'' → 0, or ∞ are realized if we let [[transconductance]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; → 0, or ∞.&lt;ref&gt;Although changing ''R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; // r&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' also could force the return ratio limits, these resistor values affect other aspects of the circuit as well. It is the ''control parameter'' of the dependent source that must be varied because it affects ''only'' the dependent source.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asymptotic gain====
Finding the asymptotic gain ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' provides insight, and usually can be done by inspection. To find ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' we let ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; → ∞ and find the resulting gain. The drain current, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ''v''&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt;, must be finite. Hence, as ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; approaches infinity, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; also must approach zero. As the source is grounded, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 implies ''v''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 as well.&lt;ref&gt;Because the input voltage ''v&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt;'' approaches zero as the return ratio gets larger, the amplifier input impedance also tends to zero, which means in turn (because of [[current division]]) that the amplifier works best if the input signal is a current. If a Norton source is used, rather than an ideal current source, the formal equations derived for ''T'' will be the same as for a Thévenin voltage source. Note that in the case of input current, ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[Electronic amplifier#Input and output variables|transresistance]] gain.&lt;/ref&gt; With ''v''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and the fact that all the input current flows through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (as the FET has an infinite input impedance), the output voltage is simply −''i''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;G_{\infty} = \frac{v_\mathrm{out}}{i_\mathrm{in}} = -R_\mathrm{f}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the gain found by replacing the transistor by an ideal amplifier with infinite gain - a [[nullor]].&lt;ref name=Verhoeven&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Verhoeven CJ, van Staveren A, Monna GL, Kouwenhoven MH, Yildiz E |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Structured electronic design: negative-feedback amplifiers|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Boston/Dordrecht/London|isbn=1-4020-7590-1|pages=§2.3 – §2.5 pp. 34–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8wDptzCMrUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=isbn=1-4020-7590-1#PPA35,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct feedthrough====
To find the direct feedthrough &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; we simply let ''g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' → 0 and compute the resulting gain. The currents through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and the parallel combination of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; || ''r''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; must therefore be the same and equal to ''i''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;. The output voltage is therefore ''i''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; ''(R''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; ''|| r''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'')''.

Hence
:&lt;math&gt;G_0 = \frac{v_{out}}{i_{in}} = R_D\|r_O \approx R_D \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the approximation is accurate in the common case where ''r&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt;&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''.

====Overall gain====
The overall [[Electronic amplifier#Input and output variables|transresistance gain]] of this amplifier is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{v_{out}}{i_{in}} = -R_f \frac{g_m R_D}{1+g_m R_D} + R_D \frac{1}{1+g_m R_D} = \frac{R_D\left(1-g_m R_f\right)}{1+g_m R_D}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Examining this equation, it appears to be advantageous to make ''R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' large in order make the overall gain approach the asymptotic gain, which makes the gain insensitive to amplifier parameters (''g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''). In addition, a large first term reduces the importance of the direct feedthrough factor, which degrades the amplifier. One way to increase ''R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is to replace this resistor by an [[active load]], for example, a [[current mirror]].
[[Image:Two-transistor feedback amp.svg|thumbnail|200px|Figure 6: Two-transistor feedback amplifier; any source impedance ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is lumped in with the base resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''.]]

===Two-stage transistor amplifier===
[[Image:Using return ratio.PNG|thumbnail|350px|Figure 7: Schematics for using asymptotic gain model; parameter α = β / ( β+1 ); resistor R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
Figure 6 shows a two-transistor amplifier with a feedback resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''. This amplifier is often referred to as a ''shunt-series feedback'' amplifier, and analyzed on the basis that resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in series with the output and samples output current, while ''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in shunt (parallel) with the input and subtracts from the input current. See the article on [[Negative feedback amplifier#Two-port analysis of feedback|negative feedback amplifier]] and references by Meyer or Sedra.&lt;ref name=Gray-Meyer1&gt;{{cite book|author1=P R Gray |author2=P J Hurst |author3=S H Lewis |author4=R G Meyer  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits|year=2001|edition=Fourth|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-32168-0|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0471321680|pages=586–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sedra1&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

It frequently is ambiguous just what type of feedback is involved in an amplifier, and the asymptotic gain approach has the advantage/disadvantage that it works whether or not you understand the circuit.

Figure 6 indicates the output node, but does not indicate the choice of output variable. In what follows, the output variable is selected as the short-circuit current of the amplifier, that is, the collector current of the output transistor. Other choices for output are discussed later.

To implement the asymptotic gain model, the dependent source associated with either transistor can be used. Here the first transistor is chosen.

====Return ratio====
The circuit to determine the return ratio is shown in the top panel of Figure 7. Labels show the currents in the various branches as found using a combination of [[Ohm's law]] and [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]]. Resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''= R''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ''// r''&lt;sub&gt;π1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''= R''&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; ''// R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. KVL from the ground of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the ground of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provides:

:&lt;math&gt; i_\mathrm{B} = -v_{ \pi} \frac {1+R_2/R_1+R_\mathrm{f}/R_1} {(\beta +1) R_2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

KVL provides the collector voltage at the top of ''R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' as

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{C} = v_{ \pi} \left(1+ \frac {R_\mathrm{f}} {R_1} \right ) -i_\mathrm{B} r_{ \pi 2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, KCL at this collector provides

:&lt;math&gt; i_\mathrm{T} = i_\mathrm{B} - \frac {v_\mathrm{C}} {R_\mathrm{C}} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the first equation into the second and the second into the third, the return ratio is found as

:&lt;math&gt;T = - \frac {i_\mathrm{R}} {i_\mathrm{T}} = -g_\mathrm{m} \frac {v_{ \pi} }{i_\mathrm{T}} &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = \frac {g_\mathrm{m} R_\mathrm{C}} { \left( 1 + \frac {R_\mathrm{f}} {R_1} \right) \left( 1+ \frac {R_\mathrm{C}+r_{ \pi 2}}{( \beta +1)R_2} \right) +\frac {R_\mathrm{C}+r_{ \pi 2}}{(\beta +1)R_1} } \ . &lt;/math&gt;

====Gain ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' with T = 0====
The circuit to determine ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is shown in the center panel of Figure 7. In Figure 7, the output variable is the output current β''i&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the short-circuit load current), which leads to the short-circuit current gain of the amplifier, namely β''i&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt; G_0 = \frac { \beta i_B} {i_S} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Ohm's law]], the voltage at the top of ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is found as

::&lt;math&gt; ( i_S - i_R ) R_1 = i_R R_f +v_E \ \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

or, rearranging terms,

::&lt;math&gt; i_S = i_R \left( 1 + \frac {R_f}{R_1} \right) +\frac {v_E} {R_1} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Using KCL at the top of ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'':

::&lt;math&gt; i_R = \frac {v_E} {R_2} + ( \beta +1 ) i_B \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Emitter voltage ''v&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' already is known in terms of ''i&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the diagram of Figure 7. Substituting the second equation in the first, ''i&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is determined in terms of ''i&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' alone, and ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes:

::&lt;math&gt;G_0 = \frac { \beta } {
 ( \beta +1) \left( 1 + \frac{R_f}{R_1} \right ) +(r_{ \pi 2} +R_C ) \left[ \frac {1} {R_1} + \frac {1} {R_2} \left( 1 + \frac {R_f} {R_1} \right ) \right]
} &lt;/math&gt;

Gain ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents feedforward through the feedback network, and commonly is negligible.

====Gain ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' with ''T'' → ∞====
The circuit to determine ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 7. The introduction of the ideal op amp (a [[nullor]]) in this circuit is explained as follows. When ''T ''→ ∞, the gain of the amplifier goes to infinity as well, and in such a case the differential voltage driving the amplifier (the voltage across the input transistor ''r&lt;sub&gt;π1&lt;/sub&gt;'') is driven to zero and (according to Ohm's law when there is no voltage) it draws no input current. On the other hand, the output current and output voltage are whatever the circuit demands. This behavior is like a nullor, so a nullor can be introduced to represent the infinite gain transistor.

The current gain is read directly off the schematic:

::&lt;math&gt; G_{ \infty } = \frac { \beta i_B } {i_S} = \left( \frac {\beta} {\beta +1} \right) \left( 1 + \frac {R_f} {R_2} \right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

====Comparison with classical feedback theory====
Using the classical model, the feed-forward is neglected and the feedback factor β&lt;sub&gt;FB&lt;/sub&gt; is (assuming transistor β &gt;&gt; 1):

::&lt;math&gt; \beta_{FB} = \frac {1} {G_{\infin}} \approx \frac {1} {(1+ \frac {R_f}{R_2} )} = \frac {R_2} {(R_f + R_2)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and the open-loop gain ''A'' is:

::&lt;math&gt;A = G_{\infin}T \approx \frac {\left( 1+\frac {R_f}{R_2} \right) g_m R_C} { \left( 1 + \frac {R_f} {R_1} \right) \left( 1+ \frac {R_C+r_{ \pi 2}}{( \beta +1)R_2} \right) +\frac {R_C+r_{ \pi 2}}{(\beta +1)R_1} } \ . &lt;/math&gt;

====Overall gain====
The above expressions can be substituted into the asymptotic gain model equation to find the overall gain G. The resulting gain is the ''current'' gain of the amplifier with a short-circuit load.

=====Gain using alternative output variables=====
In the amplifier of Figure 6, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; are in parallel.
To obtain the transresistance gain, say ''A''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, the gain using voltage as output variable, the short-circuit current gain ''G'' is multiplied by ''R&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; // R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' in accordance with [[Ohm's law]]:

::&lt;math&gt; A_{ \rho} = G \left( R_\mathrm{C2} // R_\mathrm{L} \right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The ''open-circuit'' voltage gain is found from ''A''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; by setting ''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; → ∞.

To obtain the current gain when load current ''i&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' in load resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the output variable, say ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the formula for [[current division]] is used: ''i&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = i&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; × R&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; / ( R&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; )'' and the short-circuit current gain ''G'' is multiplied by this [[Voltage divider#Loading effect|loading factor]]:

::&lt;math&gt; A_i = G \left( \frac {R_{C2}} {R_{C2}+ R_{L}} \right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Of course, the short-circuit current gain is recovered by setting ''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 Ω.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5089">'''Canada/USA Mathcamp''' is a five-week academic [[Summer camp|summer program]] for middle and high school students with talent and passion for [[mathematics]]. Rather than training students for contests or providing courses for credit, Mathcamp introduces students to the various branches of advanced mathematics they are otherwise unlikely to discover until well into their college years.

Mathcamp was founded in 1993 by Dr. George Thomas, who recognized that students interested in mathematics frequently lacked the resources and camaraderie to pursue their interest. Mira Bernstein became the director when Thomas left in 2002 to found [[MathPath]], a program for younger students.

Mathcamp is held each year on a different college campus in the United States or Canada.  Past locations have included the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of Washington]], [[Colorado College]], [[Reed College]], [[University of Puget Sound]], [[Colby College]], the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Mount Holyoke College]]. Mathcamp enrolls about 120 students yearly, 45-55 returning and 65-75 new.

The application process for new students includes an entrance exam (the "Qualifying Quiz"), personal essay, and two letters of recommendation, but no grade reports. The process helps ensure that the students who are most passionate about math come to camp. Admission is selective: in 2016, the acceptance rate was 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5t71f5h1228993_mathcamp_application|author=MarisaD|title=Mathcamp application|website=artofproblemsolving.com|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes at Mathcamp come in four designations of pace and difficulty. The milder classes often include [[Mathematical proof|basic proof techniques]], [[number theory]], [[graph theory]], and [[combinatorial game theory]], while the spicier classes cover advanced topics in [[abstract algebra]], [[topology]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[category theory]], and [[mathematical analysis]]. There are generally four class periods each day and five classes offered during each period, allowing students to create a custom schedule of classes that match their interests and background.  [[Graduate student]] mentors teach most of the classes, while [[undergraduate]] junior counselors, all of them Mathcamp alumni, do most of the behind-the-scenes work. Each year there are a number of renowned guest speakers, who have included [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], [[Avi Wigderson]], and [[Serge Lang]].

Since Mathcamp is as much designed to let students interested in mathematics meet each other as for them to meet math, staff and campers organize a number of non-mathematical events such as field trips, hikes, a [[puzzle hunt]], and game tournaments. The campers also enjoy a great deal of freedom and are expected to act responsibly. In this way, Mathcamp often eases the transition to the full freedom and responsibility of college.

==Culture==

Mathcamp culture is best described as quirky and fun-loving. In 2004, some campers created Foodtongue, a [[constructed language]] in which every word is a word that means a [[food]] in the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Casey |last=Goodwin |title=In a Class of His Own: Whiz-ard of Odd |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |publisher=Stephens Media |date=12 December 2006 |accessdate=2009-02-25 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Dec-12-Tue-2006/living/11150724.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cardinal rules of the language is an agreed ban of direct translation.  Foodtongue remains popular among campers, and there now exists an active [[wiki]], updated and referenced by speakers of the language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FoodTongue Avocado Pilaf |work=FoodTongue Wiki |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-02-25 |url=http://foodtongue.wikidot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them campers from later years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">'''Carl Adolf (Adolphe) Otth''' (April 2, 1803, Bern - May 16, 1839) was a Swiss physician and [[naturalist]]. He was the brother of [[mycologist]] [[Gustav Heinrich Otth]] (1806-1874).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33355944#page/873/mode/1up Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publications] @ Biodiversity Heritage Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822 he studied medicine in Bern, and afterwards attended classes on [[natural history]] in [[Geneva]], where he had as instructors, [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] (1778-1841) and [[Nicolas Charles Seringe]] (1776-1858). He later studied medicine at the Universities of [[University of Kiel|Kiel]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], where in 1828 he received his doctorate. After six months in Paris, he returned to Bern.

In 1836 as a naturalist, he journeyed to [[Dauphiné]] and [[Provence]] in France, to the [[Balearic Islands]] and also to [[Algeria]]. From these travels he collected a large number of insect, reptile and [[amphibian]] species. In 1837 he was the first to describe the frog genus ''[[Discoglossus]]'' based on studies of the [[Discoglossus pictus|Mediterranean painted frog]] (''Discoglossus pictus'').

In 1838 he published a book with thirty [[lithograph]]s based on a trip to [[Algiers]], titled ''Esquisses africaines, dessinées pendant un voyage a Alger et lithographiées par Adolphe Otth''. In 1839 during a journey to the Middle East, he died in [[Jerusalem]] at the age of 36.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6966">'''Collective Behavior and Social Movements (CBSM)''' is a section of the [[American Sociological Association| American Sociological Association (ASA)]] composed of [[sociology|sociologists]] who focus on the study of emerging and extra-institutional group phenomena. These include the behaviors associated with [[crowd]]s, [[disaster]]s, [[fad]]s, [[revolutionary movement]]s, [[riot]]s, and [[social movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Karides, Marina, Joya Misra, Ivy Kennely, and Stephanie Moller. 2001. “Representing the Discipline: Social Problems Compared to ASR and AJS.” ''Social Problems'' 48(1): 111-128.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the section is to foster the study of these topics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsm-asa.org/ CBSM. Accessed 5/1/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is done so by communicating through its newsletter ''Critical Mass'', organizing research-related participation, and sponsoring [[academic workshop|workshops]].&lt;ref&gt;Tindall, DB. 2003. "From Structure to Dynamics: A Paradigm Shift in Social Movements Research?" ''Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology-Revue Canadienne de Sociologie et d'Anthropologie'' 40(4): 481-487.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Within the larger ASA, there are constituent parts known as sections. In the 1970s, there was a desire among some members of the ASA to establish a group that would study [[collective behavior]] and [[social movements]] as a fused topic. Since the ASA section on [[social psychology]] had, at the time, just been reorganized, one proposal was to establish a collective behavior-social movement group as a subsection of the newly reconstituted social psychology section. In response to this idea, sociologists [[Enrico Quarantelli]] and Jack Weller conducted a survey, whose results indicated that some social movement academics felt that a collective behavior-social movement group would be misplaced as a subsection within social psychology. In order to communicate about this controversy, a [[newsletter]] was created: ''Critical Mass''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Hank and Shoon Lio. 1998. "Collective Behavior and Social Movements in the Postmodern Age: Looking Backward to Look Forward." ''Sociological Perspectives'' 41(3): 453-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''Critical Mass'', published in October 1973, was written by sociologist Thelma McCormack. McCormack suggested that the name “Social Organization” would be appropriate for a new section interested in collective behavior and social movements. However, [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]], who was central in the effort to establish an entirely separate section within the ASA for this cause, responded adamantly that the title should pay homage to the traditional link between collective behavior and social movements. The bond between collective behavior and social movements had formed earlier in the twentieth century through the work of [[Robert Ezra Park]] and [[Herbert Blumer]]. Since then, American sociological tradition had maintained that link. Thus, in 1978, a formal [[petition]] was circulated to create a new section, which would be called Collective Behavior and Social Movements (CBSM).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Hank and Shoon Lio. 1998. "Collective Behavior and Social Movements in the Postmodern Age: Looking Backward to Look Forward." ''Sociological Perspectives'' 41(3): 453-472.&lt;/ref&gt; CBSM was officially made a section of the ASA in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsm-asa.org/join/ CBSM: About. Accessed 5/1/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now one of the largest and most active sections of the ASA.&lt;ref&gt;Karides, Marina, Joya Misra, Ivy Kennely, and Stephanie Moller. 2001. “Representing the Discipline: Social Problems Compared to ASR and AJS.” ''Social Problems'' 48(1): 111-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsm-asa.org/join/ CBSM: About. Accessed 5/1/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the relevance of "CB" ([[collective behavior|Collective Behavior]]) in "CBSM" has been questioned. For some, the CB in CBSM has been replaced by CA ([[collective action|Collective Action]]). This has created the potential for a chasm between the two orientations. Additionally, as the section gains more international attendance, the link between collective behavior and social movements has become more obscure, given that the traditional American sociological link between the two areas is tenuous for non-US academics.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Hank and Shoon Lio. 1998. "Collective Behavior and Social Movements in the Postmodern Age: Looking Backward to Look Forward." ''Sociological Perspectives'' 41(3): 453-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Critical Mass''==

The newsletter of the CBSM section is ''Critical Mass.'' In the areas of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], [[critical mass]] refers to the amount of [[fissile material]] needed for [[nuclear fission]]. Drawing upon this meaning, social movement [[scholar]]s and [[activist]]s use the term critical mass in reference to the idea that some threshold of participants or action must be crossed in order for a social movement to burst into existence.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Pamela, Gerald Marwell, and Ruy Teixeira. 1985. "A Theory of the Critical Mass. I. Interdependence, Group Heterogeneity, and the Production of Collective Action." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 91(3): 522-556.&lt;/ref&gt; Fittingly, the newsletter and its title pre-dated the formation of the CBSM section, which was itself borne out of action and movement.

==Awards==
The CBSM section of the ASA gives the following awards:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsm-asa.org/awards/ CBSM: Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Charles Tilly Award for Best Book]]: Established in 1986, this award recognizes a significant published contribution in the field of collective behavior and social movements.
* Mayer Zald Outstanding Graduate Student Paper Award: Established in 1992, this award is given to recognize work done in the field by those who specifically do not have a [[PhD]].
* Best Published Article Award: Established in 2002, this award recognizes articles and chapters from edited books published in the year prior to the award year.
* Exceptional Service Award: As of 2014, this award has been given once, in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17216">A '''concept inventory''' is a [[criterion-referenced test]] designed to help determine whether a student has an accurate working [[knowledge]] of a specific set of concepts. Historically, concept inventories have been in the form of [[multiple-choice test]]s in order to aid interpretability and facilitate administration in large classes.  Unlike a typical, teacher-authored multiple-choice test, questions and response choices on concept inventories are the subject of extensive research. The aims of the research include ascertaining (a) the range of what individuals think a particular question is asking and (b) the most common responses to the questions. Concept inventories are evaluated to ensure test [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. In its final form, each question includes one correct answer and several distractors.

Ideally, a score on a criterion-referenced test reflects the amount of content knowledge a student has mastered. Criterion-referenced tests differ from [[norm-referenced tests]] in that (in theory) the former is not used to compare an individual's score to the scores of the group. Ordinarily, the purpose of a criterion-referenced test is to ascertain whether a student mastered a predetermined amount of content knowledge; upon obtaining a test score that is at or above a [[cutscore|cutoff score]], the student can move on to study a body of content knowledge that follows next in a learning sequence. In general, item difficulty values ranging between 30% and 70% are best able to provide information about student understanding.

The distractors are incorrect or irrelevant answers that are usually (but not always) based on students' commonly held misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Development and Validation of Instruments to Measure Learning of Expert-Like Thinking." W. K. Adams &amp; C. E. Wieman, 2010. International Journal of Science Education, 1-24. iFirst, {{doi|10.1080/09500693.2010.512369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test developers often research student misconceptions by examining students' responses to open-ended essay questions and conducting "think-aloud" interviews with students. The distractors chosen by students help researchers understand student thinking and give instructors insights into students' prior knowledge (and, sometimes, firmly held beliefs).  This foundation in research underlies instrument construction and design, and plays a role in helping educators obtain clues about students' ideas, [[scientific misconceptions]], and [[didaskalogenic]] ("teacher-induced" or "teaching-induced") confusions and conceptual lacunae that interfere with learning.

==Concept inventories in use==
Concept inventories are education-related diagnostic tests.&lt;ref name="Tregust, 1988"&gt;Tregust, D.F. 1988. Development and use of diagnostic tests to evaluate students' misconceptions in science.  International Journal of Science Education 10: 159-169 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0950069880100204#.VKMeQsZl5FI]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 Halloun and Hestenes introduced a "multiple-choice mechanics diagnostic test" to examine students' concepts about motion.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"&gt;Hallouin, I. A., &amp; Hestenes, D. Common sense concepts about motion (1985). American Journal of Physics, 53, 1043-1055&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates student understanding of basic concepts in classical (macroscopic) mechanics. A little later, the [[Force Concept Inventory]] (FCI), another concept inventory, was developed.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hestenes D, Wells M, Swackhamer G 1992 Force concept inventory. The Physics Teacher 30: 141-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=AJPIAS&amp;CURRENT=NO&amp;ONLINE=YES&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=AJPIAS&amp;pyears=2001%2C2000%2C1999&amp;possible1=465&amp;possible1zone=fpage&amp;fromvolume=66&amp;SMODE=strsearch&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=AJPIAS&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=1&amp;page=1&amp;chapter=0 Hestenes D 1998. Am. J. Phys. 66:465]&lt;/ref&gt; The FCI was designed to assess student understanding of the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] concepts of force.  Hestenes (1998) found that while "nearly 80% of the [students completing introductory college physics courses] could state [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law]] at the beginning of the course. FCI data showed that less than 15% of them fully understood it at the end".These results have been replicated in a number of studies involving students at a range of institutions (see sources section below).   That said, there remains questions as what exactly the FCI measures.&lt;ref name="Huffman"&gt;Huffman, D. &amp; P. Heller. 1995. What does the force concept inventory actually measure? The Physics Teacher 33: 138-143; Heller, P. &amp; D. Huffman. 1995.[http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/weeks//journal/hestenes-tpt95c.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Results from Hake (1998) using the FCI have led to greater recognition in the [[science education]] community of the importance of students' "interactive engagement" with the materials to be mastered.&lt;ref name="Hake"&gt;Hake, R. R. 1998. Interactive-engagement versus traditional methods: a six-thousand-student survey of mechanics test data for introductory physics courses. Am. J. Physics 66, 64-74.[http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/66/1/10.1119/1.18809]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Hake Plot.JPG|right|thumb|This is a schematic of the Hake plot (see Redish page&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/papers/redish/nas/nas.htm Redish page.

In many areas, foundational scientific concepts transcend disciplinary boundaries. An example of an inventory that assesses knowledge of such concepts is an instrument developed by  Odom and Barrow (1995) to evaluate understanding of [[diffusion]] and [[osmosis]].&lt;ref name="Odom"&gt;Odom AL, Barrow LH 1995 Development and application of a two-tier diagnostic test measuring college biology students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis after a course of instruction. Journal of Research In Science Teaching 32: 45-61.&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, there are non-multiple choice conceptual instruments, such as the essay-based approach suggested by Wright et al. (1998)&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;[http://bioliteracy.colorado.edu/Readings/Wright.pdf Wright et al., 1998. J. Chem. Educ. 75: 986-992]&lt;/ref&gt; and the essay and oral exams used by Nehm and Schonfeld (2008).&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; and Cooper et al &lt;ref&gt;Cooper, M. M.; Underwood, S.

==Caveats associated with concept inventory use==
Some concept inventories are problematic.  The concepts tested may not be fundamental or important in a particular discipline, the concepts involved may not be explicitly taught in a class or curriculum, or answering a question correctly may require only a superficial understanding of a topic.  It is therefore possible to either over-estimate or under-estimate student content mastery.  While concept inventories designed to identify trends in student thinking may not be useful in monitoring learning gains as a result of pedagogical interventions, disciplinary mastery may not be the variable measured by a particular instrument.  Users should be careful to ensure that concept inventories are actually testing conceptual understanding, rather than test-taking ability, language skills, or other abilities that can influence test performance.

The use of multiple-choice exams as concept inventories is not without controversy.   The very structure of multiple-choice type concept inventories raises questions involving the extent to which complex, and often nuanced situations and ideas must be simplified or clarified to produce unambiguous responses.  For example, a multiple-choice exam designed to assess knowledge of key concepts in natural selection&lt;ref name="AFN"/&gt; does not meet a number of standards of quality control.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2010"/&gt; One problem with the exam is that the two members of each of several pairs of parallel items, with each pair designed to measure exactly one key concept in natural selection, sometimes have very different levels of difficulty.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Another problem is that the multiple-choice exam overestimates knowledge of natural selection as reflected in student performance on a diagnostic essay exam and a diagnostic oral exam, two instruments with reasonably good [[construct validity]].&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt;   Although scoring concept inventories in the form of essay or oral exams is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to implement with large numbers of students, such exams can offer a more realistic appraisal of the actual levels of students' conceptual mastery as well as their misconceptions.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Recently, however, computer technology has been developed that can [[Automated essay scoring|score essay responses]] on concept inventories in biology and other domains (Nehm, Ha, &amp; Mayfield, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Nehm, R.H., Ha, M., Mayfield, E.

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/1059-0145/preprint/?sort=p_OnlineDate&amp;sortorder=desc&amp;o=30]&lt;/ref&gt; promising to facilitate the scoring of concept inventories organized as (transcribed) oral exams as well as essays.

In [[physics]], the '''correspondence principle''' states that the behavior of systems described by the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] (or by the [[old quantum theory]]) reproduces [[classical mechanics|classical physics]] in the limit of large [[quantum numbers]]. In other words, it says that for large [[orbit]]s and for large [[energy|energies]], quantum calculations must agree with classical calculations.&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tipler|first1=Paul|last2=Llewellyn|first2=Ralph|title=Modern Physics|edition=5|year=2008|publisher=[[W.

The principle was formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The term codifies the idea that a new theory should reproduce under some conditions the results of older well-established theories in those domains where the old theories work. This concept is somewhat different from the requirement of a formal [[Limiting case (philosophy of science)|limit]] under which the new theory reduces to the older, thanks to the existence of a deformation parameter.  {{What?|date=October 2017}}

Classical quantities appear in quantum mechanics in the form of [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expected values]] of observables, and as such the [[Ehrenfest theorem]] (which predicts the time evolution of the expected values) lends support to the correspondence principle.

==Quantum mechanics==

The rules of quantum mechanics are highly successful in describing microscopic objects, [[atom]]s and [[particle physics|elementary particles]]. But ''macroscopic systems,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[spring (device)|springs]] and [[capacitor]]s, are accurately described by classical theories like [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]]. If quantum mechanics were to be applicable to macroscopic objects, there must be some limit in which quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics.  ''Bohr's correspondence principle demands that classical physics and quantum physics give the same answer when the systems become large''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

The conditions under which quantum and classical physics agree are referred to as the '''correspondence limit''', or the '''[[classical limit]]'''. Bohr provided a rough prescription for the correspondence limit: it occurs ''when the quantum numbers describing the system are large''. A more elaborated analysis of quantum-classical correspondence (QCC) in wavepacket spreading leads to the distinction between robust "restricted QCC" and fragile "detailed QCC".&lt;ref&gt;

The post-1925 new quantum theory came in two different formulations. In [[matrix mechanics]], the correspondence principle was built in and was used to construct the theory. In the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger approach]] classical behavior is not clear because the waves spread out as they move. Once the Schrödinger equation was given a probabilistic interpretation, [[Ehrenfest theorem|Ehrenfest showed]] that Newton's laws hold on average: the quantum statistical expectation value of the position and momentum obey Newton's laws.

The correspondence principle is one of the tools available to physicists for selecting quantum theories corresponding to [[reality]]. The [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|principles of quantum mechanics]] are broad: states of a physical system form a [[Hilbert space|complex vector space]] and [[physical observables]] are identified with [[Hermitian operators]] that act on this [[Hilbert space]]. The correspondence principle limits the choices to those that reproduce classical mechanics in the correspondence limit.

Because quantum mechanics only reproduces classical mechanics in a statistical interpretation, and because the statistical interpretation only gives the probabilities of different classical outcomes, [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] has argued that quantum physics does not reduce to classical mechanics similarly as classical mechanics emerges as an approximation of [[special relativity]] at small [[velocity|velocities]]. He argued that classical physics exists independently of quantum theory and cannot be derived from it. His position is that it is inappropriate to understand the experiences of observers using purely quantum mechanical notions such as wavefunctions because the different states of experience of an observer are defined classically, and do not have a quantum mechanical analog. The [[many worlds interpretation|relative state interpretation]] of quantum mechanics is an attempt to understand the experience of observers using only quantum mechanical notions. Niels Bohr was an early opponent of such interpretations.

Many of these conceptual problems, however, resolve in the [[Weyl quantization|phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics]], where the ''same variables with the same interpretation'' are utilized to describe both quantum and classical mechanics.

==Other scientific theories==

The term "correspondence principle" is used in a more general sense to mean the reduction of a new [[scientific theory#science|scientific theory]] to an earlier scientific theory in appropriate circumstances. This requires that the new theory explain all the phenomena under circumstances for which the preceding theory was known to be valid, the "correspondence limit".

For example, 
*Einstein's [[special relativity]] satisfies the correspondence principle, because it reduces to classical mechanics in the limit of velocities small compared to the [[speed of light]] (example below);
* [[General relativity]] reduces to [[gravity|Newtonian gravity]] in the limit of weak gravitational fields;
* Laplace's theory of [[celestial mechanics]] reduces to Kepler's when interplanetary interactions are ignored, and Kepler's reproduces Ptolemy's [[equant]] in a coordinate system where the Earth is stationary;
* Statistical mechanics reproduces thermodynamics when the number of particles is large;
* In biology, chromosome inheritance theory reproduces Mendel's laws of inheritance, in the domain that the inherited factors are protein coding [[genes]].

In order for there to be a correspondence, the earlier theory has to have a domain of validity—it must work under ''some'' conditions. Not all theories have a domain of validity. For example, there is no limit where Newton's mechanics reduces to [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotle's mechanics]] because Aristotle's mechanics, although academically dominant for 18 centuries, does not have any domain of validity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{Dubious|date=April 2018}}

==Examples==
===Bohr model===
{{Main|Bohr model}}
If an electron in an atom is moving on an orbit with period {{math|''T''}},  classically the electromagnetic radiation will repeat itself every orbital period. If the coupling to the electromagnetic field is weak, so that the orbit doesn't decay very much in one cycle, the radiation will be emitted in a pattern which repeats every period, so that the Fourier transform will have frequencies which are only multiples of   {{math|1/''T''}}. This is the classical radiation law: the frequencies emitted are integer multiples of  {{math|1/''T''}}.

In quantum mechanics, this emission must be in quanta of light, of frequencies consisting of integer multiples of  {{math|1/''T''}}, so that classical mechanics is an approximate description at large quantum numbers. This means that the energy level corresponding to a classical orbit of period  {{math|1/''T''}} must have nearby energy levels which differ in energy by  {{math|''h/T''}}, and they should be equally spaced near that level,
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E_n= { h\over T(E_n) }    ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Bohr worried whether the energy spacing 1/{{math|''T''}} should be best calculated with the period of the energy state &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, or some average—in hindsight,  this model is only the leading semiclassical approximation.

Bohr considered circular orbits.  Classically, these orbits must decay to smaller circles when  photons are emitted. The level spacing between circular orbits can be calculated with the correspondence formula. For a Hydrogen atom, the classical orbits have a period  {{math|''T''}}  determined by [[Keplers laws|Kepler's third law]] to scale as  {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The energy scales as  {{math|1/''r''}}, so the level spacing formula  amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E \propto { 1 \over r^{3\over 2} } \propto E^{3 \over 2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is possible to determine the energy levels by recursively stepping down orbit by orbit, but there is a shortcut.

The angular momentum  {{math|''L''}} of the circular orbit scales as {{math|{{radic|''r''}}}}. The energy in terms of the angular momentum is then
:&lt;math&gt;E \propto {1\over r} \propto {1 \over L^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming, with Bohr, that quantized values of  {{math|''L''}} are equally spaced, the spacing between neighboring energies is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E \propto {1 \over (L+\hbar)^2 } - {1 \over L^2} \approx  - {2\hbar  \over L^3} \propto  - E^{3 \over 2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This is as desired for equally spaced angular momenta. If one kept track of the constants, the spacing would be   {{math|''ħ''}}, so the angular momentum should be an integer multiple of  {{math|''ħ''}},
:&lt;math&gt;
L = {nh \over 2\pi} = n \hbar  ~ .
&lt;/math&gt;

This is how Bohr arrived at his [[Bohr Model|model]]. Since only the level ''spacing'' is determined heuristically by the correspondence principle, one could always add a small fixed offset to the quantum number— {{math|''L''}} could just as well have been  {{math|(''n''+.338) ''ħ''}}. 

Bohr used his physical intuition to decide which quantities were best to quantize. It is a testimony to his skill that he was able to get so much from what is only the [[leading-order|leading order]] approximation. A less heuristic treatment accounts for needed offsets in the ground state '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, cf. [[Wigner–Weyl transform]].

=== One-dimensional potential ===

Bohr's correspondence condition can be solved for the level energies in a general one-dimensional potential. Define a quantity    {{math|''J''(''E'')}} which is a function only of the energy, and has the property that
:&lt;math&gt;
{dJ \over dE} = T
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the analog of the angular momentum in the case of the circular orbits. The orbits selected by the correspondence principle are the ones that obey  {{math|''J'' {{=}} ''nh''}}  for {{mvar|n}} integer, since
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = {dE \over dJ}(J_{n+1} - J_n) = {1 \over T} \,\Delta J
&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity  {{math|''J''}} is canonically conjugate to a variable  {{math|''θ''}} which, by the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton equations of motion]] changes with time as the gradient of energy with  {{math|''J''}}. Since this is equal to the inverse period at all times, the variable  {{math|''θ''}} increases steadily from 0 to 1 over one period.

The angle variable comes back to itself after 1 unit of increase, so the geometry of phase space in  {{math|''J'',''θ''}} coordinates is that of a half-cylinder, capped off at  {{math|''J''}} = 0, which is the motionless orbit at the lowest value of the energy. These coordinates are just as canonical as  {{math|''x'',''p''}}, but the orbits are now lines of constant  {{math|''J''}} instead of nested ovoids in  {{math|''x''-''p''}} space.

The area enclosed by an orbit is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under canonical transformations, so it is the same in  {{math|''x''-''p''}} space as in  {{math|''J''-''θ''}}. But in the {{math|''J''-''θ''}} coordinates, this area is the area of a cylinder of unit circumference between 0 and  {{math|''J''}}, or just  {{math|''J''}}. So  {{math|''J''}} is equal to the area enclosed by the orbit in  {{math|''x-p''}} coordinates too,
:&lt;math&gt;
J = \int_0^T p {d x \over dt}\, dt  ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

The quantization rule is that the [[action-angle variables|action variable]]  {{math|''J''}} is an integer multiple of  {{math|''h''}}.

=== Multiperiodic motion: Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization ===

Bohr's correspondence principle provided a way to find the semiclassical quantization rule for a one degree of freedom system. It was an argument for the old quantum condition mostly independent from the one developed by [[Wilhelm Wien|Wien]] and Einstein, which focused on [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]]. But both pointed to the same quantity, the action.

Bohr was reluctant to generalize the rule to systems with many degrees of freedom. This step was taken by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]], who proposed the general quantization rule for an [[integrable]] system,
:&lt;math&gt; J_k = h n_k. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Each action variable is a separate integer, a separate quantum number.

This condition reproduces the circular orbit condition for two dimensional motion: let  {{math|''r,θ''}} be polar coordinates for a central potential. Then  {{math|''θ''}} is already an angle variable, and the canonical momentum conjugate is  {{math|''L''}}, the angular momentum. So the quantum condition for  {{math|''L''}} reproduces Bohr's rule:
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{2\pi} L d\theta = 2\pi L = n h.
&lt;/math&gt;

This allowed Sommerfeld to generalize Bohr's theory of circular orbits to elliptical orbits, showing that the energy levels are the same. He also found some general properties of quantum angular momentum which seemed paradoxical at the time. One of these results was that the z-component of the angular momentum, the classical inclination of an orbit relative to the z-axis, could only take on discrete values, a result which seemed to contradict rotational invariance. This was called ''space quantization'' for a while, but this term fell out of favor with the new quantum mechanics since no quantization of space is involved.

In modern quantum mechanics, the principle of superposition makes it clear that rotational invariance is not lost. It is possible to rotate objects with discrete orientations to produce superpositions of other discrete orientations, and this resolves the intuitive paradoxes of the Sommerfeld model.

===The quantum harmonic oscillator===

Here is a demonstration&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation | last1=Sells | first1=Robert L. | last2=Weidner | first2=Richard T.
      | title=Elementary modern physics
      | publisher=Allyn and Bacon | location=Boston | isbn=978-0-205-06559-2 | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
of how large quantum numbers can give rise to classical (continuous) behavior.

Consider the one-dimensional [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. Quantum mechanics tells us that the total (kinetic and potential) [[energy]] of the oscillator, {{math|''E''}}, has a set of discrete values,
:&lt;math&gt;E=(n+1/2)\hbar \omega, \ n=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots ~ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{math| ''ω''}}  is the [[angular frequency]] of the oscillator.

However, in a [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]] such as a lead ball attached to the end of a spring, we do not perceive any discreteness. Instead, the energy of such a macroscopic system appears to vary over a continuum of values. We can verify that our idea of [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] systems fall within the correspondence limit. The energy of the classical harmonic oscillator with [[amplitude]] {{math|''A''}},  is
:&lt;math&gt; E = \frac{m \omega ^2 A^2}{2} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the quantum number has the value
:&lt;math&gt; n = \frac{E}{\hbar \cdot \omega} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{m \omega A^2}{2\hbar} -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply typical "human-scale" values {{math|''m''}} = 1[[kilogram|kg]],   {{math| ''ω''}} = 1 [[radian|rad]]/[[second|s]], and {{math|''A''}} = 1 m, then {{math|''n''}} ≈ 4.74×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;. This is a very large number, so the system is indeed in the correspondence limit.

It is simple to see why we perceive a continuum of energy in this limit.  With   {{math| ''ω''}} = 1  rad/s, the difference between each energy level is {{math|''ħω''}} ≈  1.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt;[[Joule|J]], well below what we normally resolve for macroscopic systems. One then describes this system through an emergent [[classical limit]].

===Relativistic kinetic energy===

Here we show that the expression of [[kinetic energy]] from [[special relativity]] becomes arbitrarily close to the classical expression, for speeds that are much slower than the [[speed of light]],  {{math|''v  ≪  c''}}.

[[Einstein]]'s   mass-energy equation
:&lt;math&gt; E =  \frac{m_0} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}  c^2 ~, &lt;/math&gt;
where the velocity, {{math| ''v''}} is the velocity of the body relative to the observer, &lt;math&gt; m_0 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass|''rest'' mass]] (the observed mass of the body at zero velocity relative to the observer), and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]].

When the velocity {{math| ''v''}}  vanishes, the energy expressed above is not zero, and represents the [[rest energy|''rest'' energy]],
:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m_0 c^2. \ &lt;/math&gt;

When the body '''is''' in motion relative to the observer, the total energy exceeds the rest energy by an amount that is, by definition, the ''kinetic'' energy,
:&lt;math&gt; T = E - E_0 =  \frac{m_0 c^2} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \ - \ m_0 c^2 ~. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the approximation
:&lt;math&gt; ( 1 + x  )^n \approx 1 + nx \ &lt;/math&gt;
:::for  &lt;math&gt; |x| \ll 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
we get, when speeds are much slower than that of light, or  {{math|''v  ≪  c''}},  
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; T \ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \frac{1} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - 1 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \left( 1 - v^2/c^2 \right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\approx m_0 c^2 \left( (1 - (-\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} )v^2/c^2) - 1 \right)  \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} v^2/c^2 \right)  \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=  \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} m_0 v^2  ~, &lt;/math&gt;
|}
which is the [[classical physics|Newtonian]] expression for [[kinetic energy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4036">'''Drug fraud''' is a type of fraud in which drugs, legal or illegal, are [[Cutting agent|cut]] or altered in such a way that diminishes their value below that which they are sold for.

== Illegal drug fraud ==

{{main|Lacing (drugs)}}

This type of drug fraud occurs then the dealer cuts or commingles the pure drug with a similar substance such as [[baby powder]] or [[powdered milk]].  When this is sold to the [[drug user|user]], the user receives less of a [[Substance intoxication|high]] and so must buy more to get the previous high.  There may also be adverse health consequences as a result of the cutting substance, such as a [[bad trip]] or [[Drug overdose|overdose]]. This can also be seen in [[prescription drug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hileman, Bette. ''"[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8145/8145drugs.html COUNTERFEIT DRUGS: Sophisticated Technologies and Old-Fashioned Fraud Pose Risks to the Prescription Drug Supply in the U.S.]"'' [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] Printed 10 Nov. 2003. Accessed 15 Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal drug fraud ==

Legal drug fraud occurs when a physician prescribes medication for a patient under false pretenses. This may be because the manufacturers of the drug have [[Bribery#Medicine|paid the doctor a fee]] to dispense their drug.  Another cause may be [[drug pricing fraud]], in which a physician prescribes a patient expensive drugs, that they may or may not need, in order to profit from the receipts.&lt;ref&gt;Beyerle, Dana. ''"[http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20080210/NEWS/727340312/1011 Medicaid Drug Fraud Trial a Who’S Who of Lawyers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110725203128/http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20080210/NEWS/727340312/1011 |date=25 July 2011 }}."''

Patients too, may participate in this.  A common method is the forging of doctor prescriptions to gain access to [[prescription drug|prescription medication]]s. A somewhat rarer type is a citizen posing as a doctor to, among other things, gain access to the [[free sample]]s of drugs that some drug manufacturers give out. The samples may also be sold to desperate patients at an exorbitant rate. Actual physicians may do this also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/02/us-drugsamples-idUSN3158060620080102|title=Free drug samples go to wealthy, insured: U.S. study|last=Dixon|first=Kim|date=Jan 2, 2008|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=6 November 2010|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordenberg, Tamar "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n2_v32/ai_20383017 Selling drug samples lands doctor in prison - Dr. Kumaralingam Nagalingam sentenced for Medicare fraud and selling free drug samples]" FDA Consumer.

== Legal status ==

Illegal drug fraud is rarely addressed in court, as victims rarely involve police, but legal drug fraud is on the rise.  Its upswing has increased calls for [[accountability]] as well as a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] being passed in the United States, 2007 Senate Bill 88.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentuckyvotes.org/2007-SB-88 2007 Senate Bill 88 (Tighten rules against drug fraud) - KentuckyVotes.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">The '''Escuela Superior Latinoamericana de Informática''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Latin American Superior School of Informatics", ESLAI) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] undergraduate school of [[computer science]] established in 1986. Classes were held in a former countryhouse at the Pereyra Iraola Park in [[Buenos Aires Province]], at approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km from [[Buenos Aires]].

The school had Argentine mathematician [[Manuel Sadosky]] among its main founders. In spite of its short life, it had a considerable impact on informatics teaching and research in Argentina and [[South America]]. ESLAI courses were attended by students from several Spanish-speaking countries in South America such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. All students had a full scholarship and the admission process was passed by about 15% of applicants. 

The school established cooperation programs with a number of foreign universities in the [[Americas]] as well as in [[Europe]]. Those agreements sponsored important visitors to the school, such as [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]], [[Jean-Raymond Abrial]], Ugo Montanari, [[Carlo Ghezzi]] and Giorgio Ausiello, and enabled its students to attend graduate school at foreign universities.

The school had a remarkable European influence and was oriented towards theoretical aspects of computer science, such as [[typed lambda calculus]], [[formal verification]], and Martin-Löf's [[intuitionistic type theory]].

Unfortunately, the school was never able to develop a relationship with local companies, which in an emergent economy like Argentina's is essential to be involved with more practical problems. Without financial support, ESLAI had to close down in September 1990 during the [[president of Argentina|presidency]] of [[Carlos Menem]].

'''European Chemist''' ('''EurChem''') is an international [[professional certification|professional qualification]] awarded by the European Chemist Registration Board (ECRB) of the [[European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences]] for [[chemist]]s and is for use in many European countries.

As Europe increasingly develops common standards, it is important that the professional competence of those who oversee the maintenance of standards is recognised. Academic qualifications alone have limited value. In providing an acceptable common professional standard, the European Chemist requires experience in the application of knowledge, level of skill, safety and environmental consciousness, sense of responsibility, ability to communicate and level of supervision received. Through the European Chemist designation the chemical societies in the EU have ensured that there is an easily understood title to indicate a high level of competence in the practice of chemistry. The award of EurChem will assist individual chemists who are moving from one employer to another in different member states, receiving equal treatment across the [[European Union|EU]]. 

EurChem Candidates must meet the following requirements:

*Be a member of a participating national chemical society;
*Hold a degree accredited by the participating national chemical society;
*Have at least eight years of post-secondary school education/experience including a category-A schedule academic qualification;
*Have at least three years' approved post-graduation professional experience ;
*Two referees who must be members of the applicant's national chemical society;
*Show proficient professional experience appearing out of:
**Able to work in conditions with minor leadership
**Applying knowledge
**Consciousness of safety, health, and environment apects
**Demonstrate of professional skill
**Excellent written and oral communications
**Good people's management, advising, evaluating skills.

The title '''EurChem''' is ''[[post-nominal]]'', i.e. it is placed after the name such as [[academic degree]]s. The ECRB maintains also a Register of European Chemists. The title is equivalent to the national chartered status, e.g. the title [[Chartered Chemist]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

Recognition of the qualification and title are generally not specifically incorporated into national law, however in the United Kingdom the [[Privy Council]] has approved the use of the title;{{cn|date=July 2018}} however in all cases approval is only after [[peer review]] by the appropriate national [[:Category:Chemistry societies|chemical society]], in addition the [[European Union|EU]] [[European professional qualification directives|Directive 89/48/EEC]] generally exempts a bearer from additional examination in the Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8311">The '''expression problem''' is a term used in discussing strengths and weaknesses of various [[programming paradigms]] and [[programming languages]].

[[Philip Wadler]] coined the term&lt;ref name="WadlerPost"&gt;{{cite web 
| title=The Expression Problem
| url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/expression/expression.txt
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a discussion with Rice University's ''Programming Languages Team'' (PLT):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The expression problem is a new name for an old problem.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;
{{cite web 
| title=User-defined types and procedural data structures as complementary approaches to data abstraction
| url=http://repository.cmu.edu/compsci/1278/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;
{{cite web 
| title=Object-Oriented Programming versus Abstract Data Types
| url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/wcook/papers/OOPvsADT/CookOOPvsADT90.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the datatype and new functions over the datatype, without recompiling existing code, and while retaining static type safety (e.g., no casts).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
At ECOOP '98, Krishnamurthi et al.&lt;ref name="Synth"&gt;
{{cite web 
| title=Synthesizing Object-Oriented and Functional Design to Promote Re-Use
| url=https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kff-synth-fp-oo/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a design pattern solution to the problem of simultaneously extending an expression-oriented programming language and its tool-set.  They dubbed it the "expressivity problem" because they thought programming language designers could use the problem to demonstrate the expressive power of their creations. For PLT, the problem had shown up in the construction of DrScheme, now [[Racket_(programming_language)#DrRacket_IDE|DrRacket]], and they solved it&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;
{{cite web 
| title= Modular object-oriented programming with units and mixins
| url= http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=289432
}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a rediscovery of mixins.&lt;ref name="FKF"&gt;
{{cite web 
| title= Classes and Mixins
| url= http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=268946.268961&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=342311756&amp;CFTOKEN=62002692
}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid using a programming language problem in a paper about programming languages, Krishnamurthi et al. used an old geometry programming problem to explain their pattern-oriented solution. In conversations with Felleisen and Krishnamurthi after the ECOOP presentation, Wadler understood the PL-centric nature of the problem and he pointed out that Krishnamurthi's solution used a cast to circumvent Java's type system. The discussion continued on the types mailing list, where Corky Cartwright (Rice) and Kim Bruce (Williams) showed how type systems for OO languages might eliminate this cast. In response Wadler formulated his essay and stated the challenge, "whether a language can solve the expression problem is a salient indicator of its capacity for expression." The label "expression problem" puns on  expression = "how much can your language express" and expression =
"the terms you are trying to represent are language expressions".

Others co-discovered variants of the expression problem around the same time as Rice University's PLT, in particular Thomas Kühne&lt;ref name="K"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Kühne|first=Thomas|title=A Functional Pattern System for Object-Oriented Design|year=1999|publisher=Verlag Dr. Kovac|location=Darmstadt|isbn=3-86064-770-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his dissertation, and Smaragdakis and Batory&lt;ref name=SB&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Smaragdakis|first=Yannis|author2=Don Batory|title=Implementing Reusable Object-Oriented Components|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=1998|volume=1445}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a parallel ECOOP 98 article.

Some follow-up work used the expression problem to showcase the power of programming language designs.&lt;ref name="Scala0"&gt;
{{cite web
| title=Extensible Algebraic Datatypes with Defaults 
| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.28.6778
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scala"&gt;
{{cite web
| title=Independently extensible solutions to the expression problem 
| url =http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.107.4449
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression problem is also a fundamental problem in multi-dimensional Software Product Line design and in particular as an application or special case of [[FOSD Program Cubes#Applications|FOSD Program Cubes]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Solutions==
There are various solutions to the expression problem. Each solution varies in the amount of code a user must write to implement them, and the language features they require.

'''General Relativity''' is a popular textbook on [[Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] written by [[Robert Wald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Relativity|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo5952261.html|website=[[University of Chicago Press]]|publisher=press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
It was published by the University of Chicago in 1984. The book, a tome of almost 500 pages, covers many aspects of the General Theory of Relativity. It is divided into two parts, the second of which covers more advanced topics such as causal structure, spinors and quantum effects. The book uses the [[Abstract index notation]] for [[tensors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23185">The '''information audit''' ('''IA''') extends the concept of auditing holistically from a traditional scope of accounting and finance to the organisational [[information management]] system. [[Information]] is representative of a [[resource]] which requires effective [[management]] and this led to the development of interest in the use of an IA.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;Ellis et al, 1993, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior the 1990s and the [[Methodology|methodologies]] of  [[#Orna|Orna]], [[#Henczel|Henczel]], Wood, [[#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]], IA approaches and methodologies focused mainly upon an identification of formal information resources (IR). Later approaches included an organisational analysis and the mapping of the [[information flow]]. This gave context to [[analysis]] within an organisation's information systems and a [[Holism|holistic]] view of their IR and as such could contribute to the development of the information [[systems architecture]] (ISA). In recent years the IA has been overlooked in favour of the [[Software development methodology|systems development]] process which can be less expensive than the IA, yet more heavily technically focused, [[project]] specific (not holistic) and does not favour the top-down [[analysis]] of the IA.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2007, p.161.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
A definition for the Information Audit cannot be universally agreed-upon amongst scholars, however the definition offered by [http://www.aslib.co.uk ASLIB] received positive support from a few notable scholars including [[Information audit#Henczel|Henczel]], [[Information audit#Orna|Orna]] and Wood; “(the IA is a) systematic examination of information use, resources and flows, with a [[Verification and validation|verification]] by reference to both people and existing documents, in order to establish the extent to which they are contributing to an organisation’s objectives” &lt;ref name="Aslib"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2007, p.159&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, the term [[audit]] itself implies a counting,&lt;ref name="Henczel"&gt;Henczel, 2000, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; the IA being much the same yet it counts IR and analyses how they are used and how critical they are to the success of a given task.

== Role and scope of an IA ==
In much the same way as the IA is difficult to define, it can be utilised in a range of [[Context (language use)|context]]s by the information professional,&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood, 2004, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  from complying with [[freedom of information legislation]] to identifying any existing [[Gap analysis|gaps]], duplications, bottlenecks or other inefficiencies in information flows and to understand how existing channels can be used for knowledge transfer &lt;ref name="Henczel2"&gt;Henczel, 2000, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] developed upon their 1998 examination of the IA process by outlining a summary of its main [[Goal|objective]]s:

*To identify an organisation’s information resource
*To identify an organisation’s information needs

Furthermore, [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] went on to state that the IA also had to meet the following additional objectives:

*To identify the cost/benefits of information resources
*To identify the opportunities to use the information resources for strategic competitive advantage
*To integrate IT investment with strategic business initiatives
*To identify information flow and processes
*To develop an integrated information strategy and/or policy
*To create an awareness of the importance of Information Resource Management (IRM)
*To monitor/evaluate conformance to information related standards, legislations, policy and guidelines.

== Methodology evolution ==

=== Overview ===
In 1976 Riley first published a definition of IA as a way of analysing IR based on a cost-benefit model. Since Riley, scholars have outlined further developed methodologies. Henderson took a cost-benefit approach hoping to draw focus from manpower-costing to [[Data storage device|information storage]] and acquisition which he felt was being overlooked. In 1985 Gillman focused upon identifying the relationships which existed between various components in order to map them to one another. Neither Henderson nor Gillman’s methods offered alternative approaches beyond the existing organisational frameworks. Quinn took a hybrid-approach combining Gillman and Henderson’s methods to identify the purpose of existing IR and to position them within the organisation, as did Worlock. The differentiator between Quinn and Worlock lay in Worlock’s consideration of solutions outside of the current organisational structure. These approaches had thus far had paid little attention to the needs of the user or in making structured recommendations for the development of a corporate information strategy.&lt;ref name="Ellis2"&gt;Ellis et al, 1993, p.137.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, here follows a brief outline and overall comparison of four published strategic approaches in order that one might understand the development of the IA methodology.

===Burk and Horton===
In 1988 Burk and Horton developed InfoMap, the first IA methodology developed for widespread use. It aimed to discover, map and evaluate the IR within an organisation using a 4-stage process:
*Survey staff using [[questionnaire]]s/[[interview]]s
*Measure the IR against cost/value
*Analyse resources
*Synthesise the findings and map the strengths and weaknesses of the IR against the objectives of the organisation.
Although the method [[Inventory|inventoried]] all IR (and therefore met standard [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm ISO] 1779) this bottom-up approach revealed limited analysis of the organisation holistically and the steps were not explicit enough.&lt;ref name="Buchanan2"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2008, p.4. Paper on methodology selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orna===
Orna produced a top-down methodology in contrast to [[Information audit#Burk and Horton|Burk and Horton]], placing emphasis upon the importance of organisational analysis and aimed to assist in the production of a corporate information policy. Initially the method had just 4-stages, this later revised to a 10-stage process which included pre and post-audit stages as below:
*Conduct a preliminary review to confirm operational/strategic direction
*Gain support/resource from management
*Gain commitment from the other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (staff)
*Planning including the [[project]], team, tools and techniques
*Identify the IR, information flow and produce a cost/value assessment
*Interpret findings based upon current versus desired state
*Produce a report to present findings
*Implement recommendations
*Monitor effects of change
*Repeat the IA
Orna’s method introduced the need for a cyclical IA to be put in place in order for the IR to be continually tracked and improvements made regularly. Again this method was criticised for lacking some practical application and in 2004 Orna revised the methodology once more to try to rectify this problem &lt;ref name="Buchanan2" /&gt;

===Buchanan and Gibb ===
In 1998, similarly to [[Information audit#Orna|Orna's]] earlier publication, Buchanan and Gibb took a top-down approach, drawing techniques from established management disciplines to provide a framework and a level of familiarity for information professionals. This set of techniques was a notable contribution to IA methodologies &lt;ref name="Buchanan2" /&gt; and understood the need to be flexible for each organisation. Theirs was a 5-stage process:
*Promote benefits of the IA through seminars/surveys/[[Chief executive officer|CEO]] letter for cooperation
*Identify the mission objectives of the organisation, define environment ([[PEST analysis|PEST]]), map information flow and examine organisation culture.
*Analyse and formulate action plan for problem areas, flow diagrams and a report of findings and recommendations
*Account for cost of IR and related services using Activity Based Costing ([[Activity-based costing|ABC]]) and Output Based Specification (OBS).
*Synthesise the whole process in final audit report and provide an information strategy (strategic direction) in relation to the organisation’s [[mission statement]].
This was the introduction of a new approach to costing the IR and had an integrated strategic direction, yet the scholars admitted that this method may be impractical for smaller organisations.&lt;ref name="Buchanan3"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 1998, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henczel===
Henczel’s methodology drew upon the strengths of [[Information audit#Orna|Orna]] and [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] to produce a 7-stage process:&lt;ref name="Buchanan6"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2008, pp.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Planning and submission of business case for approval to proceed
*Data collection and development of an IR database and population through survey techniques
*Structured data analysis
*Data evaluation, interpretation and formulation of recommendations
*Communication of recommendations through a report
*Implementing recommendations through a devised programme
*The IA as a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]-establishment of a cyclical process
Focus was made once more on the strategic direction of the organisation conducting the IA.  Furthermore, Henczel made examination into the use of the IA as a first-step in the development of a [[Information audit#Information Audit and the development of a Knowledge Audit|knowledge audit]] or knowledge management strategy &lt;ref name="Henczel5"&gt;Henczel, 2001, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; as discussed in the later section.

==Case studies==
Scholars and information professionals have since tested the above methodologies with varied results. An early case study produced by Soy and Bustelo in a Spanish [[financial institution]] in 1999 aimed to identify the use of information resources for [[qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[quantitative data]] analysis due to the rapid expansion of the organisation within a six-year period.&lt;ref name="Soy"&gt;Soy &amp; Bustelo, 1999, p.30. Part I of the study.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the methodology was not explicitly credited to any of the above-mentioned scholars, it did follow a strategic (post 1990's) IA process including gaining support from management, the use of questionnaires for data collection, analysis and evaluation of the data, identification and mapping of the IR, cost-analysis and outlining recommendations to assist with the establishment of an Information policy. In addition the IA report suggested that the process would need to be continual (cyclical as [[Information audit#Orna|Orna]], [[Information audit#Henczel|Henczel]] and [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] suggest). Conclusions of this case-study stated that the IA allowed a greater understanding of the basis of the organisation's information policy and [[personnel]] and identified technical problems within the organisation. In addition this method was believed to be cost and time-effective to the two auditors involved and the organisation used the results of the IA as a [[marketing]] tool to promote services users may not have been previously aware of.&lt;ref name="Soy2"&gt;Soy &amp; Bustelo, 1999, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a paper testing the 'viability' of [[Information audit#Henczel|Henczel's]] methodology  was published in the ''South African Journal of Library and Information Science.'' The purpose of the study was to determine the financial position of an organisation (Statistics SA) through a  report of financial statements made over a period of time. The IA was used as part of the [[Holism|holistic]] audit process and was limited to just the methodology of [[Information audit#Henczel|Henczel]] after consideration and dismissal of others.&lt;ref name="Soy3"&gt;Raliphada &amp; Botha, 2006, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt; The IA followed the seven-stage process as outlined [[Information audit#Henczel|above]] (planning, data collection, analysis, evaluation, communicating and implementing recommendations and the IA as a continuum) and the objectives were outlined as identifying the needs of respondents, identifying information sources and their significance, mapping information flow and identifying gaps in available sources. &lt;br /&gt;Upon conducting the IA several recommendations were made including making print the preferred format for information and that the library should be responsible for missing information and address this in a development plan. Finally, advantages and disadvantages to this [[methodology]] were identified. It was reported that the methodology was flexible in its application as it provided a framework which could be adjusted to suit the needs of an organisation, that the scope could be easily expanded to cover more objectives and that guidelines for data collection and analysis were varied. Secondly it was felt that the methodology was cost-effective as it made use of existing resources (email, workspace etc.). The greatest disadvantage reported was that the process was 'cumbersome' and that the researcher became weary with the repetitive nature of the planning process. &lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the study reported that [[Information audit#Henczel|Henczel's]] methodology had allowed the information professionals to effectively manage the information management activities of the public sector organisation in question.&lt;ref name="Soy4"&gt;Raliphada &amp; Botha, 2006, p.248.&lt;/ref&gt; Positively it had been viewed as cost-effective and depicted a snapshot of the use of information in the organisation, yet it had been a 'cumbersome' process with some repetition within the planning phases.

In 2007 [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] published another examination of the IA to include case studies of their own methodology, an element they had been previously criticised for not including.&lt;ref name="Buchanan7"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2008, p.150.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first case study conducted in a university research department, the objectives were to identify how effective information flow within the department was and what improvement would be required. The methodology was tailored to the study by removing the costing stage and establishing a workgroup to assist at various stages of the process, whilst all other stages remained as per the [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|above]] (promote, identify, analyse  and synthesise). Recommendations were made by the auditor towards greater synergy and systems analysis and it was found that staff immediately recognised the value of this output.&lt;ref name="Buchanan8"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2008, pp.151-155.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The second case study dealt with a public body within the arts sector with the objectives to streamline evaluation and approval processes and to improve communications between [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. The sponsor also specified that a list of recommendations were required to be incorporated into a [[change management]] programme and this aligns well to [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb's]] strategic directional method. The IA methodology was scoped to be primarily resource-orientated and once again the costing stage was removed.  All else remained as per the [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|original methodology]]. The IA output recommended that for all organisational processes a shift was needed from process-modelling to capturing process descriptions.&lt;ref name="Buchanan9"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2008, pp.155-156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main strengths identified in [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb's]] methodology were its logical structuring of stages, provision of tools, inclusive process for stakeholders, adequate illustration of the role of effective [[Information management|Information Management]] within an organisation and much like [[Information audit#Henczel|Henczel]], the flexibility to tailor the methodology. Their scope matrix was also proven to be useful. A weakness lay still in the limited instructional depth which affected the qualitative data analysis. As regards the applicability of this method, it should be noted that the costing stage was not included in either study and that this might suggest it is not required in an information audit. Further study is required to produce a more conclusive analysis of the methodology.&lt;ref name="Buchanan10"&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2008, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology comparisons and conclusions==
The conclusions of the case studies suggested that further development into the methodologies for IA was needed to include further explanation of tools, techniques, templates, interview preparation, process modelling and analysis. In 2008 [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] drew comparisons from the published IA methodologies of the following scholars: [[Information audit#Burk and Horton|Burk and Horton]], [[Information audit#Orna|Orna]], [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] and [[Information audit#Henczel|Henczel]], with the purpose of understanding if a hybrid-methodology could be produced as a ‘baseline’ from all four.

The hybrid-methodology was formed of seven stages and is as below:
*Set-up including project plan, communications, [[Testimonial|endorsements]], business case and preliminary analysis
*Review strategic (internal and external) analysis and organisational (cultural) analysis
*Survey information users, identify IR and map the information flow
*Account the cost/business benefits and value of IR
*Analyse all findings
*Report on the production and dissemination of recommendations
*Guide towards development of an organisation’s information management policy/strategy, establish the IA as a cyclical process, monitor and control.
However, [[Information audit#Buchanan and Gibb|Buchanan and Gibb]] themselves declared that this should not be considered a conclusive comparison as it is high-level "and does not assess how well each methodology addresses each stage."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan &amp; Gibb, 2008, p.6. Paper on methodology selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of a knowledge audit==
In more recent years, since the development of the top-down methodologies, IA have been used as a basis for the development of a knowledge audit, which itself in-turn contributes to an organisation's knowledge management strategy. Once complete, the IA allows examination into where knowledge is produced, where there may be need for further input and where knowledge transfer is required. Furthermore, this analysis develops strategy for knowledge capture, access, storage, dissemination and validation.&lt;ref name="Henczel4"&gt;Henczel, 2000, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissimilarly to the IA, the objectives of the knowledge audit are to identify any people-related issues which impact the ways in which knowledge is created, transferred and shared and to identify where knowledge could be captured, where it is required and then determine how best to undertake a knowledge transfer as "unlike information, knowledge is bound to a person, organisation or community."&lt;ref name="Mearns"&gt;Mearns &amp; Du Toit, 2008, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between the knowledge and information audit methodologies can be noted however, as questionnaires, the development of an inventory, analysis of flow and a data map&lt;ref name="Burnett"&gt;Burnett et al, 2004, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; are here again used.  The importance of this audit therefore is to understand the strategic significance of an organisation's knowledge assets to ensure management is focused to those areas it is specifically required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">[[File:Lace of tree branch (Pavlovsk park).jpg|thumb|Lateral Shoots/Branches are often numerous on larger vegetation such as certain trees or bushes.]]
Commonly called a [[branch]]. It develops from [[axillary bud]]s on the stem's surface, extending laterally from the [[Plant stem|plant's stem]].

A lateral shoot is a part of a plant's [[shoot]] system.
==Importance to photosynthesis==
As a plant grows it requires more energy, it also is required to out-compete nearby plants for this energy. One of the ways a plant can compete for this energy is to increase its height, another is to increase its overall surface area. That is to say, the more lateral shoots a plant develops, the more foliage the plant can support increases how much [[photosynthesis]] the plant can perform as it allows for more area for the plant to uptake [[carbon dioxide]] as well as sunlight. 

==Genes, transcription factors, and growth==

Through testing with [[Arabidopsis thaliana]] (A plant considered a [[model organism]] for plant genetic studies) genes including MAX1 and MAX2 have been found to affect growth of lateral shoots. [[Gene knockout]]s of these genes cause abnormal proliferation of the plants affected, implying they are used for repressing said growth in [[wild type]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stirnberg|first=Petra|last2=Sande|first2=Karin van de|last3=Leyser|first3=H. M. Ottoline|date=2002-03-01|title=MAX1 and MAX2 control shoot lateral branching in Arabidopsis|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/129/5/1131|journal=Development|language=en|volume=129|issue=5|pages=1131–1141|issn=0950-1991|pmid=11874909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another set of experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana testing genes in the [[plant hormone]] [[florigen]], two genes FT and TSF (which are abbreviations for Flowering Locus T, and Twin Sister of FT) when knocked out, appear to affect lateral shoot in a negative fashion. These [[mutant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s cause slower growth and improper formation of lateral shoots, which could also mean that lateral shoots are important to florigen's function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiraoka|first=Kazuhisa|last2=Yamaguchi|first2=Ayako|last3=Abe|first3=Mitsutomo|last4=Araki|first4=Takashi|title=The Florigen Genes FT and TSF Modulate Lateral Shoot Outgrowth in Arabidopsis thaliana|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcs168|journal=Plant and Cell Physiology|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=352–368|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcs168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with general growth there are also [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]] that directly effect the production of additional lateral shoots like the TCP family (also known as Teosinte branched 1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor) which are plant specific proteins that suppress lateral shoot branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800854-6.00016-6|title=The Role of TCP Transcription Factors in Shaping Flower Structure, Leaf Morphology, and Plant Architecture|last=Nicolas|first=Michael|last2=Cubas|first2=Pilar|pages=249–267|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-800854-6.00016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the TCP family has been found to be partially responsible for inhibiting the cell's [[Growth hormone–releasing hormone|Growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRF)]] which means it also inhibits cell proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0070-2153(10)91007-7|title=Control of Tissue and Organ Growth in Plants|last=Breuninger|first=Holger|last2=Lenhard|first2=Michael|pages=185–220|doi=10.1016/s0070-2153(10)91007-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings''' are annual, scientific conferences held in [[Lindau]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] since 1951. Their aim is to bring together [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]] and young scientists to foster scientific exchange between different generations and cultures.

== Purpose ==
Every Lindau Meeting consists of a multitude of scientific sessions like plenary lectures and panel discussions as well as a variety of networking and social events. The meetings assume a unique position amongst international scientific conferences: With 30-40 Nobel laureates attending they are the largest congregation of Nobel laureates (apart from the Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies in Stockholm) in the world. The meetings are not centered on the presentation of research results, but instead, their main goals are the exchange of ideas and the discussion of topics globally relevant to all scientists. The Nobel laureates do not receive any kind of payment for their participation and are free to choose the topics of their presentations. More than 300 are members of the meetings’ ''Founders Assembly.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lindau-nobel.org/founders-assembly/|title=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Website|last=|first=|date=|website=Founders Assembly|publisher=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billed by the organising Council for the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings as their ‘Mission Education’, the aim of the meetings is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between Nobel laureates and young scientists but also among the international scientific community and the general public. The opportunity for participants to form international networks of scientists is also regarded as a prime objective by the organisers. The meetings’ leitmotif is ''‘Educate, Inspire, Connect.’''

==History==

After [[World War II]], Germany was disconnected from the international scientific community due to the ramifications of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. During this time, hardly any scientific conferences of high value took place in Germany.

=== Initial Idea &amp; Establishment ===
The two physicians [[Franz Karl Hein]] and [[Gustav Parade]] from Lindau, a small town located on the Bavarian shore of [[Lake Constance]], conceived the idea of organising a scientific meeting to bring together German researchers and physicians with Nobel laureates. They convinced [[Lennart Bernadotte|Count Lennart Bernadotte af Wisborg]], a member of the [[Swedish Royal Family]] and proprietor of nearby [[Mainau|Mainau Island]], to call upon his good connections to Sweden’s [[Nobel Committee]] to support the undertaking. The first meeting, subsequently held in 1951, was dedicated to the fields of medicine and physiology and was attended by seven Nobel laureates, among them [[Adolf Butenandt]] and [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]]. After the success of the initial meeting, the scientific scope was broadened to include the other two natural science Nobel Prize disciplines chemistry and physics. Thus, a mode of annually alternating disciplines for the meetings was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science at First Hand|last=Burmester|first=Ralph|publisher=Deutsches Museum Bonn|year=2015|isbn=|location=Bonn, Germany|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1954 – 2000 ===
In 1954, the Council for the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings was founded and henceforth established as the organising committee of the meetings. Count Lennart was appointed as first president of the Council. Also in 1954, the concept of inviting students and young scientists to the meetings was introduced. This step was seen as a measure to add additional value for society to the meetings. Among the young scientists participating that year were also students from [[East Germany|Eastern Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science at First Hand|last=Burmester|first=Ralph|publisher=Deutsches Museum Bonn|year=2015|isbn=|location=Bonn, Germany|pages=42ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While originally conceived by Hein and Parade as a European meeting of scientists, the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings slowly but steadily became more international. In the beginnings, only students from Lake Constance’s bordering countries Germany, Switzerland, and Austria attended but year after year new nations began to send representatives. Since 2000, each Lindau Meeting is attended by young scientists from between 80 and 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science at First Hand|last=Burmester|first=Ralph|publisher=Deutsches Museum Bonn|year=2015|isbn=|location=Bonn, Germany|pages=72/73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Count Bernadotte resigned from his position as president of the Council due to health reasons and his wife, [[Sonja Bernadotte|Countess Sonja Bernadotte af Wisborg]]''',''' took over.

=== 2000 – 2008 ===
Shortly before the turn of the millennium, the future of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings was endangered due to financial uncertainties. In order to counter this negative development, Countess Sonja Bernadotte expanded the Council and added experts from charitable foundations and public affairs as well as representatives of Stockholm’s [[Nobel Foundation]] to the committee.

Two main goals of Countess Sonja Bernadotte’s aegis were the further internationalisation of the meetings and to improve its public image, both domestically and internationally.

On the occasion of the 50th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in the year 2000, the establishment of the ''Foundation Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings'' was officially announced. Its main goal since then has been to secure the funding of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings. Upon its creation, over 40 Nobel Laureates joined the Founders Assembly of the foundation and support the continuance of the conference both morally and financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science at First Hand|last=Burmester|first=Ralph|publisher=Deutsches Museum Bonn|year=2015|isbn=|location=Bonn, Germany|pages=86ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 50th Lindau Meeting in 2000 was also the first interdisciplinary meeting that united Nobel laureates and students from all three natural science disciplines (physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine) of the Nobel Prize.

=== 2008 –Today ===
When Countess Sonja Bernadotte died in October 2008, her daughter, Countess Bettina Bernadotte, was elected President of the Council. She continued her mother’s course and worked on establishing further cooperation with research institutions around the world but also introduced educational aspects for society in general to the Lindau Meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science at First Hand|last=Burmester|first=Ralph|publisher=Deutsches Museum Bonn|year=2015|isbn=|location=Bonn, Germany|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==

Ever since their inception, the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings have taken place in the small Bavarian town of Lindau on the shores of Lake Constance. The city’s center is located on an island in the lake that is connected to the mainland via bridges.

=== Meeting Cycle ===
The meetings focus alternately on physiology and medicine, physics, and chemistry – the three natural science Nobel Prize disciplines. An interdisciplinary meeting revolving around all three natural sciences is held every five years. In addition, the Lindau Meeting on Economic Sciences is held every three years with recipients of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]].

=== Scientific Programme ===
The following session types are currently part of the scientific programme of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings:
* ''Lectures:'' Traditional presentations held by the Nobel laureates who are free to choose their topics.
* ''Discussion Sessions:'' In the afternoon, following their lectures, the Nobel Laureates engage in intimate discussion sessions with the young scientists and answer their questions.
* ''Master Classes:'' Upon previous application, selected young scientists are given the chance to present their own research in front of an audience and receive feedback from the Nobel laureates.
* ''Panel Discussions:'' Several Nobel laureates and other meeting participants gather for a panel discussion and debate current issues in science. The audience has the opportunity to direct questions to the panelists.
* ''Science Breakfasts:'' Early-morning, panel discussions hosted by partner institutions and supporters of the meetings. 
[[File:Schloss Mainau.jpg|thumb|Mainau Castle on [[Mainau|Mainau Island]], property of the [[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte]] family and the traditional venue of the last day of any Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.]]

=== Social Programme ===
The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings also host several events with social functions like dinners, BBQs and cultural events. Since 2010 one evening of each meeting is dedicated to an alternating partner country. The partner countries so far have been [[India]] (2009), the [[European Union]] (2010), the [[United States|United States of America]] (2011), [[Singapore]] (2012), [[South Korea]] (2013), [[Australia]] (2014), [[France]] (2015) and [[Austria]] (2016).

=== Boat Trip to Mainau Island ===
The last day of each meeting includes both scientific and social programme features with a boat trip to [[Mainau|Mainau Island]]. The visit to the island owned by the [[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte family]] is designed both to let the meetings culminate in a final panel discussion on a topic combining science and society and to give the young scientists the opportunity to visit Mainau – the ‘flower island’.

==Participants==
Meetings dedicated to a single discipline are usually attended by about 30-40 Nobel laureates and 500-600 young scientists representing around 80 different countries. In addition, several special guests of honour from politics, industry and academia as well as international journalists attend the meetings.

=== Application Process ===
Young scientists who want to participate need to pass a multi-stage application process. The application is open to undergraduates, PhD students and post-doc researchers under the age of 35 who are at the top of their class and do not hold a permanent position yet. Young scientists can only participate once in a Lindau meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lindau-repository.org/permadocs/LNLM_SelectionCriteria_NAPERS.pdf|title=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Website|last=|first=|date=|website=Selection Criteria 2016|publisher=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outstanding guests ===
Over the years many noteworthy guests of honour have visited the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings: Among them former German Presidents [[Roman Herzog]], [[Johannes Rau]], [[Horst Köhler]] and [[Christian Wulff]]. Current German President [[Joachim Gauck]] gave the opening address at the interdisciplinary meeting in 2015 and German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] held the opening speech at the 2014 meeting on economic sciences.
Further notable guests include philanthropist and software entrepreneur [[Bill Gates]], former President of the [[European Commission]] [[José Manuel Barroso]] and the President of Singapore [[Tony Tan]].

==Organisation==
The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings are made up of two legal bodies: The ''Council'' and the ''Foundation''. While the council’s responsibility is to put together the scientific programme and to organise the meetings via its executive secretariat, the foundation’s task is to maintain the financial stability of the meetings and to ensure ongoing financial support.

=== Academic Partners ===
The Council sustains a global network of academic partner institutions that range from national science academies, to universities, foundations and government ministries. Applications for meeting participation need to be addressed to the academic partners, who in turn nominate the best young scientists for the meetings.

=== Funding ===
The Lindau meetings are funded by both public resources and private donations. The costs and funding of each meeting are made public in the annual report of the respective year. Private supporters are listed on the organisation’s website and various other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/publications|title=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Website|last=|first=|date=|website=Publications|publisher=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Ever since their beginnings, the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings have aimed to facilitate an atmosphere in which scientists could assume more responsibility towards society. Therefore, several political appeals have been issued in Lindau over the years.

The impact these meetings have had on the careers of the roughly 30,000 young scientists, who have participated, is hard to quantify but profound: As one of the supporters put it: "You see the deep inspiration and motivation for the years to come in the eyes of the young researchers when they leave Lindau.”

=== Global Networks ===
The meetings provide many networking opportunities for young scientists who in turn form global networks that often yield research collaborations or knowledge transfer not limited by borders or differing cultures.

=== Mainau Declarations ===
''See article: [[Mainau Declaration]]''

In 1955 at the 5th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting German physics Nobel laureates Max Born and Otto Hahn initiated the ‘Mainau Declaration against the Use of Nuclear Weapons’ that was meant to urge world leaders to abstain from using nuclear weapons. It was initially signed by 18 Nobel laureates attending the meeting, but the number of signatories grew to 52 within a year.

Fifty years later, at the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in the summer of 2015, a second Mainau Declaration was issued, this time making a statement on the need to combat climate change. The declaration was initially signed by 36 attending Nobel laureates who were later joined by 35 additional colleagues.

== Mediatheque ==
Due to the fact that the Lindau Meetings have such a long tradition and history, a digital and open to the public archive was established. It currently contains about 400 hours of video footage of lectures held by Nobel laureates during the Lindau meetings. In addition, photos, animated educational films and interactive content like virtual tours of Nobel laureates’ laboratories and an interactive map showing the career paths of the laureates are also available.
The mediatheque is also used as an educational tool providing topic dossiers and introductions to certain scientific fields that can be used by teachers and professors.

== Other Projects &amp; Outreach ==
The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings are also actively engaging in outreach projects and science communication based on their ''‘Mission Education’'' leitmotif. Among these projects are the photo exhibition ‘Sketches of Science’ by German photographer [[Volker Steger]] being exhibited world-wide and a permanent exhibition on the history of the meetings in Lindau’s city museum. Additional educational content is provided through close collaborations with media partners such as the [[Nature Publishing Group]].

The [[geography]] of northwestern [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]], Canada is dominated by [[volcano]]es of the [[Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province]] formed due to continental [[rift]]ing of the [[North American Plate]]. It is the most active volcanic region in Canada.&lt;ref name="CJI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stikine volcanic belt |work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes |publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]] |date=2008-02-13 |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_stikine_e.php |accessdate=2009-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608031644/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_stikine_e.php |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the volcanoes are notable for their eruptions, for instance, [[Tseax Cone]] for its catastrophic eruption estimated to have occurred in the 18th century which was responsible for the death of at least 2,000&amp;nbsp;[[Nisga'a]] people from poisonous [[volcanic gas]]es,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tseax Cone|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-03-10|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=tsx_crc_107|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mount Edziza volcanic complex]] for at least 20 eruptions throughout the past 10,000&amp;nbsp;years, and [[The Volcano (British Columbia)|The Volcano]] (also known as [[Lava Fork]] volcano) for the most recent eruption in Canada during 1904.&lt;ref name="ASB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lava Forks Provincial Park|publisher=[[BC Parks]]|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/lava_forks/|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province lie in Canada while a very small portion of the volcanic province lies in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]].

Volcanoes of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are a part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. The largest and most persistent volcanoes are the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and [[Level Mountain]] in northwestern British Columbia which have had volcanic activity for millions of years. In the past 7.5 million years, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex has had five phases of volcanic activity while Level Mountain north of Edziza has had three phases of volcanic activity in the past 14.9 million years.&lt;ref name="JK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Charles A. |author2=Kienle, Jürgen |chapter=|pages=109, 114, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125|title=Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada|year=2001|edition=|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge]], [[England]]|isbn=978-0-521-43811-7|oclc= 27910629}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|1000|km2|abbr=on}} Mount Edziza volcanic complex has been made into a [[provincial park]] since 1972 to protect its volcanic landscape. The 102 Northern Cordilleran volcanoes in the list below are grouped into their political regions in north-south order.

==Scope==
There is no single standard definition for a volcano. It can be defined from individual vents, volcanic edifices or volcanic fields. Interior of ancient volcanoes may have been eroded, creating a new subsurface [[magma chamber]] as a separate volcano. Many contemporary volcanoes rise as young [[parasitic cone]]s from flank vents or at a central [[Volcanic crater|crater]]. Some volcanoes are grouped into one volcano name, for instance, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, although individual vents are named by local people. The status of a volcano, either [[active volcano|active]], [[dormant volcano|dormant]] or [[extinct volcano|extinct]], cannot be defined precisely. An indication of a volcano is determined by either its historical records, [[potassium-argon dating]], [[radiocarbon dating]], or [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] activities.

The primary source of the list below is taken from the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] website, compiled by the Earth Sciences Sector of [[Natural Resources Canada]], in which Northern Cordilleran volcanoes in the past 66.4&amp;nbsp;million years are listed.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes |publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]] |date=2008-02-13 |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_stikine_e.php |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608031644/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_stikine_e.php |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geological Survey of Canada use a catalogue of volcanoes grouped by volcano fields, lava fields and mountain ranges.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The Geological Survey of Canada list is the most complete list of volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, but work of understanding the frequency and eruption characteristics at volcanoes in Canada is a slow process.&lt;ref name="HEPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Volcanoes |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2007-09-05 |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/naturalhazards/volcanoes/1 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217001048/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/naturalhazards/volcanoes/1 |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because most of Canada's dormant and potentially active volcanoes are located in isolated jagged regions, very few scientists study Canadian volcanoes and the provision of money in the Canadian government is limited.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; Because of these issues, scientists that study Canada's volcanoes have a basic understanding of Canada's volcanic heritage and how it might impact people in the future.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; Therefore, instead of using the dates of recorded eruptions, the Geological Survey of Canada mostly uses geological epochs for estimating when a volcano last erupted. Geological epoches include the [[Cenozoic]] (66.4 million years ago to present)&lt;ref&gt;

===British Columbia===
Over half of the Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are located in northwestern British Columbia. This portion is where the most recent eruptions in Canada and of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province have occurred, including the catastrophic 18th century eruption of [[Tseax Cone]] and the 1904 eruption of [[The Volcano (British Columbia)|The Volcano]].&lt;ref name="ASB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Global Volcanism Program|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/region.cfm?rnum=1200-19-|title=Tseax River Cone|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Cordilleran volcanoes of British Columbia comprises [[shield volcano]]es, [[stratovolcano]]es, [[subglacial volcano]]es, [[lava dome]]s and a large number of small [[cinder cone]]s and associated lava plains.&lt;ref name="JK"/&gt; The Northern Cordilleran volcanoes of northwestern British Columbia are disposed along short, northerly trending segments which are unmistakably involved with north-trending rift structures including synvolcanic [[graben]]s and grabens with one major fault line along only one of the boundaries ([[half-grabens]]) similar to those associated with the [[East African Rift]], which extends from the [[Afar Triple Junction]] southward across eastern Africa.&lt;ref name="JK"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2656">There are generally four classes of software used to support the [[Six Sigma]] process improvement protocol:
*Analysis tools, which are used to perform statistical or process analysis;
*Program management tools, used to manage and track a corporation's entire Six Sigma program;
*DMAIC and Lean online project collaboration tools for local and global teams;
*Data Collection tools that feed information directly into the analysis tools and significantly reduce the time spent gathering data.

'''Léon Marc Herminie Fairmaire''' (29 June 1820 – 1 April 1906) was a [[France|French]] [[entomologist]].

A specialist in [[Coleoptera]] he assembled an immense collection comparable with that of [[Pierre François Marie Auguste Dejean]] (1780-1845). This is in the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]]. Fairmaire wrote 450 scientific papers and other publications relating to Coleoptera ([[Species:Leon Fairmaire|partial list of papers in Wikispecies]]). He also worked on [[Hemiptera]].

'''Mental operations''' are operations that affect [[mind|mental]] contents. Initially, operations of [[reasoning]] have been the object of [[logic]] alone. [[Pierre Janet]] was one of the first to use the concept in psychology. Mental operations have been investigated at a developmental level by [[Jean Piaget]], and from a [[psychometric]] perspective by [[J. P. Guilford]]. There is also a cognitive approach to the subject, as well as a systems view of it.

==History==
Since [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], mental operations, more precisely, formal operations of [[reasoning]] have been the object of [[logic]].&lt;ref name="hobh"&gt;[[Hobhouse, LT]] (2005). ''The Theory of Knowledge: A Contribution to Some Problems of Logic and Metaphysics'', Kessinger Publishing, p. 223. {{ISBN|978-1-4179-6206-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, Pierre Janet described two types of mental operations:&lt;ref name="vals"&gt;Valsiner, Jaan; van der Veer, René (2000). ''The social mind: construction of the idea.'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 103-106. {{ISBN|0-521-58973-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* reality operations - mental operations under the control of logic;
* disinterested operations - escaping the control of reason.
Jean Piaget differentiated a [[preoperational stage]], and operational stages of [[cognitive development]], on the basis of presence of mental operations as an [[adaptation]] tool.&lt;ref name="gins"&gt;Ginsburg, Herbert; Opper, Sylvia (1979). ''Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Development.'' Prentice Hall, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-13-675140-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect model described up to 180 different intellectual abilities organized along three dimensions—Operations, Content, and Products.&lt;ref name="guilf"&gt;Guilford, Joy Paul (1980). Some changes in the structure of intellect model. ''Educational and Psychological Measurement'' '''48''': 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical view==
According to 
most logicians, the three primary mental operations are [[apprehension (understanding)]], [[judgement]], and [[inference]].&lt;ref name="hobh" /&gt;

===Apprehension===
Apprehension is the mental operation by which an idea is formed in the mind. If you were to think of a sunset or a baseball, the action of forming that picture in your mind is apprehension. The verbal expression of apprehension is called a term.

===Judgment===
Judgment is the mental operation by which we predicate something of a subject. Were you to think, "That sunset is beautiful" or "Baseball is the all-American sport" is to make a judgment. The verbal expression of judgment is the statement (or proposition).

===Inference===
Inference (or reasoning) is the mental operation by which we draw conclusions from other information. If you were to think, "I like to look at that sunset, because I enjoy beautiful things, and that sunset is beautiful" you would be reasoning. The verbal expression of reasoning is the logical argument.&lt;ref name="hobh"/&gt;

==Developmental view==
[[Jean Piaget]] identifies several mental operations of the [[concrete operational stage]] of [[cognitive development]]:&lt;ref name="gins"/&gt;
[[File:Piagetian operations.jpg|thumb|400px|Mental operations according to Jean Piaget.]]
*''Seriation''—the ability to sort objects in an order according to size, shape, or any other characteristic. For example, if given different-shaded objects they may make a color gradient.
*''Transitivity''—The ability to recognize logical relationships among elements in a serial order, and perform 'transitive inferences' (for example, If A is taller than B, and B is taller than C, then A must be taller than C).
*''Classification''—the ability to name and identify sets of objects according to appearance, size or other characteristic, including the idea that one set of objects can include another.
*''Decentering''—where the child takes into account multiple aspects of a problem to solve it. For example, the child will no longer perceive an exceptionally wide but short cup to contain less than a normally-wide, taller cup.
*''Reversibility''—the child understands that numbers or objects can be changed, then returned to their original state. For this reason, a child will be able to rapidly determine that if 4+4 equals t, t−4 will equal 4, the original quantity.
*''Conservation''—understanding that quantity, length or number of items is unrelated to the arrangement or appearance of the object or items.

Piaget also describes a [[formal operational stage]], with formal operations of [[abstract thinking]]: hypothesizing, [[hypothesis]] testing, and [[deductive reasoning|deduction]].&lt;ref name="gins" /&gt;

==Psychometric view==
[[File:Guilford model.jpg|thumb|400px|Guilford's Structure of Intellect.]]
According to [[J. P. Guilford]]'s Structure of Intellect (SI) theory, an individual's performance on intelligence tests can be traced back to the underlying mental abilities or factors of intelligence. SI theory comprises multiple intellectual abilities organized along three dimensions—Operations, Content, and Products.&lt;ref name="guil"&gt;Guilford, Joy Paul (1950). Creativity. ''American Psychologist'' '''5''' (9): 444-454.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Operations dimension''

SI includes six operations or general intellectual processes:
Cognition—The ability to understand, comprehend, discover, and become aware of information.
Memory recording—The ability to encode information.
Memory retention—The ability to recall information.
Divergent production—The ability to generate multiple solutions to a problem; creativity.
Convergent production—The ability to deduce a single solution to a problem; rule-following or problem-solving.
Evaluation—The ability to judge whether or not information is accurate, consistent, or valid.

*''Content dimension''

SI includes five broad areas of information to which the human intellect applies the six operations:
Visual—Information perceived through seeing.
Auditory—Information perceived through hearing.
Kinesthetic -through actions
Symbolic—Information perceived as symbols or signs that have no meaning by themselves; e.g., Arabic numerals or the letters of an alphabet.
Semantic—Information perceived in words or sentences, whether oral, written, or silently in one's mind.
Behavioral—Information perceived as acts of people.

*''Product dimension''

As the name suggests, this dimension contains results of applying particular operations to specific contents. The SI model includes six products, in increasing complexity:
Units—Single items of knowledge.
Classes—Sets of units sharing common attributes.
Relations—Units linked as opposites or in associations, sequences, or analogies.
Systems—Multiple relations interrelated to comprise structures or networks.
Transformations—Changes, perspectives, conversions, or mutations to knowledge.
Implications—Predictions, inferences, consequences, or anticipations of knowledge.

Therefore, according to Guilford there are 6 x 5 x 6 = 180 intellectual abilities or factors. Each ability stands for a particular operation in a particular content area and results in a specific product, such as Comprehension of Figural Units or Evaluation of Semantic Implications.&lt;ref name="guilf" /&gt;

==Cognitive view==
[[File:Cognitive operations.jpg|thumb|350px|Mental operations: cognitive view.]]
Following on the footsteps of Silvio Ceccato,&lt;ref name="cec"&gt;Ceccato, Silvio (1961). ''Linguistic Analysis and Programming for Mechanical Translation''. G. Feltrinelli.&lt;/ref&gt; Giulio Benedetti describes several types of mental operations:&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Benedetti, Giulio (2005).  [http://www.mind-consciousness-language.com/Elementary%20mental%20operations.pdf "Basic mental operations which make up mental categories"] (PDF). ''www.mind-consciousness-language.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
* attentional focalization - focusing [[attention]] on something;
* attentional discarding - stopping our attention on an object;
* spatial basic operating scheme (attentional movement) - passing attention from one part to another of the attentional field;
* operation of [[Representation (psychology)|representation]] - evoking a mental image;
* operation of [[Comparison (mathematics)|comparison]];
* operations of [[memory]];
* temporal basic operating scheme - variation of attentional focalization.

==Systems view==
[[File:Systemic operations.jpg|thumb|350px|Mental operations: systems view.]]
Taking into account all [[mental process]]es, the following types of mental operations have been described:&lt;ref name="sys"&gt;Tapu, Codrin Stefan (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WKZoAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en Hypostatic Personality: Psychopathology of Doing and Being Made]''. Premier, pp. 18-19. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[cognitive]] operations - production and verbalization of images and thoughts;
* practical operations, pertaining to [[executive functions]];
* [[affective]] operations - affective [[evaluation]] of the world and [[Self (psychology)|self]];
* expressive operations ([[emotional expression]]);
* perceptual-motor operations (e.g., [[eye-hand coordination]]);
* regulative operations - verbalization of needs, motives and feelings, and [[self-control]].

The '''Millennium Technology Prize''' ({{lang-fi|Millennium-teknologiapalkinto}}) is one of the world's largest technology prizes.&lt;ref name="nytimes-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hs-2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Shuji+Nakamura+inventor+of+bright+LED+lights+gets+Millennium+Prize/1135220318889|title=Shuji Nakamura, inventor of bright LED lights, gets Millennium Prize|work=Helsingin Sanomat|quote=It is the world’s largest prize for technology|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded once every two years by [[Technology Academy Finland]], an independent fund established by Finnish industry and the [[Finland|Finnish state]] in partnership. The prize is presented by the [[President of Finland]]. The Millennium Technology Prize is Finland's tribute to innovations for a better life. The aims of the prize are to promote technological research and Finland as a high-tech Nordic welfare state. The prize was inaugurated in 2004.&lt;ref name="bbc-2006"/&gt;

==The Prize==
The idea of the prize came originally from the Finnish academician Pekka Jauho, with American real estate investor and philanthropist [[Arthur J Collingsworth]] encouraging its establishment.&lt;ref name="finnf"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081118194043/http://www.finnfacts.com/english/main/actualities/millennium2.htm Millennium, Finnfacts.com] (Archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize celebrates innovations that have a favorable and sustainable impact on quality of life and well-being of people.&lt;ref name="prize-introduction"/&gt; The innovations also must have been applied in practice and stimulate further research and development.&lt;ref name="prize-introduction"/&gt; Compared to the [[Nobel Prize]] the Millennium Technology Prize is a technology award, whereas the Nobel Prize is a science award.&lt;ref name="bbc-2006"/&gt; Furthermore, the Nobel Prize is awarded for basic research, but the Millennium Technology Prize may be given to a recently conceived innovation which is still being developed. The Millennium Technology Prize is not intended as a reward for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref name="prize-introduction"/&gt;

The Millennium Technology Prize is awarded by Technology Academy Finland (formerly Millennium Prize Foundation and Finnish Technology Award Foundation), established in 2002 by eight Finnish organisations supporting technological development and innovation. The prize sum is 1 million [[euro]]s (~US$1.3 million).&lt;ref name="prize-introduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taf.fi/en/millennium-technology-prize/|title=Millennium Technology Prize|publisher=Technology Academy Finland|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Millennium Technology Prize is awarded every second year&lt;ref name="prize-introduction"/&gt; and is presented by the [[president of Finland]].&lt;ref name="yle-2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/big_data_pioneer_wins_millennium_technology_prize/7181629|title=‘Big data’ pioneer wins Millennium Technology Prize|publisher=Yle Uutiset|date=April 9, 2014|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Millennium Technology Prize is the world's largest technology award.&lt;ref name="nytimes-2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/14/technology/14web.html|title=Pioneer Who Kept the Web Free Honored With a Technology Prize|last=Shannon|first=Victoria|work=The New York Times|quote=Mr. Berners-Lee will finally be recognized, with the award of the world's largest technology prize, the Millennium Technology Prize from the Finnish Technology Award Foundation|date=June 14, 2004|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5328446.stm|title=Top prize for 'light' inventor|publisher=BBC News|quote=The Millennium Technology Prize is the world's largest technology award, equivalent to the Nobel Prizes for science|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hs-2006"/&gt; The predecessor to the Millennium Prize was the Walter Ahlström prize.

Universities, research institutes, national scientific and engineering academies and high-tech companies around the world are eligible to nominate individuals or groups for the award, excluding military technology.&lt;ref name="prize-introduction"/&gt; In accordance with the rules of the Technology Academy Finland, a proposal concerning the winner of the Millennium Technology Prize is made to the board of the foundation by the eight-member international selection committee, and the final decision on the prize winner is made by the board.

'''Minimum bias''' (MB) events are [[inelastic collision|inelastic]] events selected by a [[collider|high-energy experiment]]'s loose (minimum bias) trigger with as little bias as possible. MB events can include both non-diffractive and [[Regge theory|diffractive]] processes although the precise definition and relative contributions vary among experiments and analyses. Quite often the beam hadrons ooze through each other and fall apart without any hard collisions occurring in the event. MB event is not the same as the underlying event (UE), which consists of particles accompanying a hard scattering. The density of particles in the UE in [[Jet (particle physics)|jet]] events is found to be roughly a factor of two greater than that in MB in proton-proton collisions at the [[Tevatron]] and the [[LHC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Rick Field|date=2011|title=Min-Bias and the Underlying Event at the LHC|arxiv = 1110.5530|bibcode=2011arXiv1110.5530F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preadolescence''', also known as '''pre-teen''' or '''tween''', is a stage of [[Human development (biology)|human development]] following [[early childhood]] and preceding [[adolescence]].&lt;ref name="NOAD2"&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary. 2nd Edition. 2005. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly ends with the beginning of [[puberty]],&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Frank D. Cox, Kevin Demmitt|title=Human Intimacy: Marriage, the Family, and Its Meaning|isbn=1285633040|page=76|year=2013|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pccWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be defined as ending with the start of the teenage years.&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty and adolescence|publisher=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=July 22, 2014|archivedate=April 3, 2013|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403080324/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dictionary definitions generally designate it as 10–13 years.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/preadolescence?qsrc=2446 Dictionary.com --&gt; Definition of preadolescence] (Based on the Random House Dictionary, 2009) Retrieved on July 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and [[anxiety|anxieties]].

==Prepubescence, puberty and range==
{{See also|Tanner scale}}
Being prepubescent is not the same thing as being preadolescent. Instead, ''prepubescent'' (and sometimes ''[[child]]'') is a term for boys and girls who have not developed [[secondary sex characteristic]]s,&lt;ref name="Manske"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Manske|title=Fundamental Orthopedic Management for the Physical Therapist Assistant|isbn=0323291376|page=110|year=2015|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NszECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''preadolescent'' is generally defined as those ranging from age 10 to 13 years.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hatfield"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy T. Hatfield|title=Broadribb's Introductory Pediatric Nursing|isbn=0781777062|page=588|year=2007|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMsWpXjnWWYC&amp;pg=PA588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preadolescence may also be defined as the period from 9 to 14 years.&lt;ref name="Corsaro"&gt;William A. Corsaro, ''The Sociology of Childhood'' (2005) p. 191 and p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Donald C. Freeman, ''Essays in Modern Stylistics'' (1981) p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; 

The point at which a child becomes an adolescent is defined by the onset of [[puberty]] or the beginning of the teenage stage.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nlm.nih.gov/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manske"/&gt; Adolescence is also viewed as ending with the teenage stage.&lt;ref name=nlm.nih.gov/&gt; However, in some individuals (particularly females), puberty begins in the preadolescence years.&lt;ref name="Breinbauer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cecilia Breinbauer|title=Youth: Choices and Change : Promoting Healthy Behaviors in Adolescents|isbn=927511594X|page=303|year=2005|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Pan American Health Organization]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goqyfO8KkFIC&amp;pg=PT303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather L. Appelbaum|title=Abnormal Female Puberty: A Clinical Casebook|isbn=331927225X|pages=23–24|year=2016|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9j7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate that the onset of puberty has been one year earlier with each generation since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ryan et al., ''Juvenile Sexual Offending'' (2010) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also distinguish middle childhood and preadolescence&lt;ref name=" Corsaro"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– middle childhood from approximately 5–8 years, as opposed to the time children are generally considered to reach preadolescence.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt; There is no exact agreement as to when preadolescence starts and ends, and research by Gesell et al. suggests that "chronological time...is by no means identical with developmental time"&amp;nbsp;– the duration of the "inner" stages of growth'&amp;nbsp;– or with physiological time.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gesell et al., ''Youth'' (London 1956) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

While known as ''preadolescent'' in psychology, the terms ''preteen'', ''preteenager'' or ''tween ''are common in everyday use. A preteen or preteenager&lt;ref name="NOAD2" /&gt; is a person 12 and under.&lt;ref name="MWCD11" /&gt; Generally, the term is restricted to those close to reaching age 12,&lt;ref name="NOAD2" /&gt; especially age 11.&lt;ref name="AHDEL4" /&gt; ''Tween'' is an American [[neologism]] and [[marketing]] term&lt;ref name="FamiliarWithTweens"&gt;[http://tourismintelligence.ca/author/maithe/ Levasseur, Maïthé] (2007-02-09).

Retrieved on 2007-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''preteen'', which is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''between'' and ''teen''.&lt;ref name="MWCD11"&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. Eleventh Edition. 2003. Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHDEL4"&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Fourth Edition. 2000. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; People within this age range are variously described as tweens, preadolescents{{self-contradictory inline}}, tweenies, preteens, pubescents, [[junior highers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krafft|first1=Bob|title=Coping With Your Feelings: Five Active Meetings for Your Junior Highers|date=1994|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tweenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornburg|first1=Hershel|title=Preadolescent development|date=1974|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hjarvard|first1=Stif Prof|title=The Mediatization of Culture and Society|date=2013|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''tween'' was previously used in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1954 novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to refer to [[hobbits]] in their twenties: "''tweens'' as hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and the coming of age at thirty-three."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. ''The Lord of the Rings; The Fellowship of the Ring '' Copyright 1965 by J.R.R Tolkien; Ballantine Books, A Division of Random House Inc. SBN 345-24032-4-150&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, the word is really either a shortened version of ''between'' or a portmanteau of ''teen'' and ''twenty'', and in either case has no connection to teens, preteens or the American marketing niche.

{{wide image|Child development stages.svg|1100px|Approximate outline of development periods in [[child development]]. Preadolescence and preteen marked at center left.}}

==Psychological development==
{{Main article|Developmental psychology}}

Of the 'two major [[socialization|socializing]] agents in children's lives: the family environment...and formal educational institutions,'&lt;ref&gt;Dafna Lemish, ''Children and Television'' (Oxford 2007) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; it is 'the family in its function a primary socializer of the child'&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; that predominates in the first five years of life: middle childhood by contrast is characterized by 'a child's readiness for school...being self-assured and interested; knowing what kind of behavior is expected...being able to wait, to follow directions, and getting along with other children.'&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Preadolescent children in fact have a different view of the world from younger children in many significant ways. Typically, theirs is a more realistic view of life than the intense, fantasy-oriented world of earliest childhood. Preadolescents have more mature, sensible, realistic thoughts and actions: 'the most "sensible" stage of development...the child is a much ''less emotional being'' now.'&lt;ref&gt;Mavis Klein, ''Okay Parenting'' (1991) p. 13 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; They will often have developed a sense of ' ''intentionality''. The wish and capacity to have an impact, and to act upon that with persistence';&lt;ref&gt;daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; and will have a more developed sense of looking into the future and seeing effects of their actions (as opposed to early childhood where children often do not worry about their future). This can include more realistic [[job (role)|job]] expectations ("I want to be an engineer when I grow up", as opposed to "I want to be a wizard"). Middle children generally show more investment 'in ''control over external reality'' through the acquisition of knowledge and competence':&lt;ref&gt;Mavis Klein, ''Okay Parenting'' (1991) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; where they do have worries, these may be more a [[fear]] of [[kidnapping]]s, [[rape]]s, and scary media events, as opposed to fantasy things (e.g., witches, [[monster]]s, ghosts).

Preadolescents may well view human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s differently (e.g. they may notice the flawed, human side of [[authority]] figures). Alongside that, they may begin to develop a sense of [[self (psychology)|self]]-[[Identity (social science)|identity]], and to have increased feelings of [[independence]]: 'may feel an individual, no longer "just one of the family."'&lt;ref&gt;E. Fenwick/T. Smith, ''Adolescence'' (London 1993) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; A different view on [[morality]] can emerge; and the middle child will also show more ''cooperativeness''. The ability to balance one's own needs with those of others in group activities'.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Many preadolescents will often start to question their home life and surroundings around this time and they may also start to form opinions that may differ from their upbringing in regards to issues such as [[politics]], [[religion]], [[sexuality]], and [[gender roles]].

Greater responsibility within the family can also appear, as middle children become responsible for younger siblings and relatives, as with [[babysitting]]; while preadolescents may start caring about what they look like and what they are wearing.

Middle children often begin to experience [[infatuation]], [[limerence]], [[puppy love]], or [[love]] itself, though arguably at least with 'girls carrying out all the romantic interest....preadolescent girls' romantic pursuits often seem to be more aggressive than affectionate.'&lt;ref&gt;Giselle Liza Anatol, ''Reading Harry Potter: Critical Essays'' (2003) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Preadolescents may still suffer [[tantrum]]s at the age of 13, sometimes leading to rash decisions regarding risky actions. Such decisions may in rare cases result in grave situations such as accidental death.&lt;ref name="dailymail 2008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180677267.html | title=Boy aged 13 killed himself over Wii ban | work=[[Daily Mail]] | date=June 27, 2008 | accessdate=January 9, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home from home===
Where development has been optimal, preadolescents 'come to school for something to be added to their lives; they want to learn lessons...which can lead to their eventually working in a job like their parents.'&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; When earlier developmental stages have gone astray, however, then, on the principle that 'if you miss a stage, you can always go through it later,'&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; some middle children 'come to school for another purpose...[not] to learn but to find a home from home...a stable emotional situation in which they can exercise their own emotional liability, a group of which they can gradually become a part.'&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce===
Children at the threshold of adolescence in the nine-to-twelve-year-old group&lt;ref&gt;Ann Charlton, ''Caught in the Middle'' (London 2003) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; would seem to have particular vulnerabilities to parental separation. Among such problems were the very 'eagerness of these youngsters to be co-opted into the parental battling; their willingness to take sides...and the intense, compassionate, caretaking relations which led these youngsters to attempt to rescue a distressed parent often to their own detriment.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Preadolescents may well be more exposed to [[popular culture]] than younger children and have interests based on internet trends, television shows and movies (no longer just cartoons), fashion, technology, music and social media. Preadolescents generally prefer certain [[brand]]s, and are a heavily targeted market of many advertisers. Their tendency to buy brand-name items may be due to a desire to fit in, although the desire is not as strong as it is with teenagers.

Some scholars suggest that 'pre-adolescents&amp;nbsp;... reported frequent encounters with sexual material in the media, valued the information received from it, and used it as a learning resource&amp;nbsp;... and evaluated such content through what they perceived to be sexual morality.'&lt;ref&gt;Dafna Lemish, ''Children and Television'' (Oxford 2007) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other research has suggested that sexual media influences on preadolescent and adolescent sexual behavior is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L., &amp; Monahan, K.  2010.  Developmental Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] called this stage the ''[[latency stage|latency]]'' period to indicate that sexual feelings and interest went underground&amp;nbsp;... the ''feelings'' that create that first "eternal triangle" with the parents fade, and free energy for other interests and activities.'&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 271 and p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H. Erikson]] confirmed that 'violent drives are normally dormant&amp;nbsp;... a lull before the storm of [[puberty]], when all the earlier drives re-emerge in a new combination, to be brought under the dominance of genitality.'&lt;ref&gt;Erik H Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Latency period children can then direct more of their energy into asexual pursuits such as school, athletics, and same-sex friendships: middle childhood especially is marked by 'the importance of school, teams, classes, friends, gangs and organised activities&amp;nbsp;... and the adults who run those.'&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Miller, ''Understanding Your 8 year old'' (London 1993) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, recent research suggests that "most children do not cease sexual development, interest and behavior" at this time: rather, they "cease to share their interest with adults and are less frequently observed."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, ''Juvenile'' p. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; Because "they've learned the rules&amp;nbsp;... [they] fit in with the grown-up's ''belief'' that they're not interested. But the curiosity about it all continues, and there's quite a lot of experimenting going on between them.'&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, ''Families'' p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other pursuits

But while the eight-year-old still has "years to wait until puberty, adolescence and finally sexual maturity&amp;nbsp;... a sort of lull before puberty arrives,'&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 23 and p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; with preadolescence proper (9–12), and the move forward from middle childhood, what have been called 'the introspective and social concerns of the prepubescent'&lt;ref&gt;Michell Landsberg, ''The World of Children's Books'' (London 1988) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; tend to come more to the fore. Clearly "few experiences are more prominent in the lives of preadolescents than the onset of puberty";&lt;ref&gt;Anatol, ''Potter'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; so that "at eleven or twelve you're just reaching the end of a long period during which change was steady and incremental":&lt;ref&gt;Francis Spufford, ''The Child that Books Built'' (London 2002) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's latency years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">'''Project Hindsight''' was a [[retrospective]] study conducted to determine the effectiveness of several [[Aftermath of World War II|post-World War II]] weapons research projects.&lt;ref name="highbeam1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kostoff | first = Ronald N. | title = Research impact assessment | work = [[Business Economics (journal)|Business Economics]] | date = 1 January 1993 | accessdate = 17 March 2013 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13832964.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was conducted by the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering, a sub-agency of the [[United States Department of Defense]].  

==Parameters==
The study ran from 1963 to 1967&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=370196 | title=Hindsight and the Real World of Science Policy | author=Kreilkamp, Karl | journal=Science Studies |date=January 1971  | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=43–66 | doi=10.1177/030631277100100104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final report was published in October 1969 and released to the public in September 1970.&lt;ref name="dtic1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0495905 | title=Project HINDSIGHT - Summary | publisher=[[Defense Technical Information Center]] | date=October 1969 | accessdate=17 March  2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project had two goals: the first was to identify R&amp;D management productivity and the second was to measure the overall [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] of using recently developed weapon systems compared to their predecessors that were in use 10 to 20 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Sherwin"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Project hindsight. A Defense Department study of the utility of research. |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.156.3782.1571 |pmid=6025113 | date=23 June 1967 |volume=156 |pages=1571–7 |author=Sherwin CW, Isenson RS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
Of all 'events' studied by Project Hindsight, 91% were technological, and only 9% were classed as science. Within the latter category 8.7% were applied science, whereas only 0.3%, or two 'events', were due to basic or undirected science.&lt;ref name="Sherwin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Greenberg, 'Hindsight: DOD Study Examines Return on Investment in Research' ''Science'' 154 (November 18, 1966): 872-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip H. Abelson, 'Project Hindsight,' ''Science'' 154 (December 2, 1966): 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
As [[science and technology studies]] scholar Edwin Layton observed in 1971, 'the publication of these results produced a spate of indignant letters to the editors of ''Science''.' He noted that many of these letters missed the point, and instead should focus on the interaction between science and technology rather than attempting to demonstrate that fundamental scientific research influences technology development more than Project Hindsight had suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Layton, 'Mirror-Image Twins: The Communities of Science and Technology in 19th-Century America', ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 12, No. 4 (Oct., 1971), pp. 562-580&lt;/ref&gt; 

He also called attention to a subsequent study, ''Technology in Retrospect and Critical Events in Science'' (TRACES), which 'revealed cases in which mission-oriented research or development effort elicited later nonmission research, which often was found to be crucial to the ultimate innovation'.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute, ''Technology in Retrospect and Critical Events in Science'', 2 vols. (n. p. [Chicago], 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17469">The '''Publius Enigma''' is an [[List of Internet phenomena|Internet phenomenon]] and an [[unsolved problem]] that began with cryptic messages posted by a user identifying only as "Publius" to the unmoderated [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] alt.music.pink-floyd through the [[Penet remailer]], a now defunct anonymous information exchange service.&lt;ref name="publiuspost"&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.pink-floyd/msg/ad004f9c62301d19?dmode=source|title=&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T H E  M E S S A G E &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;|author=Publius|date=11 Jun 1994|newsgroup=alt.music.pink-floyd|message-id=165304Z11061994@anon.penet.fi|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The messenger proposed a [[riddle]] in connection with the 1994 [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[The Division Bell]]'', promising that the answer would lead to a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DB133DF935A25751C0A963958260|title=The Pop Life|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=16 February 1995|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pink Floyd's lead singer, [[David Gilmour]], denied any involvement&lt;ref name="dotmusicwebchat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/david-gilmour-interviews/january-2002-dotmusic-webchat.html |title=Brain Damage - January 2002 - Dotmusic webchat |publisher=braindamage.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while album artist [[Storm Thorgerson]] was bemused by the ordeal.&lt;ref name= "Storm Thorgerson Interview"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Thorgerson|first=Storm|subjectlink=Storm Thorgerson|interviewer=Sean Heisler|title=Phonecall on the Enigma|url=http://folk.uio.no/ericsp/report9.htm|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to drummer [[Nick Mason]], [[EMI Records]] were ultimately responsible.&lt;ref name="pinkfloydz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkfloydz.com/insideouttour.htm|title=Nick Mason's Inside Out Tour|work=A Fleeting Glimpse|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear if the enigma involves a genuinely solvable [[puzzle]] as part of an early Internet-based contest or was a convoluted [[hoax]] engineered in part by the band's management.&lt;ref name="brickman"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Brickman|first=Marc|subjectlink=Marc Brickman|interviewer=Sean Heisler|title=Marc Brickman 12/5/95: Phonecall on the Enigma|url=http://folk.uio.no/ericsp/report5.htm|date=5 December 1995|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321001123/http://folk.uio.no/ericsp/report5.htm|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the mystery continues to attract a small but loyal [[cult]] following.

==History==
During the 1994 [[Division Bell Tour|Division Bell World Tour]], Columbia Records flew a {{convert|194|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[airship]] named ''The Division Belle'' between Pink Floyd concert locations.&lt;ref name="pfairshipmystery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/miscellaneous-articles/the-great-pink-floyd-airship-mystery.html|title=The Great Pink Floyd Airship Mystery|last=Johns|first=Matt|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia Electronic Press Kit was released to the media, along with the Promo Spots Video consisting of interviews with band members, footage of the airship in action, and a segment which contained the following:

{{quote|"A spokesperson for Pink Floyd has issued the following statement: You have spotted the Pink Floyd Airship. Do not be alarmed. Pink Floyd have sent their airship to North America to deliver a message. The Pink Floyd Airship is headed towards a destination where all will be explained upon arrival. Pink Floyd will communicate."}}

On 11 June 1994, a user of the anonymous [[Penet remailer]] service posted the following message to the [[Usenet newsgroup]] [news://alt.music.pink-floyd alt.music.pink-floyd]:&lt;ref name="publiuspost" /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T H E  M E S S A G E &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

My friends,

You have heard the message Pink Floyd has delivered,
but have you listened?

Perhaps I can be your guide, but I will not solve the enigma for you.

All of you must open your minds and communicate with each other,
as this is the only way the answers can be revealed.

I may help you, but only if obstacles arise.

Listen.

Read.

Think.

Communicate.

If I don't promise you the answers would you go.

     Publius
&lt;/pre&gt;

A follow-up clarified the challenge:&lt;ref name="guitarworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/artint/37.htm|title=Guitar World Jan. Vol. 17, No 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
AS SOME OF YOU HAVE SUSPECTED, "The Division Bell" is not like its
predecessors. Although all great music is subject to multiple
interpretations, in this case there is a central purpose and a
designed solution. For the ingenious person (or group of persons)
who recognizes this - and where this information points to - a
unique prize has been secreted.

    How and Where?
    The Division Bell
    Listen again
    Look again
    As your thoughts will steer you
    Leading the blind while I stared out the steel
      in your eyes.
    Lyrics, artwork and music will take you there
&lt;/pre&gt;

In order to refute the ensuing scepticism, Publius agreed to provide proof of his authenticity. On 16 July 1994 he delivered a prediction:&lt;ref name="paradigme"&gt;[http://www.paradigme.ch/pages/enigma/pages/history.html The Publius Enigma: In a "nut" shell]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
To validate the trust of those who believe, as well as
to reconcile the doubt of others, I have gone to great
lengths to plan the following display of communication:

Monday, July 18
East Rutherford, New Jersey
Approximately 10:30pm

Flashing white lights.

There is an enigma.

Trust.
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the night of 18 July 1994, patterns in the lights on the front of the stage at the Pink Floyd [[Pink Floyd live performances|concert]] in East Rutherford momentarily spelled out the words ENIGMA PUBLIUS.&lt;ref name="enigmapubliuslights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~dekhtyar/enigma.html|title=T*H*E E*N*I*G*M*A I*M*A*G*E*S|last=Dekhtyar|first=Alexander|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enigmapubliusvideo"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhQRCcpjObs video of ENIGMA PUBLIUS in flashing white lights].&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1996, the Penet remailer service was shut down by its creator over legal threats posed to the guaranteed anonymity of its users.&lt;ref name="remailershutdown"&gt;[https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Anonymity/960830_penet_closure.announce]&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, contact to the newsgroup through the associated Publius account ceased. Subsequent Publius-style posts from other addresses have led to differing opinions over the status of the enigma and whether or not it has ever been solved.&lt;ref name="pinkfloydco"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611202458/http://www.pinkfloyd-co.com/unt/unt_enigma/unt_enigma.html A Brief History of the Publius Enigma (Archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if the original poster remained or remains active, or if the enigma has been abandoned by those responsible for starting it.

==Official statements==
During a 2002 [[webchat]], David Gilmour responded to a question about the subject.

{{quote|"Lynne from Floydian_Hemptress asks: Would you agree that the instrumental, Let's Get Metaphysical, on your About Face cd, was a precurser to the later alleged phenomenon, known as Pink Floyd's Publius Enigma? [sic]

David Gilmour: No it had nothing to do with it, there was no connection. The second thing was some silly record company thing that they thought up to puzzle people with."&lt;ref name="dotmusicwebchat"/&gt;}}

In April 2005, during a book signing of his biographical work ''[[Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd]]'', Nick Mason also asserted that the Publius Enigma had been instigated by the record company rather than the band, and that the prize for solving the riddle would have been a "crop of trees planted in a clear cut area of forest or something to that effect".&lt;ref name="pinkfloydz"/&gt;

{{quote|"That was a ploy done by EMI. They had a man working for them who adored puzzles. He was working for EMI and suggested that a puzzle be created that could be followed on the Web. The prize was never given out. To this day it remains unresolved."&lt;ref name="pinkfloydz"/&gt;}}

The comments made by Mason corroborate parts of a previous interview by Sean Heisler with [[Marc Brickman]], Pink Floyd's lighting and production designer and the man apparently responsible for putting the "ENIGMA PUBLIUS" message in the lights at the New Jersey concert.

{{quote|"...I think it really came and out of though - it came out of some guy of Washington DC, that used to be with the CIA or FBI or something that was in the encryption game. He decided he wanted to do some kind of album cover, and he started talking to Steve O'Rourke, and I think what happened was Steve O'Rourke had in his brilliant mind that he was going to try something on the internet because he had been listening to me. And he got this guy, cause if you notice a lot of this stuff can't be traced where it comes from. And I know that Dave for one thing didn't even know how to sign on."&lt;ref name="brickman"/&gt;}}

Brickman later expressed regret regarding his comments:

{{quote|"i know that sean and the other people were persistent, so i spoke, but really regret saying the things i said in the interview..

if the enigma got people to talk and discuss then it is a good thing,
but honestly, i had no part of the matter..."&lt;ref name="brickman2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinagreenelvis.com/enigmapublius/communicate/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=8 |title=ENIGMA PUBLIUS • View topic - Marc Brickman |publisher=www.chinagreenelvis.com |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204047/http://www.chinagreenelvis.com/enigmapublius/communicate/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=8 |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Author [[Douglas Adams]], who was responsible for giving ''The Division Bell'' its title,&lt;ref name="douglasadamsfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.fan.douglas-adams/3JDyQebQNVo/7wM14ilMePwJ |title=alt.fan.douglas-adams FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also questioned during an Internet chat session in 2001.

{{quote|"Question-from James Heaver &gt; Is the publius enigma real?

Douglas Adams &gt; It has nothing to do with me - I can't say anything about it."&lt;ref name="douglasadamschat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hhgttf/chat_transcript.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 Hitchhikker's Guide to the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Uncle Custard==
The Pink Floyd magazine ''Brain Damage ''had a Q&amp;A section reserved for a correspondent known only as "Uncle Custard". The name (phonetically similar to "Uncool Car Stud") was created by Glen Povey,&lt;ref name="mattjohns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinagreenelvis.com/enigmapublius/communicate/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203702/http://www.chinagreenelvis.com/enigmapublius/communicate/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=11 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-08-12 |title=ENIGMA PUBLIUS • View topic - Matt Johns |publisher=enigmapublius.chinagreenelvis.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently an allusion to Nick Mason's passion for [[auto racing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentenths.co.uk/nick-mason/|title=Nick Mason|publisher=Ten Tenths|accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue No.34 of the magazine contains the following:

{{quote|Q: Who is Publius Enigma, what is the meaning of it all, and what is the treasure to be had?

A: (Uncle Custard) As the Infamous Q has emphasized, 'you humans are so limited'. This is a project for all those out there with higher IQ's, it does require a mastery of diverse languages, along with a lot of spare time. Now get with it...the lights were brighter, the meaning is worn inside out, the bell has tolled and the surrogate band is coming back to life. The answer lies, non-linearly, within the paradox of the theme of The Division Bell -- communication breakdown. (Hint: Watch the Learning to Fly video!) It may also involve an anomaly in the time-space continuum. There is an obvious solution and you do not need to be a Floyd historian to figure it out! Winners will receive official entry into the Mensa Society and some dry ice to cool down all those neural pathways in your brain. It is important to note that neither I nor anyone involved with this zine will enter into any correspondence on this topic. It's a puzzle for you, devised by the one who loves you enough to drive you mad. Besides, I'm much too busy creating crop circles and executing think-tank projects for the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|last=Heisler|first=Sean|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/alt.music.pink-floyd/oa7jIV1IVQU/htDdFzqVsH0J|title=Publius: Reality-Duality-Spirituality 2|newsgroup=alt.music.pink-floyd|message-id=sheisler-1906962147390001@dial17.radiks.net|date=20 June 1996|accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the answers given by Uncle Custard over the years have all been written by several different people affiliated with the magazine, this particular response has been attributed to former editor and final publisher of the printed version of ''Brain Damage'', Jeff Jensen.&lt;ref name="mattjohns"/&gt; The accuracy of the content of this answer and under what authority (if any) Jensen had to produce it remains unclear.

==In the media==
Possible references to the Publius Enigma can be found in various Pink Floyd releases:
*''[[Pulse (1995 film)|P*U*L*S*E]]'', a DVD of the 20 October 1994 televised concert at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]], London, contains footage of the word "ENIGMA" being projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage during the song "[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)]]". The DVD's authoring company, Das Boot, uses an [[enigma machine]] as their logo, which can be seen at the end of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/03/dusting-em-off-pink-floyd-division-bell |title=Dusting ‘Em Off: Pink Floyd – Division Bell |publisher=consequenceofsound.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the artwork for the [[MiniDisc]] release of ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'', the word "PUBLIUS" has been inserted into the photo of the man in the rye field.

In [[general relativity]], a '''Roman ring''' (proposed by [[Matt Visser]] in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Visser, Matt| title= Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | arxiv=gr-qc/9702043 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212 | volume=55 | journal=Physical Review D | pages=5212–5214| bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.5212V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named after the '''Roman arch'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a concept proposed by [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]] and [[Kip Thorne]] in 1988 and named after physicist [[Tom Roman]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Morris M.

==Examples==
For example, an [[Earth]]–[[Moon]] wormhole whose far end is 0.5 seconds in the "[[Relativity of simultaneity|past]]" will not violate [[causality]], since [[information]] sent to the far end via the wormhole and back through normal space will still arrive back on Earth (-0.5 + 1) = 0.5 seconds after it was transmitted; but an additional wormhole in the other direction will allow information to arrive back on Earth 1 second ''before'' it was transmitted (time travel), although it is believed that relative time between the transmission of the information in one wormhole throat and out the other end in a ring structure will remain the same, because light wouldn't have violated local proper time, because the distance traveled by the information would take time, either by going the long way or through the wormhole.

==Chronology protection==
[[Semiclassical gravity|Semiclassical]] approaches to incorporating quantum effects into general relativity seem to show that the [[chronology protection conjecture]] postulated by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] fails to prevent the formation of such rings, although Matt Visser feels that there are reasons to think the semiclassical approach is unreliable here, and that a full theory of [[quantum gravity]] will likely uphold chronology protection.

'''Social orphan''' is a term in various foreign languages, such as Ukrainian,&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/16/marcel-theroux-ukraines-street-children | title=Marcel Theroux: life with Ukraine's street children | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=May 17, 2012 | location=London | date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; denoting that a child has no adults looking after it, even though one or more parents are still alive. Usually the parents are alcoholics, drug abusers, or simply are not interested in the child. It is therefore not the same as an [[orphan]], who has no living parents.

The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] has brought many countries to reassess their mandate to care for children inside their borders thus bringing to light various new ways of thinking about international [[child care]].{{fact|date=May 2012}}

==Populations==
In a study of [[Honduras]] it was found that 54.3% of children commonly identified as "orphans" were actually social orphans.&lt;ref&gt;Tercer informe periódico sobre la situación en el cumplimiento de la Convención de los Derechos del Niño {{cite web |url=http://www.ihnfa.hn/Documentos/Informe_sobre_cumplimiento_de_la_CDN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611052315/http://www.ihnfa.hn/Documentos/Informe_sobre_cumplimiento_de_la_CDN.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }} (Honduras Data)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sylva paper 1662.jpg|right|thumb| ''Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty's Dominions,'' title page of the first edition (1664).]]
'''''Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty's Dominions''''' by the English writer [[John Evelyn]] was first presented in 1662 as a paper to the [[Royal Society]]. It was published as a book two years later in 1664, and is recognised as one of the most influential texts on [[forestry]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Evelyn]], ''Sylva, Or A Discourse of Forest Trees ... with an Essay on the Life and Works of the Author by John Nisbet'', Fourth Edition (1706), reprinted London: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1908, V1, p. lxv; online edn, March 2007 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20778/20778-h/20778-h.htm], accessed 29 Dec 2012. This source (John Nisbet) states: "There can be no doubt that John Evelyn, both during his own lifetime and throughout the two centuries which have elapsed since his death in 1706, has exerted more individual influence, through his charming ''Sylva'', ... than can be ascribed to any other individual." Nisbet adds that "Evelyn was by no means the first [author] who wrote on [forestry]. That honour belongs to Master [[Anthony Fitzherbert|Fitzherbert]], whose ''Boke of Husbandrie'' was published in 1534" (V1, p. lxvi).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uniquely effective in manipulating the [[convex hull]] of [[polytope|polytopic forms]], and, hence, has revealed and proved the fact that convex hull manipulation is a necessary and crucial step in achieving optimal solutions and decreasing conservativeness&lt;ref&gt;A.Szollosi, and Baranyi, P.

Thus, although it is a transformation in a mathematical sense, it has established a conceptually new direction in control theory and has laid the ground for further new approaches towards optimality.

;TP-tool MATLAB toolbox:

A free [[MATLAB]] implementation of the TP model transformation can be downloaded at [https://nas.mistems.hu:5001/sharing/6IIIPxmtf] or an old version of the toolbox is available at  [[MATLAB]] Central [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25514-tp-tool]. Be careful, in the MATLAB toolbox the assignments of the dimensions of the core tensor is in the opposite way in contrast to the notation used in the related literature. In the ToolBox, the first two dimension of the core tensor is assigned to the vertex systems. In the TP model literature the last two. A simple example is given below.

	Once you have the feedback vertexes derived to each vertexes of the TP model then you may want to calculate the controller over the same polytope (see PDC design by Tanaka)
W = queryw1(UC,domain,p);  % computing the weighting values over the parameter vector
F = tprods(K,W);		% calculating the parameter dependent feeback F(p)
F = shiftdim(F)
U=-F*x				% calculate the control value.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Key features for control analysis and design==
* The TP model transformation transforms a given qLPV model into a (tensor product type) polytopic form, irrespective of whether the model is given in the form of analytical equations resulting from physical considerations, or as an outcome of soft computing based identification techniques (such as [[neural network]]s or [[fuzzy logic]] based methods, or as a result of a [[black-box]] identification). 
* Further the TP model transformation is capable of manipulating the convex hull defined by the polytopic form that is a necessary step in polytopic qLPV model-based control analysis and design theories.

vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The system matrix &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{S}}({\mathbf{p}}(t))=\mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}(p_n(t)) \in\R^{L_1\times L_2} &lt;/math&gt; is a parameter-varying object, where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{p}}(t)\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a time varying &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional parameter vector which is an element of

Core tensor contains elements &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_N} &lt;/math&gt; which are the vertexes of the system.
As a matter of fact, further parameter dependent channels can be inserted to  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{S}}({\mathbf{p}}(t)) &lt;/math&gt; that represent various control performance requirements.
Here

:: &lt;math&gt; \forall n : \sum_{i_n=1}^{I_n} w_{n,i_n}(p_n(t)) = 1. &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_{n,i_n}(p_n(t)) \in [0,1] .&lt;/math&gt;

This means that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}({\mathbf{p}}(t)) &lt;/math&gt; is within the vertexes &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_N} &lt;/math&gt; of the system (within the convex hull defined by the vertexes) for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}(t) \in \Omega &lt;/math&gt;. 
Note that the TP type polytopic model can always be given in the form

:: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))=\sum_{r=1}^R \mathbf{S}_r w_r(\mathbf{p}(t)), &lt;/math&gt;

where the vertexes are the same as in the TP type polytopic form and the multi variable weighting functions are the product of the one variable weighting functions according to the TP type polytopic form, and r is the linear index equivalent of the multi-linear indexing &lt;math&gt; i_1,i_2, \ldots i_N &lt;/math&gt;.

;TP model transformation for qLPV models: 
Assume a given qLPV model &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t)) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}(t)\in \Omega \subset R^N&lt;/math&gt;, whose TP polytopic structure may be unknown (e.g. it is given by neural networks). The TP model transformation determines its TP polytopic structure as

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))=\mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_n(p_n(t)) &lt;/math&gt;,

namely it generates core tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; and weighting functions of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{w}_n(p_n(t)) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; n=1 \ldots N &lt;/math&gt;. Its free MATLAB implementation is downloadable at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120229061018/http://tptool.sztaki.hu/] or at  MATLAB Central [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25514-tp-tool].

If the given model does not have (finite element) TP polytopic structure, then the TP model transformation determines its approximation:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t)) \approx \mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_n(p_n(t)),&lt;/math&gt;

where trade-off is offered by the TP model transformation between complexity (number of vertexes stored in the core tensor or the number of weighting functions) and the approximation accuracy.&lt;ref name=ykc01&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TP model can be generated according to various constrains. Typical TP models generated by the TP model transformation are:
* HOSVD canonical form of qLPV models, 
* Various kinds of TP type polytopic form (this feature is very important in control performance optimization).

==TP model based control design==
;Key methodology:

Since the TP type polytopic model is a subset of the polytopic model representations, the analysis and design methodologies developed for polytopic representations are applicable for the TP type polytopic models as well.  
One typical way is to search the nonlinear controller in the form:

:: &lt;math&gt;u=-\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{p}(t))\mathbf{x}(t)=-\sum_{r=1}^R F_r w_r(\mathbf{p}(t))\mathbf{x}(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where the vertexes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_r &lt;/math&gt; of the controller is calculated from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_r &lt;/math&gt;. Typically, the vertexes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_r &lt;/math&gt; are substituted into Linear Matrix Inequalities in order to determine &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_r &lt;/math&gt;.

In TP type polytopic form the controller is:

:: &lt;math&gt;u=-\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{p}(t))\mathbf{x}(t)=-\mathcal{F}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_n(p_n(t))\mathbf{x}(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where the vertexes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_N} &lt;/math&gt; stored in the core tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt; are determined from the vertexes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_N} &lt;/math&gt; stored in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the polytopic observer or other components can be generated in similar way, such as these vertexes are also generated from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Convex hull manipulation based optimization:

The polytopic representation of a given qLPV model is not invariant. I.e. a given &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;Z=\infty &lt;/math&gt; number of different representation as:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))=\mathcal{S}_z\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_{z,n}(p_n(t)),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z=1\ldots Z&lt;/math&gt;. In order to generate an optimal control of the given model &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))&lt;/math&gt; we apply, for instance LMIs. Thus, if we apply the selected LMIs to the above polytopic model we arrive at:

:: &lt;math&gt;u_z=-\mathbf{F}_z(\mathbf{p}(t))\mathbf{x}(t)=-\mathcal{F}_z\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_{z,n}(p_n(t))\mathbf{x}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the LMIs realize a non-linear mapping between the vertexes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; we may find very different controllers for each &lt;math&gt;z=1\ldots Z&lt;/math&gt;. This means that we have &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; different number of "optimal" controllers to the same system &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the question is: which one of the "optimal" controllers is really the optimal one. The TP model transformation let us to manipulate the weighting functions systematically that is equivalent to the manipulation of the vertexes. The geometrical meaning of this manipulation is the manipulation of the convex hull defined by the vertexes. We can easily demonstrate the following facts:

* Tightening the convex hull typically decreases the conservativeness of the solution, so as may lead to better control performance. For instance, if we have a polytopic representation

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))=\mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_{n}(p_n(t)),&lt;/math&gt;

of a given model &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}(t))&lt;/math&gt;, then we can generate a controller as

:: &lt;math&gt;u=-\mathcal{F}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_{n}(p_n(t))\mathbf{x}(t),&lt;/math&gt;

then we solved the control problem of all systems &lt;math&gt;k=1\ldots K=\infty &lt;/math&gt; that can be given by the same vertexes, but with different weighting functions as:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_k(\mathbf{p}(t))=\mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_{k,n}(p_n(t)),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:: &lt;math&gt;u_k=-\mathcal{F}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_{k,n}(p_n(t))\mathbf{x}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

If one of these systems are very hardly controllable (or even uncontrollable) then we arrive at a very conservative solution (or unfeasible LMIs). Therefore, we expect that during tightening the convex hull we exclude such problematic systems.

* It can also be easily demonstrated that the observer design is typically needs large convex hull. So, as when we design controller and observer we need to find the optimal convex hull between the tight one and the large one. Same papers also demonstrate that using different convex hulls (if the separation principal is applicable) for observer and controller may lead to even better solution.

==Properties of the TP model transformation in qLPV theories==
* It can be executed uniformly (irrespective of whether the model is given in the form of analytical equations resulting from physical considerations, or as an outcome of soft computing based identification techniques (such as neural networks or fuzzy logic based methods, or as a result of a black-box identification), without analytical interaction, within a reasonable amount of time. Thus, the transformation replaces the analytical and in many cases complex and not obvious conversions to numerical, tractable, straightforward operations that can be carried out in a routine fashion.
* It generates the HOSVD-based canonical form of qLPV models, which is a unique representation. This form extracts the unique structure of a given qLPV model in the same sense as the HOSVD does for tensors and matrices, in a way such that: 
:* the number of LTI components are minimized;
:* the weighting functions are one variable functions of the parameter vector in an orthonormed system for each parameter (singular functions); 
:* the LTI components (vertex components) are also in orthogonal positions; 
:* the LTI systems and the weighting functions are ordered according to the higher-order singular values of the parameter vector;
:* it has a unique form (except for some special cases);
:* introduces and defines the rank of the qLPV model by the dimensions of the parameter vector;

* The core step of the TP model transformation was extended to generate different types of convex polytopic models, in order to focus on the systematic (numerical and automatic) modification of the convex hull instead of developing new LMI equations for feasible controller design (this is the widely adopted approach). It is worth noting that both the TP model transformation and the LMI-based control design methods are numerically executable one after the other, and this makes the resolution of a wide class of problems possible in a straightforward and tractable, numerical way.
* Based on the higher-order singular values (which express the rank properties of the given qLPV model, see above, for each element of the parameter vector in &lt;math&gt; L_2 &lt;/math&gt; norm), the TP model transformation offers a trade-off between the complexity of the TP model (polytopic form),&lt;ref name=ykc01 /&gt; hence, the LMI design and the accuracy of the resulting TP model.
* The TP model transformation is executed before utilizing the LMI design. This means that when we start the LMI design we already have the global weighting functions and during control we do not need to determine a local weighting of the LTI systems for feedback gains to compute the control value at every point of the hyperspace the system should go through. Having predefined continuous weighting functions also ensures that there is no friction in the weighting during control.

A '''time-variant system''' is a [[system]] that is not [[time-invariant system|time invariant]] (TIV). Roughly speaking, its output characteristics depend explicitly upon time. In other words, a system in which certain quantities governing the system's behavior change with time, so that the system will respond differently to the same input at different times.

== Overview ==
There are many well developed [[LTI system theory|techniques]] for dealing with the response of linear time invariant systems, such as [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] and [[Fourier transform]]s. However, these techniques are not strictly valid for time-varying systems.  A system undergoing slow time variation in comparison to its time constants can usually be considered to be time invariant: they are close to time invariant on a small scale.  An example of this is the aging and wear of electronic components, which happens on a scale of years, and thus does not result in any behaviour qualitatively different from that observed in a time invariant system: day-to-day, they are effectively time invariant, though year to year, the parameters may change.  Other linear time variant systems may behave more like nonlinear systems, if the system changes quickly&amp;nbsp;– significantly differently between measurements.

The following things can be said about a time-variant system:
* It has explicit dependence on time.
* It does not have an [[impulse response]] in the normal sense. The system can be characterized by an impulse response except the impulse response must be known at each and every time instant.
* It is not stationary

== Examples of time-variant systems ==
The following time varying systems cannot be modelled by assuming that they are time invariant:
* Aircraft&amp;nbsp;– Time variant characteristics are caused by different configuration of control surfaces during take off, cruise and landing as well as constantly decreasing weight due to consumption of fuel. 
* The Earth's thermodynamic response to incoming [[Solar irradiance]] varies with time due to changes in the Earth's [[albedo]] and the presence of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere.
* The human vocal tract is a time variant system, with its transfer function at any given time dependent on the shape of the vocal organs.  As with any fluid-filled tube, resonances (called [[formant]]s) change as the vocal organs such as the [[tongue]] and [[Soft palate|velum]] move.  Mathematical models of the vocal tract are therefore time-variant, with transfer functions often [[linear interpolation|linearly interpolated]] between states over time.
* [[Linear]] time varying processes such as [[amplitude modulation]] occur on a time scale similar to or faster than that of the input signal.  In practice amplitude modulation is often implemented using time-invariant system [[nonlinear]] elements such as [[diode]]s.
* The [[Discrete Wavelet Transform]], often used in modern signal processing, is time variant because it makes use of the [[decimation (signal processing)|decimation]] operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80207">{{short description|Analysis of datasets using techniques from topology}}
In [[applied mathematics]], '''topological data analysis''' ('''TDA''') is an approach to the analysis of datasets using techniques from [[topology]]. Extraction of information from datasets that are high-dimensional, incomplete and noisy is generally challenging. TDA provides a general framework to analyze such data in a manner that is insensitive to the particular [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] chosen and provides [[dimensionality reduction]] and robustness to noise. Beyond this, it inherits [[functor]]iality, a fundamental concept of modern mathematics, from its topological nature, which allows it to adapt to new mathematical tools.

The initial motivation is to study the shape of data. TDA has combined [[algebraic topology]] and other tools from pure mathematics to allow mathematically rigorous study of "shape". The main tool is [[persistent homology]], an adaptation of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[point cloud]] data. Persistent homology has been applied to many types of data across many fields. Moreover, its mathematical foundation is also of theoretical importance. The unique features of TDA make it a promising bridge between topology and geometry.

== Basic theory ==

=== Intuition ===
{{tone}}
The premise underlying TDA is that shape matters. Real data in high dimensions is nearly always sparse, and tends to have relevant low dimensional features. One task of TDA is to provide a precise characterization of this fact. An illustrative example is a simple predator-prey system governed by the [[Lotka–Volterra equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological data analysis|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/120201|journal = Inverse Problems|date = 2011-12-01|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/120201|first = Charles|last = Epstein|author1-link=Charles Epstein|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson|author2-link=Gunnar Carlsson|first3 = Herbert|last3 = Edelsbrunner|author3-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|pages=120201|arxiv = 1609.08227|bibcode = 2011InvPr..27a0101E}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can easily observe that the trajectory of the system forms a closed circle in state space. TDA provides tools to detect and quantify such recurrent motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%253A575329&amp;dswid=4297 |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%253A575329&amp;dswid=4297 |website=www.diva-portal.org |accessdate=2015-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119021029/http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A575329 |archivedate=November 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many algorithms for data analysis, including those used in TDA, require the choice of various parameters. Without prior domain knowledge, the correct collection of parameters for a data set is difficult to choose. The main insight of [[persistent homology]] is that we can use the information obtained from all values of a parameter. Of course this insight alone is easy to make; the hard part is encoding this huge amount of information into an understandable and easy-to-represent form. With TDA, there is a mathematical interpretation when the information is a homology group. In general, the assumption is that features that persist for a wide range of parameters are "true" features. Features persisting for only a narrow range of parameters are presumed to be noise, although the theoretical justification for this is unclear.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Early history ===
Precursors to the full concept of persistent homology appeared gradually over time.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Edelsbrunner H. Persistent homology: theory and practice[J]. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Patrizio Frosini introduced the size function, which is equivalent to the 0th persistent homology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A distance for similarity classes of submanifolds of a Euclidean space|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0004972700028574|journal = Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society|date = 1990-12-01|issn = 1755-1633|pages = 407–415|volume = 42|issue = 03|doi = 10.1017/S0004972700028574|first = Patrizio|last = Frosini}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a decade later, Vanessa Robins studied the images of homomorphisms induced by inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Robins V. Towards computing homology from finite approximations[C]//Topology proceedings. 1999, 24(1): 503-532.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, shortly thereafter, Edelsbrunner et al. introduced the concept of persistent homology together with an efficient algorithm and its visualization as a persistence diagram.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological Persistence and Simplification|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-002-2885-2|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2002-11-01|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 511–533|volume = 28|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s00454-002-2885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlsson et al. reformulated the initial definition and gave an equivalent visualization method called persistence barcodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistence barcodes for shapes|url = http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218654305000761|journal = International Journal of Shape Modeling|date = 2005-12-01|issn = 0218-6543|pages = 149–187|volume = 11|issue = 02|doi = 10.1142/S0218654305000761|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Afra|last2 = Zomorodian|first3 = Anne|last3 = Collins|first4 = Leonidas J.|last4 = Guibas}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreting persistence in the language of commutative algebra.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In algebraic topology, the set of critical values of smooth Morse function was canonically partitioned into pairs "birth-death", filtered complexes were classified and the visualization of their invariants, equivalent to persistence diagram and persistence barcodes, was given in 1994 by Barannikov's canonical form&lt;ref name="Barannikov 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Framed Morse complex and its invariants |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267672645_The_Framed_Morse_complex_and_its_invariants |journal = Advances in Soviet Mathematics  | date = 1994|pages = 93–115|volume = 21|first = Sergey|last = Barannikov}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Concepts ===
Some widely used concepts are introduced below. Note that some definitions may vary from author to author.

A '''[[point cloud]]''' is often defined as a finite set of points in some Euclidean space, but may be taken to be any finite metric space.

The [[Cech complex|'''Čech complex''']] of a point cloud is the [[Nerve of a covering|''nerve'' of the ''cover'']] of balls of a fixed radius around each point in the cloud.

A '''persistence module''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; indexed by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space &lt;math&gt;U_t&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathrm{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, and a linear map &lt;math&gt;u_t^s: U_s \to U_t&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;s \leq t&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;u_t^t=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_t^su_s^r=u_t^r&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;r \leq s \leq t.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Proximity of Persistence Modules and Their Diagrams|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1542362.1542407|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Twenty-fifth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry|date = 2009-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-60558-501-7|pages = 237–246|series = SCG '09|doi = 10.1145/1542362.1542407|first = Frédéric|last = Chazal|first2 = David|last2 = Cohen-Steiner|first3 = Marc|last3 = Glisse|first4 = Leonidas J.|last4 = Guibas|first5 = Steve Y.|last5 = Oudot}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent definition is a functor from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; considered as a partially ordered set to the category of vector spaces.

The '''persistent homology group''' &lt;math&gt;PH&lt;/math&gt; of a point cloud is the persistence module defined as &lt;math&gt;PH_k(X)= \prod H_k(X_r)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X_r&lt;/math&gt; is the Čech complex of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of the point cloud &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt; is the homology group.

A '''persistence barcode''' is a [[Multiset (abstract data type)|multiset]] of intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and a '''persistence diagram''' is a multiset of points in &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;:= \{(u,v) \in \mathbb{R}^2| u,v \geq 0, u \leq v\}&lt;/math&gt;).

The [[Wasserstein metric|'''Wasserstein distance''']] between two persistence diagrams &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math display="block"&gt;W_p[L_q](X,Y):= \inf_{\phi: X \to Y} [~\sum_{x \in X} \Vert x-\phi(x)\Vert _q~]^{\frac{1}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;1 \leq p,q \leq \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; ranges over bijections between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Please refer to figure 3.1 in Munch &lt;ref&gt;Munch E. Applications of persistent homology to time varying systems[D]. Duke University, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; for illustration.

The '''bottleneck distance''' between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="block"&gt;W_{\infty}[L_q](X,Y):= \inf_{\phi: X \to Y} \sup_{x \in X} \Vert x-\phi(x)\Vert _q.&lt;/math&gt; This is a special case of Wasserstein distance, letting &lt;math&gt;p=\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Basic property ===

==== Structure theorem ====
The first classification theorem for persistent homology appeared in 2005:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computing Persistent Homology|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-004-1146-y|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2004-11-19|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 249–274|volume = 33|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s00454-004-1146-y|first = Afra|last = Zomorodian|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a finitely generated persistence module &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; coefficients, 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;H(C;F) \simeq  \bigoplus_i x^{t_i} \cdot F[x] \oplus \left(\bigoplus_j x^{r_j} \cdot (F[x]/(x^{s_j}\cdot F[x]))\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Intuitively, the free parts correspond to the homology generators that appear at filtration level &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and never disappear, while the torsion parts correspond to those that appear at filtration level &lt;math&gt;r_j&lt;/math&gt; and last for &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; steps of the filtration (or equivalently, disappear at filtration level &lt;math&gt;s_j+r_j&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Barannikov 1994"/&gt;.

Persistent homology is visualized through a barcode or persistence diagram. The barcode has its root in abstract mathematics, though not at first sight; essentially, the derived category of chain complexes over a field is equivalent to the graded category of vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Homological Algebra|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=zh-CN&amp;lr=&amp;id=flm-dBXfZ_gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=weibel+homological&amp;ots=_MbUFbYFtd&amp;sig=blH5vOFonrO8auLT8uOnKQ-_uRU#v=onepage&amp;q=weibel%2520homological&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1995-10-27|isbn = 9780521559874|first = Charles A.|last = Weibel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stability ====
Stability is desirable because it provides robustness against noise. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is any space which is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex, and &lt;math&gt;f,g:X\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are continuous tame&lt;ref name="Shikhman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shikhman|first1=Vladimir|title=Topological Aspects of Nonsmooth Optimization|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461418979|pages=169-170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D4FL3i4vIQC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=%22tame+set%22+semialgebraic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fTSSDvXsbN&amp;sig=9kym0Q8OHpS7l-ZTA_Xck5icdDM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQxoe0i9LXAhXIgVQKHRXeCtQQ6AEIYzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tame%20set%22%20semialgebraic&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; functions, then the persistence vector spaces &lt;math&gt;\{H_k(f^{-1}([0,r]))\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{H_k(g^{-1}([0,r]))\}&lt;/math&gt; are finitely presented, and &lt;math&gt;W_{\infty}(D(f),D(g)) \leq \lVert f-g \rVert_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the bottleneck distance&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stability of Persistence Diagrams|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-006-1276-5|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2006-12-12|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 103–120|volume = 37|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00454-006-1276-5|first = David|last = Cohen-Steiner|first2 = Herbert|last2 = Edelsbrunner|first3 = John|last3 = Harer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the map taking a continuous tame function to the persistence diagram of its &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th homology.

=== Workflow ===
The basic workflow in TDA is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Barcodes: The persistent topology of data|url = http://www.ams.org/bull/2008-45-01/S0273-0979-07-01191-3/|journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 0273-0979|pages = 61–75|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-07-01191-3|first = Robert|last = Ghrist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process converts the point cloud into a filtration of simplicial complexes. Taking the homology of each complex in this filtration gives a persistence module &lt;math display="block"&gt;H_i(X_{r_0})\to H_i(X_{r_1}) \to H_i(X_{r_2}) \to \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

== Computation ==
The first algorithm for persistent homology over &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; was given by Edelsbrunner et al.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Zomorodian and Carlsson gave the first practical algorithm to compute persistent homology over all fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Edelsbrunner and Harer's book gives general guidance on computational topology.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computational Topology: An Introduction|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MDXa6gFRZuIC|publisher = American Mathematical Soc.|date = 2010-01-01|isbn = 9780821849255|first = Herbert|last = Edelsbrunner|first2 = John|last2 = Harer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue that arises in computation is the choice of complex. The [[Čech cohomology|Čech complex]] and [[Vietoris–Rips complex|Vietoris-Rips complex]] are most natural at first glance; however, their size grows rapidly with the number of data points. The Vietoris-Rips complex is preferred over Čech complex because its definition is simpler and the Čech complex requires extra effort to define in a general finite metric space. Efficient ways to lower the computational cost of homology have been studied. For example, the α-complex and witness complex are used to reduce the dimension and size of complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological Estimation Using Witness Complexes|publisher = Eurographics Association|journal = Proceedings of the First Eurographics Conference on Point-Based Graphics|date = 2004-01-01|location = Aire-la-Ville, Switzerland, Switzerland|isbn = 3-905673-09-6|pages = 157–166|series = SPBG'04|doi = 10.2312/SPBG/SPBG04/157-166|first = Vin|last = De Silva|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization==
High-dimensional data is impossible to visualize directly. Many methods have been invented to extract a low-dimensional structure from the data set, such as [[principal component analysis]] and [[multidimensional scaling]].&lt;ref&gt;Liu S, Maljovec D, Wang B, et al. Visualizing High-Dimensional Data: Advances in the Past Decade[J].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that the problem itself is ill-posed, since many different topological features can be found in the same data set. Thus, the study of visualization of high-dimensional spaces is of central importance to TDA, although it does not necessarily involve the use of persistent homology. However, recent attempts have been made to use persistent homology in data visualization.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Carlsson et al. have proposed a general method called '''MAPPER'''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Download Limit Exceeded|url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.8956&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|website = citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inherits the idea of Serre that a covering preserves homotopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=COuPBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2013-04-17|isbn = 9781475739510|first = Raoul|last = Bott|first2 = Loring W.|last2 = Tu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generalized formulation of MAPPER is as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be topological spaces and let &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Z&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous map. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U} = \{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite open covering of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The output of MAPPER is the nerve of the pullback cover &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M(\mathbb{U},f):=N(f^{-1}(\mathbb{U}))&lt;/math&gt;, where each preimage is split into its connected components.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Mutiscale Mapper: A Framework for Topological Summarization of Data and Maps|arxiv= 1504.03763|date = 2015-04-14|first = Tamal K.|last = Dey|first2 = Facundo|last2 = Memoli|first3 = Yusu|last3 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very general concept, of which the Reeb graph and merge trees are special cases.

This is not quite the original definition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Carlsson et al. choose &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, and cover it with open sets such that at most two intersect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This restriction means that the output is in the form of a [[complex network]]. Because the topology of a finite point cloud is trivial, clustering methods (such as [[Single-linkage clustering|single linkage]])  are used to produce the analogue of connected sets in the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; when MAPPER is applied to actual data.

Mathematically speaking, MAPPER is a variation of the [[Reeb graph]].  If the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M(\mathbb{U},f)&lt;/math&gt; is at most one dimensional, then for each &lt;math&gt;i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="block"&gt;H_i(X) \simeq H_0(N(\mathbb{U});\hat{F}_i)   \oplus H_1(N(\mathbb{U});\hat{F}_{i-1}).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Sheaves, Cosheaves and Applications|arxiv= 1303.3255|date = 2013-03-13|first = Justin|last = Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The added flexibility also has disadvantages. One problem is instability, in that some change of the choice of the cover can lead to major change of the output of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A fast algorithm for constructing topological structure in large data|url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.hha/1355321072|journal = Homology, Homotopy and Applications|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1532-0073|pages = 221–238|volume = 14|issue = 1|first = Xu|last = Liu|first2 = Zheng|last2 = Xie|first3 = Dongyun|last3 = Yi|doi=10.4310/hha.2012.v14.n1.a11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work has been done to overcome this problem.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

Three successful applications of MAPPER can be found in Carlsson et al.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extracting insights from the shape of complex data using topology|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01236?message-global=remove&amp;WT.ec_id=SREP-639-20130301|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2013-02-07|pmc = 3566620|pmid = 23393618|volume = 3|doi = 10.1038/srep01236|first = P.

A free implementation of MAPPER is available [http://danifold.net/mapper/ online] written by Daniel Müllner and Aravindakshan Babu. MAPPER also forms the basis of [[Ayasdi]]'s AI platform.

=== Multidimensional persistence ===
Multidimensional persistence is important to TDA. The concept arises in both theory and practice. The first investigation of multidimensional persistence was early in the development of TDA,&lt;ref&gt;Frosini P, Mulazzani M. Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances[J]. Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society Simon Stevin, 1999, 6(3): 455-464.&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the founding papers of TDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first application to appear in the literature is a method for shape comparison, similar to the invention of TDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multidimensional Size Functions for Shape Comparison|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-008-0096-z|journal = Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|date = 2008-05-17|issn = 0924-9907|pages = 161–179|volume = 32|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10851-008-0096-z|first = S.|last = Biasotti|first2 = A.|last2 = Cerri|first3 = P.|last3 = Frosini|first4 = D.|last4 = Giorgi|first5 = C.|last5 = Landi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of an '''''n''-dimensional persistence module''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* vector space &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; is assigned to each point in &lt;math&gt;s=(s_1,...,s_n)&lt;/math&gt;
* map &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t:V_s \to V_t&lt;/math&gt; is assigned if &lt;math&gt;s\leq t&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;s_i \leq t_i, i=1,...,n)&lt;/math&gt;
* maps satisfy &lt;math&gt;\rho_r^t=\rho_s^t \circ \rho_r^s&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;r \leq s \leq t&lt;/math&gt;
It might be worth noting that there are controversies on the definition of multidimensional persistence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One of the advantages of one-dimensional persistence is its representability by a diagram or barcode. However, discrete complete invariants of multidimensional persistence modules do not exist.&lt;ref name="Carlsson 71–93"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Theory of Multidimensional Persistence|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-009-9176-0|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2009-04-24|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 71–93|volume = 42|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00454-009-9176-0|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Afra|last2 = Zomorodian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for this is that the structure of the collection of indecomposables is extremely complicated by [[Gabriel's theorem]] in the theory of quiver representations,&lt;ref&gt;Derksen H, Weyman J. Quiver representations[J]. Notices of the AMS, 2005, 52(2): 200-206.&lt;/ref&gt; although a finitely n-dim persistence module can be uniquely decomposed into a direct sum of indecomposables due to the Krull-Schmidt theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah M F. On the Krull-Schmidt theorem with application to sheaves[J]. Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France, 1956, 84: 307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, many results have been established. Carlsson and Zomorodian introduced the '''rank invariant''' &lt;math&gt;\rho_M(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the &lt;math&gt;\rho_M(u,v)=\mathrm{rank}(x^{u-v}:M_u\to M_v)&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated n-graded module. In one dimension, it is equivalent to the barcode. In the literature, the rank invariant  is often referred as the persistent Betti numbers (PBNs).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In many theoretical works, authors have used a more restricted definition, an analogue from sublevel set persistence. Specifically,  the persistence Betti numbers of a function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to \mathrm{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; are given by the function &lt;math&gt;\beta_f: \Delta^{+} \to \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;, taking each &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in \Delta^{+}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\beta_f(u,v):= \mathrm{rank} (H(X(f\leq u)\to H(X(f\leq v)))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{+} := \{(u,v)\in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}:u\leq v\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X(f\leq u):=\{x\in X:f(x)\leq u\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Some basic properties include monotonicity and diagonal jump.&lt;ref&gt;Cerri A, Di Fabio B, Ferri M, et al. Multidimensional persistent homology is stable[J]. {{arxiv|0908.0064}}, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent Betti numbers will be finite if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact and locally contractible subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Finiteness of rank invariants of multidimensional persistent homology groups|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893965910004118|journal = Applied Mathematics Letters|date = 2011-04-01|pages = 516–518|volume = 24|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.aml.2010.11.004|first = Francesca|last = Cagliari|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Landi|arxiv = 1001.0358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a foliation method, the k-dim PBNs can be decomposed into a family of 1-dim PBNs by dimensionality deduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = One-dimensional reduction of multidimensional persistent homology|url = http://www.ams.org/proc/2010-138-08/S0002-9939-10-10312-8/|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 0002-9939|pages = 3003–3017|volume = 138|issue = 8|doi = 10.1090/S0002-9939-10-10312-8|first = Francesca|last = Cagliari|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Di Fabio|first3 = Massimo|last3 = Ferri|arxiv = math/0702713}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has also led to a proof that multi-dim PBNs are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Betti numbers in multidimensional persistent homology are stable functions|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mma.2704/abstract|journal = Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences|date = 2013-08-01|issn = 1099-1476|pages = 1543–1557|volume = 36|issue = 12|doi = 10.1002/mma.2704|first = Andrea|last = Cerri|first2 = Barbara Di|last2 = Fabio|first3 = Massimo|last3 = Ferri|first4 = Patrizio|last4 = Frosini|first5 = Claudia|last5 = Landi|bibcode = 2013MMAS...36.1543C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discontinuities of PBNs only occur at points &lt;math&gt;(u,v) (u\leq v)&lt;/math&gt; where either &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a discontinuous point of &lt;math&gt;\rho_M (\star,v)&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a discontinuous point of &lt;math&gt;\rho (u,\star)&lt;/math&gt;  under the assumption that &lt;math&gt;f\in C^0(X,\mathrm{R}^k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact, triangulable topological space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Necessary conditions for discontinuities of multidimensional persistent Betti numbers|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mma.3093/abstract|journal = Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences|date = 2015-03-15|issn = 1099-1476|pages = 617–629|volume = 38|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/mma.3093|first = Andrea|last = Cerri|first2 = Patrizio|last2 = Frosini|bibcode = 2015MMAS...38..617C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical algorithm to compute multidimensional persistence was invented very early.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computing Multidimensional Persistence|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10631-6_74|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2009-12-16|isbn = 978-3-642-10630-9|pages = 730–739|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-10631-6_74|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Gurjeet|last2 = Singh|first3 = Afra|last3 = Zomorodian|editor-first = Yingfei|editor-last = Dong|editor-first2 = Ding-Zhu|editor-last2 = Du|editor-first3 = Oscar|editor-last3 = Ibarra}}&lt;/ref&gt; After then, many other algorithms have been proposed, based on such concepts as discrete morse theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Reducing complexes in multidimensional persistent homology theory|arxiv= 1310.8089|date = 2013-10-30|first = Madjid|last = Allili|first2 = Tomasz|last2 = Kaczynski|first3 = Claudia|last3 = Landi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finite sample estimating.&lt;ref&gt;Cavazza N, Ferri M, Landi C. Estimating multidimensional persistent homology through a finite sampling[J]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other persistences ===
The standard paradigm in TDA is often referred as '''sublevel persistence'''. Apart from multidimensional persistence, many works have been done to extend this special case.

==== Zigzag persistence ====
The nonzero maps in persistence module are restricted by the preorder relationship in the category. However, mathematicians have found that the unanimity of direction is not essential to many results. "The philosophical point is that the decomposition theory of graph representations is somewhat independent of the orientation of the graph edges".&lt;ref name="Carlsson 367–405"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Zigzag Persistence|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-010-9066-0|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2010-04-21|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 367–405|volume = 10|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s10208-010-9066-0|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Vin de|last2 = Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zigzag persistence is important to the theoretical side. The examples given in Carlsson's review paper to illustrate the importance of functorality all share some of its features.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Extended persistence and levelset persistence ====
Some attempts is to lose the stricter restriction of the function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extending Persistence Using Poincaré and Lefschetz Duality|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-008-9027-z|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2008-04-04|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 79–103|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10208-008-9027-z|first = David|last = Cohen-Steiner|first2 = Herbert|last2 = Edelsbrunner|first3 = John|last3 = Harer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please refer to the [[#Categorization and cosheaf|Categorization and cosheaf]] and [[#Impact on mathematics|Impact on mathematics]] sections for more information.

It's natural to extend persistence homology to other basic concepts in algebraic topology, such as cohomology and relative homology/cohomology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dualities in persistent (co)homology|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124003|journal = Inverse Problems|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124003|first = Vin|last = de Silva|first2 = Dmitriy|last2 = Morozov|first3 = Mikael|last3 = Vejdemo-Johansson|pages=124003|arxiv = 1107.5665|bibcode = 2011InvPr..27l4003D}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting application is the computation of circular coordinates for a data set via the first persistent cohomology group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistent Cohomology and Circular Coordinates|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-011-9344-x|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2011-03-30|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 737–759|volume = 45|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s00454-011-9344-x|first = Vin de|last = Silva|first2 = Dmitriy|last2 = Morozov|first3 = Mikael|last3 = Vejdemo-Johansson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Circular persistence  ====
Normal persistence homology studies real-valued functions. The circle-valued map might be useful, "persistence theory for circle-valued maps promises to play the role for some vector fields as does the standard persistence theory for scalar fields", as commented in D. Burghelea et al.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological Persistence for Circle-Valued Maps|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-013-9497-x|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2013-04-09|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 69–98|volume = 50|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00454-013-9497-x|first = Dan|last = Burghelea|first2 = Tamal K.|last2 = Dey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference is that Jordan cells(very similar in format to the ones in linear algebra) are nontrivial in circle-valued functions, which would be zero in real-valued case, and combing with barcodes give the invariants of a tame map, under moderate conditions.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

Two techniques they use are More-Novikov theory&lt;ref&gt;Novikov S P.

==== Persistence with torsion ====
The proof of the structure theorem relies on the base domain being field, so not many attempts have been made on persistence homology with torsion. Frosini defined a pseudometric on this specific module and proved its stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stable Comparison of Multidimensional Persistent Homology Groups with Torsion|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-012-9769-0|journal = Acta Applicandae Mathematicae|date = 2012-06-23|issn = 0167-8019|pages = 43–54|volume = 124|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10440-012-9769-0|first = Patrizio|last = Frosini|arxiv = 1012.4169}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its novelty is that it doesn't depend on some classification theory to define the metric.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Categorification and cosheaves ===
One advantage of [[category theory]] is its ability to lift concrete results to a higher level, showing relationships between seemingly unconnected objects. Bubenik et al.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Categorification of Persistent Homology|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-014-9573-x|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2014-01-28|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 600–627|volume = 51|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00454-014-9573-x|first = Peter|last = Bubenik|first2 = Jonathan A.|last2 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a short introduction of category theory fitted for TDA.

Category theory is the language of modern algebra, and has been widely used in the study of algebraic geometry and topology. It has been noted that "the key observation of &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is that the persistence diagram produced by &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; depends only on the algebraic structure carried by this diagram."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Metrics for Generalized Persistence Modules|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-014-9229-5|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2014-10-09|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 1501–1531|volume = 15|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s10208-014-9229-5|first = Peter|last = Bubenik|first2 = Vin de|last2 = Silva|first3 = Jonathan|last3 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of category theory in TDA has proved to be fruitful.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

Following the notations made in Bubenik et al.,&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; the '''indexing category''' &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is any [[preordered set]] (not necessarily &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;),  the target category &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is any category (instead of the commonly used &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathbb{F}}&lt;/math&gt;), and [[functor]]s &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P \to D&lt;/math&gt; are called '''generalized persistence modules''' in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, over &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

One advantage of using category theory in TDA is a clearer understanding of concepts and the discovery of new relationships between proofs. Take two examples for illustration. The understanding of the correspondence between interleaving and matching is of huge importance, since matching has been the method used in the beginning (modified from Morse theory).  A summary of works can be found in Vin de Silva et al.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geometry in the Space of Persistence Modules|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2462356.2462402|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry|date = 2013-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-2031-3|pages = 397–404|series = SoCG '13|doi = 10.1145/2462356.2462402|first = Vin|last = de Silva|first2 = Vidit|last2 = Nanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many theorems can be proved much more easily in a more intuitive setting.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Another example is the relationship between the construction of different complexes from point clouds. It has long been noticed that Čech and Vietoris-Rips complexes are related. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;V_r(X) \subset C_{\sqrt{2}r}(X) \subset V_{2r}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The essential relationship between Cech and Rips complexes can be seen much more clearly in categorical language.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

The language of category theory also helps cast results in terms recognizable to the broader mathematical community.  Bottleneck distance is widely used in TDA because of the results on stability with respect to the bottleneck distance.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In fact, the interleaving distance is the [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] in a poset category of stable metrics on multidimensional persistence modules in a [[Field (mathematics)|prime field]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Theory of the Interleaving Distance on Multidimensional Persistence Modules|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9255-y|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2015-03-24|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 613–650|volume = 15|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s10208-015-9255-y|first = Michael|last = Lesnick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Natural Pseudo-Distance and Optimal Matching between Reduced Size Functions|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-008-9332-1|journal = Acta Applicandae Mathematicae|date = 2008-10-14|issn = 0167-8019|pages = 527–554|volume = 109|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10440-008-9332-1|first = Michele|last = d’Amico|first2 = Patrizio|last2 = Frosini|first3 = Claudia|last3 = Landi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheaf (mathematics)|Sheaves]], a central concept in modern [[algebraic geometry]], are intrinsically related to category theory. Roughly speaking, [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] are the mathematical tool for understanding how local information determines global information. Justin Curry regards level set persistence as the study of [[Fiber (mathematics)|fibers]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of continuous functions. The objects that he studies are very similar to those by MAPPER, but with sheaf theory as the theoretical foundation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although no breakthrough in the theory of TDA has yet used sheaf theory, it is promising since there are many beautiful theorems in algebraic geometry relating to sheaf theory. For example, a natural theoretical question is whether different filtration methods result in the same output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Filtrations induced by continuous functions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864113001892|journal = Topology and its Applications|date = 2013-08-01|pages = 1413–1422|volume = 160|issue = 12|doi = 10.1016/j.topol.2013.05.013|first = B.|last = Di Fabio|first2 = P.|last2 = Frosini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stability ===
Stability is of central importance to data analysis, since real data carry noises. By usage of category theory, Bubenik et al. have distinguished between soft and hard stability theorems, and proved that soft cases are formal.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Specifically, general workflow of TDA is  
{| class="wikitable"
|data
|&lt;math&gt;\stackrel{F}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;
|topological persistence module
|&lt;math&gt;\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;
|algebraic persistence module
|&lt;math&gt;\stackrel{J}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;
|discrete invariant
|}
The soft stability theorem asserts that &lt;math&gt;HF&lt;/math&gt; is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]], and the hard stability theorem asserts that &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is Lipschitz continuous.

Bottleneck distance is widely used in TDA. The isometry theorem asserts that the '''interleaving distance''' &lt;math&gt;d_I&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the bottleneck distance.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Bubenik et al. have abstracted the definition to that between functors &lt;math&gt;F,G: P\to D&lt;/math&gt;  when &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is equipped with a sublinear projection or superlinear family, in which still remains a pseudometric.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Considering the magnificent characters of interleaving distance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Multidimensional Interleavings and Applications to Topological Inference|arxiv= 1206.1365|date = 2012-06-06|first = Michael|last = Lesnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; here we introduce the general definition of interleaving distance(instead of the first introduced one):&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma, K \in \mathrm{Trans_P}&lt;/math&gt; (a function from &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which is monotone and satisfies &lt;math&gt;x \leq \Gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x\in P&lt;/math&gt;). A &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma, K)&lt;/math&gt;-interleaving between F and G consists of natural transformations &lt;math&gt;\varphi: F \Rightarrow G\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi: G \Rightarrow FK&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;(\psi\Gamma)=\varphi F\eta_{K\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\varphi\Gamma)=\psi G\eta_{\Gamma K}&lt;/math&gt;.

The two main results are&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;     
* Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a preordered set with a sublinear projection or superlinear family. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H:D \to E&lt;/math&gt; be a functor between arbitrary categories &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D,E&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any two functors &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F,G:P\to D&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d_I(HF,HG) \leq d_I(F,G)&lt;/math&gt;.     
* Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a poset of a metric space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. And let&lt;math display="inline"&gt;f,g:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily continuous) be functions, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F,G&lt;/math&gt; to be the corresponding persistence diagram. Then &lt;math&gt;d_I(F,G) \leq d_{\infty}(f,g):=\sup_{x\in X}d_Y(f(x),g(x))&lt;/math&gt;.     
These two results summarize many results on stability of different models of persistence.

=== Structure theorem ===
The structure theorem is of central importance to TDA; as commented by G. Carlsson, "what makes homology useful as a discriminator between topological spaces is the fact that there is a classification theorem for finitely generated abelian groups."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topology and data|url = http://www.ams.org/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/|journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0273-0979|pages = 255–308|volume = 46|issue = 2|doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-09-01249-X|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]).

The main argument used in the proof of the original structure theorem is the standard [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, this argument fails if the indexing set is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\leq)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In general, not every persistence module can be decomposed into intervals.&lt;ref name="Chazal"&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = The structure and stability of persistence modules|arxiv= 1207.3674|date = 2012-07-16|first = Frederic|last = Chazal|first2 = Vin|last2 = de Silva|first3 = Marc|last3 = Glisse|first4 = Steve|last4 = Oudot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many attempts have been made at relaxing the restrictions of the original structure theorem.{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} The case for pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules indexed by a locally finite subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is solved based on the work of Webb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decomposition of graded modules|url = http://www.ams.org/proc/1985-094-04/S0002-9939-1985-0792261-6/|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 1985-01-01|issn = 0002-9939|pages = 565–571|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1090/S0002-9939-1985-0792261-6|first = Cary|last = Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable result is done by Crawley-Boevey, which solved the case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Crawley-Boevey's theorem states that any pointwise finite-dimensional persistence module is a direct sum of interval modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decomposition of pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules|url = http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219498815500668|journal = Journal of Algebra and Its Applications|volume = 14|issue = 05|doi = 10.1142/s0219498815500668|first = William|last = Crawley-Boevey|pages=1550066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the definition of his theorem, some concepts need introducing. An '''interval''' in &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\leq)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a subset &lt;math&gt;I \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; having the property that if &lt;math&gt;r, t \in I&lt;/math&gt; and if there is an &lt;math&gt;s \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r \leq s \leq t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s\in I&lt;/math&gt; as well. An '''interval module''' &lt;math&gt;k_I&lt;/math&gt; assigns to each element &lt;math&gt;s\in I&lt;/math&gt; the vector space &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and assigns the zero vector space to elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} / I&lt;/math&gt;. All maps &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t&lt;/math&gt; are the zero map, unless &lt;math&gt;s,t \in I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s\leq t&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Interval modules are indecomposable.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = The observable structure of persistence modules|arxiv= 1405.5644|date = 2014-05-22|first = Frederic|last = Chazal|first2 = William|last2 = Crawley-Boevey|first3 = Vin|last3 = de Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the result of Crawley-Boevey is a very powerful theorem, it still doesn't extend to the q-tame case.&lt;ref name="Chazal"/&gt; A persistence module is '''q-tame''' if the  rank of &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t&lt;/math&gt; is finite for all &lt;math&gt;s\leq t&lt;/math&gt;. There are examples of q-tame persistence modules that fail to be pointwise finite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = A subset of Euclidean space with large Vietoris-Rips homology|arxiv= 1210.4097|date = 2012-10-15|first = Jean-Marie|last = Droz}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it turns out that a similar structure theorem still holds if the features that exist only at one index value are removed.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This holds because the infinite dimensional parts at each index value do not persist, due to the finite-rank condition.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Weinberger S. What is... persistent homology?[J]. Notices of the AMS, 2011, 58(1): 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, the observable category &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ob}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pers}/\mathrm{Eph}&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Eph}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pers}&lt;/math&gt; whose objects are the ephemeral modules (&lt;math&gt;\rho^t_s=0&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;s &lt; t&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Note that the extended results listed here do not apply to zigzag persistence, since the analogue of a zigzag persistence module over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is not immediately obvious.

=== Statistics ===
Real data is always finite, and so its study requires us to take stochasticity into account. Statistical analysis gives us the ability to separate true features of the data from artifacts introduced by random noise. Persistent homology has no inherent mechanism to distinguish between low-probability features and high-probability features.

One way to apply statistics to topological data analysis is to study the statistical properties of topological features of point clouds. The study of random simplicial complexes offers some insight into statistical topology. K. Turner et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fréchet Means for Distributions of Persistence Diagrams|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-014-9604-7|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2014-07-12|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 44–70|volume = 52|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00454-014-9604-7|first = Katharine|last = Turner|first2 = Yuriy|last2 = Mileyko|first3 = Sayan|last3 = Mukherjee|first4 = John|last4 = Harer}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a summary of work in this vein.

Another way is to study probability distributions on the persistence space. The persistence space &lt;math&gt;B_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\coprod_n B_{n}/ \backsim&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the space of all barcodes containing exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals and the equivalences are &lt;math&gt;\{[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],...,[x_n,y_n]\} \backsim \{[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],...,[x_{n-1},y_{n-1}]\}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x_n = y_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological pattern recognition for point cloud data|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0962492914000051|journal = Acta Numerica|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1474-0508|pages = 289–368|volume = 23|doi = 10.1017/S0962492914000051|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This space is fairly complicated; for example, it is not complete under the bottleneck metric. The first attempt made to study it is by Y. Mileyko et al.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Probability measures on the space of persistence diagrams|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124007/meta|journal = Inverse Problems|date = 2011-11-10|issn = 0266-5611|pages = 124007|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124007|first = Yuriy|last = Mileyko|first2 = Sayan|last2 = Mukherjee|first3 = John|last3 = Harer|bibcode = 2011InvPr..27l4007M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of persistence diagrams &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; in their paper is defined as &lt;math display="block"&gt;D_p := \left\{d | \sum_{x\in d}\left(2\inf_{y \in \Delta}\lVert x-y \rVert\right)^p\right\}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the diagonal line in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. A nice property is that &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; is complete and separable in the Wasserstein metric &lt;math&gt;W_p(u,v)=\left(\inf_{\gamma\in \Gamma(u,v)}\int_{\mathbb{X}\times \mathbb{X}} \rho^p(x,y)\mathrm{d}\gamma(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;. Expectation, variance, and conditional probability can be defined in the [[Fréchet mean|Fréchet sense]]. This allows many statistical tools to be ported to TDA.

Persistence landscapes, introduced by Peter Bubenik, are a different way to represent of barcodes, more amenable to statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Statistical topological data analysis using persistence landscapes|arxiv= 1207.6437|date = 2012-07-26|first = Peter|last = Bubenik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''persistence landscape''' of a persistent module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a function &lt;math&gt;\lambda:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{R}\to \bar{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda(k,t):=\sup(m\geq 0|\beta^{t-m,t-m}\geq k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Extended real number line|extended real line]] and &lt;math&gt;\beta^{a,b}=\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{im}(M(a\leq b)))&lt;/math&gt;. The space of persistence landscapes is very nice: it inherits all good properties of barcode representation (stability, easy representation, etc.), but statistical quantities can be readily defined, and some problems in Y. Mileyko et al.'s work, such as the non-uniqueness of expectations,&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; can be overcome. Effective algorithms for computation with persistence landscapes are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A persistence landscapes toolbox for topological statistics|arxiv= 1501.00179|date = 2014-12-31|first = Peter|last = Bubenik|first2 = Pawel|last2 = Dlotko|doi=10.1016/j.jsc.2016.03.009|volume=78|journal=Journal of Symbolic Computation|pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is to use revised persistence, which is image, kernel and cokernel persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Persistent Homology for Kernels, Images, and Cokernels|url = http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611973068.110|pages = 1011–1020|doi = 10.1137/1.9781611973068.110|first = David|last = Cohen-Steiner|first2 = Herbert|last2 = Edelsbrunner|first3 = John|last3 = Harer|first4 = Dmitriy|last4 = Morozov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characteristics of TDA in applications ===
[http://www.ayasdi.com Ayasdi] is a data analysis company relying heavily on TDA, cofounded by a number of leading researchers in the field. There are several notable interesting features of the recent applications of TDA:
# '''Combining tools from several branches of mathematics'''. Besides the obvious need for algebra and topology, partial differential equations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Objective-oriented Persistent Homology|arxiv= 1412.2368|date = 2014-12-07|first = Bao|last = Wang|first2 = Guo-Wei|last2 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt; algebraic geometry,&lt;ref name="Carlsson 71–93" /&gt; presentation theory,&lt;ref name="Carlsson 367–405" /&gt; statistics, combinatorics, and Riemannian geometry&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; have all found use in TDA.  
# '''Quantitative analysis'''. Topology is considered to be very soft since many concepts are invariant under homotopy. However, persistent topology is able to record the birth (appearance) and death (disappearance) of topological features, thus extra geometric information is embedded in it. One evidence in theory is a partially positive result on the uniqueness of reconstruction of curves;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Uniqueness of models in persistent homology: the case of curves|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124005 |doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124005 | volume=27|journal=Inverse Problems|pages=124005|first = Patrizio|last = Frosini|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Landi|arxiv=1012.5783|bibcode=2011InvPr..27l4005F}}&lt;/ref&gt; two in application are on the quantitative analysis of Fullerene stability and quantitative analysis of [[self-similarity]], separately.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistent homology for the quantitative prediction of fullerene stability|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.23816/abstract|journal = Journal of Computational Chemistry|date = 2015-03-05|issn = 1096-987X|pmc = 4324100|pmid = 25523342|pages = 408–422|volume = 36|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/jcc.23816|first = Kelin|last = Xia|first2 = Xin|last2 = Feng|first3 = Yiying|last3 = Tong|first4 = Guo Wei|last4 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''The role of short persistence'''. Short persistence has also been found to be useful, despite the common belief that noise is the cause of the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistent homology analysis of protein structure, flexibility, and folding|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cnm.2655/abstract|journal = International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering|date = 2014-08-01|issn = 2040-7947|pmc = 4131872|pmid = 24902720|pages = 814–844|volume = 30|issue = 8|doi = 10.1002/cnm.2655|first = Kelin|last = Xia|first2 = Guo-Wei|last2 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is interesting to the mathematical theory.
One of the main fields of data analysis today is [[machine learning]]. Some examples of machine learning in TDA can be found in Adcock et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The ring of algebraic functions on persistence bar codes|url = http://intlpress.com/site/pub/files/_fulltext/journals/hha/2016/0018/0001/HHA-2016-0018-0001-a021.pdf|journal=Homology, Homotopy, and Applications|date = 2016-05-31|pages = 381–402|volume = 18|issue = 1|doi = 10.4310/hha.2016.v18.n1.a21|first = Aaron|last = Adcock|first2 = Erik|last2 = Carlsson|first3 = Gunnar|last3=Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [http://www.birs.ca/events/2012/5-day-workshops/12w5081 conference] is dedicated to the link between TDA and machine learning. In order to apply tools from machine leaning, the information obtained from TDA should be represented in vector form. An ongoing and promising attempt is the persistence landscape discussed above. Another attempt uses the concept of persistence images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Persistence Images: An Alternative Persistent Homology Representation|arxiv= 1507.06217|date = 2015-07-22|first = Sofya|last = Chepushtanova|first2 = Tegan|last2 = Emerson|first3 = Eric|last3 = Hanson|first4 = Michael|last4 = Kirby|first5 = Francis|last5 = Motta|first6 = Rachel|last6 = Neville|first7 = Chris|last7 = Peterson|first8 = Patrick|last8 = Shipman|first9 = Lori|last9 = Ziegelmeier}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one problem of this method is the loss of stability, since the hard stability theorem depends on the barcode representation.

=== Impact on mathematics ===
Topological data analysis and persistent homology have had impacts on [[Morse theory]]. Morse theory has played a very important role in the theory of TDA, including on computation. Some work in persistent homology has extended results about Morse functions to tame functions or, even to continuous functions. A forgotten result of R. Deheuvels long before the invention of persistent homology extends Morse theory to all continuous functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topologie D'Une Fonctionnelle|journal = Annals of Mathematics|date = 1955-01-01|pages = 13–72|volume = 61|series = Second Series|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/1969619|first = Rene|last = Deheuvels|jstor=1969619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent result is that the category of [[Reeb graph]]s is equivalent to a particular class of cosheaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Categorified Reeb graphs|journal=Discrete and Computational Geometry|first=Vin|last=de Silva|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Munch|first3=Amit|last3 = Patel|doi=10.1007/s00454-016-9763-9|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-016-9763-9|date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is motivated by theoretical work in TDA, since the Reeb graph is related to Morse theory and MAPPER is derived from it. The proof of this theorem relies on the interleaving distance.

It is evident to mathematicians that persistent homology is closely related to [[spectral sequence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surveys on Discrete and Computational Geometry: Twenty Years Later : AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conference, June 18-22, 2006, Snowbird, Utah|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ecUbCAAAQBAJ|publisher = American Mathematical Soc.|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9780821842393|first = Jacob E.|last = Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zigzag persistence may turn out to be of theoretical importance to spectral sequences.
