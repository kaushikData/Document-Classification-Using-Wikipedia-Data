      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2997">Professor '''Arthur Herbert Dodd''' (1891 - 21 May 1975) was an [[Academia|academic]] [[historian]] who taught and published widely, specialising in the [[politics]] of the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period]]s, [[History of Wales|Welsh history]], and the [[history]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/famous_people/ah_dodd.htm|title=Famous People: A H Dodd|publisher=Wrexham County Borough Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd was born and brought up in [[Wrexham]], [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]] where his father Charles was a [[headmaster]] at Victoria School. It was a family of modest means but studious inclinations; one of his three brothers, [[C. H. Dodd]], achieved particular distinction as a [[New Testament]] scholar. Having attended [[Grove Park Grammar School]] in the town he went up to [[New College, Oxford]] in 1911, and after graduating in [[history]], joined the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (2nd West Lancashire Field Ambulance) in 1914 with whom he saw active service in [[France]].

Dodd was appointed [[lecturer]] in history at [[University of Wales, Bangor|University College, Bangor]] in 1919, and succeeded Sir [[John Edward Lloyd]] as professor of history there in 1930, a post he retained until his retirement in 1958. He also taught in the Extra-Mural Department, and was stalwart of the [[Workers' Educational Association|WEA]] (Workers' Educational Association) and the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]. In retirement he was curator of Bangor Museum, and taught at [[Bangor Normal College]] (now part of the University of Wales, Bangor).

He was a founder member of the [[Denbighshire]] Historical Society and edited a history of Wrexham to coincide with the Borough Centenary Celebration in 1957. He was made a [[wikt:freeman|freeman]] of the Borough of Wrexham in 1963. A centenary celebration of his birth was held in Wrexham in 1991.

Though not a native speaker, Dodd was a supporter of the [[Welsh language]] and brought up his children as Welsh speakers, at a time when the language had far less social status than now.

'''Dr. Alexander Hewat (or Hewatt)''' (1739–1824; b. [[Roxburgh]], [[Scotland]]) was the first historian of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; best known for his two volume work "''An Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Colonies of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]''".&lt;ref name="Hewat" /&gt; He remained loyal to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] during the [[American Revolution]], and as a result his property was seized and he was expelled in 1777.&lt;ref name="Meroney" /&gt;

==Life and work==
Hewat(t) was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister&lt;ref name="Smyth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="briggs" /&gt; who officiated in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] from 1763 to 1777. After the publication of his History in 1779, he was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] doctorate degree by Edinburgh University.&lt;ref name="allibone" /&gt; His character may be illustrated by one of his Sermons cited by [[Smollett]].&lt;ref name="smollett" /&gt;

''Gold is the idol of every traitor, and he that proves faithful to his king and country for a great reward only, will betray them both for a greater.  What was the method [[Constantius Chlorus]] took to try the souls of his public servants, both civil and military? Being friendly disposed towards the Christian religion, and sensible how hard it was to know the human heart, we are told, that he assembled his officers and judges, and proposed to them this condition, either to sacrifice to demons, or leave the court and their places to others, giving each liberty of choice. By this device he divided his servants into two parties, into men of principle, and men of the world.'' (p.&amp;nbsp;347)

Hewat believed that Religion was important for the cohesion of society, where every man should do his duty according to the station in life that [[Divine Providence|Providence]] had allocated to him. In a 1794 sermon on ''The Duty of Man in Perilous Times'' cited by ''[[English Review (18th century)|The English Review]]'' he warned: "''Let the superior ranks beware how they introduce into society an irreverence for God, and a distaste for religion; for they cannot do so but at their peril." The lower ranks are taught their duty, and warned against: the dangers of civil convulsion, with equal propriety.'' &lt;ref name="Sermon" /&gt;

Hewat's History of South Carolina and Georgia includes observations of the peoples of the area, so although its account of early history may be inaccurate to a degree and his historical interpretation of the events of the times no longer in fashion, his observation of facts continues to be cited, especially his accounts of slaves &lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; and Native Americans. Hewat may have been only a "gentleman historian" but he had the advantage of first-hand observation, with the ability, time, and local contacts required for a remarkably dispassionate account of pre-revolutionary Carolina. Hewat's history, one author said, "''is the basis — in fact the substance — of [[David Ramsay (congressman)|Ramsay]]'s history,&lt;ref name="Ramsay" /&gt; which quotes him copiously (without acknowledgement) and follows him blindly.''"&lt;ref name="SHA" /&gt; A less strident assessment is that Ramsay "''shows a disposition to follow slavishly in the footsteps of Hewat.''"&lt;ref name="mode" /&gt;

Contemporaneous resident of Charleston, but on the Revolutionary side, [[David Ramsay (congressman)|Congressman David Ramsay]] acknowledged his extensive use of Hewat's History, writing in his 1808 Preface: "''Dr. Hewat's historical account of the rise and progress of the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, was read with much more advantage — on it greater reliance was placed — and of it more use has been made, than of all the histories which had preceded. To him every Carolinian ought to be obliged for preserving many useful facts which otherwise would before this day have been forgotten. His valuable work was written shortly before the American Revolution, when tradition went further back and was more recent than at present.''" &lt;ref name="Ramsay" /&gt;

Hewatt Square, in Charleston, South Carolina, was named for him.&lt;ref name="SRC" /&gt;

Hewat's History is still a respected account of [[Colonial history of the United States#Carolinas|Colonial American history]], has been transcribed by Project Guttenberg, and is still in print. Incidentally, the "Hewatt" spelling was apparently introduced after his book was published anonymously; manuscript letters (below) show that he himself spelled his name "Hewat".

==Family==
Hewat came from a long line of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] farmers, [[notaries]] and churchmen. The earliest record of the name appears to be a William Hewat (born about 1366); the UK National Archives show he bore witness to a grant of land and tenement at Nustede (Newstead) in 1387.  Peter Hewat (born before 1482) was a [[Notary]] in Roxburgh Scotland; the National Archives of Scotland show he was a witness to an assignment of land to the church on 16 September 1503.  James Hewat, was a [[Dominican Order]] friar in Dundee in the 1520s, and one of the earliest teachers of Calvin's doctrine in Scotland. In the conflicts between [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestant]] and then [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Puritan]] religions, Hewats often found themselves on the wrong side. In 1619 (the year before ''[[Mayflower]]'') Peter Hewat&lt;ref name="Mullan" /&gt; a church leader, notary and member of the [[Parliament of Scotland]], was exiled to [[Abbot of Crossraguel|Crossraguel Abbey]] (which had been given to him in 1612 by the king) after [[James VI of Scotland]] had become head of the official Anglican church as [[James I of England]]. By the 18th century Hewats were farming around Roxburgh when Alexander's grandfather James was expelled from his kirk for taking over other people's land. However, Alexander's father Richard (1707–1776) became an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] of the church and is described on his [[tombstone]], still standing in Roxburgh churchyard, as "an honest and industrious man and a sincere and devout Christian".

==Alexander Hewat's arrival in Charleston and his History of the Colony==

''Hewat was a young man of about twenty-four when he arrived in Charleston in 1763 as minister of the Scots (First Presbyterian) Church there. He had received his early education at [[Kelso High School (Scotland)|Kelso Grammar School]] in Scotland and had attended the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Shortly after his arrival in Charleston he was elected to the St. Andrew's Club, an organisation of native-born Scotsmen which included some of the colony's leading men, and so had the chance to secure authentic evidence and first-hand experience for his historical narrative. His association with royal officials gave him access to official documents which he used in his history.''&lt;ref name="Meroney" /&gt;

Hewat's first volume attempts to outline the earliest settlement of North America, and the reasons for the influx of British, French and other European migrants in the early 17th century due to religious conflict at home. He wrote: "''Amidst cold, hunger, toil, disease, and distress of every kind, they comforted themselves with the thoughts of being removed far out of the reach of tyrants, and triumphed in their deliverance from an idolatrous and wicked nation.''" &lt;ref name="Hewat_Puritans" /&gt;

Hewat describes in much detail the conditions and customs of American Indians, with whom he shows sympathy despite their threat to European immigrants. "''When [[Julius Caesar]] carried the Roman arms into Britain, and [[Germanicus]] over-ran the forests of Germany, did they not find the [[Wild Natives (Spanish)|silvestres]] of those countries little, if at all, more civilized than the brown natives of America?''"&lt;ref name="Hewat_Indians" /&gt; And even some humour ... "''In case of adultery among Indians, the injured husband considers himself as under an obligation to revenge the crime, and he attempts to cut off the ears of the adulterer... This is more severe than the law of [[Æthelberht of Kent#Law code|Ethelbert]], which admitted of a fine from the adulterer, and obliged him to purchase another wife for the injured husband''."&lt;ref name="Ethelbert" /&gt;

He describes the settlement of Carolina by aristocratic British [[Lords Proprietors|Proprietors]], the setting up of plantations, wars with the Indians, the Spanish and Pirates, and the hardships of the climate. "''New settlers in all countries and climates are subject to many hardships, especially such as are in low and indigent circumstances; but those of the first settlers of Carolina must have equalled, if not surpassed, every thing of the kind to which men in any age have been exposed.''"&lt;ref name="Hewat_Climate" /&gt; He describes the ravages of [[smallpox]], [[yellow fever]] and other diseases on both the native and immigrant population.

Hewat describes the introduction of African slaves, and maintains that "''[[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Hawkins]] had no idea of perpetual slavery, but expected they would be treated as free servants, after they had by their labours brought their masters an equivalent for the expense of their purchase... Hence arose that horrid and inhuman practice of dragging Africans into slavery; which has since been so pursued, in defiance of every principle of justice and religion... Nature has given the people of the one continent no superiority over those of the other; the advantages of Europeans were the effects only of art and improvement.''"&lt;ref name="Hewat_Hawkins" /&gt;

Hewat saw Africans as more suited to the SC climate, and essential to the Southern Economy, but imagined an [[indentured servant]] system similar to that which existed for white immigrants, and supposed that the conditions of slavery would incite them to revolt, as indeed they did at Stono in September 1739. "''At this time there were above forty thousand negroes in the province, a fierce, hardy and strong race, whose constitutions were adapted to the warm climate, whose nerves were braced with constant labour, and who could scarcely be supposed to be contented with that oppressive yoke under which they groaned.''"&lt;ref name="Hewat_Stono" /&gt;

Hewat's own brother Andrew, used Black labour on his plantation, and after the Revolution at least one followed him into exile, first to [[Nova Scotia]], and then back to [[Roxburgh]]. Indeed, many [[Black Loyalists]] fought against the revolution, and left with [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|White Loyalists]] as a result. The economic requirement for Black labour in the South, and the growing opposition to slavery in Britain, may have been one of the roots of the revolution in the South, just as it was later in the civil war. In his history, Hewat points to errors made by the British Administration, and is careful not to criticise unduly the revolutionaries, setting out their complaints in some detail about what they saw as unfair taxation, or indeed any taxation at all by a parliament they claimed could not, at that distance, represent them. He did however passionately believe that Britain and America had more to achieve united than separated.

''When Hewat, along with other Charleston ministers, was ordered on 3 August 1776 to pray no more for the king, he "changed the form to 'those in Lawful Authority over us' which gave great Offence," but complied with the letter of the order. Given sixty days to leave the colony or suffer imprisonment and perhaps death, Hewat left his congregation and his property and took passage to [[Nantes]]; from there, he went to London. Charleston had been recaptured by British forces by the time Hewat received the honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Edinburgh University on 12 July 1780. He obviously expected to return to his home, for he signed the Laureation Book of the University as a resident of "Charlestown, South Carolina." American animosity against those who had not supported the rebellion relegated loyalists to historical oblivion; nor did the British receive them with generosity or pay them honour for their sacrifice.''&lt;ref name="Meroney" /&gt;

[[File:Alexander Hewat MS Letter.gif|thumb|right|Dr Alexander Hewat's letter To G. Edwards, 28 September 1820. Charleston Library Society MS#79 via Ogden Hammond.]]

==Manuscript copy of Dr Alexander Hewat's letter of 28 September 1820==

On the death of his wife (formerly Mrs Barksdale of Charleston), Hewat wrote to G. Edwards, her relation in Charleston, showing much affection still for South Carolina. This manuscript clearly shows that he spelled his name "Hewat".

''George Edwards, Charleston So., Carolina''

''Carolina Coffee House (London), 28 September 1820''

''Dr Hewat presents his best respects to Mr &amp; Mrs Edwards, and having an excellent opportunity sends them by the Bearer two miniature pictures which belong to the good family of Barksdale. From what he often heard during Mrs Hewat's lifetime he has reason to conclude they will be particularly acceptable to Mrs Edwards of whom Mrs Hewat often spoke with much affection. They will be handed to her by Mr Hall in the same condition &amp; in the Same Box in which they were left by the Deceased; and She will be pleased to accept of them in memorial of two dear and beautiful relations. They both died in [[Flanders]] and were brought to England &amp; buried, to which place their Mother at her request was also conveyed &amp; buried betwixt them in the same Tomb at [[Dover]]. I never saw the children, having never met their Mother in England till both were above three years &amp; dead &amp; buried; tho' she belonged to my Parish before she was first married; and Mr Barksdale I remember well, and together with Mr &amp; Mrs Gordon I approved of the Choice she made. Mr Thomas Braidwood our English Teacher of the Deaf &amp; Dumb has oft expressed to me his surprise at the degree of perfection to which the child had attained in speaking; but her mother, anxious for still greater proficiency, was advised to carry her to another famous master in France, which advice was to her matter of great lamentation till Death. Farewell &amp; God bless you &amp; all friends in Carolina.''

==Death==
Alexander Hewat died in [[Marylebone]], London on 3 March 1824 at the age of 85.

He left an [[Estate (law)|estate]] of 7000 [[Pound sterling|sterling]] (equivalent to almost £500,000 in 2000), including a small legacy to the Scots church in Charleston, and is buried in [[St. John's Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=190144&amp;queryType=1&amp;resultcount=1 U.K. Death Duty Registers, Public Record Office, 20 May 1824	PROB 11/1686].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Lewis Vail''' (September 25, 1807 – January 18, 1859) was an American [[machinist]] and inventor.  Along with [[Samuel Morse]], Vail was central in developing and commercializing American [[telegraphy]] between 1837 and 1844.&lt;ref name="parks.morris.nj.us"&gt;[http://www.parks.morris.nj.us/speedwell/tel/tel.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321094151/http://www.parks.morris.nj.us/speedwell/tel/tel.html |date=March 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vail and Morse were the first two telegraph operators on Morse's first experimental line between [[Washington, DC]], and [[Baltimore]], and Vail took charge of building and managing several early telegraph lines between 1845 and 1848.  He was also responsible for several technical innovations of Morse's system, particularly the sending key and improved recording registers and relay magnets.  Vail left the telegraph industry in 1848 because he believed that the managers of Morse's lines did not fully value his contributions.

His last assignment, superintendent of the Washington and New Orleans Telegraph Company, paid him only $900 a year, leading Vail to write to Morse, "I have made up my mind to leave the Telegraph to take care of itself, since it cannot take care of me.  I shall, in a few months, leave Washington for New Jersey, ... and bid adieu to the subject of the Telegraph for some more profitable business."&lt;ref&gt;Morse, Edward L., ed.  Samuel F. B. Morse, His Letters and Journals.  New York, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--only first two paragraphs have citations--&gt;
Vail's parents were Bethiah Youngs (1778–1847) and [[Stephen Vail]] (1780–1864). Vail was born in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], where his father was an entrepreneur and industrialist who built the [[Speedwell Ironworks]] into one of the most innovative iron works of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/alfred-vail-woi/ Alfred Vail], World of Invention. Accessed June 1, 2008. "Alfred Vail was born on September 25, 1807, in Morristown, New Jersey, where his father, Stephen, operated the Speedwell Iron Works."&lt;/ref&gt; Their son and Alfred's brother was [[George Vail]], a noted politician.

Alfred attended public schools before taking a job as a [[machinist]] at the iron works. He enrolled in [[New York University]] to study theology in 1832, where he was an active and successful student and a member of the [[Eucleian Society]], graduating in 1836.&lt;ref name="parks.morris.nj.us" /&gt; Visiting his [[alma mater]] on September 2, 1837, he happened to witness one of [[Samuel F. B. Morse]]'s early telegraph experiments. He became fascinated by the technology and negotiated an arrangement with Morse to develop the technology at Speedwell at his own expense in return for 25% of the proceeds. Alfred split his share with his brother George Vail.  When Morse took on [[Francis O. J. Smith]], a congressman from Maine, as a partner, he reduced the Vails' share to one-eighth. Morse retained patent rights to everything Vail developed.

After having secured his father's financial backing, Vail refined Morse's crude prototype to make it suitable for public demonstration and commercial operation. The first successful completion of a transmission with this system was at the Speedwell Iron Works on January 6, 1838, across two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) of wiring. The message read "A patient waiter is no loser." Over the next few months Morse and Vail demonstrated the telegraph to Philadelphia's [[Franklin Institute]], members of Congress, and President [[Martin Van Buren]] and his cabinet.  Demonstrations such as these were crucial to Morse's obtaining a Congressional appropriation of $30,000 to build his first line in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore.

Vail retired from the telegraph operations in 1848 and moved back to Morristown. He spent his last ten years conducting genealogical research. Since Vail shared a one-eighth interest in Morse's telegraph patents with his brother George, Vail realized far less financial gain from his work on the telegraph than Morse and others.

His papers and equipment were subsequently donated by his son Stephen to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and [[New Jersey Historical Society]].

Vail's cousin was [[Theodore N. Vail]], who became the first president of [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]].

==Morse code==
Alfred Vail and Samuel Morse collaborated in the invention of [[Morse code]]. A controversy exists over the role of each in the invention.  The argument for Vail being the original inventor is laid out by several scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Franklin Leonard. "The American Inventors of the Telegraph, with Special References to the Services of Alfred Vail." Century Illustrated Magazine 35 (April 1888), 924–45.

The argument offered by supporters of Morse claims that Morse originally devised a cipher code similar to that used in existing [[semaphore line]] telegraphs, by which words were assigned three- or four-digit numbers and entered into a codebook. The sending operator converted words to these number groups and the receiving operator converted them back to words using this codebook.

Morse spent several months compiling this code dictionary. It is said by Morse supporters that Vail, in public and private writings, never claimed the code for himself.  According to one researcher, in a February 1838 letter to his father, Judge Stephen Vail, Alfred wrote, "Professor Morse has invented a new plan of an alphabet, and has thrown aside the Dictionaries."&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth.  Lightning Man:  The Accursed Life of Samuel F.B. Morse.  New York, 2003, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  In an 1845 book Vail wrote describing Morse's telegraph, he also attributed the code to Morse.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Vail, The American Electro Magnetic Telegraph:  With the Reports of Congress, and a Description of all Telegraphs Known, Employing Electricity or Galvanism, Philadelphia:  Lea &amp; Blanchard, 1845.  Reprinted by New York:  Arno Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A US Army base was named in his honor. [[Camp Vail]] in [[Eatontown]], New Jersey, later renamed [[Fort Monmouth]], was an Army housing complex. After World War II the families of servicemen and civilian Army employees negotiated with the Army to purchase the development, which was later named Alfred Vail Mutual Association, and due to the work of the Town Clerk the residents retained the rights to the original Charter of [[Shrewsbury Township, New Jersey|Shrewsbury Township]] Est. 1693. This housing development exists to this day under that name. An elementary school near the Speedwell Works, in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], is named "Alfred Vail."

'''William Ambrose Bebb''' (4 July 1894 – 27 April 1955) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] language critic, author and politician.

Ambrose Bebb was the son of diarist Edward Hughes Bebb, and the father of noted Welsh rugby international [[Dewi Bebb]]. The family came from [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]].

A co-founder of [[Plaid Cymru]],{{citation needed|reason=Bebb is not quoted in the article on Plaid Cymru as a co-founder|date=November 2015}} Bebb took a keen interest in politics and was inclined towards [[fascism]], influenced by [[Charles Maurras]] of the [[Action Française]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Richard (2004) "Another Form of Fascism: The Cultural Impact of the French ‘Radical Right’ in Britain" in Gottlieb, Julie V. (ed.) ''Culture of Fascism: Visions of the Far Right in Britain'' I. B. Tauris &amp; Co., London, {{ISBN|1-4175-1621-6}} pp. 174-175&lt;/ref&gt; With the outbreak of the Second World War,  Bebb became a vocal proponent of the [[War Effort]] against [[Nazi Germany]], and considered Germany's total defeat "essential".&lt;ref&gt;A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 599&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1945 General Election Mr Bebb stood for the Plaid Cymru in the seat of [[Caernarvonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarvonshire]], and came in third place.

Ambrose Bebb was the grandfather of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aberconwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberconwy]], [[Guto Bebb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/wales_politics/8687037.stm|title='First 11' of new Welsh MPs start|date=18 May 2010|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asep is highly dedicated in his field. He encourages his nation to appreciate and relearn about the country’s history. “A great nation is the one that can appreciate its history. The reason why this nation is never great is because we refuse to appreciate history”, Asep stated firmly and spiritedly.

But the past is not Asep’s only passion. He’s also passionate about his name that he co-founded [[:id:Paguyuban Asep Dunia|Paguyuban Asep Dunia]] (World Asep Community). There are so many people bearing the name Asep they made a club out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.brilio.net/community/faces-of-jakarta-asep-kambali-president-of-asep-community-170428k.html |publisher=Jakarta Globe |title=Faces of Jakarta: Asep Kambali, President of Asep Community |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Brothers}}
A '''brother''' is a [[male]] [[sibling]]. Although the term typically refers to the consanguineal relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-consanguineal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Mufwene, Salikoko S. For example Beau is brother to Serge as they have the same mother and father."The pragmatics of kinship terms in Kituba." (1988): 441-454.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''brother'' comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *bʰréh₂tēr, which becomes [[Latin language|Latin]] ''frater'', of the same meaning. Sibling warmth, or sibling affect between male siblings has been correlated to some more negative effects. In pairs of brothers higher sibling warmth is related to more risk taking behaviour although risk taking behaviour is not related to sibling warmth in any other type of sibling pair. The cause of this phenomenon in which sibling warmth is only correlated with risk taking behaviours in brother pairs still is unclear. This finding does, however, suggest that although sibling conflict is a risk factor for risk taking behaviour, sibling warmth does not serve as a protective factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solmeyer|first1=Anna|last2=McHale|first2=Susan|last3=Crouter|first3=Ann|title=Longitudinal Associations Between Sibling Relationship Qualities and Risky Behavior Across Adolescence|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=February 2014|volume=50|pages=600–610|doi=10.1037/a0033207|pmc=3797172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest that girls having an older brother delays the onset of [[menarche]] by roughly one year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/08/18/2985389.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that the likelihood of being [[homosexuality|gay]] increases with the more older brothers a man has.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10287958/Having-more-older-brothers-increases-likelihood-of-being-gay.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some analyzers have suggested that a man's attractiveness to a heterosexual woman may increase with the more he resembles her brother, while his [[unattractiveness]] may increase the more his likeness diverges from her brother.&lt;ref&gt;Bereczkei, Tamas, Petra Gyuris, and Glenn E. Weisfeld. "Sexual imprinting in human mate choice." Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences 271.1544 (2004): 1129-1134.&lt;/ref&gt; Females with a twin or very close-in-age brother, sometimes view him as their male alter ego, or what they would have been like, if they had a Y chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, Robyn. "Other selves: subjectivity and the doppelganger in Australian adolescent fiction." Writing the Australian child: Texts and contexts in fictions for children (1996): 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraternal relationship==
The book Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII written by Aristotle in ¬350 B.C.E., offers a way in which people should view the relationships between biological brothers. The relationship of brothers is laid out with the following quote: 
"The friendship of brothers has the characteristics found in that of comrades and in general between people who are like each other, is as much as they belong more to each other and start with a love for each other from their very birth, and in as much as those born to the same parents and brought up together and similarly educated are more akin in character; and the test of time has been applied most fully and convincingly in their case"&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, and W.D Ross. "The Internet Classics Archive | Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle." The Internet Classics Archive | Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle. Classics Archive, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
For these reasons, it is the job of the older brother to influence the ethics of the younger brother by being a person of good action. Aristotle says "by imitating and reenacting the acts of good people, a child becomes habituated to good action". Over time the younger brother will develop the good actions of the older brother as well and be like him. Aristotle also adds this on the matter of retaining the action of doing good once imitated: "Once the habits of ethics or immorality become entrenched, they are difficult to break."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers Victor, Kelly. "Raising Ethical Kids with Insights from Plato and Aristotle." Smartparenting.com. SMRT, 26 Mar. 2014. Web. 2 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The good habits that are created by the influence of the older brother become habit in the life of the younger brother and turn out to be seemingly permanent. It is the role of the older brother to be a positive influence on the development of the younger brother's upbringing when it comes to the education of ethics and good actions. When positive characteristics are properly displayed to the younger brother by the older brother, these habits and characteristics are imitated and foster an influential understanding of good ethics and positive actions.

The '''Catalan State''' ({{lang-ca|Estat Català}}, {{IPA-ca|əsˈtat kətəˈla|IPA}}) was a short-lived state proclaimed during the [[events of 6 October]] 1934 by [[Lluís Companys]] as the "Catalan State within the Spanish Federal Republic".

==History==
[[File:Lluis Companys.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Lluís Companys i Jover]]
On 6 October 1934 the [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia]], Lluís Companys ([[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]]), proclaimed the Catalan State within the Spanish Federal Republic. The event was part of a [[Revolution of 1934|semi-insurrectional program of the left]] against the new Spanish right-wing republican government led by [[Alejandro Lerroux]], which incorporated as ministers some members of the [[Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas|CEDA]], Spanish political party that was considered close to [[fascism]] and, therefore, they feared that it was the first step of this party to take the power as [[Hitler]] and [[Mussolini]] made in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Noble |first1=Thomas F.X. |last2=Strauss |first2=Barry |last3=Osheim |first3=Duane |last4=Neuschel |first4=Kristen |last5=Accampo |first5=Elinor |title=Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries |date=2010 |publisher=[[CEngage Learning]] |isbn=0495900745 |page=733 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5W-Hei1Rg5UC&amp;pg=PA773 |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt was quickly aborted by the Spanish government, the general [[Domènec Batet]], chief of the IV Organic Division in Catalonia, crushed the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Finestres| first1=Jordi| last2=López| first2=Manel| title = Entre la revolució i l'estelada| year=2014| publisher=Sàpiens| location=Barcelona| language=Catalan| issn=1695-2014|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companys was arrested and imprisoned; the autonomous government suspended, and virtually all its members jailed. After the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] victory in the [[Spanish general election, 1936|February 1936 Spanish general election]], his government was pardoned and reinstated in their functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pagès i Blanch|first1=Pelai|title=War and Revolution in Catalonia, 1936–1939|date=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004254277|pages=16-17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfZ0AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proclamation==
In the afternoon of October 6, Lluís Companys appeared on the balcony of the Generalitat accompanied by his advisers and proclaimed the Catalan Republic.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this solemn hour, in the name of the people and the Parliament, the Government over which I preside assumes all the faculties of power in Catalonia, proclaims the Catalan State of the Spanish Federal Republic, and in establishing and fortifying relations with the leaders of the general protest against Fascism, invites them to establish in Catalonia the provisional Government of the Republic, which will find in our Catalan people the most generous impulse of fraternity in the common desire to erect a free and magnificent federal republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Separatists' Rising: Bloodshed in Barcelona|work=The Times|date=8 October 1934|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Consequences==
In the failed rebellion forty-six people died: thirty-eight civilians and eight soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Casanova |first=Julián |authorlink=Julián Casanova Ruiz |title=República y Guerra Civil.

Azaña was also arrested, who happened to be in Barcelona to attend the funerals of the former minister of his cabinet, Jaume Carner. The soldiers who had taken part of the insurrection, the commander Enrique Pérez Farrás and the captains Escofet and Ricart, were condemned to death, their sentence being commuted to life imprisonment by the President of the Republic, Alcalá Zamora, in spite of the protests of both the [[CEDA]] and the Republican Liberal Democrat Party of [[Melquíades Álvarez (politician)|Melquiades Álvarez]] , who demanded a strong hand.&lt;ref&gt;Casanova (2007), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The President and the Government of the Generalitat were tried by the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal and were sentenced for military rebellion to thirty years in prison, which was carried out by some in the Cartagena prison and others in the [[Puerto de Santa María]] . On February 23, 1935, the [[Mayor of Barcelona]] and the detained councilors were provisionally released.&lt;ref name=Termes&gt;{{cite book |last=Termes |first=Josep |title=De la Revolució de Setembre a la fi de la Guerra Civil (1868-1939).

The government of Lerroux unleashed "a harsh repressive wave with the closure of political and trade union centers, the suppression of newspapers, the removal of municipalities and thousands of detainees, without having had a direct action on the facts", which showed "a punitive will often arbitrary and with vengeance components of class or ideological".&lt;ref name="De la Granja"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De la Granja |first1=José Luis |last2=Beramendi |first2=Justo |last3=Anguera |first3=Pere |title=La España de los nacionalismos y las autonomías |year=2001 |publisher=Síntesis|location=Madrid |isbn=84-7738-918-7 |pages=134–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalan autonomy was suspended indefinitely by a law passed on December 14 at the proposal of the Government (the CEDA demanded the repeal of the Statute) and the Generalitat of Catalonia was replaced by a Council of the Generalitat appointed by the Government and a president called Governor General of Catalonia (the first was [[Colonel]] Francisco Jiménez Arenas, who acted as "accidental president" of the Generalitat since October 7, and who in January 1935 was replaced by [[Manuel Portela Valladares]] ). In April 1935, when the state of war was lifted, Portela was replaced by the radical juan Pich y Pon, and some of the powers of the Generalitat were returned to him, but not those of Public Order.&lt;ref name=Termes/&gt; La Lliga participated in that government, "which confirmed its image as an accomplice of the enemies of autonomy and alienated middle class sectors from it, although at the same time, since the end of October, it denounced the central government for taking advantage of the situation created to suppress or reduce the autonomic faculties, maintaining that "a people should not be punished for the mistakes of their rulers". In the name of La Lliga, the vice-president of the Catalan parliament, A. Martínez Domingo, challenged before the Guarantees Court the law of January 2, 1935, which emptied the Generalitat of its contents".&lt;ref name="De la Granja"/&gt;

The Law of Cultivation Contracts was annulled and almost three thousand eviction lawsuits of " rabassaires " and sharecroppers were processed . The nationalist and left-wing newspapers were suspended.&lt;ref name=Termes/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2449">In Linguistics, '''change from above''' refers to conscious change to a language. That is, speakers are generally aware of the linguistic change and use it to sound more dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Sharon. "Social Class."" The Handbook of Language Variation and Change, 402-422. Malden, Mass: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in contrast to [[change from below]].

Change from above usually enters formal speech, not the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt; Labov, William. "Transmission and Diffusion." Language.Volume 83, Number 2, June 2007, 344-387. Linguistic Society of America.&lt;/ref&gt; This change usually begins with speakers in higher social classes and diffuses down into the lower classes. Upper classes use these new linguistic forms to differentiate themselves from the lower classes, while lower classes use these forms to sound more formal and similar to the upper class. However, the concepts of change from above and below refer to consciousness and not social class.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram,Walt and Schilling-Estes, Natalie. American English: Dialects and Variation. Blackwell Publishers. p.4. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Diffusion==

Diffusion is a major kind of change. It includes changes of words, sounds, mergers, and reassignment of words to different categories. A person picks up these changes over a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~levmichael/pubs/l_michael_soc_lang_chng_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Women usually tend to lead in these kinds of variation and in change from above in general. This is also the case for change from below.&lt;ref&gt;http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~levmichael/pubs/l_michael_soc_lang_chng_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Labov's Work==

[[William Labov]] (1927-) is a linguistic professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in language change, and is a major figure in [[sociolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/Sociolinguistics/WilliamLabov&lt;/ref&gt; Change from above is seen in Labov's New York Department Store [https://antro-ling.wikispaces.com/file/view/Labov_The+social+stratification+of+English+in+NYC.pdf study] exhibiting the social stratification of New York City, where the upper classes reintroduced the word-final pronunciation of /r/ as a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] form.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Sharon.

== History ==
''Cycle Chic'' is a modern phrase to describe something that has existed since the invention of the [[bicycle]] in the 1880s - regular citizens on bicycles. Cycling was fashionable from the late 1880s and through the 1940s. 
[[File:Liebig bike polo.jpg|thumb|Cycle polo, early 20th century]]
At the end of the 19th century, the height of ''cycle chic'' was to play [[Cycle polo|polo]] on bicycles, using long-handled tennis rackets and rubber balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE-GAAAAIAAJ|pages=272|title=Crusades and crinolines|author=Ishbel Ross|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's wear (such as [[corset]]s and [[petticoat]]s) was impractical for cycling and so [[rational dress]] was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgqkLrQEbfMC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=1999 |title=The 1900s |isbn=978-1-896990-70-5 |author=Elizabeth Salomons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Divided skirts, [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] and [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] were tried as fashionable women attempted to resolve the matter without provoking hostility, ridicule or violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vphcHONAXmwC|pages=117|title=Fashion and Its Social Agendas|author=Diana Crane|isbn=978-0-226-11799-7|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the 1980s [[bicycle messenger]]s became a common sight on the streets of major cities, and the messengers' mix of street fashion and cycling gear was seen as an alternative fashion statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Street Smart | journal = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | volume = 354 | issue = 6310 | date = October 1989 | pages = 65| id = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=O5KWH9rNuE4C&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=bicycle%20messengers%20fashion%2080s&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=messengers&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine, owned by [[Quincy Jones]], listed brands that had "infiltrated" cycling such as [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[DKNY]] and [[Fila (company)|FILA]] with ''cycle chic''.&lt;ref name="vibe"&gt;{{cite journal | title = GEAR: Cycle chic | journal = [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] | date = November 1995 | pages = 103| id = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_CsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=vibe%20november%201995&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q=cycle%20chic&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2013-07-20| last1 = Group | first1 = Vibe Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clothing shares little with the contemporary perception of the phrase, however, as it was more focused the bicycle messenger crowd.

Around the time that Mikael Colville-Andersen coined the phrase Cycle Chic, the bicycle had largely disappeared from the public consciousness as a transport option, at least in many North American cities, though that was not the case in northern Europe. The first photo taken by Mikael Colville-Andersen in 2006, which led to the Copenhagen Cycle Chic blog and the global trend has been referred to as "The Photo That Launched a Million Bicycles".&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/cycle-chic/story-e6frg8h6-1225902227493?nk=3ba548b7da29f5ef03bdf104211726d9 | title = Cycle Chic | last=Safe | first=Georgina | newspaper=The Australian | location=Sydney | date=2010-08-06 | accessdate = 2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Chain+Reaction/6735071/story.html | title = Chain Reaction | date=2012-05-24 | last=Babin | first=Tom | newspaper=Calgary Herald | location=Calgary | accessdate = 2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tribaspace.com/news/5484-copenhagen-cycle-chic%3A-redefining-bike-culture-one-turn-at-a-time-iiwii|title=Copenhagen Cycle Chic: Redefining Bike Culture One Turn at a Time|author=Megan Cahn|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/fashion-and-beauty/fashion/cycle-chic-style-on-two-wheels/article11287605/|title=Cycle chic: Style on two wheels |author=Samantha Grice |location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|date=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current bicycle boom in transportation and fashion has its roots in this one photo.

Today cycle chic is associated with the American phrase [[utility cycling]], people cycling to get around, not just for exercise or at sporting events. It is particularly associated with wearing everyday clothes with an emphasis on stylish dressing.&lt;ref name=cr&gt;{{citation|title=Two wheels|author=Carlton Reid|url=http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/wellbeing/story/0,,2287337,00.html|publisher=The Guardian|date=June 26, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycle chic is especially prominent in cities with many bicycle-commuters such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Copenhagen]] but the number of Cycle Chic blogs around the world indicates that the interest is global in nature.

Official and unofficial blogs encourage cyclists to dress up, as a way of raising the profile of cycling and to encourage others to feel they can cycle without helmets and the specialist clothing associated with sports cycling. Articles in the media promote fashionable cycling by publishing photographs of celebrities such as [[Agyness Deyn]] riding bikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/invest-save/in-the-red-i-finally-like-bicycles-maybe-im-just-a-wickerbasket-case-936108.html|title=In The Red: I finally like bicycles&amp;nbsp;...

==Bicycles and accessories==
[[File:Cycling couple.JPG|thumb|right|280px|A Dutch couple in their normal, formal or fashionable clothes.]]
Vintage bicycles dating back to the 1950s and 60s are especially seen as appropriate, with their mudguards, chain guard, carriers, baskets and lights all contributing to their usefulness. The point is to be able to cycle casually without special protection, with shopping or pets, even with a passenger riding on the rack (although that is illegal in some countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Easy Rider|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2010/08/06/what-to-wear-when-cycling|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=2011-07-13|publisher=[[Vogue (British magazine)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models mentioned in various early 21st century media include vintage [[Schwinn]]s, three-speed [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]]s, the [[Velorbis]],&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; and the new-vintage models made by [[Pashley Cycles|Pashley]]s and [[Brooklyn Bicycle Co.]], all bicycles which incorporate classic vintage features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bernard |first1=Katherine |title=Fashion Cycles: The Best Bikes—and the Pre-Fall Looks That Go With Them |url=http://www.vogue.com/868714/fashion-cycles-the-best-bikes-and-the-pre-fall-looks-that-go-with-them/ |website=Vogue.com|publisher=Condé Nast |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scandinavian type of [[cargo bike]], capable of carrying large loads or several small children, is becoming more popular in other countries influenced by the trend.

Picking up on the cycle chic trend early on, various fashion houses like [[Chanel]] and [[Gucci]] designed their own bicycles.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;

[[Bicycle helmet]]s are notably absent from the official Copenhagen Cycle Chic website, not because Danish people do not wear helmets (although most don't) but as a matter of policy associated with the Cycle Chic® trademark. The policy is promoted on the basis that the evidence does little to support the idea that helmets increase safety, and that they discourage people from cycling.

== Websites ==
The term ''cycle chic'' is associated with many related [[blog]]s picturing people, especially women, cycling in stylish everyday clothes. There are over 100 ''Cycle Chic'' blogs and most of them are associated with the community formed around the original blog, ''Copenhagen Cycle Chic'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://copenhagencyclechic.com/ Cycle Chic - The Original from Copenhagen]&lt;/ref&gt; dubbed "the [[Sartorialist]] on two wheels" and selected as one of the ten best fashion blogs by [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/feb/21/10-best-fashion-bloggers The Guardian/Observer]&lt;/ref&gt; The company [[Copenhagenization (bicycling)|Copenhagenize Design Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenize.eu | title = Copenhagenize Design Co. | accessdate = 2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Copenhagen, holds the ''Copenhagen Cycle Chic'' and ''Copenhagenize.com'' blogs as well as the ''Cycle Chic'' [[Trademark#International law|territorial trademark]] in the United States&lt;ref name="trademark2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4008:cptdb5.2.1 | title = Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) record 85032525 | accessdate = 2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil and encourages usage "for the idealistic purpose of non-commercial bicycle advocacy",&lt;ref name="trademark1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cyclechic.dk/cycle_chic_trademark_guidelines.htm | title = Cycle Chic trademark guidelines | accessdate = 2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described in a manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/2008/04/cycle-chic-manifesto.html|title=The Cycle Chic Manifesto|publisher=copenhagencyclechic.com|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5199">'''Denis Saurat''' (21 March 1890 – 7 June 1958) was an Anglo-French scholar, writer, and broadcaster on a wide range of topics, including explaining French society and culture to the English and what he called "philosophical poetry."

==Biography==
He was born in [[Toulouse]] and died in [[Nice]], France, but his most active years were spent in London, England. His views on the connection in the [[early modern period]] between the poetry of [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[John Milton]] and the [[occult]], represented in particular by the [[Kabbalah]], were ahead of their time: without surviving close scholarly analyses, they anticipated later studies such as those of [[Frances Yates]].&lt;ref&gt;E.gm. Frances Amelia Yates, ''The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age'' (1999 edition), pp. 178-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also interpreted in light of Philosophical Poetry the Prophetic Books of  [[William Blake]] and discussed Blake's relationship to Milton and Celtic antiquarians.&lt;ref&gt;Mona Wilson, ''The Life of William Blake'', notes p. 118, 191, 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Scottish Renaissance]]" was brought into critical prominence by Saurat in his article "{{lang|fr|Le Groupe de la Renaissance Écossaise}}", which was published in the ''{{lang|fr|[[Revue Anglo-Américaine]]}}'' in April 1924.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a doctorate of the [[University of Bordeaux]], and a ''lauréat des concours d'agrégation'' in 1919, he became associated with the Department of French at [[King's College London]] from 1920, where he was a professor from 1926. He was also director for many years of the [[French Institute of London]] (''Institut Français'') in South Kensington. During [[World War II]] his position there and his wish to maintain the autonomy of the Institut led him into a serious clash with [[Charles de Gaulle]]. This concerned not only the politics of the Free French, but also Saurat's resistance to the General's technocratic ambitions for the ''Institut''. Under official pressure to move to [[Bristol]], Saurat came through with support from [[Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Atkin, ''The Forgotten French'' (2003), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he resigned from the Institut, retired from the University,and settled in Nice. In his last years he took an active interest in PEN International, composed poems in Occitan, his mother tongue, and wrote best-selling books of speculative non-fiction on [[Atlantis]] and the early history of Earth.

'''Edmund Oscar von Lippmann''' (January 9, 1857 in Vienna – September 24, 1940 in Halle) was a German [[chemist]] and natural science historian.&lt;ref name="OBL"&gt;"[http://epub.oeaw.ac.at/oebl_5/238.pdf Lippmann, Edmund Oscar von (1857–1940), Chemiker]" entry in ''Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815–1950'', Vol. 5, 1971, p. 238 [http://epub.oeaw.ac.at/oebl/oebl_L/Lippmann_Edmund-Oscar_1857_1940.xml metadata]&lt;/ref&gt; For his writings he was awarded a couple [[honoris causa]] doctorates from German universities, as well as the [[Leibniz Medal]] and the [[Sudhoff Medal]].&lt;ref name="OBL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Read | first1 = J. | title = Studien zur Gewchichte der Chemie Festgabe Edmund O v Lippmann zum siebzigsten Geburtstaqe | doi = 10.1038/119451a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 2995 | pages = 451–452 
| year = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He studied at the [[ETH Zurich]] and obtained a doctorate in 1878 under [[Robert Bunsen]] at [[Heidelberg University]]. Lippmann ran large [[Sugar refinery|sugar refineries]], in [[Duisburg]] and later in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. During this phase of his career he was granted the title of professor in 1901.&lt;ref name="OBL"/&gt; In 1904, Lippmann founded the [[Sugar Museum (Berlin)|Berlin Sugar Museum]], still open today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdtb.de/Home.645.0.html|title=Main page|quote=The Sugar Museum was opened on the 8th of May 1904. The initiator of the museum was Edmund Oskar von Lippmann, the doyen of the history of sciences and sugar.|accessdate=24 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926–1933, he taught as a volunteer at [[Martin Luther University]] in Halle. In 1935, under the new Nazi regime he was stripped of the authority to teach because of his Jewish ancestry.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In 1878 Lippmann published his first edition of what would become a reference monograph on sugar chemistry in his time. The 3rd edition of this work, published in 1904 in two volumes was 2000 pages long and attempted to cover every aspect of what had become a vast field. A contemporary review in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' noted that "With a modesty as charming as it is rare, he states in his preface: 'Completeness could not be attained in any direction', and yet this work is the most thorough of all works ever published on the chemistry of sugars", concluding that it was "rivaled by few, excelled by none".&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Wiechmann, "Reviewed work(s): Die Chemie der Zuckerarten by Edmund O. Von Lippmann", Science New Series, Vol. 20, No. 499 (Jul. 22, 1904), pp. 111–112 {{JSTOR|1630622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890 Lippmann wrote an extremely detailed and influential history of sugar processing, ''Geschichte des Zuckers: seiner Darstellung und Verwendung, seit den ältesten Zeiten bis zum Beginn der Rübenzucker Fabrikation'' (History of sugar from the ancient times until the beginning of [[beet sugar]] production). To make it more accessible, he wrote an abridged version in 1894, which was also translated in French. In 1929 he published an updated version of his initial volume (824 pp). Although an influential work in its day, 21st century scholars found it to be misleading with respect to sugar production in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Ouerfelli2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed Ouerfelli|title=Le sucre: production, commercialisation et usages dans la Méditerranée médiévale|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16310-2|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lippmann also wrote extensively on the history of [[alchemy]], from the perspective of it being a forerunner of chemistry rather than more philosophical considerations. His three-volume ''Entstehung und Ausbreitung der Alchemie'' (Origin and propagation of Alchemy) is considered to contain the most detailed account of Greek alchemy, superseding earlier accounts of [[Marcellin Berthelot]] and C. Ruelle in accuracy.&lt;ref name="Martels1990"/&gt; In 1920, [[George Sarton]] wrote in his review of the first volume that it was a "truly monumental work, the greatest single addition to our knowledge of ancient chemistry (and also to our knowledge of human superstition) since the days of [[Hermann Franz Moritz Kopp|Kopp]]".&lt;ref&gt;George Sarton, "Reviewed work(s): Entstehung und Ausbreitung der Alchemie by Edmund O. von Lippmann", ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'', Vol. 3, No. 2 (Autumn, 1920), pp. 302–305, {{JSTOR|224029}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the 1931 volume, Sarton warned that the portion dealing with Arabic materials was of lesser quality than the rest, particularly with respect to spelling of Arabic names.&lt;ref&gt;George Sarton, "Reviewed work(s): Entstehung und Ausbreitung der Alchemie by Edmund O. von Lippmann", ''Isis''
Vol. 16, No. 2 (Nov., 1931), pp. 462–463&lt;/ref&gt; Yet more recent reevaluations point to some deficiencies in citation style that make the text difficult to follow back to primary sources. More compact accounts have been written since.&lt;ref name="Martels1990"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Z. R. W. M. von Martels|title=Alchemy revisited: proceedings of the International Conference on the History of Alchemy at the University of Groningen, 17–19 April 1989|year=1990|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-09287-7|pages=21–22|author=Brian Vickers|chapter=The Discrepancy between res and verba in Greek Alchemy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 1982 he directed excavations at the [[Templo Mayor]], the remains of a major [[Aztec]] [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] in central [[Mexico City]].

Matos Moctezuma graduated with a master's degree in archaeology from the [[National School of Anthropology and History]] and a master's degree in anthropology from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. He has excavated at archaeological sites in both the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] area and in central [[Mexico]]. In addition to the Templo Mayor project, Matos has directed major fieldwork projects at the sites of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] and [[Teotihuacan]]. He has also made important contributions to the study of the history of archaeology in Mexico.

Matos Moctezuma was director of the [[Templo Mayor]] project from 1978 to 1982, one of the most important archaeological projects in the world. Several seasons of excavations uncovered the construction history of this central temple of the [[Aztec Empire]], where numerous artefacts were unearthed, overturning scholarly understanding of [[Aztec religion]], empire, and ideology. Matos Moctezuma oversaw the creation of the [[Templo Mayor Museum]] in which these spectacular finds are displayed, and he directed the Museum for many years. 1987 saw the creation of the Urban Archaeology Program (directed by Matos) in which excavations in downtown Mexico City were expanded beyond the immediate site of the Templo Mayor. This research continues today.

Eduardo Matos Moctezuma has published nearly 500 works during his career. His books include technical archaeological reports, interpretive works on archaeological finds, scholarly studies in the history of archaeology, exhibition catalogs, and collections of chapters. In addition to his work at the Templo Mayor and its museum, Matos Moctezuma has held many important posts in the field of [[Mexican archaeology]]. For the National Institute of Anthropology and History, he has directed the Department of Pre-Hispanic Monuments, the Archaeology Council, and the National Museum of Anthropology and History. He has also worked to explain archaeology and Aztec civilization to the public through lectures, writings, and museum exhibits.

Professor Matos has received many honors and awards, both in Mexico and in other countries. The most notable is election to the [[Colegio Nacional (Mexico)|Colegio Nacional]], a prestigious group of the top scholars and artists in Mexico. He has been distinguished as a ''[[Ordre des Palmes Académiques|Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Palmes Académiques]]'', ''[[Ordre National du Mérite|Chevalier de l'Ordre National du Mérite]]'' and given the ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]'' by the Government of [[France]]. He has also received [[Venezuela]]'s Andrés Bello Award, [[Harvard University]]'s Henry B. Nicholson Medal and an honorary doctorate in science by the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. He is also a member of the [[Germany|German]] Archaeological Institute, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], the Mexican Society of Geography and Statistics, the [[Mexican Academy of History]] and many other professional organizations. He was awarded the [[National Science and Arts Prize]] in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7521">In [[linguistics]], an '''eggcorn''' is an [[idiosyncratic]] substitution of a word or phrase for a word or words that sound similar or identical in the speaker's dialect (sometimes called  [[Juncture#Oronyms|oronyms]]). The new phrase introduces a meaning that is different from the original but plausible in the same context, such as "old-timers' disease" for "[[Alzheimer's disease]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title =eggcorn ''n.'' |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=fifth |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston |isbn=0-547-04101-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An eggcorn can be described as an intra-lingual [[phono-semantic matching]], a matching in which the intended word and substitute are from the same language.  

==Etymology==
The term ''eggcorn'' was coined by professor of [[linguistics]] [[Geoffrey Pullum]] in September 2003 in response to an article by [[Mark Liberman]] on the website [[Language Log]], a [[blog]] for linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Pullum suggested using "eggcorn" itself as a label.

==Similar phenomena==
An eggcorn differs from  a [[malapropism]], the latter being a substitution that creates a nonsensical phrase. Classical malapropisms generally derive their comic effect from the fault of the user, while eggcorns are substitutions that exhibit creativity, logic&lt;ref name=PsyTod&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peters |first=Mark |title=Word Watch: The Eggcorn – Lend Me Your Ear |journal=Psychology Today |volume=39 |issue=2 |page=18 |date=March–April 2006 |deadurl=yes |url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20060214-000002.html |accessdate=2006-07-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709191315/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20060214-000002.html |archivedate=2006-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Scientific citation needed|date=November 2017}} or [[ignorance]]. Eggcorns often involve replacing an unfamiliar, archaic, or obscure word with a more common or modern word ("baited breath" for "[[wikt:with bated breath|bated breath]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Staff |title = The word: Eggcorns |page=52 |publisher = New Scientist |date = 2006-08-26

The phenomenon is similar to the form of wordplay known as the [[pun]] except that, by definition, the speaker or writer intends the pun to have some humorous effect on the recipient, whereas one who speaks or writes an eggcorn is unaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LADY MONDEGREEN SAYS HER PEACE ABOUT EGG CORNS|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000074.html|date=2 Nov 2003|first=Arnold|last=Zwicky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also similar to, but differs from, [[mondegreen]]s or a [[folk etymology]].&lt;ref name="Snowclone_Def"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000061.html |title=Phrases for lazy writers in kit form |date=October 27, 2003 |first=Geoffrey K |last=Pullum |authorlink=Geoffrey Pullum |publisher=[[Language Log]] |accessdate=November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evangelos Kofos''' ({{lang-el|Ευάγγελος Κωφός}}), was born in [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]] in 1934 and graduated from [[Anatolia College|Anatolia College of Thessaloniki]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=SpeAd&gt;"Evangelos Kofos/ Special Adviser."

&lt;/ref&gt;  His grandfather, Evangelos Ant. Kofou, had been an elected elder of the Greek Community Council in the then Ottoman-held Edessa, responsible for the Greek schools of the region.  A generation later, his father, Andonis Ev. Kofou, had been organized in the Resistance in Edessa during the [[Battle of Greece|German occupation]], until his arrest and imprisonment in 1943 in a notorious prison camp in [[Thessaloniki]]. As a result, the family moved to the mother’s ([[Anna Avaropoulou Kofou]]) native town, Thessaloniki.

Evangelos Kofos has been a Special Adviser on Balkan affairs at the [[Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy]], [[Athens]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Kofos, Evangelos. ELIAMEP Thesis (2009): 1. European Paraliament, Apr. 2009. Web. 13 June 2014. &lt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/d-mk/dv/0120_08/0120_08en.pdf&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpeAd" /&gt;

In 1995 he was appointed Visiting Fellow on Greek Studies at [[Brasenose College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]].  Prior to this he had served for over thirty years at the Greek [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] as Special Consultant on Balkan Affairs and retired with the rank of ambassador-counselor.&lt;ref name="SpeAd" /&gt;

He holds a Ph.D. in History from [[Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]] (1993), a M.A. in International Relations from [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington D.C.]] (1959), and a B.Sc  in Journalism from [[Ohio University]], [[Athens, Ohio|Athens]], [[Ohio]] (1955). Kofos is a member of several academic societies and served for many years as Special Counsellor on Balkan affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Athens. He is also the author of a number of books and essays on Greek and Balkan issues. Two of his books, [[Greece and the Eastern Crisis, 1875-1878]], (Thessaloniki 1975 in English. Athens, 2001 in Greek) and [[The History of the Macedonian Question in the 19th and 20th centuries]] \[in Greek, 1993, unpublished\],) have received [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] awards. His earlier book, [[Nationalism and Communism in Macedonia]], (Thessaloniki, 1964, reissued with additional essays, New York, 1993) has been considered a pioneering  work on a controversial Balkan issue.&lt;ref name="SpeAd" /&gt;

In more recent years he has been engaged with projects dealing with the [[Kosovo]] and [[Macedonian issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Prof. Evangelos Kofos, PhD Held a Quest Lecture - FON University." Prof. Evangelos Kofos, PhD Held a Quest Lecture - FON University. FON, n.d. Web. 13 June 2014. &lt;http://www.fon.edu.mk/novost.aspx?cid=57&amp;ln=en&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he co-edited with [[Thanos Veremis]] the book [[Kosovo, Avoiding Another Balkan War]] (Athens, ELIAMEP) and subsequently he published his own book [[Kosovo and the Albanian Unification; The Burden of the Past, the Anguish of the Future]] (Athens, 1998, in Greek)). In 2005, he co-edited with [[Vlasis Vlasidis]] the book, [[Athens-Skopje: An Uneasy Symbiosis, 1995-2002]] (Athens, ELIAMEP, in English) and in 2008 he co-edited with [[Ioannis Stefanidis]] and Vlasis Vlasidis a new volume, [[Makedonikes Taftotites sto Chrono. Diepistimonikes Prosengisies]] ("Macedonian Identities in Times. Interdisciplinary Approaches"), Thessaloniki, Athens, Patakis publishers, 2008.

In 1999 the President of the Hellenic Republic [[Constantine Stephanopoulos]] decorated him with the Golden Cross of the Order of Phoenix for his services and all round meritorious work,. Ten years later, in 2010, the Academy of Athens bestowed on him its Award for the entirety of his scholarly work.&lt;ref name="SpeAd" /&gt;

----
'''Ferdinand Hitzig''' (23 June 1807&amp;ndash;22 January 1875), was a German biblical critic.

He was born at Hauingen (now a part of [[Lörrach]]), [[Baden, Germany|Baden]], where his father was a pastor.
He studied theology at [[university of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] under H.E.G. Paulus, at [[University of Halle|Halle]] under [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] and at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] under [[Georg Heinrich August Ewald|Ewald]]. Returning to Heidelberg he became ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in theology in 1829, and in 1831 published his ''Begriff der Kritik am Alten Testamente praktisch erörtert'', a study of [[Old Testament]] criticism in which he explained the critical principles of the grammatico-historical school, and his ''Des Propheten Jonas Orakel über Moab'', an exposition of the 5th and 16th chapters of the book of [[Isaiah]] attributed by him to the prophet [[Jonah]] mentioned in ''2 Kings'' xiv. 25.

In 1833 he was called to the [[University of Zürich]] as professor ordinarius of theology. His next work was a commentary on [[Isaiah]] with a translation (''Übersetzung und Auslegung des Propheten Jesaias''), which he dedicated to Heinrich Ewald, and which [[Hermann Hupfeld]] (1796–1866), well known as a commentator on the [[Psalms]] (1855–1861), pronounced to be his best exegetical work. At Zürich he laboured for a period of twenty-eight years, during which, besides commentaries on ''The Psalms'' (1835–1836; 2nd ed., 1863–1865), ''The Minor Prophets'' (1838; 3rd ed., 1863), ''Jeremiah'' (1841; 2nd ed., 1866), ''Ezekiel'' (1847), ''Daniel'' (1850), ''Ecclesiastes'' (1847), ''Canticles'' (1855), and ''Proverbs'' (1858), he published a monograph, ''Über Johannes Markus und seine Schriften'' (1843), in which he maintained the chronological priority of the second [[gospel]]. He wrote works of [[archaeology|archaeological]] interest, of which the most important are ''Die Erfindung des Alphabets'' (1840), ''Urgeschichte und Mythologie der Philister'' (1845), and ''Die Grabschrift des Eschmunezar'' (1855).

After the death in 1860 of [[Friedrich Umbreit]], one of the founders of the well-known ''Studien und Kritiken'', Hitzig was called to succeed him as professor of theology at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. Here he wrote his ''Geschichte des Volkes Israel'' (1869–1870), in two parts, extending respectively to the end of the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] domination and to the fall of Masada, 72 AD, as well as a work on the Pauline epistles, ''Zur Kritik Paulinischer Briefe'' (1870), on the Moabite Stone, ''Die Inschrift des Mescha'' (1870), and on [[Assyria]]n, ''Sprache und Sprachen Assyriens'' (1871), besides revising the commentary on [[Book of Job|Job]] by [[Ludwig Hirzel]], first published in 1839.

He was also a contributor to the ''Monatsschrift des wissenschaftlichen Vereins'' in Zürich, the ''Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft'', the ''Theologische Studien und Kritiken'', [[Eduard Zeller]]'s ''Theologische Jahrbücher'', and [[Adolf Hilgenfeld]]'s ''Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie''. Hitzig died at Heidelberg.

His lectures on biblical theology (''Vorlesungen über biblische Theologie und messianische Weissagungen'') were published in 1880 after his death, along with a portrait and biographical sketch by his pupil, [[Johann Jakob Kneucker|J. J. Kneucker]] (b. 1840), professor of theology at Heidelberg.

== Belshazzar and his historicity ==
It has been charged that certain “fundamentalists” were wrong in citing Hitzig as an example of those who denied the historicity of Belshazzar.&lt;ref&gt;In the present Wikipedia article, this claim was made in an entry made on September 10, 2006. Despite its misrepresentation of what Hitzig wrote (the person making the entry apparently could not read Hitzig’s German), this accusation trying to vindicate Hitzig against his critics was allowed to stand until it was deleted as factually incorrect in January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; But Hitzig really did hold the erroneous position ascribed to him by conservative scholars, as shown by what he wrote in his commentary on the Book of Daniel.&lt;blockquote&gt;Selbst den Fall gesetzt, dass der fragliche Koenig Mediens existiert habe, wurde der Name, unter welchen er bei Daniel auftritt, zu beanstanden sein. Jene zweiheit in Nabonned = Baltasar wiederholt sich in Cyaxares = Darius, und wieder zu Daniels nachteil.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinant Hitzig, ''Das Buch Daniel'' (Leipzig: Weidman, 1850) p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
Translation:
Even supposing that the king of the Medes in question [i.e., Darius; Dan 5:31] had existed, the objection is the name under which he is referenced in Daniel. Each of the two were standardized in Nabonidus = Belshazzar which is repeated in Cyaxares = Darius, to Daniel’s discredit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One could wish that German scholars would learn from the French how to express things with clarity and elegance. Nevertheless, what can be extracted from this quote is that Hitzig thought that, historically, there was no such person as Belshazzar, or alternately, that the deluded author of the book of Daniel made two mistakes: he gave Nabonidus the name Belshazzar and Cyraxares the name Darius. Hitzig’s position logically followed from his presupposition that the book of Daniel was a fraud perpetrated by a nameless author in Maccabean times. Such a deceiver could not have known a genuine name of Belshazzar from the sixth century BC, because at the time Hitzig wrote, all resources available to him outside of the Bible and texts derived from the Bible named Nabonidus as the last king of Babylon, without any mention of Belshazzar. This conclusion was therefore a natural consequence of the starting assumptions, which were the presuppositions accepted by the radical criticism of the day. As the Jewish Encyclopedia explains: &lt;blockquote&gt;The name “Belshazzar” was previously held to have been invented by the author of the Book of Daniel, which has long been recognized as a Maccabean production (see DANIEL). Since the discovery and decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions, however, “Belshazzar” is now generally admitted to be the Hebrew-Aramaic equivalent of the Babylonian form ‘Belsharuṣur’ (Bel preserve the king), which has been found in the cuneiform documents as the name of the eldest son of Nabonidus (Nabuna'id), the last native king of Babylon (555-538 B.C.).&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Encyclopedia'', article Belshazzar (NY and London: Funk and Wagnalls, 1909).[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2846-belshazzar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A modern evaluation of Hitzig’s scholarship should take into consideration not only his starting presuppositions, but also how the deductions from those presuppositions have led to numerous errors in judgment that have later proved to be unsustainable.

[[File:Waulking 18th century engraving.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Scotswomen singing a [[waulking song]] while walking or fulling cloth, c.&amp;nbsp;1770.]]

'''Fulling''', also known as '''tucking''' or '''walking''' (spelled '''waulking''' in [[Scotland]]), is a step in [[woolen|woollen]] [[Textile manufacturing|clothmaking]] which involves the cleansing of [[cloth]] (particularly [[wool]]) to eliminate oils, dirt, and other impurities, and to make it thicker. The worker who does the job is a '''fuller''', '''tucker''', or '''walker''',&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gareth ''Daniel Rhydderch of Aberloch'', reproduced from The Western Mail July 17, 1933 accessed at {{cite web |url=http://colley.co.uk/garethjones/rural_wales/daniel_rhydderch.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311112410/http://colley.co.uk/garethjones/rural_wales/daniel_rhydderch.htm |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }} June 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have become common surnames. The [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]] word for a fulling mill is ''pandy'', which appears in many place-names, for example [[Tonypandy]] ("fulling mill lea").

==Process==
Fulling involves two processes, scouring and milling (thickening). Originally, fulling was carried out by the pounding of the woollen cloth with a club, or the fuller's feet or hands. In [[Scottish Gaelic]] tradition, this process was accompanied by [[waulking song]]s, which women sang to set the pace. From the medieval period, however, fulling was often carried out in a [[water mill]], followed by stretching the cloth on great frames known as tenters, to which it is attached by [[tenterhook]]s. It is from this process that the phrase ''being on tenterhooks'' is derived, as meaning to be held in suspense. The area where the tenters were erected was known as a [[tenterground]].

===Scouring===
In Roman times, fulling was conducted by slaves working the cloth while ankle deep in tubs of human [[urine]]. Urine was so important to the fulling business that it was [[urine tax|taxed]]. Stale urine, known as wash, was a source of [[ammonium]] salts and assisted in cleansing and whitening the cloth. By the medieval period, [[fuller's earth]] had been introduced for use in the process. This is a soft clay-like material occurring naturally as an impure [[hydrous]] [[aluminium silicate]]. It was used in conjunction with wash. More recently, soap has been used.

===Thickening===
The second function of fulling was to thicken cloth by matting the fibres together to give it strength and increase waterproofing ([[felting]]). This was vital in the case of [[woolen|woollens]], made from [[carding]] [[wool]], but not for [[worsted]] materials made from combing wool. After this stage, water was used to rinse out the foul-smelling liquor used during cleansing. Felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation because the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibres hook together, somewhat like [[Velcro]].

==Fulling mills==
[[File:Fulling mill bockler.jpg|thumb|upright=1|A fulling mill from [[Georg Andreas Böckler]]'s ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'', 1661]]

From the medieval period, the fulling of cloth often was undertaken in a [[water mill]], known as a fulling mill, a walk mill, or a tuck mill, and in [[Wales]], a pandy. In these, the cloth was beaten with wooden hammers, known as fulling stocks or fulling hammers. Fulling stocks were of two kinds, falling stocks (operating vertically) that were used only for scouring, and driving or hanging stocks. In both cases the machinery was operated by [[cam]]s on the shaft of a [[waterwheel]] or on a [[tappet]] wheel, which lifted the hammer.

Driving stocks were pivoted so that the foot (the head of the hammer) struck the cloth almost horizontally. The stock had a tub holding the liquor and cloth. This was somewhat rounded on the side away from the hammer, so that the cloth gradually turned, ensuring that all parts of it were milled evenly. However, the cloth was taken out about every two hours to undo plaits and wrinkles. The 'foot' was approximately triangular in shape, with notches to assist the turning of the cloth.

==History==
There are several Biblical references to fulling (2 Kings 18:17; Isaiah 7:3 and 36:2; Malachi 3:2; Mark 9:3). Prior to this, at least one reference appears in the speeches of Lysias, written in Athens during the 5th century BC. By the time of the [[Crusades]] in the late eleventh century, fulling mills were active throughout the medieval world.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woods (2005), "How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization", ''How the Monks Saved Civilization'' '''33''' &lt;/ref&gt; They appear to have originated in 9th or 10th century in Europe. The earliest known reference to a fulling mill in France, which dates from about 1086, was discovered in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Gimpel, ''The Medieval Machine'' (2nd ed., Pimlico, London 1992 repr.), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Genoa|Timeline of Genoa}}

==Flag==
[[File:Palazzo Ducale Genova 02.jpg|thumbnail|upright|St. George's flag flying on the [[Doge's Palace, Genoa|Doge's Palace]] in Genoa]]
The flag of Genoa is a [[St. George's Cross]], a red cross on a white field; the [[flag of England]] comes from the flag of Genoa, as remarked by the Duke of Kent in 1992: "The St. George's flag, a red cross on a white field, was adopted by England and the City of London in 1190 for their ships entering the Mediterranean to benefit from the protection of the Genoese fleet. The English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the Doge of Genoa for this privilege." 

The patron saint of Genoa was Saint [[Lawrence of Rome|Lawrence]] until at least 958, but the Genoese transferred their allegiance to [[Saint George]] at some point during the 11th or 12th century, most likely with the rising popularity of the "warrior saint" during the [[Crusades]]. Genoa also had a banner displaying a cross since at latest 1218, possibly as early as 1113.&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, ''British Flags'', 1922, 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; But the cross banner was not associated with the saint; indeed, the saint had his own flag, the ''vexillum beati Georgii'' (first mentioned 1198), a red flag showing George and the dragon. A depiction of this flag is shown in the Genoese annals under the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this "Saint George's flag", from at least 1218, known as the ''insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' ("cross ensign of the commune of Genoa"). 

The saint's flag was the city's main war flag, but the cross flag was used alongside it in the 1240s.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Ziggioto, "Genova", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, "Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Saint George|Saint George's]] flag (i.e. the flag depicting the saint) remained the main flag of Genoa at least until the 1280s. The flag now known as the "St. George's Cross" seems to have replaced it as Genoa's main flag at some point during the 14th century. The ''[[Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms]]'' (c. 1385) shows it, inscribed with the word ''iustiçia'', and described as:
{{bquote|And the lord of this place has as his ensign a white pennant with a red cross. At the top it is inscribed with 'justice', in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;transcription after the edition by Joaquín Rubio Tovar (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Geography==
The city of Genoa covers an area of {{convert|243|km2|sqmi}} between the [[Ligurian Sea]] and the [[Apennine Mountains]]. The city stretches along the coast for about {{convert|30|km|mi}} from the neighbourhood of [[Voltri]] to Nervi, and for {{convert|10|km|mi}} from the coast to the north along the valleys [[Val Polcevera|Polcevera]] and [[Bisagno (stream)|Bisagno]]. The territory of Genoa is popularly divided into 5 main zones: the centre, the west, the east, the [[Polcevera]] and the Bisagno Valley.

Genoa is adjacent to two popular Ligurian vacation spots: [[Camogli]] and [[Portofino]]. In the metropolitan area of Genoa lies [[Aveto Natural Regional Park]].
{{wide image|Panorama di Genova.jpg|800px|A panoramic view of Genoa}}

===Climate===
Genoa has a borderline subtropical (''Cfa'') and Mediterranean climate (''Csa'') in the [[Köppen climate classification]], since only one summer month has less than {{convert|40|mm|2|abbr=out}} of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely oceanic or Mediterranean; with a special note for the [[Genoa low]].

The average yearly temperature is around {{convert|19|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. In the coldest months: December, January and February, the average temperature is {{convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|6|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. In the warmest months – July and August – the average temperature is {{convert|27.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|21|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. The daily temperature range is limited, with an average range of about {{convert|6|C-change|0}} between high and low temperatures. Genoa also sees significant moderation from the sea, in stark contrast to areas behind the Ligurian mountains such as [[Parma]], where summers are hotter and winters are quite cold.

Annually, the average 2.9 of nights recorded temperatures of ≤{{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} (mainly in January). The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-8|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the night of February 2012; the highest temperature ever recorded during the day is {{convert|38.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the August 2015. Average annual number of days with temperatures of ≥{{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} is about 8, average four days in July and August.&lt;ref name=ServizioMeteorologico/&gt;

Average annual temperature of the sea is {{convert|17.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, from {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the period January–March to {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August.

Genoa is also a windy city, especially during winter when [[Tramontane|northern winds]] often bring cool air from the [[Po Valley]] (usually accompanied by lower temperatures, high pressure and clear skies). Another typical wind blows from [[Sirocco|southeast]], mostly as a consequence of atlantic disturbances and storms, bringing humid and warmer air from the sea. Snowfall is sporadic, but does occur almost every year, albeit big amounts in the city centre are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimbus.it/liguria/rlm44/neve_mediterraneo.htm |title=La neve sulle coste del Mediterraneo |website=Nimbus.it|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimbus.it/liguria/rlm50/statistica_meteorologica.htm |title=Appunti di statistica meteorologica  |website=Nimbus.it|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual average [[relative humidity]] is 68%, ranging from 63% in February to 73% in May.&lt;ref name=ServizioMeteorologico/&gt;

Sunshine hours total above 2,200 per year, from an average 4 hours of sunshine duration per day in winter to average 9 hours in summer. This value is an average between the northern half of Europe and North Africa.&lt;ref name="weather2travel"/&gt;

===Main sights===
[[File:Palazzo Ducale Genoa.jpg|thumb|[[Doge's Palace, Genoa|Doge's Palace]], ancient seat of the government of the oligarchic republic]]
[[File:Palazzo San Georgio Genova W.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palazzo San Giorgio|Palace of Saint George]], built in 1260]]
[[File:Cimitero staglieno-veduta2-wiki.jpg|thumb|Staglieno: A monumental cemetery]]

Notable to the city are the [[Palazzi dei Rolli]], included in [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] ''[[Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli]]''. The world-famous Strade Nuove are [[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|via Garibaldi]] (Strada Nuova), [[Via Cairoli (Genoa)|via Cairoli]] (Strada Nuovissima) and [[Via Balbi (Genoa)|via Balbi]] (Strada Balbi). Among the most important palaces are the [[Palazzo Rosso]], [[Palazzo Bianco]], Palazzo Podestà o di Nicolosio Lomellino, [[Palazzo Reale (Genoa)|Palazzo Reale]], [[Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola]], [[Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca]] and [[Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria]].

Genoa's historic centre is articulated in a maze of squares and narrow ''caruggi'' (typical Genoese alleys). It joins a [[medieval]] dimension with following 16th century and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] interventions (the ancient Via Aurea, now [[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|Via Garibaldi]]).

Near [[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|Via Garibaldi]], through the public elevator Castelletto Levante, one can reach one of the most scenic places in the city, [[Castelletto (Genoa)|Belvedere Castelletto]]. The centre of Genoa is connected to its upper part by ancient paths caught between tall palaces, called ''creuze''. Walking along these small paths one can reach magnificent places like the Santuario di Nostra Signora di Loreto. Very beautiful is the upper ring road so-called Circonvallazione a Monte that includes Corso Firenze, Corso Paganini, Corso Magenta, Via Solferino, and Corso Armellini.

[[Saint Lawrence Cathedral|San Lorenzo cathedral]] has a splendid portal and the dome designed by [[Galeazzo Alessi]]. Inside is found the treasure of the Cathedral where among other objects there is also what is said to be the [[Holy Chalice]].

The symbols of the city are the [[Lighthouse of Genoa|Lanterna]] (the lighthouse) ({{convert|117|m|abbr=off}} high), old and standing lighthouse visible in the distance from the sea (beyond {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}}), and the monumental fountain of [[Piazza De Ferrari (Genoa)|Piazza De Ferrari]], recently restored, out-and-out core of the city's life. Near [[Piazza De Ferrari (Genoa)|Piazza De Ferrari]] and [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] is the Mazzini Gallery, a typical nineteenth-century structure with many elegant shops and coffee bars.

Another tourist destination is the ancient seaside district of [[Boccadasse]] (which means "the mouth of the donkey"), with its multicolour boats, set as a seal to [[Corso Italia (Genoa)|Corso Italia]], the promenade which runs along the Lido d'Albaro, and known for its ice-creams. After Boccadasse you can continue along the sea up to [[Sturla]].

[[File:Genova-Porta Soprana-DSCF7083.JPG|thumb|Medieval gates of Genoa are a rare survivor of the city's oldest buildings.]]
[[File:Palazzo Reale - Genova.jpg|thumb|Royal Palace of Genoa, 16th century]]
Just out of the city centre, but still part of the {{convert|33|km|0|abbr=on}} of coast included in the municipality's territory, are [[Nervi]], natural doorway to the Ligurian East [[Italian Riviera|Riviera]], and [[Pegli]], the point of access to the West [[Italian Riviera|Riviera]]. Nervi offers many attractions: the promenade overlooking the sea called {{ill|Passeggiata Anita Garibaldi|it}}; parks covered with lush tropical vegetation; numerous villas and palaces open to the public that now house museums (like GAM-Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Raccolte Frugone Museum, Museo Giannettino Luxoro and Wolfsoniana). (see also {{ill|Parchi di Nervi|it}}) The East Riviera of Genoa called Riviera di Levante is part of the [[Italian Riviera]]. East Riviera is full of interesting towns to visit, and then from Genoa to east are: [[Bogliasco]], [[Pieve Ligure]], [[Sori, Liguria|Sori]], [[Recco]], [[Camogli]], [[Portofino]], [[Santa Margherita Ligure]], [[Rapallo]], [[Zoagli]], [[Chiavari]], [[Lavagna]] and [[Sestri Levante]]. In the west, [[Pegli]] is the site of the famous [[Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini]] and [[Arenzano]] is a seaside town at the foot of the [[Parco naturale regionale del Beigua]].

The new Genoa based its rebirth upon the restoration of the green areas of the immediate inland parts, among them the [[Parco naturale regionale del Beigua]], and upon the construction of facilities such as the [[Aquarium of Genoa]] in the Old Harbour - the biggest in Italy and one of the major in Europe - and its [[Marina]] (the tourist small port which holds hundreds of pleasure boats). All of these are inside the restored Expo Area, arranged in occasion of the Columbian Celebrations of 1992.

Near the city are [[Camogli]] and [[San Fruttuoso abbey]] accessible by a daily ferry from the Old Harbour (Porto Antico) of Genoa. In the seabed in front of the San Fruttuoso abbey there is the [[Christ of the Abyss]]. From the Old Harbour one can reach by boat other famous seaside places around Genoa such as [[Portofino]] or a little more distant, [[Lerici]] and the [[Cinque Terre]].

The regained pride gave back to the city the consciousness of being capable of looking to the future without forgetting its past. The resumption of several flourishing hand-crafting activities, far-back absent from the ''caruggi'' of the old town, is a direct evidence of it. The restoration of many of Genoa's churches and palaces in the 1980s and the 1990s contributed to the city's rebirth. A notable example the [[Renaissance]], [[Santa Maria Assunta, Genoa|Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta]], sitting on the top of the hill of Carignano and visible from almost every part of the city. The total restoration of [[Doge's Palace, Genoa|Doge's Palace]] - once venue of [[doge of Genoa|dogi]] and senators and nowadays location of cultural events - and of the Old Harbour and the rebuilding of [[Teatro Carlo Felice]], destroyed by the [[Second World War]] bombings that only spared the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassic]] pronao of the architect [[Carlo Barabino]], were two more points of strength for the realisation of a new Genoa.

Genoa could not renounce, especially as from the 1960s, to a great renewal, which as happened in several other metropolis, should necessarily get through the realisation of big [[public housing]] complexes, whose quality, utility and functionality has been and still is controversial for those residents living there. Concerning this, the most known cases are those of the so-called "Biscione", a development in the shape of a long snake, situated on the hills of the populous district of [[Marassi]], and the one of the group of houses known as "Le Lavatrici" (the washing machines), in the district of Prà.

Beyond a complete restyling of the area, the ancient port zone nearby the Mandraccio opening, in Porta Siberia, was enriched by Genoese architect [[Renzo Piano]] with a large sphere made of metal and glass, installed in the port's waters, not far from the [[Aquarium of Genoa]], and unveiled in 2001 in occasion of the [[G8 Summit]] held in Genoa. The sphere (called by the citizens "Piano's bubble" or "The Ball"), after hosting an exposition of fens from Genoa's Botanical Gardens, currently houses the reconstruction of a tropical environment, with several plants, little animals and butterflies.
Piano also designed the subway stations and, in the hills area, the construction - in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] - of Punta Nave, base of the [[Renzo Piano Building Workshop]].

Nearby the Old Harbour is the so-called "[[Matitone (Genoa)|Matitone]]", a skyscraper in shape of a pencil, that lays side by side with the group of the WTC towers, core of the San Benigno development, today base of part of the Municipality's administration and of several companies.

===Churches===
[[File:Genova Duomo St. Lawrence Cathedral.jpg|thumb|[[Genoa Cathedral|St. Lawrence Cathedral]]]]
[[Genoa Cathedral|St. Lawrence Cathedral]] (Cattedrale di San Lorenzo) is the city's cathedral, built in a Gothic-Romanesque style. Other notable historical churches are the Commandery of the [[Order of Saint John|Saint John's Order]] called {{il|Commenda di San Giovanni di Prèl|it|Commenda di San Giovanni di Pré}}, [[San Matteo (Genoa)|San Matteo]], [[San Donato (Genoa)|San Donato]], [[Santa Maria di Castello]], [[Sant'Agostino (Genoa)|Sant'Agostino]] (deconsecrated since the 19th century, sometimes is used for theatrical representations), [[Santo Stefano (Genoa)|Santo Stefano]], [[Santi Vittore e Carlo, Genoa|Santi Vittore e Carlo]], [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato]], [[San Pietro in Banchi, Genoa|San Pietro in Banchi]], [[Santa Maria delle Vigne]], [[Nostra Signora della Consolazione e San Vincenzo martire (Genoa)|Nostra Signora della Consolazione]], [[San Siro (Genoa)|San Siro]], {{ill|Santa Maria Maddalena|it|Chiesa di Santa Maria Maddalena (Genova)}}, [[Santa Maria Assunta, Genoa|Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano]] and {{ill|Chiesa del Gesù|it|Chiesa del Gesù e dei Santi Ambrogio e Andrea}}. [[San Bartolomeo degli Armeni]] houses the [[Image of Edessa]] and [[San Pancrazio, Genoa|San Pancrazio]] after the World War II was entrusted to the ligurian delegation of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. These churches and basilicas are built in Romanesque (San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Commenda di San Giovanni di Pré), Gothic (San Matteo, Santo Stefano, Sant'Agostino), Baroque (San Siro) or Renaissance (Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano, San Pietro in Banchi) appearance, or a mix of different styles (Nostra Signora della Consolazione, Santissima Annunziata del Vastato; this last has a Baroque interior and a Neoclassicist façade).

[[File:Genova Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano.jpg|thumb|right|Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano]]
Another well known Genoese church is the shrine of [[Francis of Paola|Saint Francis of Paola]], notable for the outer courtyard overlooking the port and the memorial to all those who died at sea. This church is of artistic mention in that the tile depictions of the [[Stations of the Cross|Via Crucis]] Stations along the brick path to the church.

Near Genoa is found the [[Shrine of Nostra Signora della Guardia]], (the sanctuary is said to have inspired the writer [[Umberto Eco]] in making his novel [[The Name of the Rose]]). Another interesting church in the neighborhoods of Genoa is [[San Siro di Struppa]].

The city was the birthplace of several popes ([[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]], [[Pope Adrian V|Adrian V]], [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]], and [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]]) and various saints ([[Syrus of Genoa]], [[Romulus of Genoa]], [[Catherine of Genoa]], and [[Virginia Centurione Bracelli]]). The Archbishop of Genoa [[Jacobus de Voragine]], wrote the [[Golden Legend]]. Also from Genoa were: [[Giovanni Paolo Oliva]], the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]]; [[Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni]], the Archbishop of Aix; [[Ausonio Franchi]], priest, philosopher, and theologian; Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]]; and the priests [[Francesco Repetto]], [[Giuseppe Dossetti]], [[Gianni Baget Bozzo]], and [[Don Andrea Gallo|Andrea Gallo]]. The present archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal [[Angelo Bagnasco]], comes from a Genoese family but was born in [[Pontevico]], near [[Brescia]] (see also [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Archdiocese of Genoa]]).

===Buildings and palaces===
[[File:Via Garibaldi di notte (Genova).jpg|thumb|Via Garibaldi by night]]
[[File:Genoa Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli-113860.jpg|thumb|The Mirror Gallery of the Royal Palace]]
[[File:Genova - Piazza della Vittoria.jpg|thumb|[[Arco della Vittoria]]]]
The main features of central Genoa include the [[Piazza De Ferrari (Genoa)|Piazza De Ferrari]], around which are the [[Teatro Carlo Felice|Opera]] and the [[Palazzo Ducale (Genoa)|Palace of the Doges]].

The [[Palazzo di San Giorgio]] was the headquarters of the [[Bank of Saint George]] and was the place where [[Marco Polo]] and [[Rustichello da Pisa]] composed [[The Travels of Marco Polo]].

Outside the city walls is [[Christopher Columbus House]], where [[Christopher Columbus]] is said to have lived as a child. The current building is an 18th-century reconstruction of the original which was destroyed by the French naval bombing of 1684.

[[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|Strada Nuova]] (now Via Garibaldi), in the old city, was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 2006. This district was designed in the mid-16th century to accommodate Mannerist palaces of the city's most eminent families. In Genoa there are 114 noble palaces (see also {{ill|Rolli di Genova|it}}): among these 42 are inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]]. Among the [[Palazzi dei Rolli]] the most famous are [[Palazzo Rosso (Genoa)|Palazzo Rosso]] (now a museum), [[Palazzo Bianco (Genoa)|Palazzo Bianco]], {{ill|Palazzo Tursi|it|Palazzo Doria-Tursi}}, {{ill|Palazzo Gerolamo Grimaldi|it}}, {{ill|Palazzo Podestà|it}}, [[Palazzo Reale (Genoa)|Palazzo Reale]], [[Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola]], [[Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca]], [[Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria]], [[Palazzo Cicala]]. Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso are also known as Musei di Strada Nuova. The famous art college is also located on this street. The Genoese artistic renaissance begins with the construction of {{ill|Villa del Principe|it}} commissioned by [[Andrea Doria]]: the architects were [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]] and Giovanni Ponzello, the interior was painted by [[Perino del Vaga]] and the garden fountain was realised by [[Taddeo Carlone]]. In 1548 [[Galeazzo Alessi]], with the project of {{ill|Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso|it}}, designed a new prototype of Genoese palace that would be an inspiration to other architects working in Genoa as [[Bartolomeo Bianco]], Pietro Antonio Corradi, [[Rocco Lurago]], Giovan Battista Castello, and Bernardino Cantone. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] wrote [[Palazzi di Genova]] in 1622, a book dedicated to the palaces of Genoa.

Scattered around the city are many villas, built between the fifteenth and the twentieth centuries. Among the best known are: {{ill|Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera|it}}, {{ill|Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini|it}}, {{ill|Villa Doria Centurione|it}}, {{ill|Villa Durazzo Bombrini|it}}, {{ill|Villa Serra|it}}, Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, {{ill|Villa Rossi Martini|it}}, {{ill|Villa Imperiale Scassi|it}}, {{ill|Villa Grimaldi|it|Villa Grimaldi (La Fortezza)}}, {{ill|Villa Negrone Moro|it}}, {{ill|Villa Rosazza|it}}, {{ill|Villetta Di Negro|it}}, {{ill|Villa delle Peschiere|it|Villa delle Peschiere di Tobia Pallavicino}}, {{ill|Villa Imperiale|it|Villa Imperiale (Genova)}}, {{ill|Villa Saluzzo Bombrini|it}}, and {{ill|Villa Grimaldi Fassio|it|Raccolte Frugone}}.

As it regards the 19th century remember the architects Ignazio Gardella (senior), and [[Carlo Barabino]] which among other things, realises together with Giovanni Battista Resasco, the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]]. The cemetery is renowned for its statues and sepulchral monuments that preserve the mortal remains of notable personalities, including [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Fabrizio De André]], and [[Constance Lloyd]] (Oscar Wilde's wife). In the first half of the 19th century they are completed the {{ill|Albergo dei Poveri|it|Albergo dei Poveri (Genova)}} and the {{ill|Acquedotto storico|it|Acquedotto storico di Genova}}. In 1901 {{ill|Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu|it}} realised the ''Silos Granari''.

The city is rich in testimony of the [[Gothic Revival]] like [[Albertis Castle]], {{ill|Castello Bruzzo|it}}, {{ill|Villa Canali Gaslini|it}} and [[Mackenzie Castle]] designed by the architect [[Gino Coppedè]]. Genoa is also rich of [[Art Nouveau]] works, among which: {{ill|Palazzo della Borsa|it|Palazzo della Borsa (Genoa)}}, {{ill|Via XX Settembre|it|Via XX Settembre (Genova)}}, [[Hotel Bristol Palace]], {{ill|Grand Hotel Miramare|it|Grand Hotel Miramare (Genoa)}} and {{ill|Stazione marittima|it|Stazione marittima (Genoa)}}. Works of Rationalist architecture of the first half of the 20th century are [[Terrazza Martini Tower|Torre Piacentini]] and Piazza della Vittoria where [[Arco della Vittoria]], both designed by the architect [[Marcello Piacentini]]. Other architects who have changed the face of Genoa in the 20th century are: [[Ignazio Gardella]], {{ill|Luigi Carlo Daneri|it}} who realised the [[Piazza Rossetti]] and the residential complex so-called {{ill|Il Biscione|it|Biscione (quartiere di Genova)}}, {{ill|Mario Labò|it}}, [[Aldo Rossi]], {{ill|Ludovico Quaroni|it}}, [[Franco Albini]] who designed the interiors of [[Palazzo Rosso]], and {{ill|Piero Gambacciani|it}}. The [[Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art]], designed by Mario Labò, has one of the largest collections of Oriental art in Europe.

Other notable architectural works include: the [[Ponte Morandi]] by [[Riccardo Morandi]] (built 1967, collapsed 2018), the Old Harbour's new design with the [[Aquarium of Genoa|Aquarium]], the {{ill|Bigo (Genoa)|it|Bigo (Genova)|lt=Bigo}} and the {{ill|Biosfera|it|Biosfera (Genova)}} by [[Renzo Piano]], the [[Palasport di Genova]], the [[Matitone]] skyscraper, and the {{ill|Padiglione B of Genoa Fair|it|Padiglione B della Fiera di Genova}}, by [[Jean Nouvel]].

===Old harbour===
[[File:Пираты Карибского моря-1.jpg|thumb|The [[Neptune (galleon)|galleon Neptune]] in the Old Harbour]]
The old harbour ("porto antico" in Italian) is the ancient part of the port of Genoa. The harbour gave access to outside communities creating a good geographical situation for the city.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shaw, C. (2012). Genoa. In A. Gamberini &amp; I. Lazzarini (Eds.). ''The Italian Renaissance State''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The city is spread out geographically along a section of the Liguria coast, which makes trading by ship possible. Before the development of car, train, and airplane travel, the main outside access for the city was the sea, as the surrounding mountains made trade north by land more difficult than coastal trade. Trade routes have always connected Genoa on an international scale, with increasingly farther reach starting from trade along Europe's coastline before the medieval period to today's connection across continents.&lt;ref&gt;Tonizzi, Maria Elisabetta. "Genoa." ''History of World Trade Since 1450'', edited by John J. McCusker, vol. 1, Macmillan Reference USA, 2006, pp. 311-312. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library.''&lt;/ref&gt; In its heyday the [[Genoese Navy]] was a prominent power in the Mediterranean.

As the Genoa harbour was so important to the merchants for their own economic success, other nearby harbours and ports were seen as competition for a landing point for foreign traders.  In the 16th century, the Genovese worked to destroy the local shipping competition, the Savona harbour.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Taking matters into their own hands, the Genoa merchants and the politically powerful in Genoa attacked the harbour of Savona with stones.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This action was taken to preserve the economic stability and wealth of the city during the rise in prominence of Savona. The Genovese would go as far as to war with other coastal, trading cities such as Venice,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; in order to protect the trade industry.

[[Renzo Piano]] redeveloped the area for public access, restoring the historical buildings (like the Cotton warehouses) and creating new landmarks like the Aquarium, the Bigo and recently the "Bolla" (the Sphere). The main touristic attractions of this area are the famous Aquarium and the Museum of the Sea (MuMA). In 2007 these attracted almost 1.7&amp;nbsp;million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Fonte: ''[[Il Secolo XIX]]'', 17 ottobre 2008, pag. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquarium of Genoa===
[[File:La Bolla di Renzo Piano; Porto Antico Genoa (5700585868).jpg|thumb|right|[[Aquarium of Genoa]] and [[biosphere]]]]
The [[Aquarium of Genoa]] (in {{lang-it|Acquario di Genova}}) is the largest [[aquarium]] in [[Italy]] and among the largest in [[Europe]]. Built for [[Genoa Expo '92]], it is an educational, scientific and cultural centre. Its mission is to educate and raise public awareness as regards conservation, management and responsible use of aquatic environments. It welcomes over 1.2&amp;nbsp;million visitors a year.

Control of the entire environment, including the temperature, filtration and lighting of the tanks was provided by local Automation Supplier Orsi Automazione, acquired in 2001 by [[Siemens]].
The Aquarium of Genoa is co-ordinating the AquaRing EU project. It also provides scientific expertise and a great deal of content for AquaRing, including documents, images, academic content and interactive online courses, via its Online Resource Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaringweb.eu/index.html |title=AquaRing – home |language=it |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2009-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082449/http://www.aquaringweb.eu/index.html |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walls and fortresses===
{{Main|Walls of Genoa}}
[[File:Le torri di Porta Soprana, Genova.jpg|thumb|upright|The Porta Soprana]]
The city of Genoa during its long history at least since the 9th century had been protected by different line of [[defensive wall]]s. Large portions of these walls remain today, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy. The main [[city walls]] are known as "Ninth century walls", "Barbarossa Walls" (12th century), "Fourteenth century walls", "Sixteenth century walls" and "New Walls" ("Mura Nuove" in Italian). The more imposing walls, built in the first half of the 17th century on the ridge of hills around the city, have a length of almost {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}}. Some fortresses stand along the perimeter of the "New Walls" or close them.

===Parks===
{{Main|The Parks of Genoa}}
[[File:Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini - the lake.JPG|thumb|The gardens of [[Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini]]]]

Genoa has {{convert|82,000|m2|abbr=off}} of public parks in the city centre, such as Villetta Di Negro which is right in the heart of the town, overlooking the historical centre. Many bigger green spaces are situated outside the centre: in the east are the Parks of [[Nervi]] ({{convert|96,000|m2|disp=or|abbr=off}}) overlooking the sea, in the west the beautiful gardens of [[Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini|Villa Durazzo Pallavicini]] and its [[Giardino botanico Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi]]. ({{convert|265,000|m2|disp=or|abbr=off}}). The numerous villas and palaces of the city also have their own gardens, like Palazzo del Principe, Villa Doria, [[Palazzo Bianco (Genoa)|Palazzo Bianco]] and Palazzo Tursi, Palazzo Nicolosio Lomellino, [[Albertis Castle]], Villa Rosazza, Villa Croce, Villa Imperiale Cattaneo, Villa Bombrini, Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera, Villa Serra and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turismo.comune.genova.it/spip.php?page=scheda&amp;id_article=452 |title=Tourism – Comune di Genova

The city is surrounded by natural parks such as [[Parco naturale regionale dell'Antola]], [[Parco naturale regionale del Beigua]], [[Aveto Natural Regional Park]] and the [[Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary]].

===Promenades===
[[Corso Italia (Genoa)|Corso Italia]] runs for {{convert|2.5|km|1|abbr=on}} in the [[quartiere]] of [[Albaro]], linking two neighbourhoods of Foce and [[Boccadasse]]. The promenade, which was built in 1908, overlooks the sea, towards the promontory of [[Portofino]]. The main landmarks are the small lighthouse of Punta Vagno, the San Giuliano Abbey, and the Lido of Albaro.

{{ill|Passeggiata Anita Garibaldi|it}}, promenade overlooking the sea and {{convert|2|km|abbr=off}} long, [[Nervi]].

Promenade of the upper ring road, so-called "Circonvallazione a Monte" that includes: Corso Firenze, Corso Paganini, Corso Magenta, Via Solferino, Corso Armellini.

Walks can be made from the centre of Genoa following one of the many ancient paths between tall palaces and the "Creuze" to reach the higher areas of the city where there are magnificent places like [[Castelletto (Genoa)|Belvedere Castelletto]], the "Righi's district", the "Santuario di Nostra Signora di Loreto", the "Santuario della Madonnetta", the "Santuario di San Francesco da Paola".

[[Monte Fasce]] gives a complete view of the city.

To reach the hinterland of the [[Province of Genoa]] one can use the Genoa - [[Casella, Liguria|Casella]] Old Railway, {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} of railway between the Genoese mountains.

At the beginning of 2011, there were 608,493 people residing in Genoa, of whom 47% were male and 53% were female. The city is characterised by rapid aging and a long history of demographic decline, that has shown a partial slowdown in the last decade. Genoa has the lowest birth rate and is the most aged of any large Italian city. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled only 14.12% of the population compared to pensioners who number 26.67%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The median age of Genoa's residents is 47, compared to the Italian average of 42. The current birth rate of the city is only 7.49 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to the national average of 9.45. {{As of|2006}}, 94.23% of the population was [[Italian people|Italian]]. The largest immigrant group is from the [[Americas]] (mostly [[Ecuador]]): 2.76%, other [[Europe]]an nations (mostly [[Albania]], [[Ukraine]], the former [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]]): 1.37%, and [[North Africa]]: 0.62%. The city is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]], with small numbers of [[Protestant]]s.

==Economy==
The Genoa metropolitan area had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to $30.1&amp;nbsp;billion]] in 2011, or $33,003 per capita.&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 |title=Global city GDP 2011 |publisher=Brookings Institution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H7Jql2A9?url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 |archivedate=2013-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, [[Italian wine|wine]], [[olive oil]]) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999).&lt;ref name="regportraits1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |website=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916185647/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_eco.htm |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).

Steel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting productions. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding (in [[Sestri Ponente]] and in metropolitan area - [[Sestri Levante]]), electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the regions still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).&lt;ref name="regportraits1"/&gt;
In the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.
A good motorway network ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).
On average, about 17&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57&amp;nbsp;million tonnes enter the region.&lt;ref name="regportraits1"/&gt; The [[Port of Genoa]], with a trade volume of 58.6&amp;nbsp;million tonnes&lt;ref name="genova1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |title=Autorità Portuale di Genova – Traffico porto |website=Porto.genova.it |date= |accessdate=2008-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145356/http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ranks first in [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20070406_00/inf_07_05_statistiche_trasporti_marittimi_2002_2004.pdf |title=Inf_07_05_Statistiche dei trasporti marittimi 2002-2004 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2008-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66TBYarpJ?url=http://www3.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20070406_00/inf_07_05_statistiche_trasporti_marittimi_2002_2004.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; second in terms of [[twenty-foot equivalent units]] after the [[transshipment]] port of [[Gioia Tauro]], with a trade volume of over 2 million TEUs.&lt;ref name= data&gt;{{cite web |title=Genoa Port Yearbook 2012 |url= http://servizi.porto.genova.it/archivio/TRAF/SANNU/12041.ashx |publisher=Genoa Port Authority |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona, and the Canary Islands.

Genoese painters active in the 14th century include [[Barnaba da Modena]] and his local followers [[Nicolò da Voltri]] and at the same time, the sculptor [[Giovanni Pisano]] reached Genoa to make the monument for [[Margaret of Brabant]], whose remains are today housed in the {{ill|Museum of Sant'Agostino|it|Museo di Sant'Agostino di Genova}}.

In the 16th century along with the flourishing trade between the Republic of Genoa and Flanders also grew the cultural exchanges. The painters [[Lucas de Wael|Lucas]] and [[Cornelis de Wael]] lived in Genoa for a long time, where they played the role of a magnet for many Flemish painters like [[Jan Roos (painter)|Jaan Roos]], [[Giacomo Legi]], [[Jan Matsys]], [[Andries van Eertvelt]] and [[Vincent Malo]].

This creative environment also attracted the two most important Flemish painters, [[Rubens]] and [[Van Dyck]], who along with [[Bernardo Strozzi]].&lt;ref name="premier.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premier.net/~Italy/genoa3.htm |title=Art And Culture In And Around Genoa |website=Premier.net |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave life to the Genoese Painting School of the 17th century.

Much of the city's art is found in its churches and palaces, where there are numerous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo frescos. They are rich in works of art the [[Genoa Cathedral|Cathedral]], the {{ill|Chiesa del Gesù|it|Chiesa del Gesù e dei Santi Ambrogio e Andrea}} where [[The Circumcision (Rubens)|''The Circumcision'']] and the "''Miracles of St. Ignatius''" by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], the ''Assunzione della Vergine'' by [[Guido Reni]]. The [[San Donato (Genoa)|Church of San Donato]] contains works of [[Barnaba da Modena]], [[Nicolò da Voltri]] and [[Joos van Cleve]],&lt;ref name="premier.net"/&gt; the [[Santo Stefano (Genoa)|Church of Santo Stefano]] {{ill|The Stoning of St. Stephen|it|Lapidazione di santo Stefano (Giulio Romano)}} by [[Giulio Romano]] and the [[Santa Maria Assunta, Genoa|Church of Santa Maria Assunta]] the sculptures by [[Filippo Parodi]] and [[Pierre Puget]], very interesting is the {{ill|Santa Maria di Castello|it|Chiesa di Santa Maria di Castello (Genova)}}. But most of the works are kept in the Palaces like [[Palazzo Bianco]] where "[[Ecce Homo (Caravaggio)|''Ecce Homo'']]" by [[Caravaggio]], "[[Susannah and the Elders (Veronese)|''Susannah and the Elders'']]" by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], and the ''[[Garden Party in Albaro]]'' by [[Alessandro Magnasco|Magnasco]] are kept, [[Palazzo Rosso]] with the {{ill|Portrait of Anton Giulio Brignole-Sale|it|Ritratto equestre di Anton Giulio Brignole-Sale}} by [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], {{ill|Cleopatra morente|it|lt=''Cleopatra morente''}} by [[Guercino]] and works of [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]], [[Bernardo Strozzi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]; [[Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria]] where the "''[[Portrait of Giovanni Carlo Doria on Horseback]]''" by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and {{ill|Ecce Homo|it|Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina Genova)|lt=''Ecce Homo''}} by [[Antonello da Messina]] (see also [[Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina)|the series of Ecce Homo by Antonello da Messina]]) are kept, {{ill|Palazzo Tursi|it|Palazzo Doria-Tursi}} with the {{ill|Penitent Magdalene (Canova)|lt=Penitent Magdalene|it|Maddalena penitente (Canova)}} by [[Antonio Canova|Canova]], and [[Palazzo Reale]] which contains works of [[Bernardo Strozzi|Strozzi]], [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli|Gaulli]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Simon Vouet]], [[Guercino]].

The most important Genoese painters are: "[[Luca Cambiasi|Luca Cambiaso]]", "[[Bernardo Castello|Bernardo]]" and "[[Valerio Castello]]", "[[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]]", "[[Domenico Piola|Domenico]]" and "[[Paolo Gerolamo Piola]]", "[[Gregorio De Ferrari]]", "[[Bernardo Strozzi]]", "[[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]]" and "[[Alessandro Magnasco]]". Sculptors include [[Filippo Parodi]], the wood sculptor [[Anton Maria Maragliano]], [[Francesco Maria Schiaffino]] and [[Agostino Carlini]] who was member of the [[Royal Academy]].

In Genoa on 14 February 1404, the famous humanist author, architect, poet and philosopher [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was born. From Genoa was also [[Simonetta Vespucci]] considered the most beautiful woman of her time, we find portrayed in ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' and Allegory of [[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]] by [[Sandro Botticelli]] and in [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|''Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci'']] by [[Piero di Cosimo]].

Genoa is also famous for its numerous tapestries, which decorated the city's many salons. Whilst the patrician palaces and villas in the city were and still are austere and majestic, the interiors tended to be luxurious and elaborate, often full of tapestries, many of which were Flemish.&lt;ref name="premier.net"/&gt; Famous is the [[Genoese lace]] called with its name of Turkish origin "Macramè". Very used in Genoa is the [[Cobblestone]] called "Risseu" and a kind of [[Azulejo]] called "Laggioni".

Genoa has been likened by many to a Mediterranean New York, perhaps for its high houses that in the Middle Ages were the equivalent of today's skyscrapers, perhaps for the sea route Genoa-New York which in past centuries has been travelled by millions of emigrants. The architect [[Renzo Picasso]] in his visionary designs reinforces this strange affinity between the two cities.

In the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]], you can admire some magnificent sculpture of the 19th century and early 20th century like [[Monteverde Angel]] by [[Giulio Monteverde]], or works by artists such as "[[Augusto Rivalta]]", "[[Leonardo Bistolfi]]", "[[Edoardo Alfieri]]", "[[Santo Varni]]".

Among the Genoese painters of the 19th century and of the first half of the 20th century remember: "[[Tammar Luxoro]]", "[[Ernesto Rayper]]", "[[Rubaldo Merello]]" and "Antonio Giuseppe Santagata", in Genoa also grows up the sculptor [[Francesco Messina]].

In 1967 the Genoese historian, critic and curator [[Germano Celant]] coined the term [[Arte Povera]]. "[[Enrico Accatino]]" was another important art theorist and [[Emanuele Luzzati]] was the production designer and illustrator like [[Lorenzo Mongiardino]] also him a production designer and architect. Two other important artists are [[Emilio Scanavino]] and [[Vanessa Beecroft]].

In 1972 was founded in [[Rapallo]] near Genoa the annual art exhibition [[International Cartoonists Exhibition]]. About this, we have to remember the illustrator and comics artist, [[Giovan Battista Carpi]].

===Literature===
[[File:Umbria, jacopo da varazze, leggenda aurea, 1290 ca. 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Golden Legend]]'', 1290]]
"Anonymous of Genoa" was one of the first authors in Liguria and Italy who wrote verses in the Vernacular.
It explained that in Genoa [[Marco Polo]] and [[Rustichello da Pisa]], in the prisons of [[Palazzo San Giorgio]], wrote [[The Travels of Marco Polo]]. The [[Golden Legend]] is a collection of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] written by the Archbishop of Genoa [[Jacobus de Voragine]]. To animate the Genoese literary environment of the 16th century were [[Gabriello Chiabrera]] and "Ansaldo Cebà", the latter best known for his correspondence with [[Sara Copia Sullam]]. The city has been the birthplace of the historian [[Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone]], of the poet "Martin Piaggio", of the famous historian, philosopher and journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], of the writer [[Piero Jahier]], of the poet Nobel Prize [[Eugenio Montale]]. The writer and translator [[Fernanda Pivano]], the journalist "Vito Elio Petrucci" and the poet [[Edoardo Sanguineti]], the literary critic [[Carlo Bo]] instead was born in [[Sestri Levante]] near Genoa. We have also remember the dialet poet {{ill|Edoardo Firpo|it}} and the symbolist {{ill|Ceccardo Roccatagliata Ceccardi|it}}. The city of Genoa has been an inspiration to many writers and poets among which: [[Dino Campana]], {{ill|Camillo Sbarbaro|it}}, {{ill|Gaspare Invrea|it}} who wrote "The mouth of the wolf" and [[Giorgio Caproni]]. Between the alleys of the historical centre there is the Old [[Libreria Bozzi]]. The "Berio Civic Library" houses the precious manuscript entitled "The Durazzo Book of Hours". In the first half of the 20th century, the Mazzini Gallery's was a meeting place of many artists, writers and intellectuals among which [[Guido Gozzano]], [[Salvatore Quasimodo]], Camillo Sbarbaro, [[Francesco Messina]], {{ill|Pierangelo Baratono|it}}, [[Eugenio Montale]]. In the thirties of the 20th century was active in Genoa the [[Circoli]] magazine and after the World War II the "Il Gallo" magazine. Coveted and known from the 1960s to the 1980s was the Genoese literary lounge animated by the writer {{ill|Minnie Alzona|it}}. Dutch writer [[Ilja Leonard Pfeijffer]] wrote "La Suberba", a novel in which Genoa is prominently featured.

Since 1995, all the months of June take place in Genoa the '''Genoa's International Poetry Festival''', conceived by {{ill|Claudio Pozzani|it}} with the help of [[Massimo Bacigalupo]].

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Genoa}}
[[File:Teatro Carlo Felice Notturno.JPG|thumb|The neoclassical [[Teatro Carlo Felice]]]]
Genoa was a centre of [[Occitanie]] culture in [[Italy]] and for this reason it developed an important school of troubadours: [[Lanfranc Cigala]], [[Jacme Grils]], [[Bonifaci Calvo]], [[Luchetto Gattilusio]], [[Guillelma de Rosers]], and [[Simon Doria]].

Genoa is the birthplace of the composer [[Simone Molinaro]], violinist and composer [[Niccolò Paganini]], violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and composer [[Cesare Pugni]]. In addition, the famous violin maker [[Paolo de Barbieri]]. Paganini's violin, [[Il Cannone Guarnerius]], is kept in Palazzo Tursi. The city is the site of the Niccolò Paganini Music Conservatory.

[[Alessandro Stradella]], a composer of the middle baroque, lived in Genoa and was assassinated in 1682.

[[Felice Romani]] was a poet who wrote many librettos for the opera composers like [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]. [[Giovanni Ruffini]] was another poet known for writing the libretto of the opera ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' for its composer.

In 1847, [[Goffredo Mameli]] and [[Michele Novaro]] composed "[[Il Canto degli Italiani]]".

In 1857, debuted the work of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] entitled ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' inspired by the first Doge of Genoa, Simone Boccanegra.

Genoa is also the birthplace of the condcuctor [[Fabio Luisi]] and of many opera singers like [[Giuseppe Taddei]], [[Margherita Carosio]], [[Luciana Serra]], and [[Daniela Dessì]].

The [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] was built in 1828 in the city in the Piazza De Ferrari, and named for the monarch of the then [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (which included the present regions of [[Sardinia]], [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]]). The theatre was the centre of music and social life in the 19th century. On various occasions in the history of the theatre, presentations have been conducted by [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. Other Genoese theaters are the Politeama Genovese, Teatro Stabile di Genova, Teatro della Tosse and Teatro Gustavo Modena.

On the occasion of the [[Christopher Columbus]] celebration in 1992, new musical life was given to the area around the old port, including the restoration of the house of [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and presentations of the ''[[trallalero]]'', the traditional singing of Genoese dock workers.

The trallalero, traditional music in the Genoese dialect, is a [[polyphonic]] vocal music, performed by five men and several songs. The {{ill|trallalero|it}} are ancient songs that have their roots in the Mediterranean tradition. Another aspect of the traditional Genoese music is the "Nostalgic Song". The principal authors and singers of the Nostalgic Song in Genoese dialect are {{ill|Mario Cappello|it}} who wrote the piece "[[Ma se ghe penso]]" (English: "But if I think about it"), a memory of Genoa by an emigrant to [[Argentina]], {{ill|Giuseppe Marzari|it}}, {{ill|Agostino Dodero|it}} up to {{ill|I Trilli|it}}, {{ill|Piero Parodi|it}}, {{ill|Buby Senarega|it}}, {{ill|Franca Lai|it}}. The traditional Nostalgic Song will have a great influence on the so-called {{ill|Scuola Genovese|it}} of singer-songwriters that in some cases will mix the nostalgic feeling with pop and jazz atmospheres.

The singer [[Natalino Otto]] started the swing genre in Italy and his friend and colleague [[Pippo Barzizza]] was a composer, arranger, conductor and music director. Other musicians, composers and arrangers are [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]], [[Gian Piero Reverberi]], [[Gian Franco Reverberi]], [[Oscar Prudente]], [[Pivio and Aldo De Scalzi]].

Genoa in the second half of the 20th century was famous for an important school of Italian singer-songwriters, so-called {{ill|Scuola Genovese|it|Scuola genovese}}, that includes [[Umberto Bindi]], [[Luigi Tenco]]", "[[Gino Paoli]]", "[[Bruno Lauzi]]", "[[Fabrizio de André]], [[Ivano Fossati]], [[Angelo Branduardi]]" and [[Francesco Baccini]]. [[Nino Ferrer]] was also born in Genoa. In the 70s there were formed in Genoa numerous bands of [[Italian progressive rock]] like [[New Trolls]], [[Picchio dal Pozzo]], [[Latte e Miele]], and Delirium. Today we point the band [[Buio Pesto]] and [[The Banshee (band)|The Banshee]] band.

Some songs about the city of Genoa are part of Italian popular culture, like "Via del Campo" and "La Città Vecchia" by [[Fabrizio de André]], "Genova per noi" by [[Paolo Conte]], "La Casa in Via del Campo" the song also sung by [[Amalia Rodrigues]] and "Piazza Alimonda" the song about the facts of [[27th G8 summit|Genoa 2001]] by [[Francesco Guccini]].

[[Fabrizio de André]] in 1984 released the album ''[[Crêuza de mä]]'', totally written in Genoese dialect.

I Madrigalisti di Genova is a vocal and instrumental group formed in 1958 which specialised in medieval and Renaissance repertoire

The city has numerous music festivals, among which are Concerts at [[San Fruttuoso abbey]], Premio Paganini, I Concerti di San Torpete, International Music Festival Genova, We Love Jazz, Gezmatz Festival &amp; Workshop, and Goa-Boa Festival. In the town of [[Santa Margherita Ligure]] the ancient abbey of Cervara is often the site of chamber music.

[[Giovine Orchestra Genovese]], one of the oldest concert societies in Italy, was founded in Genoa in 1912.

{{main|Railway stations in Genoa}}
[[File:Train station - Genoa Brignole.jpg|thumb|[[Genova Brignole railway station]]]]
[[File:Genova staz Principe ingresso.jpg|thumb|[[Genova Piazza Principe railway station]]]]
The main railway stations are [[Genova Brignole railway station|Genoa Brignole]] in the east and [[Genova Piazza Principe railway station|Genoa Principe]] in the west. Genoa Brignole is close to the business districts and the exhibition centre, while the Principe is close to the port, the university and the historical centre. From these two stations depart the main trains connecting Genoa to [[France]], Turin, Milan and Rome.

Genoa's third most important station is [[Genova Sampierdarena railway station|Genoa Sampierdarena]], which serves the densely populated neighbourhood of Sampierdarena. 23 other local stations serve the other neighbourhoods on the 30-kilometre-long coast line from [[Nervi]] to [[Voltri]] and on the northern line through [[Bolzaneto]] and the Polcevera Valley.

The municipal administration of Genoa plans to transform these urban railway lines to be part of the rapid transit system, which now consists of the ''Metropolitana di Genova'' ([[Genoa Metro]]),  a [[light metro]] connecting Brin to the city centre. The metro line has been recently extended to Brignole Station in December 2012. The Corvetto station between De Ferrari and Brignole is currently passed-through. A possible further extension towards the eastern, densely populated boroughs was planned, but the municipal administration intends to improve the public transport by investing in new tram lines instead of completing the extension of the light metro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilitypoint.it/InfomobilityWeb/portal/alias__Rainbow/lang__it-IT/tabID__3509/sitemap/archivio_news/news_metropolitana.aspx |title=Mobility Point and local press |website=Mobilitypoint.it |date=2007-08-22 |accessdate=2009-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722042152/http://www.mobilitypoint.it/InfomobilityWeb/portal/alias__Rainbow/lang__it-IT/tabID__3509/sitemap/archivio_news/news_metropolitana.aspx |archive-date=2011-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current stations of the metro line are Brin-Certosa, Dinegro, Principe, Darsena, San Giorgio, Sant'Agostino and De Ferrari, and the line is {{convert|5.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.

The city's hilly nature has influenced its public transport.

'''Henry Adamson''' (1581–1637), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]] and [[historian]].

Adamson was the son of James Adamson, [[wikt:dean|Dean]] of the [[Merchant]] [[Guild]]ry and [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] of [[Perth, Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfamilyheritage.co.uk/list_perth%20magistrates.shtm|title=Perth Magistrates|publisher=Scottish Family Heritage|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321203119/http://www.scottishfamilyheritage.co.uk/list_perth%20magistrates.shtm|archivedate=21 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; baptised on 11 November 1581.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|first=Katharine A.|last=Craik|title=Adamson, Henry (bap. 1581, d. 1637)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/142|accessdate=2015-08-03|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/142}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry set out to train as a [[priest]], after his uncle [[Patrick Adamson]], but instead became a schoolmaster in his home city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/adamson_henry.htm Significant Scots: Henry Adamson]&lt;/ref&gt; He died before July in the year 1637.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

His friend [[William Drummond of Hawthornden|William Drummond]] encouraged the publication of his most famous poem: ''Muses Threnodie: of Mirthful Mournings on the death of Mr Gall'', ([[Edinburgh]] 1638 &amp;mdash; see [[1638 in poetry]]). The poem is an important document for its general account of Perth in the seventeenth century. Adamson is credited with first using the word ''[[curling]]'' in 1620. He related that his friend, Mr Gall, "a citizen of Perth, and a gentle-man of goodly stature, and pregnant wit, much given to pastime, as [[golf]], [[Archery|archerie]], curling and jovial companie". It also records the playing of [[History of golf|Golf]] on the [[Perth, Scotland|South Inch]]:

:''And ye, my clubs must no more prepare''
:''To make your balls flee whistling through the air''

It is also particularly noted for its observation of [[rosicrucianism]], [[freemasonry]] and [[second sight]]. Referring to the rebuilding of a bridge over the [[River Tay]], swept away in 1621, Adamson wrote:

:''Thus Mr Gall assured it would be so''
:''And my good genius doth surely know:''
:''For what we do presage is not in grosse''
:''For we be brethren of the Rosie Crosse;''
:''We have the [[Mason word]], and second sight,''
:''Things for to come we can foretell aright.''&lt;ref&gt;''The muses threnodie, or, mirthfull mournings, on the death of Master Gall. Containing varietie of pleasant poëticall descriptions, morall instructions, historiall narrations, and divine observations, with the most remarkable antiquities of Scotland, especially at Perth'' by Henry Adamson, King James College, Edinburgh, 1638&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Historical anthropology''' is a [[historiographical]] movement which applies methodologies and objectives from [[Social Anthropology|Social]] and [[Cultural Anthropology]] to the study of historical societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Like most such movements, it is understood in different ways by different scholars, and to some may be synonymous with the [[history of mentalities]], [[cultural history]], [[ethnohistory]], [[microhistory]], [[People's history|history from below]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]''. Anthropologists whose work has been particularly inspirational to historical anthropology include [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Arnold van Gennep]], [[Jack Goody]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] has contrasted historical anthropology with [[Social History]], finding that historical anthropology tends to focus on qualitative rather than quantitative data, smaller communities, and symbolic aspects of culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; Thus it reflects a turn away, in the 1960s, in [[Marxist historiography]] from 'the orthodox Marxist approach to human behaviour in which actors are seen as motivated in the first instance by economics, and only secondarily by culture or ideology', in the work of historians such as [[E. P. Thompson]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt;

Historical anthropology was rooted in the [[Annales School]], associated with a succession of major historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Pierre Nora]], along with researchers from elsewhere on the Continent such as [[Carlo Ginzburg]]. The label ''historical anthropology'' has been actively promoted by some recent Annales School historians, such as [[Jean-Claude Schmitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Claude Schmitt |url=https://cem.revues.org/8862 |title=Anthropologie historique |publisher=Cem.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acrh.revues.org/1926 |title=L’anthropologie historique de l’Occident médiéval. Un parcours |publisher=Acrh.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1929 by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]], the review [[Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales]] is still among the most influential French publications for research in historical anthropology.

Historical anthropology has been open to similar criticisms to anthropology: 'as [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] and [[John Comaroff|John]] and [[Jean Comaroff]] have observed, studies in which societies were represented in this way were often partial, biased, and unwitting handmaidens to the domination of non-Western peoples by Europeans and Americans'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; But since the Second World War, increasingly reflexive approaches have led to sophisticated developments of the field, and the banner of 'historical anthropology' has often attracted Anglo-American historians in ways that the Annales School did not: key figures have been [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Jay O'Brien (anthropologist)|Jay O'Brien]], [[William Roseberry]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Jane Schneider]], [[Peter Schneider (historian)|Peter Schneider]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], and people from elsewhere in the world such as [[Aaron Gurevich]].

==José María Velasco Ibarra (1960 - 61)==
The instability began immediately. Ponce was so angry over Velasco's vicious campaign attacks on his government that he resigned on his last day in office rather than preside over the inauguration of his successor. During his campaign, "the National Personification" had promised government support to the masses of urban poor, many of whom had recently migrated to Guayaquil and other major cities in search of a decent job and a place to live. Velasco's populism continued into his inaugural address, when he renounced the hated 1942 Rio Protocol. He thus came to power with the adoration of the masses, but he saddled himself with expensive commitments to the poor at a time when deficits in the state coffers were approaching a critical level. Additionally, Velasco threatened Ecuador's shaky economy with what amounted to a declaration of hostilities against Peru and the guarantors of the Rio Protocol, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Rudolph |first=James D. |chapter=Chapter 1. Historical Setting |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ectoc.html |title=A Country Study: Ecuador |editor-first=Dennis M. |editor-last=Hanratty |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] |year=1989 |series=Country Studies |access-date=15 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116085830/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ectoc.html |archive-date=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensing the direction of the political wind in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, Velasco magnified his anti-United States rhetoric and included leftists in his government. Meanwhile, the United States encouraged Latin American governments to break diplomatic relations with Cuba. Before long, Ecuador's widening political polarization became manifest in outbreaks of violence between leftist students and the anticommunist right.

The rapidly deteriorating economic situation soon brought about a split in the velasquista coalition, however, with the left, led by Vice President [[Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy]] (who was also president of the Chamber of Deputies) openly opposing the government in July 1961. By October relations between Velasco's government and Congress had deteriorated to the point where legislators and progovernment spectators engaged in a gun battle. Although dozens of bullet holes were later found in the Chamber, no one was injured.

A series of new sales taxes imposed during the same month in order to raise desperately needed revenues then sparked a general strike and a series of demonstrations and riots in several major cities. Amid growing chaos, Velasco ordered the arrest of his vice president, a move that opened him to charges of violating the constitution. On November 8, after only fourteen months in office, Velasco was ousted by the military and replaced by [[Otto Arosemena]], who was his constitutional successor as well as his leading opponent.

==Otto Arosemena (1961 - 1963)==
Arosemena's insistence on maintaining relations with Cuba, however, became a major domestic political issue in Ecuador. Political opponents labeled Arosemena a dangerous communist, and part of the military went into open rebellion in March 1962. The following month, Ecuador broke diplomatic relations with Cuba, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The crisis over Cuba proved to be very costly for Arosemena, who lost not only much of his local political support, but also the self-confidence to pursue his own, independent course. Afterward, the government drifted with little leadership from the president, who allegedly indulged in frequent drinking bouts.

The brief appearance of a guerrilla movement in the coastal jungle and a rash of small-scale terrorist incidents (many of which later were found to have been staged by right-wing provocateurs) also left Arosemena open to accusations of being either unable or unwilling to stop communist subversion. By early 1963, military conspiracy was again afoot. On July 11 the high command of the armed forces decided, without dissent, to depose Arosemena.

==Junta (1963 - 67)==
The four-man military junta that seized power announced its intention not to return the nation to constitutional rule until the institution of basic socioeconomic reforms, which both Velasco and Arosemena had promised but never implemented. This failure by their two civilian predecessors, the junta believed, had become a source of growing frustration within the lower classes, thus making them more receptive to the lure of communism. The junta combined its reformist anticommunism with the more traditional hard-line variety. After jailing or exiling the entire leadership of the communist left, the new government reorganized the nation's two leading universities in an effort to eliminate them as sources of left-wing political activity.

In July 1964, the junta decreed the [[Agrarian Reform]] Law to commemorate the first anniversary of its assumption of power. The law abolished the huasipungo system, the feudalistic land tenure arrangement widely used in the Sierra. However, the law resulted in little real improvement in the lives of the long-suffering Sierra peasants and died from lack of funding under subsequent civilian governments.

Meaningful reform was precluded, in part at least, by the increasingly cumbersome process of decision making within the politically heterogeneous, plural executive. Insubordination by the air force representative on the junta led to his dismissal and arrest in November 1965; thereafter, the junta had only three members.

In 1965 Ecuador also saw a dramatic drop in its revenue from banana exports and, despite generous development assistance from the United States government and the Inter-American Development Bank, the junta suddenly faced an economic crisis of major proportions. The announcement of increased taxes on imports sparked the opposition of the powerful Guayaquil Chamber of Commerce, which in March called for a general strike. Long- disgruntled student groups and labor unions were only too happy to join in the protest, which rapidly spread to other cities. On March 29, 1966, following a bloody and demoralizing attack on the Central University in Quito, the disillusioned military reformers stepped down.

===Transition (1966-7)===
The following day, a small group of civilian leaders named [[Clemente Yerovi Indaburu]], a non-partisan banana grower who had served as minister of economy under Galo Plaza, to be provisional president. In October a popularly elected constituent assembly drafted a new constitution and elected Otto Arosemena Gómez, a cousin of Carlos Julio and a political centrist, to act as a second provisional president. During his twenty months in office, the new constitution went into effect in May 1967, and popular elections for president were held in June 1968. Incredibly, Velasco—now seventy-five years old—was voted into the presidency for the fifth time, an incredible thirty-four years after his initial victory.

==Velasco (1967 - 72)==
The weakness of Velasco's mandate—he managed only a plurality of barely one-third of the popular vote in a crowded field of five candidates—foreshadowed political difficulties that plagued him during his final term. His newly formed National Velasquista Federation (Federación Nacional Velasquista—FNV) was far short of a majority in either house of Congress, and a failure to build any working coalition made for a stalemate in the legislative process. Even Velasco's own vice president, a Guayaquileño Liberal named Jorge Zavala Baquerizo, turned into a strident and vocal critic. Cabinet ministers came and went with astonishing frequency. This political impasse soon combined with the fiscal and balance-of- payments crises, which by now had become customary under the spendthrift habits and administrative mismanagement associated with each of Velasco's terms in office, to spawn a major political crisis. The turning point came on June 22, 1970, when Velasco, in an action known as an [[autogolpe]] (self-seizure of power), dismissed Congress and the Supreme Court and assumed dictatorial powers.

Velasco subsequently decreed a number of necessary, though extremely unpopular, economic measures. After devaluing the sucre for the first time since 1961, he placed tight controls on foreign exchange transactions and then decreed a number of new tax measures, the most controversial of which raised import tariffs considerably. Velasco attempted to compensate for his lost prestige by baiting the United States, seizing and fining United States fishing boats found within {{convert|200|nmi|km}} of the Ecuadorian coast. The intensification of the "tuna war" inflamed tempers in both countries; Ecuador dismissed United States military advisers, and the United States withdrew almost all economic and military aid to Ecuador. Such nationalistic adventures were of only momentary value to Velasco, however. In 1971, amid mounting civic unrest that verified the extent of the opposition, he was forced to cancel a scheduled national plebiscite in which he hoped to replace the 1967 constitution, with the charter written under his own auspices in 1946 the Constitution, Velasco argued, made the president too weak to be effective.

The president's autogolpe and his continuance in power were possible because of support from the armed forces. Velasco's key ally was his nephew and minister of defense, General Jorge Acosta Velasco, who continually reshuffled the high command in order to retain velasquistas in key posts. In the wake of a failed attempt to oust the powerful commandant of the Quito military academy in April 1971, however, Acosta himself was forced to resign his ministerial portfolio and was summarily dispatched to Madrid as ambassador. Having lost the man who was his linchpin in the armed forces and the only apparent heir to the velasquista throne, Velasco was left to the mercy of the high command.

Two circumstances proved critical in persuading the military to overthrow Velasco before the scheduled completion of his term in 1972. On the one hand, the state was due very shortly to begin reaping vast revenues under a 1964 petroleum concession. On the other hand, the overwhelming favorite to win the presidency in 1972 was Asaad Bucaram Elmhalim, a former street peddler who in 1960 had seized the leadership of the CFP from Guevara Moreno and later had twice been an extremely popular mayor of Guayaquil. Both the military and the business community regarded Bucaram as dangerous and unpredictable and unfit to be president, especially at a time when unprecedented income was expected to flow into the state coffers. On February 15, 1972, four months before the scheduled elections, the military under the command of Jorge Queirolo G. once again overthrew Velasco, who was sent into his final period of exile. He was replaced by a three-man military junta headed by the Army chief of staff, General [[Guillermo Rodríguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodríguez Lara]].

==Junta (1972 - 79)==
The military regime called itself "nationalist and revolutionary," but the well-known connections of Rodríguez Lara to the Guayaquil business community signaled disappointment for those who anticipated that he would head a progressive military regime such as was ruling in Peru at the time. It shortly became apparent that, ideologically, the [[Guillermo Rodríguez (politician)|General Guillermo Rodríguez Lara]] regime was a hybrid, reflecting a tenuous equilibrium among the widely divergent political tendencies within the Ecuadorian armed forces. Nevertheless, like the contemporary Peruvian and Brazilian regimes, the regime of Rodríguez Lara, he promised, would not be an interim government, but rather a long-term venture dedicated to introducing structural changes thought necessary to unfreeze the development process.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Rudolph, James D. "Historical Setting". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ectoc.html ''A Country Study: Ecuador''] (Dennis M. Hanratty, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1989). ''This article incorporates text from this source which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodríguez Lara's regime gave early emphasis to a campaign designed in part to exert firm control over the nation's petroleum resources and in part to consolidate the government's political authority. Several former political leaders, including ex-President [[Otto Arosemena]], were tried for corruption in connection with oil concessions granted during the 1960s. In addition, a large number of functionaries of the Velasco government, supporters of Bucaram, as well as drug traffickers, legitimate importers, and customs officials were charged with corruption and "illegal enrichment." Although it thus assailed its major opponents from the start the military regime, however, failed to build its own civilian base of political support.

Promises of a "meaningful agrarian reform" under the auspices of Minister of Agriculture Guillermo Maldonado, a dedicated reformer, were frustrated by intense opposition from traditional elites. Maldonado was eventually forced out, and by the end of Rodríguez Lara's four years in office less than 1 percent of Ecuador's cultivable land had changed hands under the reform. More notable achievements came in the areas of building infrastructure projects, such as the major oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Esmeraldas; various highway and electrification projects; and state capitalist enterprises, particularly the Ecuadorian State Petroleum Corporation (Corporación Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana—CEPE). The lateter corporation was founded in 1972 and grew to become the major actor in Ecuador's exploitation of its oil reserves.

Oil policy was the regime's vehicle for its most forceful expression of nationalism. Minister of Natural Resources Gustavo Jarrín Ampudia presided over Ecuador's 1973 entry into the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)]], with all its attendant prestige and economic benefits. He was also responsible for Ecuador's renegotiation of a number of oil concessions, including the key Texaco-Gulf concession in the Oriente, on terms much more favorable to the state, such as substantial increases in both the royalties paid by foreign firms and the tax rate they paid on petroleum exports. These efforts were initially successful in allowing the government to retain a larger share of Ecuador's petroleum earnings.

The oil companies became increasingly disconcerted, however, when Jarrín proposed in late 1974 that the share of stock in the Texaco-Gulf subsidiary held by CEPE be increased from 25 to 51 percent. Claiming that the terms of their concessions negotiated with Jarrín had priced Ecuadorian oil beyond the world market price, the oil companies cut back drastically on their exports, at a cost to the government of hundreds of millions of dollars over the following nine months. This intense financial pressure finally led to a July 1975 announcement that taxes on the oil companies' exports were being reduced. It was thus clear that the military regime had overplayed its nationalistic oil policy, having failed to keep in mind that Ecuador was, after all, a relatively small oil producer and thus not a powerful player within OPEC.

The moderation of the regime's oil policy, however, did not result in the anticipated resolution of mounting economic problems. Oil exports rose only slightly, while imports, particularly of luxury items, continued to soar, aided by a low-tariff policy that had been designed to soak up petroleum earnings, and thus control inflation. In excess of 22 percent during 1974, inflation was rapidly eroding the real value of wages within the middle class.

In August, in an effort to resolve its balance-of-payments difficulties, the regime decreed a 60 percent duty on imported luxury items. The measure was condemned by the Chambers of Commerce in Quito and Guayaquil, whose constituents had grown dependent on the sale of imports, and caused, a week later, a bloody attempt led by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Raúl González Alvear, to overthrow Rodríguez Lara. Although this coup attempt failed, at a cost of twenty-two lives, on January 11, 1976, a second, bloodless coup was successful in removing Rodríguez Lara. He was replaced by a Supreme Council of Government consisting of the commanders of the three armed services: [[Alfredo Poveda]] (Navy), [[Luis Leoro]] (Air Force) and [[Guillermo Durán]] (Army).

===Transition===
Virtually the only item on the agenda of the new military triumvirate was to preside over a return of the government to constitutional, civilian rule. The bloody September 1975 coup attempt had revealed the depth of the breach in the institutional unity of the armed forces. Handing the government back to civilians, it was hoped, might remove the causes of divisions within the military, or at least make it easier to hide them from public view.

The original timetable, announced in June 1976, called for a transition that was to culminate in presidential elections in February 1978. First, new government charters and electoral laws were to be drafted by appointed commissions, and then a public referendum would choose between two proposed constitutions. The transition was repeatedly slowed down, however, and in the end, instead of the less than two years originally scheduled, three years and eight months elapsed between the 1976 coup and the inauguration of a civilian president.

Two reasons are commonly cited for the delay: the slowness of decision making within the Supreme Council of Government because of ongoing disagreement within the military high command and repeated maneuverings by the military government to manipulate the electoral process, thereby controlling its outcome. Like the Rodríguez Lara government, the Council was particularly interested in seeing a poor electoral performance by the CFP and, especially, preventing Bucaram from winning the presidency.

The [[Ecuadorian constitutional referendum, 1978|national referendum]] to choose the constitution was finally held on 15 January 1978. The results saw 23 percent of the voting population nullify their ballots, an action that had been advocated by the traditional right; 31 percent of the population voted in favor of a revised version of the 1945 constitution, and a plurality of 44 percent voted in favor of the newly drafted national charter. The charter was the more progressive of the two constitutions, its major reforms being the acknowledgement of a role for the state in socioeconomic development, the legalization of a worker self-managed (autogestional) sector in the economy, a unicameral legislature, no presidential re-election, and, for the first time in Ecuador, electoral suffrage for illiterates.

Five candidates then campaigned for the presidency. The consistent favorite in polls was Rodrigo Borja of the social democratic Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática—ID). Because the Supreme Council of Government made sure that Bucaram was barred from running, the CFP strongman named his second in command, [[Jaime Roldós Aguilera]], to be the party's candidate. In order to broaden the appeal of the ticket, [[Osvaldo Hurtado]], the leader of the Christian Democratic Party (Partido Demócrata Cristiano—PDC), was tapped to be Roldós's vice presidential running mate. The traditional rightist vote was split between two candidates, and the various parties of the Marxist left coalesced to name one candidate. After a lengthy recount, the final results of the July 16 election confirmed the initial tally of a surprise victory by Roldós, with 27 percent of the national vote. [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], candidate of a coalition of rightist parties, finished second with 24 percent. The electoral law mandated that when no candidate achieved a majority vote, a run-off election between the two top finishers be held.

It was more than nine months before the second-round election took place, however. They were months of considerable political tension and doubt as to whether the transition would proceed as planned. First, widespread problems in organizing the election and in the vote count during the first round left serious doubts as to the competence and honesty of the electoral authorities. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Electoral—TSE) was, as a result, completely reorganized. Second, the government—remembering a campaign slogan calling "Roldós to the government, Bucaram to power"—was understandably dismayed with results of the first-round election. By delaying the second round, the government sought to give rightists the time to build an anti-Roldós coalition under which Durán could emerge as the second-round victor. To complicate matters further, Abdón Calderón Múñoz, a populist candidate who had won 9 percent of the vote in the first round, was murdered under circumstances implicating the government. Finally, as a further distraction during this difficult period, Velasco returned from exile to bury his wife and died in March 1979 at age eighty-six.

The second round was finally held on April 29, 1979, with the Roldós-Hurtado ticket sweeping to an overwhelming 68.5 percent victory against a weak performance by Durán. Doubts persisted, however, up to the moment that the winners took office three months later, that the military would allow them to assume their duly elected offices. The size of their popular mandate and, according to political scientist John D. Martz, pressure from the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]] in Washington made it difficult for the military to stop the "democratization" process at this late date. The military did extract as a price, in any case, unprecedented powers to name representatives to the boards of directors of major state corporations and to participate directly in the naming of the minister of defense. The outgoing government also made it clear to Roldós (who had an early campaign slogan of "we will not forgive, we will not forget") that it would not tolerate any investigation into the behavior of the military with respect to human rights. With his autonomy thus diminished, Roldós finally assumed the presidency on August 10, and thus Ecuador returned to constitutional, civilian rule after almost a decade of dictatorship.

{{History of Singapore}}
The '''history of the Republic of Singapore''' began when [[Singapore]] became an [[independence|independent]] [[republic]] following an [[secession|ejection]] from [[Malaysia]] on 9 August 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Road to Independence | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress | accessdate = 2006-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the separation, the fledgling nation had to become self-sufficient, and faced problems including mass [[unemployment]], housing shortages and lack of land and natural resources such as [[petroleum]].

During [[Lee Kuan Yew]]'s term as prime minister from 1959 to 1990, his administration curbed unemployment, raised the [[standard of living]] and implemented a large-scale public housing programme. The country's [[economic]] infrastructure was developed, racial tension was eliminated and an independent national defence system was created. Singapore evolved from a [[Developing country|developing nation]] to [[developed country|first world status]] towards the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Country Groups | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~menuPK:64133156~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html | publisher = [[The World Bank]] | accessdate = 2006-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Goh Chok Tong]] succeeded Lee as Prime Minister. During his tenure, the country tackled the economic impacts of the 1997 [[East Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] and the 2003 [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] outbreak, as well as [[War on Terrorism|terrorist threats]] posed by the [[Jemaah Islamiyah|Jemaah Islamiah]] (JI) [[September 11 attacks|post–11 September]] and the [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali bombings]]. In 2004 [[Lee Hsien Loong]], the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, became the third prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =  Country profile: Singapore | publisher = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1143240.stm | accessdate = 2006-04-14 | date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence of Singapore==

Singapore became part of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 following a merger with [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]]. The merger was thought to benefit the economy by creating a common, free market, and to improve Singapore's internal security. However, it was an uneasy union. Disputes between the state government of Singapore and the federal government occurred on different issues, especially the federal policies of [[affirmative action]], which granted special privileges to Malays guaranteed under [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia]]. Singapore's chief minister, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and other political leaders began advocating for equal treatment of all races in Malaysia, with a rallying cry of ''"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]!"''&lt;ref name="uslcRoadToIndependence"&gt;{{cite web | title = Singapore - Road to Independence  | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm  | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress  | accessdate = 2006-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial tensions between Chinese and Malays increased dramatically resulting in numerous racial riots. The most notorious riots were the [[1964 race riots]] that first took place on the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s birthday on 21 July with twenty-three people killed and hundreds injured. The price of food increased greatly when the transport system was disrupted during the unrest, causing further hardship for the people.

The state and federal governments also had conflicts on the economic front. [[UMNO]] leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans previously agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the [[arrest]] of [[Lee Kuan Yew]].

Seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] decided to expel Singapore from the federation. The Parliament of Malaysia voted 126–0, with all Singaporean MPs boycotting the vote, in favour of the expulsion on 9 August 1965. On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced on a televised press conference that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he uttered that: ''"For me, it would be a moment of anguish. I mean for me, it is a moment of anguish because all my life….you see the whole of my adult life…. I have believed in Merger and the unity of the two territories. You know it's a people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship... ."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Road to Independence | publisher = AsiaOne | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | url = http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/merger.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131013002423/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/merger.html | archivedate = 13 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new state became the Republic of Singapore.

{{see also|PAP-UMNO relations|History of Malaysia}}

==1965 to 1979==

After gaining independence abruptly, Singapore sensed the need for immediate international recognition of its sovereignty. The [[Konfrontasi]] was ongoing and some UMNO factions strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the danger of being attacked by Indonesian military or forcibly reabsorbed into Malaysia on disadvantageous terms. With the support of the Malaysian, [[Republic of China]], and Indian governments, Singapore became a member of the [[United Nations]] on 21 September 1965, and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in October that year.

A new foreign ministry was established and was headed by [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] who helped to assert Singapore's independence and established diplomatic relations with other countries. The participation in international organizations also helped to boost trade through cooperation. Singapore later co-founded the [[ASEAN]] on 8 August 1967, joined the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1970, and later the [[World Trade Organization]].

As a tiny island, Singapore was seen as a nonviable nation state, much of the international [[mass media|media]] was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, lack of [[natural resource]]s and lack of [[landform|land]].&lt;ref name="uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence"&gt;{{cite web | title = Singapore – Two Decades of Independence | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/11.htm | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress  | accessdate = 2006-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[unemployment rate]] ranged between 10–12% and it threatened to create civil unrest. The loss of the access to the Malaysian [[hinterland]] market and the lack of [[natural resource]]s meant that Singapore had no solid traditional sources of [[measures of national income and output|income]]. A large portion of the population lacked formal education, even when this statistic counted Chinese schools which the British did not recognize. [[Entrepot]] trade, the main use of Singapore's port and the original reason for Singapore's success in the 19th century, was no longer sufficient to support the large population.

=== Economic focus ===
Singapore invested heavily to promote economic growth. The [[Economic Development Board]] was set up in 1961 by [[Goh Keng Swee]], and with the assistance of Dutch economic advisor [[Albert Winsemius]], national economic strategies were formulated to promote Singapore's manufacturing sector. [[Industrial estate]]s were set up, especially in the reclaimed swampland of [[Jurong]], and government ministers toured the world in order to try to attract foreign [[investment]]. The government offered new investors [[tax holiday]]s of 5–10 years.&lt;ref name="uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence"/&gt;

Singapore's port gave her an advantage over her neighbouring countries, being a favourable spot for efficient exports of refined goods and imports of raw material. This meant that industries in Singapore found international markets easily, and cheaper prices for raw goods. Singapore's growing [[industrialization|industrialisation]] meant that entrepot trade had been extended into processing of imported raw materials into exported finished products—leading to higher value-added goods which brought more income to the island. This ended up being a suitable alternative to a common market to the Malaysian hinterland, although later a form of it ended up being formed with the creation of [[ASEAN]].&lt;ref name="uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence"/&gt;

The [[service industry]] also grew at this time, sparked by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment problem. With Winsemius's help, Singapore attracted big oil companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Esso]] to establish [[oil refineries]] in Singapore which became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world by the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence"/&gt;

The new direction that Singapore took demanded a skilled labour force to engage in her revised role of refining raw goods, as opposed to the traditional natural resource extraction industries of her neighbours. Its leaders decided early on that the population would need to be fluent in the English language, as they would be communicating and cooperating with [[expatriate]] employers or business partners abroad, and English was adopted as the medium of education for all schools.

The education system was designed to be rigorous and intensive, with emphasis on immediately [[pragmatism|practical]], rather than [[intellectual]], applications, such as on technical sciences as opposed to [[political science|political discussion]] or [[philosophy]].  A large portion, around one-fifth of Singapore's budget, was devoted to education to facilitate a large and competent workforce upon graduation. The government of Singapore currently maintains it at this level.

=== New housing ===
There was a lack of good housing and a proliferation of [[squatter]] settlements. Combined with the high unemployment rate, this led to social problems from crime, a low standard of living, and unrest. The other deleterious effect of squatter settlements was that many of these were built of highly [[flammability|flammable materials]], were poorly constructed and thus posed a high fire risk. A prominent example in this case is the [[Bukit Ho Swee Fire|Bukit Ho Swee Squatter Fire]] that broke out in 1961. In addition, there was poor [[sanitation]], which led to the spread of [[infectious disease]]s.

The [[Housing Development Board]] set up before independence continued to be largely successful under [[Lim Kim San]]. Huge building projects sprang up to provide cheap, affordable public housing to resettle the squatters, hence removing a serious social problem. 25,000 apartments were built in the first two years. It was remarkable that, within a decade, the majority of the population had been housed in HDB apartments. Possible explanations for the otherwise seemingly impossible success was the determination of the government, the large budget allocations, and efforts to eliminate [[red tape]] and corruption. In 1968, the [[Central Provident Fund]] (CPF) Housing Scheme was introduced to allow residents to use their CPF savings to purchase HDB flats, which gradually increased home ownership in Singapore.

Another problem facing Singapore was the lack of national identity and unity among most of the population. Many people were born in foreign lands and still identified themselves in terms of countries of origin, rather than being Singaporeans. This posed possible problems of loyalty, reliability and the possibility of further racial riots. In order to resolve racial tension, a policy to create national identity through education in schools and flag raising and lowering ceremonies was implemented. This is constantly re-emphasized within the curriculum and "[[National Education]]", a compulsory program of which the main goal is to inculcate students with a sense of "national fraternity". The [[Singapore National Pledge]], written by [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]], was introduced in 1966 emphasizing unity among the people "regardless of race, language or religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Pledge | url = http://www.sg/explore/symbols_pledge.htm | publisher = Singapore Infomap, Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore | accessdate = 2006-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[laws of Singapore|system of justice and law in Singapore]] was reformed and the government implemented several measures to overcome labour unrest and disputes. Strict labour legislation was passed to provide better protection to workers but yet allow for greater productivity by permitting longer working hours and reducing holidays.&lt;ref name="uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence"/&gt; The labour movement was further consolidated under the [[National Trades Union Congress]] with close oversight by the government. By the end of the 1960s, the number of labour strikes was significantly reduced.&lt;ref name="uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence"/&gt;

Singapore took the step of [[nationalization|nationalising]] companies that would not survive on their own, or could otherwise be detrimental for Singapore if they were not closely in line with government policy because they were a [[public services|public service]]. [[Singapore Power]], [[Public Utilities Board]], [[SingTel]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] (SIA) are prominent examples. Such companies that were nationalized were often infrastructure or utility companies, companies meant to lay out services such as electricity or transport for the benefit of other companies. The extension of power infrastructure, for example, led to an increased attraction of foreign investors. Recently, the government has taken steps to privatize these previous monopolies—SingTel and Singapore Airlines are now publicly listed, limited liability companies, even though the government still holds large shares in them.

=== Independent defence force ===
The other major issue brought up around this time was national [[defense (military)|defence]].  Following independence, the British were still defending Singapore, but had announced they would be withdrawing by 1971, due to pressures at home and military commitments elsewhere in the world. This caused considerable alarm locally, particularly among those who remembered the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]] during [[World War II]].

In 1965, [[Goh Keng Swee]] became Minister for the Interior and Defence, and initiated the formation of a national defence force, called the [[Singapore Armed Forces]], which was to be established by the time of the British withdrawal. The British agreed to postpone the withdrawal for half a year, but no longer.

Singapore consulted international experts from [[West Germany]] and [[Israel]] to train their armed forces and equip them. As a small country surrounded by larger neighbours, Singapore allocated a large portion of its budget, around 19%, to defence and this still continues today, having the fourth largest [[per capita]] military expenditure in the world, after [[Israel]], [[United States]] and [[Kuwait]].

Singapore was especially interested in Israel's model of [[national service]], a factor in its decisive victory in the [[Six-Day War]] over its Arab neighbours in 1967. This led to the implementation of [[national service in Singapore|Singapore's own national service programme]] starting in 1967. All eighteen-year-old males would be required to participate in national service and train full-time for two and a half years, and then required to repeatedly come back each year to maintain their skills in order to carry out an effective [[mobilization|mobilisation]] at any time.

This policy meant that Singapore could quickly mobilise enough defence forces to deter any [[invasion]], especially against Indonesia during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Confrontation]], when the British withdrew in September 1971.  Females were left out of national service—the explanation being that, during a time of war, they would be required to support the economy while the men were fighting. This policy is sometimes questioned as being [[sexism|sexist]] and has been discussed in the [[mass media]] a number of times together with the length of training involved. The creation of the national service policy is thought to aid the strengthening of national and racial ties since there is a sense of unity when training as a youth with peers of other races.

==1980s to 1990s==

Further economic success continued through the 1980s onwards, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% during this time until 1999. In the 1980s, Singapore faced the challenge of needing to upgrade its industries to higher-technology industries, in order to compete with its neighbours which were exporting the same things at a lower price. Originally, Singapore manufactured goods such as textiles. A skilled workforce with an aptitude for learning helped ease the transition, for example, to new jobs in the [[wafer fabrication]] industry, which was quickly being established in Singapore.

[[Singapore Changi Airport]] was opened in 1981. The development of air transport meant further extension of entrepot trade as well as its intended purpose of attracting investors through a convenient way to enter and leave the country. In conjunction with Singapore Airlines, for example, the hospitality industry grew immensely, which led to growth in the [[tourism]] industry.

The [[Housing Development Board]] continued to promote public housing. New towns, such as in Ang Mo Kio, were designed and built. They have larger and higher-standard apartments and are served with better amenities. Today, 80–90% of the population lives in HDB apartments.With the justification of fostering national unity, "racial harmony" and loyalty, the government explicitly planned to group the different races together within the same estate, in order to integrate the races. This HDB policy became a major contribution towards the [[culture of Singapore|Singaporean culture]].

[[File:BukitBatok.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Top view of Bukit Batok West. Large scale public housing development programme has created high housing ownership among the population.]]

Singapore also had to upgrade its military, for instance upgrading the standard infantry weapon of its army. Formerly it had been the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]], it was upgraded to the lighter, [[United States]]-made [[M16 (rifle)|M16]]. A ''[[Total Defence]]'' policy was created in 1984 with the intent of the population being prepared to defend Singapore on five metaphorical fronts: economically, on a civil level (including hospitals), a social level, a psychological level as well as on a military level.

With continuous strong economic growth, Singapore became one of the world's most prosperous countries, with strong international trading links. Its [[Port of Singapore|port]] is one of the world's busiest and with a per capita GDP above that of the leading nations of Western Europe.  The education budget remains at one fifth or more, and many of its practices, such as racial harmony, continue today.

A side effect of this is that [[traffic congestion]] became increasingly more common, and in 1987, the first [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) line was established and would later grow to become a famous epitome of what is often viewed as a well-integrated [[public transport]] system. This network also improved the convenience of travelling from one side of the island to the other—a benefit which did not exist in the 1960s.

=== Political system ===
The political situation in Singapore was stable. The PAP had a 15-year monopoly in parliament during 1966 to 1981, winning all seats in elections before [[J. B. Jeyaretnam]] of the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]] won the Anson constituency in a 1981 by-election. The PAP rule is termed [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] by activists who see some of the regulations of political and media activities as an infringement on political rights, perceiving them as [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. This has been the greatest complaint about the PAP by the opposition parties so far, the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]] and the [[Singapore Democratic Party]] being two of the prominent opposition parties who accuse the PAP of authoritarianism.

The government of Singapore underwent several significant changes. [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament]] was introduced in 1984 to allow up to three losing opposition parties candidates be appointed as MPs. [[Group Representation Constituencies]] (GRCs) was introduced in a 1988 amendment to the [[Parliamentary Elections Act]] to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament. [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] was introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs.

The [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] was amended in 1991 to provide for an [[President of Singapore|Elected President]] who has veto power in the use of national reserves and appointments to public office. The opposition parties have complained that the GRC system has made it difficult for them to gain a foothold in [[parliamentary elections in Singapore]], and the [[plurality voting system]] in the  [[constituencies of Singapore]], especially large group representation constituencies, tends to exclude minority parties. The system has been defended by the PAP because the system encourages representation of the minority ''races'' by requiring a minority candidate in group representation constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|publisher=Singapore Statutes Online|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2001-REVED-218&amp;doctitle=PARLIAMENTARY%20ELECTIONS%20ACT%0A&amp;segid=946439076-000003|accessdate=2006-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This however increases the difficulty of the opposition parties being able to gain a seat. Until the [[Singapore general election, 2006|general election in 2006]], the PAP had always managed to return to power on nomination day, even before the elections commenced since the amendment to the Parliamentary Elections Act. The opposition accuses that the group representation constituency is an intentional hindrance, as between 1991 and 2001 did not manage to put forward enough qualified candidates to even contest the PAP's mandate.

The arrest of [[Chee Soon Juan]], and the lawsuits of slander against [[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam|J. B. Jeyaretnam]], both opposition MPs, have been cited by the opposition parties as examples of such authoritarianism. They also have been charged on the grounds of [[libel and slander|slander]] for political criticism. The lack of [[separation of powers in Singapore|separation of powers]] between the court system and the government led to further accusations by the opposition parties of [[miscarriage of justice]]. Further arrests of those who were politically active against the PAP, such as [[Francis Seow]], and even students who have recently entered [[tertiary education]] are part of these accusations of authoritarianism.

In 1990, [[Lee Kuan Yew]] passed the reins to successor [[Goh Chok Tong]], who presented a more open and consultative style of leadership as the country continued to modernise. In 1997, Singapore experienced the effect of the [[Asian financial crisis]] and tough measures, such as cuts in the CPF contribution were implemented.

==2000 to present==
In the first few years of the 21st century, Singapore went through some of its most serious postwar crises, including the [[SARS]] outbreak in 2003 and the threat of [[terrorism]]. In December 2001, a [[Singapore embassies attack plot|plot to bomb embassies]] and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and 15 members of the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] were arrested under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]]. [[Counter-terrorism in Singapore|Major counter-terrorism measures]] were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorism acts and to minimize damages should they occur. Meanwhile, the economy was affected marginally during the crisis, and in 2003, the average monthly household income was [[Singapore Dollar|SGD]]$4,870.

[[File:Workers party rally.jpg|thumb|right|350px|One of the [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] rallies, this particular one at [[Serangoon]] Stadium. The opposition rallies were known for having a large turnout.]]

In 2004, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, became the third prime minister of Singapore. A number of national policy changes have been proposed and carried out since then. One of these changes was the reduction of National Service training requirements from two and a half years to two during 2005. The government also introduced a "Cutting Red Tape" program, which allows citizens to share their views on law, punishment, social and world issues.

The [[Singapore general election, 2006|general election of 2006]] has been considered by analysts to be a landmark election in the history of Singapore, because of the heavy use of the [[internet]] and [[blog]]ging that covered the election, which escaped government regulation. Just before the election, on 1 May 2006, the government issued a cash bonus, called the "progress package" to all adult citizens, worth [[Singapore Dollar|SGD]] $2.6 billion. The PAP returned to power in the election winning 82 out of 84 seats, and 66% of the votes. During the election campaign period, there were large turnouts at many opposition rallies, with Malaysian newspaper ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' estimating that over ten thousand people attended one rally held on 30 April 2006.

Singapore's bilateral post-independence relationship with Malaysia is complex and rocky at times. Despite their differences, Malaysia remains an important, albeit partial, economic hinterland and a regional ally, especially due to both their memberships in ASEAN. This importance becomes especially apparent when considering that much of Singapore's water supply comes from Malaysia. Both countries have been known to chide or even issue threats to the other due to differences in paths taken after independence, but fortunately this has never become serious enough to develop into [[embargo]] or hostility.

There are increasing reforms in the education system. [[Primary education]] was made [[compulsory education|compulsory]] in 2003. This style of educational policy was still extremely competitive, and favoured those that did well initially, and tended to ignore the suffering students, in the process of [[streaming (education)|streaming]]. This remains a controversial issue even today. It was theme for the successful local film ''[[I Not Stupid]]'' which also addresses the culture of competition induced by the post-independence education policy. Although the education policy has evolved over the years to address such concerns, the streaming issue is still prominent.

The [[Demographics of Singapore#2013 Population White Paper|2013 Population White Paper]] was officially released by the government proposing a future national population of 6.9 million due to growing concerns of rising life expectancy, declining birth rates and ageing population foreseen of Singapore in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable population for a dynamic Singapore |publisher=''[[The Straits Times]]''|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sustainable-population-for-a-dynamic-singapore |date= 2013-01-30 |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after the formal launch of two [[Integrated Resorts]], which also became the most profitable in the world in the same year.

The hobble skirt may have been inspired by one of the first women to fly in an airplane.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=re4pCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=hobble+skirt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4lr7kqoPWAhWPZiYKHYaSCssQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=hobble%20skirt&amp;f=false|title=Fashion Victims: The Dangers of Dress Past and Present|last=David|first=Alison Matthews|date=2015-09-24|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472577733|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1908 Wright Brothers demonstration in Le Mans, France, Mrs. (Edith) Hart O. Berg asked for a ride and became the first American woman to fly as a passenger in an airplane, soaring for two minutes and seven seconds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/women-in-aviation/berg.cfm|title=Women in Aviation and Space History - Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|website=airandspace.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She tied a rope securely around her skirt at her ankles to keep it from blowing in the wind during the flight. According to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, a French fashion designer was inspired by the way Mrs. Berg walked away from the aircraft with her skirt still tied and created the hobble skirt based on her ingenuity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

The French fashion designer in the Berg story might have been Paul Poiret&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; who claimed credit for the hobble skirt, but it is not clear whether the skirt was his invention or not.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T26HCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=hobble+skirt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4lr7kqoPWAhWPZiYKHYaSCssQ6AEISjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=hobble%20skirt&amp;f=false|title=Edwardian Fashion|last=Milford-Cottam|first=Daniel|date=2014-02-10|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9780747814757|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skirts had been rapidly narrowing since the mid-1900s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Slim skirts were economical because they used less fabric.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The hobble skirt became popular just as women were becoming more physically active.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Hobble skirts inspired hundreds of cartoons and comic postcards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  One series of comic post cards called it the "speed-limit skirt."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There were several reports of women competing in hobble skirt races as a joke.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Boarding a streetcar in a hobble skirt was particularly difficult.  In 1912, the New York Street Railway began running hobble skirt cars with no step up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Los Angeles introduced similar streetcars in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-5tjYETEPkC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=hobble+skirt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2oaTytoPWAhVH7SYKHUbhCXs4ChDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=hobble%20skirt&amp;f=false|title=Los Angeles Railway Yellow Cars|last=Walker|first=Jim|date=2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738547916|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hobble skirts were directly responsible for several deaths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 1910, a hobble-skirt-wearing woman was killed by a loose horse at a racetrack outside Paris.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A year later, eighteen-year-old Ida Goyette stumbled on an Erie Canal bridge while wearing a hobble skirt, fell over the railing, and drowned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

To prevent women from splitting their skirts, some women wore a [[fetter]] or tied their legs together at the knee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://content.lib.washington.edu/costumehistweb/fashion-trends.html|title=::: Fashion Plate Collection :::|website=content.lib.washington.edu|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some designers made alterations to the hobble skirt to allow for greater movement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Jeanne Paquin concealed pleats in her hobble skirts while other designers such as Lucile offered slit or wrap skirts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The hobble skirt trend died out at the beginning of World War I, as the skirt's limited mobility did not suit the wartime atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58897/hundred-year-old-fashion-fad-hobble-skirt|title=Hundred-Year-Old Fashion Fad: The Hobble Skirt|date=2014-09-22|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">'''Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi''' (born 1328) was a [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] scholar and [[Talmudist]] born at [[Ohrid]]. Owing to the wars which agitated [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] in the 14th century, Mosconi left his native country about 1360. He traveled in all the three continents of the Old World. He was in [[Chios]] and [[Cyprus]], in [[Euboea|Négropont]] (where he became the pupil of [[Shemariah b. Elijah al-Iḳriṭi]]), in [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], and later in [[Egypt]] (where he studied under [[Obadiah Miẓri]], to whom he owed "the greatest part of his learning"). He was afterward in [[Morocco]], in [[Italy]], and in [[France]]. In [[Perpignan]] he made the acquaintance of several scholars, among them [[Moses Narboni]] and [[David Bongoron]].

Mosconi was well versed in philosophical works, both Hebrew and Arabic; but, having a predilection for metaphysics, he occupied himself particularly with [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]]'s commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], on which he wrote a supercommentary. Most of the 30 supercommentaries on Ibn Ezra which Mosconi examined during his wanderings were, in his opinion, worthless. According to Mosconi, Ibn Ezra wrote his commentary on the [[Neviim|Prophets]] and [[Hagiographa]] before that on the Pentateuch, which he wrote 11 years before his death.

Mosconi insisted on the necessity of studying grammar; and he blamed the commentators who neglected it. In his commentary he quotes the other works of Ibn Ezra, those of [[Samuel ben Hophni]], [[Saadia]]'s Arabic translation of the [[Pentateuch]], [[Maimonides]]' commentary on the "Aphorisms" of [[Hippocrates]], [[Averroes]], and the other Arabian philosophers. Simultaneously with his supercommentary, Mosconi began to write other treatises, e.g.: ''En Gedi,'' an explanation of certain metaphysical passages disseminated in different works; ''Reaḥ Niḥoaḥ,'' a treatise on sacrifices; ''Ṭa'ame ha-Mibṭa,'' on grammar—all these works being left unfinished on account of the persecutions which he underwent.

Mosconi's preface to his commentary, in which he gives this information, was published by [[Abraham Berliner]] in ''Oẓar Ṭob'' (1878, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10). Mosconi also revised the ''[[Yosippon]]'' and wrote a preface to it (published by Berliner, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;17–23). [[Steinschneider]] (''Hebr. Bibl.'' xiv. 90) thinks that the Moses Mosconi mentioned by [[Moses Bagi]] in his ''Ohel Mosheh'' as having written against the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaite]] [[Aaron b. Elijah]] is identical with Judah Leon Mosconi, whose name was incorrectly given by Bagi.

A '''lampshade hat''' is a millinery design in which the hat has a small circular crown – typically flat, but sometimes rounded – and flares outwards to create a cone-like profile.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Costume Brooks Picken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks Picken|first1=Mary|title=A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion: Historic and Modern|date=1999|publisher=Dover Publications|location=United States|isbn=0486402940|pages=164|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbOI4TCcnbQC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=Brooks+picken+%2B+lampshade+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=adtnkmGizG&amp;sig=Z-dHsOoYHeMwG6QINFPyLxU3FyA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kKy6VJ-fCJX3aoibgkA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Brooks%20picken%20%2B%20lampshade%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shape, it may have some similarities to the [[Pillbox hat|pillbox]] and [[Bucket hat|bucket]] hat, both of which were popular at around the same time, although the classic lampshade design is longer and more flared than a pillbox  (typically ending at or below the ears) and is generally made of stiffer material than a bucket hat. 

The [[Asian conical hat]] and the [[mushroom hat]] are sometimes termed ''lampshade'', as well as any oversized or lavishly trimmed hat.&lt;ref name="Time Sun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sun|first1=Feifei|title=The 15 most ridiculous trends from fashion month|url=http://style.time.com/2012/10/03/15-ridiculous-trends-from-fashion-month/slide/giles/|accessdate=17 January 2015|publisher=Time|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Hats 120413"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wedding guest hats, ten years later|url=https://royalhats.wordpress.com/tag/princess-miriam/|website=royalhats.wordpress.com|publisher=Royal Hats|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the design==
The lampshade style was popularised by [[Christian Dior]] in the 1950s and remained fashionable through the next decade.&lt;ref name="Hatatorium Grantland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grantland|first1=Brenda|last2=Robak|first2=Mary|title=Hatatorium: An essential guide for hat collectors|date=2011|publisher=Brenda Grantland|location=Mill Valley, CA|isbn=9780984785902|pages=77|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLEK49A-LUAC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=hatatorium+%2B+cossack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cN_dDYIZ6O&amp;sig=wqKfSvKReaPp2IOyTYfS6S_VcLw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BseyVJbkFOeP7AaS6IGoDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hatatorium%20%2B%20cossack&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dior continued to feature variations in his collections into the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="Style Spade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spade|first1=Kate|title=Style|date=2004|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=United States|isbn=9780743250672|page=78|edition=2004|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZzDwREJdaC0C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=1960s+lampshade+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hv_rMOXDBk&amp;sig=RrEg1DBAM9bf4Y6_udBhG2gfskw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tdK7VO-rJcmwUfrugfAB&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=1960s%20lampshade%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions could be trimmed or decorated, or could rely on shape alone for effect. 

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1953 about the London spring collections, Clair Wilson described a: "lampshade of a hat" designed by [[Simone Mirman]] and shown at [[John Cavanagh (designer)|John Cavanagh]]'s London show. This model was pleated and matched to a black silk cape.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Wilson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Clair|title=The London Spring Collections: Outfits for the occasions|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Wilson described a new season's design that was quite close fitting, in the manner of a helmet, adding that it was: "devoid of decoration and having some relationship to the cloche in concealing most of the hair".&lt;ref name="The Guardian Wilson 120354"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Clair|title=Spring Hats all at Sea|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 March 1954|ref=pg.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1956, lampshades and pillboxes were said to be overtaking the previously popular mushroom and [[Cartwheel hat|cartwheel]] designs at [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]] races. A reviewer of the opening day's fashions noted: "1956 must be dismissed as an unspectacular year. Gone were the cartwheels and giant mushrooms of other years, and in their place were pill-boxes (Princess Margaret), lampshades (Princess Alexandra) and various derivations of the beret".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 200656"&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Ascot All Too Blue: A windy day for toppers and a chill one for ladies of fashion|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 June 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable examples of the design include the red lampshade hat worn by [[Doris Day]] in the 1959 romantic comedy ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]''. Costumes for this film were created by French costume/fashion designer [[Jean Louis]].&lt;ref name="CoF Laverty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laverty|first1=Lord Christopher|title=Doris Day in Pillow Talk: Couture Allure|url=http://clothesonfilm.com/doris-day-in-pillow-talk-couture-allure/25632/|website=clothesonfilm.com|publisher=Clothes on Film|accessdate=15 January 2015|ref=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Variations==
Like the pillbox, the lampshade remained popular into the 1960s, as hems rose and [[space age]] fashions took hold. Adaptations included both close-fitting and flared designs, as well as what fashion correspondent John Hart Roberts described as the "lampshade helmet", worn with hooded pullover, walking skirt and stockings at designer Maljana's [[Florence]] fashion show in 1965.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Hart Roberts"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hart Roberts|first1=John|title=Pop and op|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 January 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''law of the handicap of a head start''' (original [[dutch language|Dutch]]: ''[[:nl:Wet van de remmende voorsprong|Wet van de remmende voorsprong]]'') or '''dialectics of lead''' is a theory that suggests that an initial [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in a given area may result in a handicap in the long term. The term was coined in 1937 by [[Jan Romein]], a Dutch [[journalist]] and [[historian]], in his essay "The dialectics of progress" ("De dialectiek van de vooruitgang"), part of the series ''The unfinished past'' (''Het onvoltooid verleden'').

==The phenomenon==
The ''law of the handicap of a head start'' describes a [[phenomenon]] that is applicable in numerous settings. The [[Principle|law]] suggests that making progress in a particular area often creates circumstances in which stimuli are lacking to strive for further progress. This results in the individual or group that started out ahead eventually being overtaken by others. In the [[terminology]] of the law, the ''head start'', initially an advantage, subsequently becomes a ''handicap''. 

An explanation for why the phenomenon occurs is that when a society dedicates itself to certain standards, and those standards change, it is harder for them to [[Adaptation|adapt]]. Conversely, a society that has not committed itself yet will not have this problem. Thus, a society that at one point has a head start over other societies, may, at a later time, be stuck with [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] [[technology]] or ideas that get in the way of further progress. One consequence of this is that what is considered to be the [[state of the art]] in a certain field can be seen as "jumping" from place to place, as each leader soon becomes a victim of the handicap. 

In common terms, societies, companies, and individuals are often confronted with the decision to either [[Investment|invest]] now and get a fast return, or put off the investment until a new technology has emerged and possibly make a bigger profit then. For example, a regular problem for individuals is the decision of when to buy a new [[computer]]. Since computer speed develops at a steady pace, delaying the investment for a year may mean having to make do with a slower (or no) computer for the first year, but after that the individual will be able to buy a better computer for the same price. In many cases, however, the technological development is not as predictable as this, so it is harder to make an informed decision.

A related law that can be considered as the contrary of this law is the ''Law of the stimulative arrears'' (''[[:nl:Wet van de stimulerende achterstand|Wet van de stimulerende achterstand]]'') published by Erik van der Hoeven in 1980.&lt;ref name=hoeven&gt;{{cite book|last=van der Hoeven|first=Erik|title=De wet van de stimulerende achterstand|year=1980|publisher=Bakker|location=[[Amsterdam]]|isbn=978-90-6019-742-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The author gives an example of the law in his original essay. During a trip to [[London]], he wonders why at that time it was still lit by [[Gas lighting|gas lamps]], rather than [[electric light]]s as were by then common in other [[Europe]]an capitals like [[Amsterdam]]. His explanation was that London's head start—their possession of street lights before most other cities—was now holding them back in replacing them with the more modern electric lights. As the streets were already lit there was no pressing need to replace gas lamps, despite the other advantages of electric lighting.

A modern example—an independent observation given not by the author—the internet situation in the US and Romania. Romania got access to the latest and the greatest equipment in a time where it hadn't laid down any cables, but the US has already done that in the past. Upgrades from the American point of view would like a waste of money, as their equipment is already "doing the job".{{OR|date=December 2017}}

The abbeys aren't 'Merovingian' as such, although there are quite a few monasteries which were founded under royal Merovingian patronage, especially in the 7th and early 8th centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42956">An [[architectural style]] is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable.  A style may include such elements as [[wikt:form|form]], method of [[construction]], [[building materials]], and regional character.  Most [[architecture]] can be classified as a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.

Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of [[architectural history]]. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. A style may also spread through [[colonialism]], either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. After a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, [[classicism]] has been revived many times and found new life as [[neoclassicism]]. Each time it is revived, it is different.

[[Vernacular architecture]] works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded by new technology and national building standards.

==Examples of styles==
&lt;!--- Please don't flood this gallery! We should end up with a maximum of 8, perhaps 10, examples of DIFFERENT styles here. ---&gt;

==Chronology of styles==
{{Expand list|date=March 2011}}

===Prehistoric===
Early [[civilizations]] developed, often independently, in scattered locations around the globe. The architecture was often a mixture of styles in timber cut from local forests and stone hewn from local rocks. Most of the timber has gone, although the earthworks remain. Impressively, massive stone structures have survived for years.

===Classical Antiquity===
The architecture of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], derived from the ancient Mediterranean civilisations such as at [[Knossos]] on Crete. They developed highly refined systems for proportions and style, using mathematics and geometry.

===The Dark Ages===
The European "Dark Ages" are generally taken to run from the end of the [[Roman Empire]], around 400 AD, to around 1000 AD. Relatively little is known of this period, but Christianity (spread by the Romans) was already making a significant impact on European culture, and the Romans left a technological and social legacy.

===Medieval Europe===
The dominance of the Church over everyday life was expressed in grand spiritual designs which emphasized piety and sobriety. The Romanesque style was simple and austere. The Gothic style heightened the effect with heavenly spires, pointed arches and religious carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zyHqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA75 Robert Stuart (1854), ''Cyclopedia of architecture: historical, descriptive, typographical, decorative, theoretical and mechanical, alphabetically arranged, familiarly explained, and adapted to the comprehension of workmen'', A.

===The Renaissance and its successors===

1425-1660. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread through Europe, rebelling against the all-powerful Church, by placing Man at the centre of his world instead of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Leinwand, ''The pageant of world history'', Prentice-Hall, 1990, page 330&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic spires and pointed arches were replaced by classical domes and rounded arches, with comfortable spaces and entertaining details, in a celebration of humanity. The Baroque style was a florid development of this 200 years later, largely by the Catholic Church to restate its religious values.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7jzT0qcJu1MC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Jackson J.

===Neoclassicism===
1720-1837 and onward. A time often depicted as a rural idyll by the great painters, but in fact was a hive of early industrial activity, with small kilns and workshops springing up wherever materials could be mined or manufactured. After the Renaissance, neoclassical forms were developed and refined into new styles for public buildings and the gentry.

===Revivalism and Orientalism===
Late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Victorian Era was a time of giant leaps forward in technology and society, such as iron bridges, aqueducts, sewer systems, roads, canals, trains, and factories. As engineers, inventors, and businessmen they reshaped much of the British Empire, including the UK, India, Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and influenced Europe and the United States. Architecturally, they were revivalists who modified old styles to suit new purposes.

===Modernism and other styles contemporary with modernism===
1880 onwards. The Industrial Revolution had brought steel, plate glass, and mass-produced components. These enabled a brave new world of bold structural frames, with clean lines and plain or shiny surfaces. In the early stages, a popular motto was "[[Ornament and Crime|decoration is a crime]]". In the [[Eastern Bloc]] the Communists rejected the [[Western Bloc]]'s 'decadent' ways, and modernism developed in a markedly more bureaucratic, sombre, and monumental fashion.

The '''Magyarab'''&lt;ref name="Balázs"&gt;Géza Balázs, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=3lAwUu2pL8PLhAfK-ICwBw&amp;id=uybnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22magyarab%22+people&amp;q=%22magyarab%22#search_anchor The Story of Hungarian: A Guide to the Language], Corvina Books, 1997,p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iván Boldizsár, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x80nAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22magyarab%22+people&amp;dq=%22magyarab%22+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3lAwUu2pL8PLhAfK-ICwBw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjgK The New Hungarian Quarterly, Volume 7], Lapkiadó Publishing House, 1966, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; are a people living along the [[Nile]] [[River]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. They are of [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] ancestry, probably dating back to the late 16th century, when both parts of Hungary and Egypt were part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

== Name ==

The name "Magyarab" is not a [[portmanteau]] of the words "Magyar" and "Arab" as is commonly assumed{{By whom|date=July 2018}}.   Rather, the name is a concatenation of "Magyar" ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) and "Ab" which in [[Nubian language|Nubian]] simply means "tribe"{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. So Magyarab combined translates to "Tribe of the Magyars." In fact, to the Magyarab people, their Hungarian identity specifically sets them apart from the surrounding [[Egyptians]].

== History ==

According to legend, [[Christian]] Hungarians who had only recently been brought under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] formed a part of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] that was fighting in southern Egypt. Evidently, a portion or the entirety of the fighting unit remained there and intermarried with the local [[Nubian people|Nubian]] women.

According to local Magyarabs, their ancestor was ''Ibrahim el-Magyar'', a general who came from [[Buda]] (present-day [[Budapest]]) in 1517, he married with a local [[Nubian people|Nubian]] woman, they had a son called Ali. Ali had five sons (Selami, Mustafa, Djelal Eddin, Musa and Iksa), and Ali's five sons were the ancestor of all Magyarabs. Magyar Abs have been members of the [[World Federation of Hungarians]] (''Magyarok Világszövetsége'') since 1992 and still consider themselves as [[Hungarians]].

They were not discovered by Europeans until 1935, when [[László Almásy]], himself Hungarian, and his co-worker, the German engineer and explorer [[Hansjoachim von der Esch]], happened upon the tribe in the [[Nubia]]n region. Representatives of the tribes had attempted to make contact with Hungarian officials, but were unable to do so because of the outbreak of [[World War II]].

These people now have a mixed race appearance due to the intermarriage with the local Nubian population and no longer speak the [[Hungarian language]]. Around 1934, however, Esch, who spent several weeks with the population of the Magyarab island at [[Wadi Halfa]], put together a list of non-Arabic words used only on that island and which, according to him, were recognized by Almásy as similar to Hungarian words. His notes show that all Magyarab in [[Wadi Halfa]] were convinced that their ancestors came from "Nemsa" (the Arabic word for [[Austria]]), which might refer to any region of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He was told by the chief of the Magyarab island village that their ancestors arrived in Egypt/Sudan as a group of "Austrian" soldiers led by a man called Shenghal Sendjer, which Esch assumes to be originally ''General'' Sendjer or Senger.&lt;ref&gt;Hansjoachim von der Esch, Weenak - die Karawane ruft (Brockhaus, Leipzig 1941)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magyarab communities ==

Magyarabs live along the [[Nile]], in [[Sudan]] around [[Wadi Halfa]], in [[Egypt]] around [[Aswan]] in the villages of Magyarab-irki, Magyararti, Magyariyya, Magyar-nirki, Hillit el-Magyarab and about 400 Magyarabs live in [[Cairo]].

== Proverbs about the Magyarab ==

The people of many different ethnicities neighboring the Magyarab have proverbs that tell us more about the historical Magyarab people.

'''Al-majāri lā jisālli fil-mesjīd.''' - The Hungarian does not pray in the mosque.

'''Rá'sz el-mágyár zejj el-hágyár.''' - The Hungarian's head is as hard as a stone.

'''El-mágyárí jilbisz burnétá.''' - The Hungarian wears a hat.&lt;ref&gt;The surrounding Muslim populations wear [[turban]]s, differentiating their headwear from the Magyarab.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], a '''manuport''' is a natural object which has been moved from its original context by human agency but otherwise remains unmodified.&lt;ref name="Mary"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leakey |first1=Mary |title=Olduvai Gorge |date=1979 |publisher=Book Club Associates |location=London |pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Latin words ''manus'', meaning "hand" and ''portare'', meaning "to carry".

Examples include stones or shells moved from coastal or riverine areas or pebbles found in alien geological contexts. Some have been attributed to pre-human [[hominine]]s applying significance to pleasingly shaped natural objects such as the [[Makapansgat pebble]], as well as to later societies.

The appearance of the first manuport, the [[Makapansgat pebble]] with distinctive "staring eyes" markings and facial features deposited by hominid in a dolerite cave in [[Makapansgat]], [[South Africa]], may date as early as 3,000,000&amp;nbsp;BC.

Manuports have also been used to support the theory of the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]].

'''Matthew 1:13''' is the thirteenth verse of [[Matthew 1]] of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]].  The verse is part of the section where the [[genealogy]] of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the father of [[Jesus]], is listed.  This verse covers the section somewhat after the [[Babylonian Captivity]] six generation before [[Jesus]].
{{See also|Genealogy of Jesus}}

In the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] the text reads:
:And [[Zerubbabel|Zorobabel]] begat [[Abihud|Abiud]];
:and Abiud begat [[Eliakim (Bible)|Eliakim]];
:and Eliakim begat Azor;

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud.
:Abiud became the father of Eliakim.
:Eliakim became the father of Azor.

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=1:13&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 1:13]

==Analysis==
Zerubbabel is reported to have had a number of children, but no other source includes one named Abiud.  The Eliakim listed is not to be confused with [[Jehoiakim]], who is sometimes referred to as Eliakim. Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel is also listed in the genealogy of Jesus that appears in [[Luke 3:27]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} For a full discussion of this issue see [[Genealogy of Jesus#Explanations for divergence]].

Those listed in this part of the genealogy lived in the period after the [[Babylonian captivity]] and six generation before [[Jesus]]. Traditionally Zerubbabel's period is believed to have started in 539 BC, while Azor, the last listed, is said to have died in 372 BC.  This is a long period of time for just four people and many scholars feel an accurate list would be longer. Luke's genealogy has far more names covering this period. That this part of the genealogy is usually lacking in [[papponymic]] naming leads [[William F. Albright]] and C.S. Mann to speculate that over the generations the repeating and similar names were merged.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew." ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the people listed in this passage only Zerubbabel is well known. He plays an important role in the [[Book of Ezra]] and appears elsewhere in the Bible.  It is at this point that the Old Testament histories conclude, and the other three figures listed here are only known from this genealogy. It is thus unknown where the rest of the genealogy comes from. As noted in [[Josephus]], prominent Jewish families did keep detailed genealogical records, and the author of Matthew may have had access to some of these. Each local government also kept genealogical records to ensure proper rules of inheritance were followed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Robert H. Gundry]] believes that the rest of the genealogy is a creative fiction by the author of Matthew to fill in the gap between the end of the Old Testament sources and Jesus' birth. He argues that the reason Abiud, Eliakim, and Azor are not known outside this passage is because the author of Matthew made them up. According to Gundry, once the list moves away from the accepted genealogy of Jewish leaders, it is fabricated until it reaches the known territory of Joseph's grandfather. Gundry does not imagine that Matthew has made up the list entirely. The names listed do fit the period of history.  Rather Gundry sees the author, who had been copying the list of kings from the [[Old Testament]], turn to that source for the names of Joseph's ancestors.  Specifically he believes the names are all drawn from [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]], but were modified to not make the copying obvious.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Nadab and Abihu|Abihu]] was one of the priests whose name means "son of Judah." According to Gundry the author of Matthew liked the meaning behind this name and it was slight modified to become Abiud. [[Eliezer]] succeeded Abihu and his name is changed to Eliakim by the author of Matthew, linking him to the Eliakim mentioned in [[Isaiah 22]] and to [[Jehoiakim]], a king that was left out of the earlier narrative. [[Azariah (high priest)|Azariah]], another priest, had his name shortened to create the name Azor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

The son of Richard ap David ap Howel Goch of Pentre-pant, Selattyn, near [[Oswestry]],&lt;ref&gt;
http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-HANM-HAN-1388.html&lt;/ref&gt; he was born at [[Porkington]] in [[Shropshire]] in 1543. He was educated at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he obtained a chaplaincy in 1567, and graduated B.A. 1568, M.A. 1572, and D.D. 1582. On 7 June 1575, by a special dispensation, he was allowed to supplicate for the degree of B.D., as a nobleman's chaplain, while of less than the customary standing; but the degree was not granted till 1581.

He was vicar of [[St. Leonard's, Shoreditch]], from 8 December 1581 till June 1592, and vicar of [[St Mary's Church, Islington|St Mary's, Islington]] from 4 November 1583 to 5 September 1590. At Shoreditch he made himself notorious by removing the [[monumental brass]]es in the church, which he was believed to have done for his own gain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45434&lt;/ref&gt; In 1584, when [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]] was examined as to the circulation of a libel that he had got [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] by child, Hanmer appeared as a witness against the earl, and is described by [[William Fleetwood (recorder)|William Fleetword]], [[recorder of London]], who appeared in the case, as 'regarding not' an oath, 'and as a very bad man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cromwell|first=Thomas|title=Walks through Islington|year=1835|location=London|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the consistorial acts of the diocese of Rochester, Hanmer was charged between 1588 and 1590 with having celebrated a marriage without [[banns]] or license.

He crossed over to Ireland about 1591. In that year he appears as archdeacon of Ross and vicar of [[Timoleague]]. He was commended to [[Francis Walsingham]] by [[Christopher Carleill]] as a diligent preacher. On 4 December 1593 he was appointed treasurer of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Waterford|Waterford Cathedral]], vacant by the deprivation of [[Thomas Granger]]; in April 1594 vicar-choral of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]]; on 8 June 1595 prebendary of St. Michan's in Christ Church; and on 1 November of the same year rector of the Blessed Virgin Mary de Borages, in Leighlin. On 1 June 1598 he was presented to the parish church of Muckalee, the vicarage of Rathpatrick, and the vicarage of Kylbeacon and Killaghy, all in [[county Kilkenny]], in the [[diocese of Ossory]]. On 10 October in the following year he was presented to the rectory or wardenship of the new [[college of the Blessed Mary of Youghal]] in the diocese of Cloyne (ib. 6345). He appears to have resigned this and his prebend of St. Michan's in 1602. On 16 June 1603 he was appointed chancellor of the cathedral church of St. Canice, Kilkenny, and at the same time vicar of Fiddown and St. John the Evangelist, and rector of Aglish-Martin.

He died in 1604, and was buried in [[St. Michan's Church]], [[Dublin]]. It is likely that he fell a victim to the [[bubonic plague]]. Hanmer married at Shoreditch, 21 June 1581, Mary Austin, by whom he had four daughters.

'''Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki''' was a fight between American [[professional boxer]] [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Puroresu|Japanese professional wrestler]] [[Antonio Inoki]] that was held at the [[Nippon Budokan]] arena in Tokyo on June 26, 1976. At the time, Ali had come off a [[knockout]] victory over [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]] in May and was the reigning [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/[[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Heavyweight Champion. Inoki, who had been taught the art of [[catch wrestling]] by legendary wrestler [[Karl Gotch]], was staging exhibition fights against champions of various martial arts, in an attempt to show that pro wrestling was the dominant fighting discipline.&lt;ref name=Asahi&gt;[http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~YF7M-ON/ematch3.html Antonio Inoki Home Page: best matches]. Asahi-net.or.jp. Retrieved on 2015-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fight itself, which was fought under [[Hybrid martial arts|special rules]], is seen as a precursor to modern [[mixed martial arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.180travel.com/the-historical-roots-of-mma-muhammad-ali-vs-antonio-inoki.html]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the fight saw Inoki on his back kicking Ali's legs. The result of the fight, a draw, has long been debated by the press and fans. The fight was refereed by [[Gene LeBell]].

==Background==
In April 1975, at a reception held in the United States, Muhammad Ali was introduced to [[Ichiro Hatta]], president of the Japanese Amateur Wrestling Association. Ali characteristically bragged to Hatta: "Isn't there any Oriental fighter who will challenge me? I'll give him one million dollars if he wins". This flippant remark made headlines in Japan, and Ali's challenge was accepted by Inoki, whose financial backers offered the boxer $6 million for the fight. The deal was struck in March 1976, and the fight was scheduled for June 26 at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan]].&lt;ref name=sweet&gt;Tallent, Aaron. "[http://www.thesweetscience.com/article-archive/2005/1716-the-joke-that-almost-ended-ali-s-career The Joke That Almost Ended Ali's Career]". The Sweet Science. February 20, 2005. Retrieved June 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several press conferences were held to promote the fight. When the two men first met, Ali announced he would nickname Inoki "The Pelican", because of his prominent chin. Inoki replied, via an interpreter: "When your fist connects with my chin, take care that your fist is not damaged". He then presented Ali with a [[crutch]], to use after he had been thrown from the ring. Inoki said afterwards: "I don't know how seriously Muhammad Ali is taking the fight, but if he doesn't take it seriously, he could suffer damage. I'm going in there fighting. I may even break his arm".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;Bull, Andy. "[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/nov/11/the-forgotten-story-of-ali-inoki The forgotten story of ... Muhammad Ali v Antonio Inoki]". ''[[The Guardian]]''. November 11, 2009. Retrieved June 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the fight Ali made a scene upon his arrival at the airport, bellowing "There will be no [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]! Muhammad Ali has returned! There will be no Pearl Harbor!" as he walked past the mass of journalists. Anticipation for the fight was huge; it would be broadcast to 34 countries around the world to an estimated audience of 1.4 billion. Because of time zone differences, the bout was seen on June 25 at over 150 closed circuit TV locations in the US. In New York, pro-wrestling promoter [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]] sold tickets to a closed-circuit telecast of the fight at [[Shea Stadium]], and drew a crowd of 32,897. At Shea, the Ali and Inoki fight would be the main event on [[Showdown at Shea#1976|a card]] that also featured wrestler [[André the Giant]] vs. boxer [[Chuck Wepner]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;Cohen, Eric.

==Rules==
The fight was contested under specially created rules. Due to varying claims over the years, it is difficult to know the reasons behind their implementation.

It has been alleged that the Ali's handlers originally agreed to a [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#W|worked match]], but that Ali never agreed to fix the fight. According to boxing journalist Jim Murphy, the original plan was for Ali to accidentally punch the referee and knock him out. While standing over the referee, looking concerned, Inoki would knock him out with a kick to the head. The referee would then come around and count Ali out, giving Inoki the win in front of his fellow countrymen, and allowing Ali to save face. However, when Ali found out he had to lose, he refused, turning the fixed fight into a real one.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

According to Inoki, Ali and his entourage had signed on expecting the fight to be an [[exhibition fight|exhibition]] rather than a real contest. It was only when they went to see Inoki train six days before the fight, and saw him use a series of brutal [[kick]]s and [[Grappling hold|grapple]]s on sparring partners, that they sensed it would be a legitimate fight. Inoki alleges he was asked by Ali, "OK, so when do we do the rehearsal?", with Inoki replying: "No, no. This isn't an exhibition. It's a real fight!"&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

In the days leading up to the fight, Ali and Inoki's representatives began to renegotiate the rules. A list of restrictions was imposed on Inoki. He would not be allowed to throw, grapple or tackle Ali and could not land any kicks unless he had one knee on the mat.&lt;ref name=sweet/&gt; Ali's camp also demanded that the rules not be made public before the fight. Judo expert and US Marine [[Donn Draeger]] noted, "The rules have been so seriously modified that the contest is no longer boxing versus wrestling. Unless this were done there would be no way to choreograph the match and make it look convincing. Ali can grapple or punch the man down; Inoki is not allowed to leg-dive or tackle. That latter restriction is the same as prohibiting Ali from jabbing. What a farce!"&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

Forty years after the fight, the referee Gene LeBell stated that there were no actual limitations on kicking or grappling and said all types of kicking, throwing and grappling were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWXwkpYeOck&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional wrestler [[Bret Hart]], then an employee of Inoki's, claimed in his autobiography that "the [[Nation of Islam|black Muslims]] who were backing Ali made it clear that if Inoki laid a finger on their champ, they would kill him. That's why Inoki lay on his back for fifteen rounds, kicking Ali in the shins so as not to use his hands".&lt;ref name="Hart2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bret Hart|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycs4AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73|date=8 October 2008|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=978-0-446-54607-2|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fight summary==
===Entrances===
Inoki made his entrance first, wearing his signature purple robe and being accompanied by former Olympic [[amateur wrestler]] [[Karl Gotch]], Olympic [[judo]] medalist [[Seiji Sakaguchi]], wrestling trainer [[Kotetsu Yamamoto]], and star wrestler [[Kantaro Hoshino]]. Ali was the second, sporting a red and white robe and being followed by his [[manager]] Herbert Muhammad, his trainers [[Angelo Dundee]] and Wali Muhammad, his cornerman [[Drew Bundini Brown]], and Dr. Ferdie Pachecho. For this occasion, his entourage had been reinforced with professional wrestler [[Freddie Blassie]], [[taekwondo]] master [[Jhoon Goo Rhee]], and promoter [[Butch Lewis]]. He donned special gloves, smaller than boxing ones, loaded with tape and gauze.&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite book|author=Josh Gross|title=Ali vs. Inoki: The Forgotten Fight That Inspired Mixed Martial Arts and Launched Sports Entertainment|url=|date= June 21, 2016|publisher=BenBella Books|isbn=978-1-942-95219-0|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rounds 1–5===
As soon as the opening bell rang, Inoki ran the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} distance between Ali and himself and slid at the legs of Ali, who sidestepped the attack. Inoki stayed on the ground and started kicking and sweeping for Ali's legs. After scoring a hard kick to the right leg, Inoki stood up momentarily, but returned to his field and continued throwing kicks, landing a [[side kick]] which forced Ali's corner to instruct him to back away from Inoki. Ali taunted Inoki to stand up, but the wrestler answered by continuing his kicking strategy, connecting with a few of them until the end of the round.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

The second and third rounds unfolded the same way, with Inoki taking refuge from possible punches on the mat and kicking towards an infuriated Ali. The boxer maneuvered to avoid several of the kicks, but Inoki [[crawling (human)#Crab crawl|crab crawled]] across the mat towards him and kept connecting kicks to his legs. By the third round, a wound had appeared on Ali's left knee, and the crowd had started to boo at the lack of solid action. Ali began walking around the ring, out of reach of Inoki's kicks, taunting him by shouting "Coward Inoki! Inoki no fight!" and "One punch! I want one punch!"&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

In the fourth round, Inoki missed a jumping [[side kick]] and, still on his back, crawled towards Ali, trapping him in a corner. After referee LeBell restarted action in the center of the ring, Inoki returned to his strategy, prompting Ali to scream "I thought Inoki could wrestle!" and "Inoki girl!" multiple times. Inoki eventually trapped him again in a corner and started kicking wildly at his thighs, prompting Ali to leap up on to the ropes and tuck his legs underneath him in an attempt to avoid them. A new restart by LeBell came near of the end of the round.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

The fifth round followed closely the already familiar pattern of the match, with Inoki landing kicks from his back and Ali looking for ways to counter it. The round did feature, however, an instance in which Inoki knocked Ali off his feet with one of his kicks. Upon recovering and dancing around to avoid more hits, the boxer managed to grab Inoki's boot and drag him a short distance, but the bell sounded before anything could follow up. Ali's legs were already bruised and bleeding due to the accumulated kicks, the sight of which finally drew some appreciation from the crowd after the round ended.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

===Rounds 6–10===
In round six, Inoki repeated his usual jumping side kick into lying on the canvas. One of the subsequent kicks landed toe-first on Ali's groin, gaining a warning from LeBell, but he followed up with two more successful legal kicks. Ali got hold of Inoki's boots with the goal of immobilizing him for a punch, but Inoki, wiser in grappling, countered by grabbing Ali's left shoe, wrapping his right leg around Ali's right calf and sweeping down to the mat. Inoki sat on Ali and turned towards his legs, pursuing a [[leglock]], but Ali managed to swing one of his feet over the ring rope, which called for a standing restart. Knowing his chance had waned, Inoki still threw a back elbow strike to Ali's face while action was being stopped, gaining a warning and a point deducted by LeBell due to the boxer's protests.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; As the bout resumed, Ali tried to kick Inoki while illegally holding the ropes for balance, attracting his own reprimand.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

In the seventh round, it was Inoki who goaded Ali to meet him on the ground, but Ali refused and threw a pair of kicks that missed. Ali finally threw his first punch, a long jab to Inoki's face, only for Inoki to knock him down with a sweeping kick. Although the crowd chanted for Ali, he seemed wary of trying to strike again, allowing for another landed kick for the wrestler. After the round ended, the bloody state of Ali's left leg worried Dr. Pacheco, who rubbed it with ice and ointment. Meanwhile, Dundee went over to the Japanese corner and talked to Gotch, claiming that one of Inoki's brass [[eyelet]]s had come loose from his shoe and was cutting Ali's legs. He demanded that they taped the tips of his shoelaces, and so they did.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

The match's pattern did not change in round eight, where Ali had predicted he would finish Inoki. The Japanese wrestler connected a pair of kicks that dropped Ali again, although LeBell mistakenly warned him for a low blow. He was also forced to stop the match several times to apply tape to Inoki's shoe. The uneventful round ended with Ali still taunting Inoki and shouting "Inoki nothing!"&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

In the ninth, Ali passed to attack. He crouched down and sought for jabs while dancing, drawing chants from the crowd. He also attempted to circle the supine Inoki around, trying to get Inoki to return to his feet to avoid being outmaneuvered, and thus entering hitting range. However, Inoki followed his strategy and landed a kick that sent Ali staggering to his corner. Inoki connected another, and by this point Ali's repeated tumbling made evident to the crowd the damage to his legs.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

In the tenth, Ali threw his second punch, landing a jab in Inoki's face, but the execution of the move left his leg open to another kick. Although Inoki followed up with an inside leg kick and an outside one to the same leg, the crowd chanted for him to fight standing, so he charged at Ali, who clamped to the ring ropes. The rest of the round went without new events, so the crowd was now solidly against Inoki, despite Ali engaging in increasingly worried talks with his team.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

===Rounds 11–15===
The eleventh round saw Ali trying a new tactic. As suggested by his cornerman Rhee, a [[taekwondo]] expert, Ali would try to block Inoki's kicks with his gloves and arms in order to protect his leg. This allowed Ali to catch and twist Inoki's foot, although he lacked the grappling knowledge to turn it into a submission move. The boxer's blocks were relatively successful, but Inoki had continued to land kicks, and Ali's corner was forced to tend his leg again. In Inoki's own corner, Gotch advised Inoki to either tackle Ali down or capitalize on the next time Ali fell down, so he could pin him and finish him by submission.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

In round twelve, Ali became confident after blocking several, though not all, of Inoki's kicks. Inoki then got up and landed a clean [[low kick]], but this drew protests, as rules impeded him from kicking standing. Ali's corner told him to capitalize and attack Inoki, but the latter immediately returned to safe ground, impeding further action. When the round ended, Ali's left leg was so swollen that, according to reviewers, it "appeared to be double the size of the right."&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

In the thirteenth round, it was Ali who became the aggressor, taking the center of the ring and backing Inoki towards a corner. The wrestler then feigned a takedown attempt to push Ali towards the ropes, as he could not execute a true technique due to the ruleset. Afterwards, Ali taunted him with by blocking with his glove, but Inoki did not kick as expected, as he charged at Ali again. The wrestler grabbed a waist lock, threatening with a [[suplex]], but Ali hurredly grabbed the rope. During the subsequent [[clinch (grappling)|clinch]], Ali put his weight on Inoki, to which the latter answered with an illegal knee strike to the groin. Among the protests, LeBell asked Ali if he could continue, and it seemed the boxer was going to exit the ring, but the referee convinced him to return. Restarting the bout, Inoki threw a tentative low kick, but Ali responded by firing and connecting two jabs, forcing him to go to the canvas as usual. After the round ended, Inoki was deduced another point due to the groin strike.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

In the fourteenth round, Inoki feigned some bare-fisted jabs and a takedown before dropping low for another of his kicks. Ali clamped to the ropes without provocation, drawing protests by Inoki. The contenders exchanged taunts, goading each other to meet in their respective field of expertise. Ali then landed a stiff left jab at the very end of the round.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

Before the fifteenth and final round, Inoki and Ali shook hands while the crowd acclaimed in anticipation of a possible finish. However, Inoki's strategy went unchanged, even although Ali reminded him of the bout's nearby ending. Inoki landed several kicks more before Ali landed a [[counterpunch (boxing)|counter]] jab, but nothing came from it, and when the final bell sound, both men shook hands again and embraced among a mix of cheers and jeers.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

After Ali gave a speech about how he thought himself as the winner due to Inoki's "cowardice", the judges gathered to decided the result. Veteran professional wrestler Kokichi Endo scored it 74–72 for Ali, while boxing judge Ko Toyama scored it 72–68 for Inoki, thus leaving the weight of the decision to referee LeBell. Taking into consideration the points deducted from Inoki, he scored it 71–71 and thereby a draw.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The result meant no one had to lose face; Inoki could claim he would have won had it not been for the penalties, whereas Ali could defend himself by saying his opponent had cheated.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; However, the fight was poorly received. The crowd at the Budokan threw rubbish into the ring and chanted "Money back! Money back!" Donn Draeger said of the response: "The Budokan janitorial people took almost a full day to clean up the garbage that was hurled at the two 'combatants' as the result of their lousy performance".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Ali's left leg was so badly swollen and bleeding that it led to an infection. He also suffered two blood clots in his legs affecting his mobility for the remainder of his boxing career. At one point, even although Ali insisted to the press that it was nothing serious, amputation was also discussed.&lt;ref name=sweet/&gt;

Riots and boos happened not only in the Tokyo Dome, but also among the crowds of broadcasts of the event, as they were unaware of the restrictions put on Inoki. [[Dave Meltzer]] explained it as "they were expecting something like a cross between a boxing match and a pro wrestling match and got nothing resembling either."&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt; Only after the fight Inoki could explain himself to a world critical of his tactics during the fight. "I was handicapped by the rules that said no tackling, no karate chops, no punching on the mat. I kept my distance to stay away of Ali's punches."&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt; His reputation got soured for a long time, although Asian audiences eventually appreciated he had represented them and avoided a loss.

==Legacy==
The fight is considered by boxing writers and fans as one of the most embarrassing moments in the career of both Ali and his cornermen.&lt;ref name=sweet/&gt; Rhee considered the match and their participation as "shameful", and Pacheco would even deny to have taken part in the event until forty years later.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

Despite this, Ali and Inoki became good friends following the fight. Inoki started using Ali's theme music, "The Greatest" (taken from [[The Greatest (1977 film)|the film]]), as his own signature tune, and borrowed the catchphrase "bom-ba-ye" from Ali's fans at the [[Rumble in the Jungle]]. Ali would continue to box for the next five years. In 1978, he lost the WBA and WBC heavyweight championships to [[Leon Spinks]], but regained the WBA title (the WBC had stripped Spinks of his title due to his refusal to fight [[Ken Norton]], the Number 1 contender) in a rematch the same year. In 1986, Spinks would also fight and lose to Inoki in the eighth round of a match for the [[WWF World Martial Arts Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=Asahi/&gt; After a two-year retirement, Ali would lose to [[Larry Holmes]] in 1980, and following a unanimous-decision loss to [[Trevor Berbick]] in 1981, retired from boxing.

Inoki continued to wrestle for the next twenty-two years. In 1989, Inoki established his own political group, the [[Sports and Peace Party]]. He was elected to the [[House of Councillors]] of the [[Diet of Japan]]. In 1990, he was sent to negotiate with [[Saddam Hussein]] over the release of Japanese citizens being held hostage in Iraq. He eventually left office in 1995 amid accusations he had been bribed by the [[Yakuza]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

The fight played a role in the history of [[mixed martial arts]], particularly in [[Japan]]. The match inspired Inoki's students [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and [[Minoru Suzuki]] to found [[Pancrase]] in 1993, which in turn inspired the foundation of [[Pride Fighting Championships]] in 1997.

In 1998, 38 years after his wrestling debut, Inoki retired. Ali flew out from America to watch Inoki win his final match against [[Don Frye|Don "The Predator" Frye]]. After the match, Ali climbed into the ring and hugged Inoki. Ali's representative read a message over the PA:

{{quote|It was 1976 when I fought Antonio Inoki at the Budokan. In the ring, we were tough opponents. After that, we built love and friendship with mutual respect. So, I feel a little less lonely now that Antonio has retired. It is my honour to be standing on the ring with my good friend after 22 years. Our future is bright and has a clear vision. Antonio Inoki and I put our best efforts into making world peace through sports, to prove there is only one mankind beyond the sexual, ethnical{{sic}} or cultural differences. It is my pleasure to come here today."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;}}

The '''Planet Simulator''' (also known as a '''Planetary Simulator''') is a machine designed to study the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] on planet [[Earth]] and beyond. The simulator machine was announced by researchers at [[McMaster University]] on behalf of the [[Origins Institute]] on 4 October 2018.&lt;ref name="BW-20181004"&gt;{{cite news |last=Balch |first=Erica |title=Ground-breaking lab poised to unlock the mystery of the origins of life on Earth and beyond |url=https://brighterworld.mcmaster.ca/articles/ground-breaking-lab-poised-to-unlock-the-mystery-of-the-origins-of-life-on-earth-and-beyond/ |date=4 October 2018 |work=[[McMaster University]] |accessdate=4 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EA-20181004"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Ground-breaking lab poised to unlock the mystery of the origins of life |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/mu-glp100418.php |date=4 October 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GN-20181004"&gt;{{cite news |last=Casey |first=Liam |title=McMaster University researchers testing origins of life theory in new planet simulator |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4516282/mcmaster-researchers-planet-simulator/ |date=4 October 2018 |work=[[Global News]] |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IVG-2018"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Planet Simulator |url=https://www.intravisiongroup.com/planet-simulator |date=2018 |work=IntraVisionGroup.com |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC-20181005"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chung |first=Emily |title=Canadian researchers use new 'planet simulator' to probe origins of life - 'Life is probably a relatively frequent process in the universe' new experiments suggests |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/origins-of-life-lab-1.4852248 |date=5 October 2018 |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES-209181014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Paul Scott |title=New technology may help solve mystery of life's origins - How did life on Earth begin?

The one-of-a-kind planet simulator is about the size of a [[microwave oven]] and can control [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[pressure]], [[atmosphere]] and [[radiation levels]] that may be consistent with conditions on the early Earth, or conditions on other astronomical bodies, including other [[planet]]s, [[exoplanet]]s and the like.&lt;ref name="GN-20181004" /&gt; The simulator project, begun in 2012, was funded with $1 million from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], the [[Ontario government]] and [[McMaster University]], and was built by [https://angstromengineering.com/ Angstrom Engineering Inc] of [[Kitchener, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="BW-20181004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC-20181005" /&gt;

==Observations==
According to researchers, preliminary tests with the simulator, under possible conditions of the [[early Earth]], created [[protocell]]s, not living but very important nonetheless.&lt;ref name="GN-20181004" /&gt; According to biologist [[David W. Deamer|David Deamer]], the machine is a [[wiktionary:game changer|game changer]], and the cells produced so far are "significant". The "cells are not alive, but are [[Evolution|evolutionary steps]] toward a [[Life|living system of molecules]] ... [the simulator] opens up a lot of experimental activities that were literally impossible before.”&lt;ref name="GN-20181004" /&gt; Based on initial tests with the new simulator technology, project director Rheinstadter stated that it "seems that the formation of life is probably a relatively frequent process in the [[universe]]".&lt;ref name="CBC-20181005" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6054">A '''Presidential Emergency Facility''' ('''PEF'''), also called Presidential Emergency Relocation Centers and VIP Evacuation and Support Facilities, is a fortified, working residence intended for use by the [[President of the United States]] should normal presidential residences, such as the [[White House]] or [[Camp David]], be destroyed or overrun during [[war]] or other types of national emergencies. Some Presidential Emergency Facilities are specially designated sections of existing government and military installations, while others are dedicated sites that have been purpose-built. Various sources state there are, or were, between 9 and 75 such facilities.

==Quantity and location==
In his 1984 journalistic expose “The Day After World War III”, Edward Zuckerman states there were then nine Presidential Emergency Facilities within a 25-minute helicopter trip from [[Washington, D.C.]] According to Zuckerman, sites known to him at that time were code-named Cartwheel (at [[Fort Reno Park]]), Corkscrew, Cowpuncher, and Cannonball ([[Cross Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Cross Mountain, Pennsylvania]]), though all have since been decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Edward|title=The Day After World War Iii|date=1984|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=0670258806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richey|first1=Warren|title=The 'Strangelovian' world of civil defense planning|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0806/080611.html|accessdate=10 March 2016|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=6 August 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fcc" /&gt;   The White House itself is known as Crown while the presidential compound at the [[High Point Special Facility]] is Crystal (sometimes referred to as Crystal Palace).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheney|first1=Dick|title=In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir|date=2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1439176221|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cannon222ball.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial view of the decommissioned Presidential Emergency Facility "Cannonball" in rural Pennsylvania.]]
In a 2004 report to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) concerning Corkscrew, which at the time had been decommissioned as a PEF site and transferred to the FCC, historian David Rotenstein contended there were 75 PEFs “scattered throughout the United States”, a number also claimed by the [[Brookings Institution]].&lt;ref name="fcc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rotenstein|first1=David|title=FCC Historic Preservation Policies &amp;  Visual Impacts to Historic Properties WT Docket No. 03-128|date=April 2004|url=http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view;jsessionid=XZJLTZ5Jk9Vf1D8JnkLBMHp9mTYxpJXnRy8nvfQ3hLt4lsLF2Mpl!-448120223!-58662085?id=6516088702|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Facts About U.S. Nuclear Weapons|url=http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/archive/nucweapons/50|website=brookings.edu|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|accessdate=10 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313163740/http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/archive/nucweapons/50|archivedate=13 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and staffing==
Construction on Presidential Emergency Facilities began in the 1960s from classified, [[black budget]] government appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krugler|title=This is only a Test: How Washington D.C. Prepared for Nuclear War|date=2006|publisher=Springer|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfPIAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Purpose-built Presidential Emergency Facilities are silo-like structures constructed from reinforced concrete that sit atop an underground warren of bunkers and chambers designed to withstand a [[nuclear explosion]].&lt;ref name="fcc"/&gt; One of the few descriptions of a Presidential Emergency Facility observed while still in operation was provided by [[U.S. Coast Guard]] Captain Alex R. Larzelere, a former White House military aide, who visited one such site in 1968.&lt;ref name="witness" /&gt; 

{{cquote|… we drove out of Washington for three hours or more. When we turned off the main road we drove through heavily wooded and hilly terrain. [Commander John] Clearwater left the paved road and went up a dirt road.  We finally came to a structure, painted forest green to blend in with the trees. The rustic appearance of the outside of the facility and the unimproved condition of the forested land attracted little attention. Most of the facility was below ground.}}

Larzelere went on to describe the subterranean interior of the site, noting there were quarters for the President and his staff with beds kept ready for immediate use with fresh linens, communications facilities, and stores stocked with emergency rations, medicine, and other supplies to sustain several people for a prolonged period.&lt;ref name="witness"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larzelere|first1=Alex|title=Witness To History: White House Diary of a Military Aide to President Richard Nixon|date=2009|isbn=1449046614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Gulley, a former [[U.S. Marine]] assigned to the [[White House Military Office]], reported in 1980 that PEFs were all "manned twenty-fours a day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherill|first1=Robert|title=Snitching On the Chief Executive|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1980/07/27/snitching-on-the-chief-executive-breaking-cover-by-bill-gulley-with-mary-ellen-reese-simon-and-schuster-288-pp-1195/0f364e17-c15f-4859-a60f-7ba9302adc05/|accessdate=10 March 2016|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=27 July 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gulley|first1=Bill|title=Breaking Cover|date=1980|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0671245481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Periods in US history}}
{{Progressivism}}

The '''Progressive Era''' is a period of widespread social [[activism]] and political [[reform]] across the United States that spanned from the 1890s to the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Buenker, John C. Boosham, and Robert M. Crunden, ''Progressivism'' (1986) pp 3–21&lt;/ref&gt; The main objectives of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive movement]] were eliminating problems caused by [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[immigration]], and [[political corruption]].

The movement primarily targeted [[political machine]]s and their bosses. By taking down these corrupt representatives in office, a further means of [[direct democracy]] would be established. They also sought regulation of monopolies (trust busting) and corporations through [[United States antitrust law|antitrust laws]], which were seen as a way to promote equal competition for the advantage of legitimate competitors.

Many progressives supported [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcoholic beverages]], ostensibly to destroy the political power of local bosses based in [[bar (establishment)|saloons]], but others out of a religious motivation.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Timberlake, ''Prohibition and the progressive movement, 1900–1920'' (1970) pp 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] was promoted to bring a "purer" female vote into the arena.&lt;ref&gt;On purification, see David W. Southern, ''The Malignant Heritage: Yankee Progressives and the Negro Question, 1900–1915'' (1968); Southern, ''The Progressive Era And Race: Reaction And Reform 1900–1917'' (2005); Norman H. Clark, ''Deliver Us from Evil: An Interpretation of American Prohibition'' (1976) p 170; and [[Aileen Kraditor]], ''The Ideas of the Woman Suffrage Movement: 1890–1920'' (1967). 134–36.&lt;/ref&gt;  A third theme was building an [[Efficiency Movement]] in every sector that could identify old ways that needed modernizing, and bring to bear scientific, medical and engineering solutions; a key part of the efficiency movement was [[scientific management]], or "[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylorism]]".

Many activists joined efforts to reform local government, public education, medicine, finance, insurance, industry, railroads, churches, and many other areas. Progressives transformed, professionalized and made "scientific" the social sciences, especially history,&lt;ref name="Richard Hofstadter 1968" /&gt; economics,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; and political science.&lt;ref name="Barry Karl 1975" /&gt; In academic fields the day of the amateur author gave way to the research professor who published in the new scholarly journals and presses. The national political leaders included Republicans [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], and [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and Democrats [[William Jennings Bryan]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Al Smith]]. Leaders of the movement also existed far from presidential politics: [[Jane Addams]], [[Grace Abbott]], [[Edith Abbott]] and [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]] were among the most influential non-governmental Progressive Era reformers.

Initially the movement operated chiefly at local levels; later, it expanded to state and national levels. Progressives drew support from the middle class, and supporters included many lawyers, teachers, physicians, ministers, and business people.&lt;ref&gt;George Mowry, ''The California Progressives'' (1963) p 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Progressives strongly supported [[scientific method]]s as applied to economics,  government, industry, finance, medicine, schooling, theology, education, and even the family. They closely followed advances underway at the time in Western Europe&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted numerous policies, such as a major transformation of the banking system by creating the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Kazin|title=The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political  Turn up  History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWLGcZ7pyAC&amp;pg=PA181|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=181|isbn=9781400839469|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the arrival of [[cooperative banking]] in the US with the founding of the first [[credit union]] in 1908&lt;ref&gt;https://www.acumuseum.org/credit-union-history&lt;/ref&gt;. Reformers felt that old-fashioned ways meant waste and inefficiency, and eagerly sought out the "one best system".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis L. Gould, ''America in the Progressive Era, 1890–1914'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David B. Tyack]], ''The One Best System: A History of American Urban Education'' (Harvard UP, 1974), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Government reform==
Disturbed by the waste, inefficiency, stubbornness, corruption, and injustices of the [[Gilded Age]], the Progressives were committed to changing and reforming every aspect of the state, society and economy. Significant changes enacted at the national levels included the imposition of an [[income tax]] with the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], direct election of [[United States Senate|Senators]] with the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], [[Prohibition]] with the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], election reforms to stop corruption and fraud, and [[women's suffrage]] through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Kyvig, ''Explicit and authentic acts: amending the U.S. Constitution, 1776–1995'' (Kansas UP, 1996) pp. 208–14;Hedwig Richter: TRANSNATIONAL REFORM AND DEMOCRACY: ELECTION REFORMS IN NEW YORK CITY AND BERLIN AROUND 1900, in: [[Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era]] 15 (2016), 149-175 URL: https://www.academia.edu/25338056/_TRANSNATIONAL_REFORM_AND_DEMOCRACY_ELECTION_REFORMS_IN_NEW_YORK_CITY_AND_BERLIN_AROUND_1900_in_Journal_of_the_Gilded_Age_and_Progressive_Era_15_2016_149-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==The middle class philosophy ==

A hallmark group of the Progressive Era, the middle class became the driving force behind much of the thought and reform that took place in this time. With an increasing disdain for the upper class and aristocracy of the time, the middle class is characterized by their rejection of the individualistic philosophy of the upper ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGerr |first1=Michael |title=A Fierce Discontent |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a rapidly growing interest in the communication and role between classes, those of which are generally referred to as the upper class, working class, farmers, and themselves, and sought to define these terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wiebe |first1=Robert H |title=The Search For Order: 1877-1920 |date=1967 |publisher=Hill and Wang |location=New York |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the founder off [[Hull-House]], [[Jane Addams]], coined the term "association" as a counter to [[Individualism]], with association referring to the search for a relationship between the classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGerr |first1=Michael |title=A Fierce Discontent |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the middle class (most notably women) began to move away from prior [[Victorian era]] domestic values. Divorce rates increased as women preferred to seek education and freedom from the home. Victorianism was pushed aside in favor of the rise of the Progressives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGerr |first1=Michael |title=A Fierce Discontent |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages=40–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muckraking: exposing corruption==
{{further|Muckrakers|Mass media and American politics}}
Magazines experienced a boost in popularity in 1900, with some attaining circulations in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers. In the beginning of the age of [[Mass media]] the rapid expansion of national advertising led to the cover price of popular magazines falling sharply to about 10 cents, lessening the financial barrier to consuming them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter C. Holloran et al. eds.|title=The A to Z of the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt3243E-Wm0C&amp;pg=PA266|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor contributing to the dramatic upswing in magazine circulation was the prominent coverage of corruption in politics, local government and big business, especially by journalists and writers who were labeled ''muckrakers.'' They wrote for popular magazines to expose social and political sins and shortcomings. Relying on their own [[investigative journalism]]; muckrakers often worked to expose social ills and corporate and [[Corruption in the United States|political corruption]]. Muckraking magazines, notably ''[[McClure's|McClure’s]],'' took on corporate monopolies and crooked [[political machine]]s while raising public awareness of chronic urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, and [[social issues]] like [[child labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Shapiro,  ed., ''The muckrakers and American society'' (Heath, 1968), contains representative samples as well as academic commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional exposés often had a major impact as well, such as those by [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;Judson A. Grenier, “Muckraking the muckrakers: Upton Sinclair and his peers.” in  David R Colburn and Sandra Pozzetta, eds., ''Reform and Reformers in the Progressive Era '' (1983) pp: 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' Sinclair exposed the unsanitary and inhumane practices of the meat packing industry. He quipped, “I aimed at the public’s heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,” as readers demanded and got the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] .&lt;ref&gt;Arlene F. Kantor, “Upton Sinclair and the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906.: ‘I aimed at the public’s heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach’.” ''American Journal of Public Health'' 66.12 (1976): 1202-1205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalists who specialized in exposing waste, corruption, and scandal operated at the state and local level, like [[Ray Stannard Baker]], [[George Creel]], and [[Brand Whitlock]]. Others such as [[Lincoln Steffens]] exposed political corruption in many large cities; [[Ida Tarbell]] is famed for her criticisms of [[John D. Rockefeller]]’s [[Standard Oil Company]].  In 1906, [[David Graham Phillips]] unleashed a blistering indictment of corruption in the U.S. Senate. Roosevelt gave these journalists their nickname when he complained they were not being helpful by raking up all the muck.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Miraldi, ed.

==Modernization==
{{Further|Efficiency Movement}}
The Progressives were avid modernizers, with a belief in science and technology as the grand solution to society's flaws.  They looked to education as the key to bridging the gap between their present wasteful society and technologically enlightened future society. Characteristics of Progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban-industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in an obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, a belief in the ability of experts and in the efficiency of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Buenker, and Robert M. Crunden. ''Progressivism'' (1986); Maureen Flanagan, ''America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890–1920s'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haber, ''Efficiency and Uplift Scientific Management in the Progressive Era 1890–1920'' (1964) 656&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific management, as promulgated by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], became a watchword for industrial efficiency and elimination of waste, with the stopwatch as its symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nelson, ''Frederick W. Taylor and the Rise of Scientific Management'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.-C. Spender|author2=Hugo Kijne|title=Scientific Management: Frederick Winslow Taylor's Gift to the World?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcLkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2012|publisher=Springer|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women==
{{main|History of women in the United States#Progressive era: 1900–1940}}
Across the nation, middle-class women organized on behalf of [[social reform]]s during the Progressive Era. Using the language of [[municipal housekeeping]] women were able to push such reforms as prohibition, women's suffrage, child-saving, and public health.

Middle class women formed local clubs, which after 1890 were coordinated by the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] (GFWC). Historian Paige Meltzer puts the GFWC in the context of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Movement]], arguing that its policies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;built on Progressive-era strategies of municipal housekeeping. During the Progressive era, female activists used traditional constructions of womanhood, which imagined all women as mothers and homemakers, to justify their entrance into community affairs: as "municipal housekeepers," they would clean up politics, cities, and see after the health and well being of their neighbors. Donning the mantle of motherhood, female activists methodically investigated their community's needs and used their "maternal" expertise to lobby, create, and secure a place for themselves in an emerging state welfare bureaucracy, best illustrated perhaps by clubwoman [[Julia Lathrop]]'s leadership in the [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]]. As part of this tradition of maternal activism, the Progressive-era General Federation supported a range of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care for mothers and children, to a ban on child labor, each of which looked to the state to help implement their vision of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;Paige Meltzer, "The Pulse and Conscience of America" The General Federation and Women's Citizenship, 1945–1960," ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'' (2009), Vol. 30 Issue 3, pp. 52–76. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/frontiers/v030/30.3.meltzer.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Women's suffrage===
{{main|National American Woman Suffrage Association}}
[[File:Mayer-Awakening-1915.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|"The Awakening": Suffragists were successful in the West; their torch awakens the women struggling in the East and South in this cartoon by Hy Mayer in ''Puck'' Feb. 20, 1915.]]

The [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) was an American women's rights organization formed in May 1890 as a unification of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA) and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA). The NAWSA set up hundreds of smaller local and state groups, with the goal of passing [[Women's suffrage|woman suffrage]] legislation at the state and local level. The NAWSA was the largest and most important suffrage organization in the United States, and was the primary promoter of women's right to vote. [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] was the key leader in the early 20th century. Like AWSA and NWSA before it, the NAWSA pushed for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing women's voting rights, and was instrumental in winning the ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Flexner, ''Century of Struggle'' (1959), pp. 208–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corrine M. McConnaughy, ''The Woman Suffrage Movement in America: A Reassessment'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; A breakaway group, the [[National Woman's Party]], tightly controlled by [[Alice Paul]], used [[civil disobedience]] to gain publicity and force passage of suffrage. Paul's members chained themselves to the White House fence in order to get arrested, then went on hunger strikes to gain publicity. While the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul began her campaign in 1917 and was widely criticized for ignoring the war and attracting radical anti-war elements.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy F. Cott, ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (1989) pp. 51–82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The number of rich families climbed exponentially, from 100 or so millionaires in the 1870s, to 4000 in 1892 and 16,000 in 1916. Many subscribed to [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s credo outlined in ''[[The Gospel of Wealth]]'' that said they owed a duty to society that called for philanthropic giving to colleges, hospitals, medical research, libraries, museums, religion and social betterment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivier Zunz]], ''Philanthropy in America: A History'' (2012) ch 1 [https://www.amazon.com/Philanthropy-America-History-Politics-Twentieth/dp/0691128367/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, American philanthropy matured, with the development of very large, highly visible private foundations created by [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]], and [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]]. The largest foundations fostered modern, efficient, business-oriented operations (as opposed to "charity") designed to better society rather than merely enhance the status of the giver. Close ties were built with the local business community, as in the "community chest" movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nikki Mandell, "Allies or Antagonists? Philanthropic Reformers and Business Reformers in the Progressive Era," ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era'' (2012), 11#1 71–117.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Red Cross]] was reorganized and professionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Branden Little. "Review of Jones, Marian Moser, ''The American Red Cross from Clara Barton to the New Deal''" [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=39722 H-SHGAPE, H-Net Reviews. August, 2013, online]&lt;/ref&gt; Several major foundations aided the blacks in the South, and were typically advised by [[Booker T. Washington]]. By contrast, Europe and Asia had few foundations. This allowed both Carnegie and Rockefeller to operate internationally with powerful effect.&lt;ref&gt;Zunz, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Progressives sought to enable the citizenry to rule more directly and circumvent machines, bosses and professional politicians. The institution of the initiative and referendums made it possible to pass laws without the involvement of the legislature, while the recall allowed for the removal of corrupt or under-performing officials, and the direct primary let people democratically nominate candidates, avoiding the professionally dominated conventions. Thanks to the efforts of Oregon State Representative [[William Simon U'Ren|William S. U'Ren]] and his [[Direct Legislation League]], voters in Oregon overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure in 1902 that created the [[initiative]] and [[referendum]] processes for citizens to directly introduce or approve proposed laws or amendments to the state constitution, making Oregon the first state to adopt such a system. U'Ren also helped in the passage of an amendment in 1908 that gave voters power to [[Recall election|recall]] elected officials, and would go on to establish, at the state level, popular election of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] and the first [[presidential primary]] in the United States. In 1911, California governor [[Hiram Johnson]] established the Oregon System of "Initiative, Referendum, and Recall" in his state, viewing them as good influences for citizen participation against the historic influence of large corporations on state lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Allswang, ''The initiative and referendum in California, 1898–1998,'' (2000) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; These Progressive reforms were soon replicated in other states, including [[Idaho]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]], and today roughly half of U.S. states have initiative, referendum and recall provisions in their state constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i&amp;r.htm | publisher = State Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute at USC | title = State Initiative and Referendum Summary | accessdate = 27 November 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160211180917/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm | archivedate = 11 February 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 16 states began using [[primary election]]s to reduce the power of bosses and machines.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ware, ''The American direct primary: party institutionalization and transformation'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, requiring that all senators be elected by the people (they were formerly appointed by state legislatures). The main motivation was to reduce the power of political bosses, who controlled the Senate seats by virtue of their control of state legislatures. The result, according to political scientist [[Henry Jones Ford]], was that the United States Senate had become a "Diet of party lords, wielding their power without scruple or restraint, on behalf of those particular interests" that put them in office.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hoebeke, ''The road to mass democracy: original intent and the Seventeenth Amendment'' (1995) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipal reform==
{{Further|American urban history#Progressive era: 1890s–1920s}}
A coalition of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts, and reformers hostile to the political machines started forming in the 1890s and introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste, inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.

The pace was set in [[Detroit|Detroit Michigan]], where Republican mayor [[Hazen S. Pingree]] first put together the reform coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cities set up municipal reference bureaus to study the budgets and administrative structures of local governments.

Progressive mayors took the lead in many key cities,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Finegold, "Traditional Reform, Municipal Populism, and Progressivism," ''Urban Affairs Review'', (1995) 31#1 pp 20-42&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (especially Mayor [[Tom L. Johnson|Tom Johnson]]); [[Toledo, Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. DeMatteo, "The Progressive As Elitist: 'Golden Rule' Jones And The Toledo Charter Reform Campaign of 1901," ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'', (1997) 69#1 pp 8–30&lt;/ref&gt; Jersey City, New Jersey;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Tobin, "The Progressive as Single Taxer: Mark Fagan and the Jersey City Experience, 1900–1917," ''American Journal of Economics &amp; Sociology'', (1974) 33#3 pp 287–298&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]];&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, "Progressive Reform in Los Angeles under Mayor Alexander, 1909–1913," ''California Historical Quarterly'', (1975) 534#1, pp:37–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Memphis, Tennessee]];&lt;ref&gt;G. Wayne Dowdy, "'A Business Government by a Business Man': E. H.

Ellis, "Robert Worth Bingham and Louisville Progressivism, 1905–1910," ''Filson Club History Quarterly'', (1980) 54#2 pp 169–195&lt;/ref&gt; and many other cities, especially in the western states. In [[History of Illinois|Illinois]], Governor [[Frank Lowden]] undertook a major reorganization of state government.&lt;ref&gt;William Thomas Hutchinson, ''Lowden of Illinois: the life of Frank O. Lowden'' (1957) vol 2&lt;/ref&gt; In Wisconsin, the stronghold of [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.|Robert La Follette Sr.]], the [[Wisconsin Idea]] used the state university as a major source of ideas and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressivism and the Wisconsin Idea|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-036/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural reform==
{{further|Country life movement}}
As late as 1920, half the population lived in rural areas. They experienced their own progressive reforms, typically with the explicit goal of upgrading country life.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Bowers, "Country-Life Reform, 1900–1920: A Neglected Aspect of Progressive Era History." ''Agricultural History'' 45#3 (1971): 211–21. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3741982 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1910 most farmers subscribed  to a farm newspaper, where editors promoted efficiency as applied to farming.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart W. Shulman, "The Progressive Era Farm Press," ''Journalism History'' (1999) 25#1  pp. 27–36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Special efforts were made to reach the rural South and remote areas, such as the mountains of [[Appalachia]] and the [[Ozarks]].&lt;ref&gt;William A. Link, ''A Hard Country and a Lonely Place: Schooling, Society, and Reform in Rural Virginia, 1870–1920'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most urgent need was better transportation. The railroad system was virtually complete; the need was for much better roads. The traditional method of putting the burden on maintaining roads on local landowners was increasingly inadequate. New York State took the lead in 1898, and by 1916 the old system had been discarded in every area. Demands grew for local and state government to take charge. With the coming of the automobile after 1910, urgent efforts were made to upgrade and modernize dirt roads designed for horse-drawn wagon traffic. The American Association for Highway Improvement was organized in 1910. Funding came from automobile registration, and taxes on motor fuels, as well as state aid. In 1916, federal-aid was first made available to improve post-roads, and promote general commerce. Congress appropriated $75 million over a five-year period, with the Secretary of Agriculture in charge through the [[Bureau of Public Roads]], in cooperation with the state highway departments. There were 2.4 million miles of rural dirt rural roads in 1914; 100,000 miles had been improved with grading and gravel, and 3000 miles were given high quality surfacing. The rapidly increasing speed of automobiles, and especially trucks, made maintenance and repair a high priority. Concrete was first used in 1933, and expanded until it became the dominant surfacing material in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold U. Faulkner, ''The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897–1917'' (1951) pp. 233–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lee Dearing, ''American highway policy'' (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; The South had fewer cars and trucks and much less money, but it worked through highly visible demonstration projects like the "[[Dixie Highway]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tammy Ingram, ''Dixie Highway: Road Building and the Making of the Modern South, 1900–1930'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural schools were often poorly funded, one room operations. Typically, classes were taught by young local women before they married, with only occasional supervision by county superintendents. The progressive solution was modernization through consolidation, with the result of children attending modern schools. There they would be taught by full-time professional teachers who had graduated from the states' teachers colleges, were certified, and were monitored by the county superintendents. Farmers complained at the expense, and also at the loss of control over local affairs, but in state after state the consolidation process went forward.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Reynolds, ''There goes the neighborhood: Rural school consolidation at the grass roots in early twentieth-century Iowa'' (University of Iowa Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danbom|first=David B.|title=Rural Education Reform and the Country Life Movement, 1900–1920|journal=Agricultural History|date=April 1979|volume=53|issue=2|pages=464–66|jstor=3742421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other programs were aimed at rural youth, including [[4-H]] clubs,&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Natasha Thompson, " The Changing Needs of Our Youth Today: The Response of 4-H to Social and Economic Transformations in Twentieth-century North Carolina." (PhD Diss. University of North Carolina at Greensboro, 2012). [http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Thompson_uncg_0154D_11047.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. County fairs not only gave prizes for the most productive agricultural practices, they also demonstrated those practices to an attentive rural audience. Programs for new mothers included maternity care and training in baby care.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Irvin Holt, ''Linoleum, Better Babies, and the Modern Farm Woman, 1890–1930'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement's attempts at introducing urban reforms to rural America often met resistance from traditionalists who saw the country-lifers as aggressive modernizers who were condescending and out of touch with rural life. The traditionalists said many of their reforms were unnecessary and not worth the trouble of implementing. Rural residents also disagreed with the notion that farms needed to improve their efficiency, as they saw this goal as serving urban interests more than rural ones. The social conservatism of many rural residents also led them to resist attempts for change led by outsiders. Most important, the traditionalists did not want to become modern, and did not want their children inculcated with alien modern values through comprehensive schools that were remote from local control.&lt;ref&gt;Danbom 1979, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen and Mark Friedberger, Education and Social Structure: An Historical Study of Iowa, 1870–1930 (Chicago: Newberry Library, 1976, [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED125982 online]).&lt;/ref&gt; The most successful reforms came from the farmers who pursued agricultural extension, as their proposed changes were consistent with existing modernizing trends toward more efficiency and more profit in agriculture.

==Overseas possessions: the Philippines==
The [[Philippines]] were acquired by the United States in 1899, after victory over Spanish forces at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] and a long series of controversial political debates between the senate and President McKinley and was considered the largest colonial acquisition by the United States at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power and Restraint|last=Meiser|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-62616-177-1|location=United States|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While anti-imperialist sentiments had been prevalent in the United States during this time, the acquisition of the Philippines sparked the relatively minor population into action. Voicing their opinions in public, they sought to deter American leaders from keeping the Asian-Pacific nation and to avoid the temptations of expansionist tendencies that were widely viewed as “un-American” at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nqbjc|title=Benevolent Assimilation: The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899-1903|last=MILLER|first=STUART CREIGHTON|date=1982|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300030815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippines was a major target for the progressive reformers. A 1907 report to Secretary of War Taft provided a summary of what the American civil administration had achieved. It included, in addition to the rapid building of a public school system based on English teaching, and boasted about such modernizing achievements as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;steel and concrete wharves at the newly renovated [[Port of Manila]]; dredging the [[River Pasig]]; streamlining of the Insular Government; accurate, intelligible accounting; the construction of a telegraph and cable communications network; the establishment of a postal savings bank; large-scale road-and bridge-building; impartial and incorrupt policing; well-financed civil engineering; the conservation of old Spanish architecture; large public parks; a bidding process for the right to build railways; Corporation law; and a coastal and geological survey.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900'' (2008), p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1903 the American reformers in the Philippines passed two major land acts designed to turn landless peasants into owners of their farms.  By 1905 the law was clearly a failure. Reformers such as Taft believed landownership would turn unruly agrarians into loyal subjects. The social structure in rural Philippines was highly traditional and highly unequal. Drastic changes in land ownership posed a major challenge to local elites, who would not accept it, nor would their peasant clients. The American reformers blamed peasant resistance to landownership for the law's failure and argued that large plantations and sharecropping was the Philippines' best path to development.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Ventura, "From Small Farms to Progressive Plantations: The Trajectory of Land Reform in the American Colonial Philippines, 1900–1916." ''Agricultural History'' 90#4 (2016): 459-483. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3098/ah.2016.090.4.459 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elite Filipina women played a major role in the reform movement, especially on health issues. They specialized on such urgent needs as infant care and maternal and child health, the distribution of pure milk and teaching new mothers about children's health. The most prominent organizations were the La Protección de la Infancia, and the National Federation of Women's Clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Mina Roces, "Filipino Elite Women and Public Health in the American Colonial Era, 1906–1940." Women's ''History Review'' 26#3 (2017): 477-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race relations==
Across the South black communities developed their own Progressive reform projects.&lt;ref&gt;John Dittmer, ''Black Georgia in the Progressive era, 1900–1920'' (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David W. Southern, ''The Progressive Era and Race: Reaction and Reform, 1900–1917'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical projects involved upgrading schools, modernizing church operations, expanding business opportunities, fighting for a larger share of state budgets, and engaging in legal action to secure equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Jones, ''African American Civil Rights: Early Activism and the Niagara Movement'' (2011) [https://www.questia.com/library/120085334/african-american-civil-rights-early-activism-and online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reform projects were especially notable in rural areas, where the great majority of Southern blacks lived.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Reid, "Rural African Americans and Progressive Reform," ''Agricultural History'' (2000) 74#2 pp. 322–41 on Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Washington Carver]] (1860-1943) was well known for his research projects, especially involving agriculture. He was also a leader in promoting environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Hersey, ''My Work Is That of Conservation: An Environmental Biography of George Washington Carver'' (2011) [https://www.questia.com/library/120080065/my-work-is-that-of-conservation-an-environmental online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural blacks were specially involved in environmental issues, in which they developed their own traditions and priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Dianne D. Glave, "'A Garden so Brilliant With Colors, so Original in its Design': Rural African American Women, Gardening, Progressive Reform, and the Foundation of an African American Environmental Perspective." ''Environmental History'' 8#3 (2003): 395–411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dianne D. Glave and Mark Stoll, eds., ''To Love the Wind and the Rain': African Americans and Environmental History.'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were some achievements that improved conditions for African Americans and other non-''white'' minorities, the Progressive Era was the nadir of American race relations. While white Progressives in principle believed in improving conditions for minority groups, there were wide differences in how this was to be achieved. Some, such as [[Lillian Wald]], fought to alleviate the plight of poor African Americans. Many, though, were concerned with enforcing, not eradicating, racial segregation. In particular, the mixing of black and white pleasure-seekers in 'black-and-tan' clubs troubled Progressive reformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keire|first=Mara L.|year=2001|title=The Vice Trust: A Reinterpretation of the White Slavery Scare in the United States, 1907–1917|url=|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=35|pages=5–41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Progressive ideology espoused by many of the era attempted to correct societal problems created by racial integration following the Civil War by segregating the races and allowing each group to achieve its own potential. That is to say that most Progressives saw racial integration as a problem to be solved, rather than a goal to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Racial Encounter: The Social Psychology of Contact and Desegregation | author=Durrheim, Kevin; Dixon, John | year=2005 | publisher=Routledge | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jR5kd11CUMC | pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Tar Heel Politics 2000 | author=Luebke, Paul | year=2000 | publisher=The University of North Carolina Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S9D7f9NQ1L0C | page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political Ideologies and Political Parties in America

Legal historian Herbert Hovenkamp argues that while many early progressives inherited the racism of Jim Crow, as they begin to innovate their own ideas, they would embrace [[behaviorism]], [[cultural relativism]] and [[marginalism]] which stress environmental influences on humans rather than biological inheritance. He states that ultimately progressives "were responsible for bringing [[scientific racism]] to an end".&lt;ref&gt;Hovenkamp, H. 2017  [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2767&amp;context=faculty_scholarship The Progressives: Racism and Public Law] Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper Series, 59 Ariz.

==Family and food==

[[File:Lindsey ben.jpg|thumb|Colorado judge [[Ben Lindsey (jurist)|Ben Lindsey]] a pioneer in the establishment of juvenile court systems.]]
Progressives believed that the family was the foundation stone of American society, and the government, especially municipal government, must work to enhance the family.&lt;ref&gt;Gwendoline Alphonso, "Hearth and Soul: Economics and Culture in Partisan Conceptions of the Family in the Progressive Era, 1900–1920," ''Studies in American Political Development,'' Oct 2010, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp. 206–32&lt;/ref&gt;  Local public assistance programs were reformed to try to keep families together. Inspired by crusading Judge [[Ben Lindsey (jurist)|Ben Lindsey]] of Denver, cities established juvenile courts to deal with disruptive teenagers without sending them to adult prisons.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, "Judge Ben Lindsey and the Juvenile Court Movement, 1901–1904," ''Arizona and the West,'' 1976, Vol. 18 Issue 1, pp. 5–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Marten, ed. ''Children and Youth during the Gilded Page and Progressive Era'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the progressive era more women took work outside the home. For the working class this work was often as a domestic servant.  Yet working or not women were expected to perform all the cooking and cleaning. This “affected female domestics’ experiences of their homes, workplaces, and possessions, While the male household members, comforted by the smells of home cooking, fresh laundry, and soaped floors, would have seen home as a refuge from work, women would have associated these same smells with the labor that they expended to maintain order.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979148778|title=Atlantic Crossings in the Wake of Frederick Douglass : Archaeology, Literature, and Spatial Culture.|last=Mark.|first=P.

The purity of food, milk and drinking water became a high priority in the cities. At the state and national levels new food and drug laws strengthened urban efforts to guarantee the safety of the food system. The 1906 federal [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], which was pushed by drug companies and providers of medical services, removed from the market patent medicines that had never been scientifically tested.&lt;ref&gt;Marc T. Law, "The Origins of State Pure Food Regulation," ''Journal of Economic History,'' Dec 2003, Vol. 63 Issue 4, pp. 1103–31&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decrease in standard working hours, urban families had more leisure time. Many spent this leisure time at movie theaters. Progressives advocated for censorship of motion pictures as it was believed that patrons (especially children) viewing movies in dark, unclean, potentially unsafe theaters, might be negatively influenced in witnessing actors portraying crimes, violence, and sexually suggestive situations. Progressives across the country influenced municipal governments of large urban cities, to build numerous parks where it was believed that leisure time for children and families could be spent in a healthy, wholesome environment, thereby fostering good morals and citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Gregory D. ''Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies''. Cambridge University Press 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eugenics==
{{main|Eugenics in the United States}}
Some Progressives sponsored [[eugenics]] as a solution to excessively large or underperforming families, hoping that birth control would enable parents to focus their resources on fewer, better children.&lt;ref name=" Thomas C. Leonard "&gt;Leonard, Thomas C. (2005) [http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era] Journal of Economic Perspectives, 19(4): 207–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Progressive leaders like [[Herbert Croly]] and [[Walter Lippmann]] indicated their classically liberal concern over the danger posed to the individual by the practice of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Cohen, ''The reconstruction of American liberalism, 1865–1914'' (2002) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  The Catholics strongly opposed birth control proposals such as eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Celeste Michelle Condit, ''The meanings of the gene: public debates about human heredity'' (1999) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional change==
The Progressives fixed some of their reforms into law by adding amendments 16, 17, 18, and 19 to the [[Us constitution|US Constitution]]. The [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th amendment]] made an income tax legal (this required an amendment due to Article One, Section 9 of the Constitution, which required that direct taxes be laid on the States in proportion to their population as determined by the decennial census). The Progressives also made strides in attempts to reduce political corruption through the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th amendment]] (direct election of U.S. Senators). The most radical and controversial amendment came during the anti-German craze of [[World War I]] that helped the Progressives and others push through their plan for [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] through the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th amendment]] (once the Progressives fell out of power the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st amendment]] repealed the 18th in 1933). The ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment]] in 1920, which recognized [[women's suffrage]] was the last amendment during the progressive era.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Kyvig, ''Explicit and authentic acts: amending the U.S. Constitution, 1776–1995'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant constitutional change that began during the progressive era was the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]] so that those rights would apply to the states. In 1920, Benjamin Gitlow was convicted under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and [[Gitlow v. New York|the case]] went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the justices decided that the First Amendment applied to the states as well as the federal government. Prior to that time, the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was considered to apply only to the federal government, not the states.

==Prohibition==

Prohibition was the outlawing of the manufacture, sale and transport of alcohol. Drinking itself was never prohibited. Throughout the Progressive Era, it remained one of the prominent causes associated with Progressivism at the local, state and national level, though support across the full breadth of Progressives was mixed. It pitted the minority urban Catholic population against the larger rural Protestant element, and Progressivism's rise in the rural communities was aided in part by the general increase in public consciousness of social issues of the [[temperance movement]], which achieved national success with the passage of the 18th Amendment by Congress in late 1917, and the ratification by three-fourths of the states in 1919. Prohibition was essentially a religious movement backed by the Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists, Scandinavian Lutherans and other evangelical churches. Activists were mobilized by the highly effective [[Anti-Saloon League]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Austin Kerr, ''Organized for Prohibition:  A New History of the Anti-Saloon League'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  Timberlake (1963) argues the dries sought to break the liquor trust, weaken the saloon base of big-city machines, enhance industrial efficiency, and reduce the level of wife beating, child abuse, and poverty caused by alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;James Timberlake, ''Prohibition and the Progressive Movement, 1900–1920'' (Harvard UP, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Agitation for prohibition began during the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the 1840s when crusades against drinking originated from evangelical Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Jack S. Blocker, ''American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelicals precipitated the second wave of prohibition legislation during the 1880s, which had as its aim local and state prohibition. During the 1880s, referendums were held at the state level to enact prohibition amendments. Two important groups were formed during this period. The [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) was formed in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Jed Dannenbaum, ''Drink and Disorder: Temperance Reform in Cincinnati from the Washingtonian Revival to the WCTU'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anti-Saloon League|The Anti-Saloon League]] which began in Ohio was formed in 1893, uniting activists from different religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, ''Organized for Prohibition:  A New History of the Anti-Saloon League'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The league, rooted in Protestant churches, envisioned nationwide prohibition. Rather than condemn all drinking, the group focused attention on the saloon which was considered the ultimate symbol of public [[vice]]. The league also concentrated on campaigns for the right of individual communities to choose whether to close their saloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=A fierce discontent|last=Michael.|first=McGerr,|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=88–89|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Georgia and Alabama were the first states to go dry followed by Oklahoma, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee in the following years. In 1913, Congress passed the [[Webb–Kenyon Act|Webb-Kenyon Act]], which forbade the transport of liquor into dry states.

By 1917, two thirds of the states had some form of prohibition laws and roughly three quarters of the population lived in dry areas. In 1913, the Anti-Saloon League first publicly appealed for a prohibition amendment. They preferred a constitutional amendment over a federal statute because although harder to achieve, they felt it would be harder to change. As the United States entered World War I, the Conscription Act banned the sale of liquor near military bases.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Mennell, "Prohibition: A Sociological View," ''Journal of American Studies'' 3, no. 2 (1969): 159–75.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1917, the Lever [[Food and Fuel Control Act]] banned production of distilled spirits for the duration of the war. The War Prohibition Act, November, 1918, forbade the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages (more than 2.75% alcohol content) until the end of demobilization.

The drys worked energetically to secure two-third majority of both houses of Congress and the support of three quarters of the states needed for an amendment to the federal constitution. Thirty-six states were needed, and organizations were set up at all 48 states to seek ratification. In late 1917, Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment; it was ratified in 1919 and took effect in January 1920. It prohibited the manufacturing, sale or transport of intoxicating beverages within the United States, as well as import and export. The [[Volstead Act]], 1919, defined intoxicating as having alcohol content greater than 0.5% and established the procedures for federal enforcement of the Act. The states were at liberty to enforce prohibition or not, and most did not try.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;David E. Kyvig,''Repealing National Prohibition'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer demand, however, led to a variety of illegal sources for alcohol, especially illegal distilleries and smuggling from Canada and other countries. It is difficult to determine the level of compliance, and although the media at the time portrayed the law as highly ineffective, even if it did not eradicate the use of alcohol, it certainly decreased alcohol consumption during the period. The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed in 1933, with the passage of the Twenty-First Amendment, thanks to a well-organized repeal campaign led by Catholics (who stressed personal liberty) and businessmen (who stressed the lost tax revenue).&lt;ref name="David" /&gt;

==Education==

The Progressives sought to reform and modernize schools at the local level. The era was notable for a dramatic expansion in the number of schools and students attending them, especially in the fast-growing metropolitan cities. By 1940, 50% of young adults had earned a high school diploma. The result was the rapid growth of the educated middle class, who typically were the grass roots supporters of Progressive measures.&lt;ref&gt;[[David B. Tyack]], ''The One Best System: A History of American Urban Education'' (Harvard University Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; During the Progressive Era, many states began passing compulsory schooling laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0112617.html |title=State Compulsory School Attendance Laws |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=1999-10-01 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An emphasis on [[school hygiene|hygiene]] and health was made in education, with [[physical education|physical]] and [[school health education|health education]] becoming more important and widespread.&lt;ref name = "ProgHealthA"&gt;{{cite book|title=The progressive era's health reform movement: a historical dictionary|first1=Ruth C.|last1=Engs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNeGQRBgd_MC|pages=20–22|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2003|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-97932-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's Education in Home Economics===
A new field of study, the art and science of homemaking, emerged in the Progressive Era in an effort to feminize women's education in the United States. Alternatively called home arts, or home economics, the major curriculum reform in women's education was influenced by the publication of ''Treatise on Domestic Economy'', written by Catherine Beecher in 1843. Advocates of home economics argued that homemaking, as a profession, required education and training for the development of an efficient and systematic domestic practice. The curriculum aimed to cover a variety of topics, including teaching standardized way of gardening, child-rearing, cooking, cleaning, performing household maintenance, and doctoring. Such scientific management applied to the domestic sphere was presented as a solution to the dilemma middle class women faced in terms of searching for meaning and fulfillment in their role of housekeeping. The feminist perspective, by pushing for this type of education, intended to explain that women had separate but equally important responsibilities in life with men that required proper training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powers |first1=Jane B. |title=The Girl Question: Vocational Training for Young Women in the Progressive Era |date=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location=Washington D.C |pages=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children and education===
There was a concern towards working-class children being taken out of school to be put straight to work. Progressives around the country put up campaigns to push for an improvement in public education and to make education mandatory. It was further pushed in the South, where education was very much behind compared to the rest of the country. The Southern Education Board came together to publicize the importance of reform. However, many rejected the reform. Farmers and workers relied heavily on their eldest children, their first born, to work and help the family's income. Immigrants were not for reform either, fearing that such a thing would Americanize their children. 
Despite those fighting against reform, there was a positive outcome to the fight for reform. Enrollment for children (age 5 to 19) in school rose from 50.5 percent to 59.2 between 1900 and 1909. Enrollment in public secondary school went from 519,000 to 841,000. School funds and the term of public schools also grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGerr |first1=Michael |title=A Fierce Discontent: The Rise And Fall Of The Progressive Movement In America, 1870-1920 |date=2003 |publisher=New York:Free Press |location=New York |pages=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine and law==

The [[Flexner Report|''Flexner Report'']] of 1910, sponsored by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]], professionalized American medicine by discarding the scores of local small medical schools and focusing national funds, resources, and prestige on larger, professionalized medical schools associated with universities.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Flexner, ''Flexner Report on Medical Education in the United States and Canada 1910'' (new edition 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Friedman and Mark McGarvie, ''Charity, philanthropy, and civility in American history'' (2003) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent leaders included the [[William James Mayo|Mayo Brothers]] whose [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Minnesota]], became world-famous for innovative surgery.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Fye, "The Origins and Evolution of the Mayo Clinic from 1864 to 1939: A Minnesota Family Practice Becomes an International 'Medical Mecca'", ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' Volume 84, Number 3, Fall 2010 pp. 323–57 in [[Project MUSE]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the legal profession, the [[American Bar Association|American Bar Associatio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n set up in 1900 the [[Association of American Law Schools]] (AALS). It established national standards for law schools, which led to the replacement of the old system of young men studying law privately with established lawyers by the new system of accredited law schools associated with universities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Diner, ''A Very Different Age: Americans of the Progressive Era'' (1998) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social sciences==

Progressive scholars, based at the emerging research universities such as [[Harvard]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] and [[University of California|California]], worked to modernize their disciplines. The heyday of the amateur expert gave way to the research professor who published in the new scholarly journals and presses. Their explicit goal was to professionalize and make "scientific" the social sciences, especially [[history]],&lt;ref name="Richard Hofstadter 1968"&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[economics]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Joseph Dorfman, ''The economic mind in American civilization, 1918–1933'' vol 3, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="Barry Karl 1975"&gt;Barry Karl, ''Charles E. Merriam and the Study of Politics'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;  Professionalization meant creating new career tracks in the universities, with hiring and promotion dependent on meeting international models of scholarship.

==Economic policy==
[[File:Pump1913.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] uses tariff, currency, and anti-trust laws to prime the pump and get the economy working.]]
The Progressive Era was one of general prosperity after the [[Panic of 1893]]—a severe depression—ended in 1897. The [[Panic of 1907]] was short and mostly affected financiers. However, Campbell (2005) stresses the weak points of the economy in 1907–1914, linking them to public demands for more Progressive interventions. The Panic of 1907 was followed by a small decline in real wages and increased unemployment, with both trends continuing until World War I. Campbell emphasizes the resulting stress on public finance and the impact on the Wilson administration's policies. The weakened economy and persistent federal deficits led to changes in fiscal policy, including the imposition of federal income taxes on businesses and individuals and the creation of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard Campbell, "Economic Causes of Progressivism," ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' Jan 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp. 7–22&lt;/ref&gt;  Government agencies were also transformed in an effort to improve administrative efficiency.&lt;ref name="Harold U. Faulkner 1951"&gt;Harold U. Faulkner, ''The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897–1917'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gilded Age]] (late 19th century) the parties were reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private sector, except in the area of railroads and tariffs. In general, they accepted the concept of [[laissez-faire]], a doctrine opposing government interference in the economy except to maintain law and order. This attitude started to change during the [[Panic of 1893|depression of the 1890s]] when small business, farm, and labor movements began asking the government to intercede on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Harold U. Faulkner 1951"/&gt;

By the start of the 20th century, a middle class had developed that was leery of both the business elite and the radical political movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West. The Progressives argued the need for government regulation of business practices to ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the [[Interstate Commerce Act]]), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1901–1909), Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1913–1921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S. regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. [[Muckrakers]] were journalists who encouraged readers to demand more regulation of business. [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906) was influential and persuaded America about the supposed horrors of the Chicago [[Union Stock Yards]], a giant complex of meat processing plants that developed in the 1870s. The federal government responded to Sinclair's book and [[The Neill-Reynolds Report]] with the new regulatory [[Food and Drug Administration]]. [[Ida M. Tarbell]] wrote a series of articles against [[Standard Oil]], which was perceived to be a monopoly. This affected both the government and the public reformers. Attacks by Tarbell and others helped pave the way for public acceptance of the breakup of the company by the Supreme Court in 1911.&lt;ref name="Harold U. Faulkner 1951"/&gt;

When Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected President with a Democratic Congress in 1912 he implemented a series of Progressive policies in economics. In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] was ratified, and a small [[income tax]] was imposed on higher incomes. The Democrats lowered tariffs with the [[Revenue Act of 1913|Underwood Tariff]] in 1913, though its effects were overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by the World War that broke out in 1914. Wilson proved especially effective in mobilizing public opinion behind tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists, addressing Congress in person in highly dramatic fashion, and staging an elaborate ceremony when he signed the bill into law.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent W. Howard, "Woodrow Wilson, The Press, and Presidential Leadership: Another Look at the Passage of the Underwood Tariff, 1913," ''CR: The Centennial Review,'' 1980, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp. 167–14&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson helped end the long battles over the trusts with the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] of 1914. He managed to convince lawmakers on the issues of money and banking by the creation in 1913 of the [[Federal Reserve System]], a complex business-government partnership that to this day dominates the financial world.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, ''Woodrow Wilson and the progressive Era, 1910–1917'' (1954) pp. 25–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, [[Henry Ford]] dramatically increased the efficiency of his factories by large-scale use of the moving assembly line, with each worker doing one simple task in the production of automobiles. Emphasizing efficiency, Ford more than doubled wages (and cut hours from 9 a day to 8), attracting the best workers and sharply reducing labor turnover and absenteeism. His employees could and did buy his cars, and by cutting prices over and over he made the Model T cheap enough for millions of people to buy in the U.S. and in every major country. Ford's profits soared and his company dominated the world's automobile industry. Henry Ford became the world-famous prophet of high wages and high profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Faith Jaycox|title=The Progressive Era: Eyewitness History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yLQ2NsC9wIC&amp;pg=PA403|year=2005|publisher=Infobase |page=403|isbn=9780816051595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor unions===
Labor unions, especially the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), grew rapidly in the early 20th century, and had a Progressive agenda as well. After experimenting in the early 20th century with cooperation with business in the [[National Civic Federation]], the AFL turned after 1906 to a working political alliance with the Democratic party. The alliance was especially important in the larger industrial cities. The unions wanted restrictions on judges who intervened in labor disputes, usually on the side of the employer. They finally achieved that goal with the [[Norris–La Guardia Act]] of 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Greene, ''Pure and Simple Politics: The American Federation of Labor and Political Activism, 1881–1917'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the century, more and more small businesses were getting fed up with the way that they were treated compared to the bigger businesses. It seemed that the "Upper Ten" were turning a blind-eye to the smaller businesses, cutting corners where ever they could to make more profit. The big businesses would soon find out that the smaller businesses were starting to gain ground over them, so they became unsettled as described; "Constant pressure from the public, labor organizations, small business interests, and federal and state governments forced the corporate giants to engage in a balancing act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saros |first1=Daniel |title=Labor, Industry, and Regulation during the Progressive Era |date=2009 |publisher=Routledge |location=270 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10016 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now that all of these new regulations and standards were being enacted, the big business would now have to stoop to everyones level, including the small businesses. The big businesses would soon find out that in order to succeed they would have to band together with the smaller businesses to be successful, kind of a "Yin and Yang" effect.

===Immigration===
The influx of immigration grew steadily after 1896, with most new arrivals being unskilled workers from eastern and southern Europe. These immigrants were able to find work in the steel mills, slaughterhouses, and construction crews of the emergent mill towns and industrial cities of the late 19th century. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 halted most transcontinental immigration, only after 1919 did the flow of immigrants resume. Starting in the 1880s, the labor unions aggressively promoted restrictions on immigration, especially restrictions on Chinese, Japanese and Korean immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Parmet, ''Labor and immigration in industrial America'' (1987) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  In combination with the racist attitudes of the time, there was a fear that large numbers of unskilled, low-paid workers would defeat the union's efforts to raise wages through collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;Gwendolyn Mink, ''Old Labor and New Immigrants in American Political Development: Union, Party and State, 1875–1920'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, rural Protestants distrusted the urban Catholics and Jews who comprised most of the immigrants after 1890, and on those grounds opposed immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Tichenor, ''Dividing lines: the politics of immigration control in America'' (2002) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the rapid growth of the industry called for a greater and expanding labour pool that could not be met by natural birth rates. As a result, many large corporations were opposed to immigration restrictions. By the early 1920s a consensus had been reached that the total influx of immigration had to be restricted, and a series of laws in the 1920s accomplished that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Golden, "The Political Economy of Immigration Restriction in the United States, 1890 to 1921," in Goldin, ''The regulated economy'' (1994) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;  A handful of eugenics advocates were also involved in immigration restriction for their own pseudo-scientific reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Leonard, [http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf "Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era"] ''Journal of Economic Perspectives,'' (2005) 19(4): 207–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Immigration restriction continued to be a national policy until after World War II.

During World War I, the Progressives strongly promoted [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]] programs, designed to modernize the recent immigrants and turn them into model American citizens, while diminishing loyalties to the old country.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Barrett, "Americanization from the Bottom, Up: Immigration and the Remaking of the American Working Class, 1880–1930," ''Journal of American History'' 79 (December 1992): 996–1020. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2080796 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; These programs often operated through the public school system, which expanded dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Christina A. Ziegler-McPherson, ''Americanization in the States: Immigrant Social Welfare Policy, Citizenship, and National Identity in the United States, 1908–1929'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign policy in the progressive era was often marked by a hint of moral supremacy, with assessments of Woodrow Wilson and William Jennings Bryan believing themselves to be 'Missionaries of Democracy' being accurate, with them believing that they were “Inspired by the confidence that they knew better how to promote the peace and well-being of other countries than did the leaders of those countries themselves.” Similar ideas and language had already been used previously in the Monroe Doctrine, wherein Roosevelt claimed that the United States could serve as the police of the world, using its power to end unrest and wrongdoing on the western hemisphere. Using this moralistic approach, Roosevelt argued for intervention with Cuba to help it to become a “just and stable civilization”, by way of the Platt amendment. Wilson used a similar moralistic tone when dealing with Mexico. In 1913, while revolutionaries took control of the government, Wilson judged them to be immoral, and refused to acknowledge the in-place government on that reason alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63179060|title=America reformed : Progressives and progressivisms, 1890s-1920s|last=1948-|first=Flanagan, Maureen A.,|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195172191|location=New York|oclc=63179060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War==
Although the Progressive Era was characterized by public support for [[World War I]] under [[Woodrow Wilson]], there was also a substantial [[opposition to World War I]].

==Decline==
In the 1940s typically historians saw the Progressive Era as a prelude to the [[New Deal]] and dated it from 1901 (when Roosevelt became president) to the start of World War I in 1914 or 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Goldman, ''Rendezvous with Destiny: A History of Modern American Reform'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have moved back in time emphasizing the Progressive reformers at the municipal&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  and state&lt;ref&gt;David P. Thelen, ''The New Citizenship: Origins of Progressivism in Wisconsin, 1885–1900'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; levels in the 1890s.

===End of the Era===
Much less settled is the question of when the era ended. Some historians who emphasize civil liberties decry their suppression during World War I and do not consider the war as rooted in Progressive policy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Murphy, ''World War I and the Origin of Civil Liberties in the United States'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; A strong anti-war movement headed by noted Progressives including [[Jane Addams]], was suppressed after Wilson's 1916 re-election, a victory largely enabled by his campaign slogan, "He kept us out of the war." &lt;ref&gt;Jane Addams, ''Bread and Peace in Time of War'' (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan was no longer accurate by April 6 of the following year, when Wilson surprised much of the Progressive base that twice elected him and asked a joint session of Congress to declare war on Germany. The Senate voted 82–6 in favor; the House agreed, 373–50. Some historians see the so-called "war to end all wars" as a globalized expression of the American Progressive movement, with Wilson's support for a League of Nations as its climax.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The politics of the 1920s was unfriendly toward the labor unions and liberal crusaders against business, so many if not most historians who emphasize those themes write off the decade. Urban cosmopolitan scholars recoiled at the moralism of prohibition, the intolerance of the nativists and the KKK, and on those grounds denounced the era. [[Richard Hofstadter]], for example, in 1955 wrote that prohibition, "was a pseudo-reform, a pinched, parochial substitute for reform" that "was carried about America by the rural-evangelical virus".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''The Age of Reform'' (1955) p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as [[Arthur S. Link]] emphasized, the Progressives did not simply roll over and play dead.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, "What Happened to the Progressive Movement in the 1920s?," ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 64, No. 4 (Jul., 1959), pp. 833–51 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1905118 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Link's argument for continuity through the twenties stimulated a historiography that found Progressivism to be a potent force. Palmer, pointing to leaders like [[George W. Norris|George Norris]], says, "It is worth noting that progressivism, whilst temporarily losing the political initiative, remained popular in many western states and made its presence felt in Washington during both the Harding and Coolidge presidencies."&lt;ref&gt;Niall A. Palmer, ''The Twenties in America: Politics and History'' (2006) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Gerster and Cords argue that, "Since progressivism was a 'spirit' or an 'enthusiasm' rather than an easily definable force with common goals, it seems more accurate to argue that it produced a climate for reform which lasted well into the 1920s, if not beyond."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Gerster and Nicholas Cords, ''Myth in American History'' (1977) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Some social historians have posited that the KKK may in fact fit into the Progressive agenda, if Klansmen are portrayed as  "ordinary white Protestants" primarily interested in purification of the system, which had long been a core Progressive goal.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Coben, "Ordinary white Protestants: The KKK of the 1920s," ''Journal of Social History,'' (1994) 28#1 pp. 155–65&lt;/ref&gt; This however ignores the violence and racism central to Klan ideology and activities, that had nothing to do with improving society, so much as enforcing racial hierarchies.

While some Progressive leaders became reactionaries, that usually happened in the 1930s, not in the 1920s, as exemplified by [[William Randolph Hearst]],&lt;ref&gt;Rodney P. Carlisle, ''Hearst and the New Deal: The Progressive as Reactionary'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Hoover]], [[Al Smith]] and [[Henry Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. H.

=== First Red Scare ===
{{Main|First Red Scare}}
Following the period rapid social change saw a worker's uprising turn to a full scale [[Russian Revolution|revolution in Russia]] in 1917 taken over by Bolsheviks along [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|anarchist bombings]] of 1919 by foreigners encroached a large fear over many citizens of a possible Bolshevism revolt to overthrow values which the United States holds up to mainly capitalism. It saw persecutions of many ideals of the progressive era seeing raids, arrests, and persecutions taken place. Such as the period saw supporters such as worker unions, socialist, and others faced similar prosecutions. Along these convicted were foreigners, African Americans, Jews, Catholics, etc. The US government was also affected both legally and internally as of January 1920 saw 6,000 arrests of persecutions along changes in government policies where the government in acted censorship in the media and suppressing opinion on the matter going as far to use physical assaults or legal arrests having certain civil liberties stripped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10925102|title=America enters the world : a people's history of the Progressive Era and World War I|last=Page.|first=Smith,|date=1985|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0070585733|location=New York|oclc=10925102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business progressivism in 1920s===
What historians have identified as "business progressivism", with its emphasis on efficiency and typified by Henry Ford and [[Herbert Hoover]]&lt;ref&gt;Barry C. Edwards, "Putting Hoover on the Map: Was the 31st President a Progressive.'' ''Congress &amp; the Presidency'' 41#1 (2014) pp 49-83 [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.720.8853&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; reached an apogee in the 1920s. Wik, for example, argues that Ford's "views on technology and the mechanization of rural America were generally enlightened, progressive, and often far ahead of his times."&lt;ref&gt;Reynold M. Wik, "Henry Ford's Science and Technology for Rural America," ''Technology &amp; Culture,'' July 1962, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp. 247–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Tindall stresses the continuing importance of the Progressive movement in the South in the 1920s involving increased democracy, efficient government, corporate regulation, social justice, and governmental public service.&lt;ref&gt;George B. Tindall, "Business Progressivism: Southern Politics in the Twenties," ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' 62 (Winter 1963): 92–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Tindall, ''The Emergence of the New South, 1913–1945'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; William Link finds political Progressivism dominant in most of the South in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Link, ''The Paradox of Southern Progressivism, 1880–1930'' (1997) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise it was influential in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Sealander, ''Grand Plans: Business Progressivism and Social Change in Ohio's Miami Valley, 1890–1929'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of women and of youth emphasize the strength of the Progressive impulse in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen A. Flanagan, ''America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s–1920s'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Women consolidated their gains after the success of the suffrage movement, and moved into causes such as world peace,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Zeiger, "Finding a cure for war: Women's politics and the peace movement in the 1920s," ''Journal of Social History,'' Fall 1990, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp. 69–86 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3787631 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; good government, maternal care (the [[Sheppard–Towner Act]] of 1921),&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"&gt;J. Stanley Lemons, "The Sheppard-Towner Act: Progressivism in the 1920s," ''Journal of American History'' Vol. 55, No. 4 (Mar., 1969), pp. 776–86 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1900152 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; and local support for education and public health.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Morris-Crowther, "Municipal Housekeeping: The Political Activities of the Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs in the 1920s," ''Michigan Historical Review,'' March 2004, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp. 31–57&lt;/ref&gt; The work was not nearly as dramatic as the suffrage crusade, but women voted&lt;ref&gt;Kristi Andersen, ''After suffrage: women in partisan and electoral politics before the New Deal'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and operated quietly and effectively. Paul Fass, speaking of youth, says "Progressivism as an angle of vision, as an optimistic approach to social problems, was very much alive."&lt;ref&gt;Paula S. Fass, ''The damned and the beautiful: American youth in the 1920s'' (1977)  p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; International influences that sparked many reform ideas likewise continued into the 1920s, as American ideas of modernity began to influence Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1930 a block of progressive Republicans in the Senate who were urging Hoover to take more vigorous action to fight the depression.  There were about a dozen members of this group including [[William Borah]] of Idaho, [[George W. Norris]] of Nebraska, [[Robert M. La Follette Jr.]], of Wisconsin, [[Gerald Nye]] of North Dakota, [[Hiram Johnson]] of California and [[Bronson M. Cutting]] of New Mexico.  While these western Republicans could stir up issues, they could rarely forge a majority, since they were too individualistic and did not form a unified caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur M. Schlesinger|title=The Crisis of the Old Order: 1919-1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=134fup3VQPkC&amp;pg=PT242|year=1959|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoover himself had sharply moved to the right, and paid little attention to  their liberal ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, "Putting Hoover on the Map: Was the 31st President a Progressive'' p 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1932 this group was moving toward support for Roosevelt's New Deal. They remain staunch isolationists deeply opposed to any involvement in Europe. Outside the Senate, however, a strong majority of the surviving Progressives from the 1910s had become conservative opponents of New Deal economic planning.&lt;ref&gt;Otis L. Graham, ''An Encore for Reform: The Old Progressives and the New Deal'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reformation Europe, 1517-1559''''' is a 1963 book written by [[Geoffrey Elton]].

==Content==
The book is an analysis of the religious, economic, cultural and political history of Europe during the period of the [[Reformation]]. He examines the history of the period through the interrelationships between different forces in Europe at the time, such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], the Papacy, reformers such as [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Zwingli]], and explores the resultant [[Counter-Reformation]] and the beginnings of European colonisation of other parts of the world such as South America. Its central focus is upon the conflict between Luther and Charles V.

According to one scholar, the book was written in a way which helped Reformation studies to emerge from a partisan situation where Protestant history was largely written by Protestants and Catholic history written by Catholics, in this sense representing the 'secularisation' of the period's historical interpretation. Elton also wrote from a particular intellectual framework of his own, however, being antithetical towards radical movements such as the [[Anabaptists]] in a way that drew some criticism at the time of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pettegree|first1=Andrew|title=The Reformation World|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0415163579|pages=1–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdSVnJDClesC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Reformation+Europe+Elton&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qwTlU6WCK82y7AaRnYCgAw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Reformation%20Europe%20Elton&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the work is largely narrative and chronological in tone and structure, though there are important points of interpretation: one key conclusion that Elton comes to, for example, is a repudiation of the [[Max Weber|Weberian]] thesis of a link between the Protestant revolution and a nascent 'spirit of capitalism' associated with a rising middle-class. Elton asserts that there is not ample factual evidence to support such a framework and concludes that it is sad that so many historians have devoted their time and energy to what he perceives of as an illusory belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elton|first1=G.R.|title=Reformation Europe 1517-1559|publisher=Fontana|isbn=0006321240|pages=312–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romesh Chunder Dutt''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CIE}} ({{lang-bn|রমেশচন্দ্র দত্ত}}) (August 13, 1848 – November 30, 1909) was an Indian civil servant, [[economic history|economic historian]], writer, and translator of ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

==Early life and education==
[[Dutta (surname)|Dutt]] was born into a distinguished Bengali [[Maulika Kayastha|Kayastha]] family well known for its members' literary and academic achievements.  His parents were Thakamani and Isam Chunder Dutt, a [[Deputy Collector]] in Bengal, whom Romesh often accompanied on official duties. He was educated in various [[Bengali language|Bengali]] District schools, then at [[Hare School]], Calcutta. After his father's untimely death in a boat accident in eastern Bengal, his uncle, Shoshee Chunder Dutt, an accomplished writer, became his guardian in 1861.  He commenting on his uncle, wrote, "He used to sit at night with us and our favorite study used to be pieces from the works of the English poets."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RomeshChenderDutt  R. C. Dutt, ''Romesh Chunder Dutt'' (1968), Internet Archive, Million Books Project, p. 10.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a relative of [[Toru Dutt]], one of nineteenth century Bengal's most prominent poets.

He entered the [[University of Calcutta]], [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] in 1864. He passed the First Arts examination in 1866, ranking second in order of merit and won a scholarship.  While still a student in the B.A. class, without his family's permission, he and two other friends, [[Behari Lal Gupta]] and [[Surendranath Banerjee]], left for England in 1868.&lt;ref name="lifeandworkofromeshchandradutt,cie,"&gt;Jnanendranath Gupta, ''Life and Works of Romesh Chandra Dutt, CIE'', (London: J.M.Dent and Sons Ltd., 1911); while young Romesh came out unnoticed, Beharilal, possibly his closest friend ever, was chased all the way down to the Calcutta docks by his "poor" father, who could not, however, successfully persuade his son to return to the safety of his parental home. Later, in England, both the friends took the civil service examination successfully, becoming the 2nd and 3rd Indians to join the ICS. The third person in the group, Surendranath Banerjee, also cleared the test, but was incorrectly disqualified, as being over-age.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, only one other Indian, [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendra Nath Tagore]], had qualified for the [[Indian Civil Service]]. Dutt aimed to emulate Tagore's feat. For a long time, before and after 1853, the year the ICS examination was introduced in England, only British officers were appointed to covenanted posts.&lt;ref&gt;Nitish Sengupta, ''History of the Bengali-speaking People'', UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt. Ltd. (2002), p. 275.  {{ISBN|81-7476-355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University College London]], Dutt continued to study British writers. He qualified for the Indian Civil Service in the open examination in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poet/373.html  "Selected Poetry of Romesh Chunder Dutt (1848–1909)", University of Toronto (2002) On line.]&lt;/ref&gt; taking third place.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe&gt;[[S. K. Ratcliffe]], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/dutt/duttintr.htm A Note on the Late Romesh C. Dutt], in the [[Everyman's Library]] edition ''The [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] Condensed into English Verse'' (London: J.M. Dent and Sons and New York: E.P. Dutton, 1910), ix.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was called to the bar by the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple on 6 June 1871.&lt;ref name="middletemple"&gt;[http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wordpress/sharafi/files/2010/07/Middle-5.01.pdf South Asians at the Inns: Middle Temple]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Civil Service===
====Pre-Retirement====
He entered the [[Indian Civil Service]] as an assistant magistrate of [[Alipore|Alipur]] in 1871. A famine in [[Meherpur|Meherpur, District of Nadia]] in 1874 and another in Dakhin Shahbazpur ([[Bhola District]]) in 1876, followed by a disastrous cyclone, required emergency relief and economic recovery operations, which Dutt managed successfully. He served as administrator for [[Barisāl Division|Backerganj]], [[Mymensingh]], [[Burdwan]], [[Danapur|Donapur]], and [[Midnapore]]. He became Burdwan's District Officer in 1893, Commissioner (''offtg''.) of Burdwan Division in 1894, and Divisional Commissioner (''offtg''.) for [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] in 1895. Dutt was the first Indian to attain the rank of divisional commissioner.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe/&gt;

====Post-retirement====
Dutt retired from the ICS in 1897. In 1898 he returned to England as a lecturer in Indian History at University College, London where he completed his famous thesis on economic nationalism. He returned to India as dewan of [[Baroda State]], a post he had been offered before he left for Britain. He was extremely popular in Baroda where the Maharaja, [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] and his family members and all other staff members used to call him the Babu Dewan, as a mark of personal respect. In 1907, he also became a member of the [[History of panchayati raj in India|Royal Commission on Indian Decentralisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1907/aug/26/royal-commission-on-indian  ''Hansard'', HC Deb 26 August 1907 vol 182 c149]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poet/373.html  "Selected Poetry of Romesh Chunder Dutt (1848–1909), Notes on Life and Works," ''Representative Poetry Online'', University of Toronto (2002)  On line.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
He was president of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1899. He was also a member of the Bengal Legislative Council.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Academics===
====Literature====
He served as the first president of [[Bangiya Sahitya Parishad]] ({{lang-bn|বঙ্গীয় সাহিত্য পরিষদ}}) in 1894, while [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Nabinchandra Sen|Navinchandra Sen]] were the vice-presidents of the society.&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mozammel |first=Md Muktadir Arif |year=2012 |chapter=Vangiya Sahitya Parishad |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Vangiya_Sahitya_Parishad |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''The Literature of Bengal'' presented "a connected story of literary and intellectual progress in Bengal" over eight centuries, commencing with the early Sanskrit poetry of [[Jayadeva]].  It traced [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]]'s religious reforms of the sixteenth century, [[Raghunatha Siromani]]'s school of [[formal logic]], and [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]'s brilliance, coming down to the intellectual progress of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Literature of Bengal

This was presented by Thacker, Spink &amp; Co. in Calcutta and Archibald Constable in London in 1895, but it had formed earlier in Dutt's mind while he managed famine relief and economic recovery operations in Dakhin Shahbazpur. It had appeared originally under the disguise of an assumed name in 1877.  It was dedicated to his esteemed uncle, Rai Shashi Chandra Dutt Bahadur.

====History====
He was a major economic historian of India of the nineteenth century. His thesis on deindustrialization of India remains forceful argument in Indian historiography. To quote him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;India in the eighteenth century was a great manufacturing as well as great agricultural country, and the products of the Indian loom supplied the markets of Asia and of Europe. It is, unfortunately, true that the East Indian Company and the British Parliament ...   discouraged Indian manufactures in the early years of British rule in order to encourage the rising manufactures of England . . . millions of Indian artisans lost their earnings; the population of India lost one great source of their wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/052157/0425/excerpt/0521570425_excerpt.pdf  The Economic History of India Under Early British Rule, vol. 1, 2nd ed. (1906) pp. vi–vii, quoted by Prasannan Parthasarathi, "The Transition to a Colonial Economy: Weavers, Merchants and Kings in South India 1720–1800", Cambridge U. Press. On line, excerpt.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also directed attention to the deepening internal differentiation of Indian society appearing in the abrupt articulation of local economies with the world market, accelerated urban-rural polarisation, the division between intellectual and manual labour, and the toll of recurrent devastating [[famine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/32/2/201.pdf  Manu Goswami, "Autonomy and Comparability: Notes on the Anticolonial and the Postcolonial", ''Boundary 2'', Summer 2005; 32: 201 – 225 Duke University Journals.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7646">'''TURBINE''' is the codename of an automated system which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices).

The [[NSA]] has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. As quoted by ''[[The Intercept]]'', TURBINE is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."&lt;ref name="TC20140312"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014|author=Ryan Gallagher and Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called [[Five Eyes]] surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:
* breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks
* infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive
* covertly recording audio from a computer’s microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam
* launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites
* exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer

The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance "sensors" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland ([[Fort George G. Meade]]) and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan ([[Misawa Air Base]]) and Menwith Hill, England ([[RAF Menwith Hill]]). Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data "selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include [[email address]]es, [[IP address]]es, or the unique "[[HTTP cookie|cookies]]" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Hotmail]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Twitter]], unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique [[Public key fingerprint|encryption key fingerprints]] that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computer crashes or updates.&lt;ref name="TC20140312" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Ryan|title=Compare the NSA’s Facebook Malware Denial to its Own Secret Documents|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/15/nsa-facebook-malware-turbine-non-denial-denial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=NSA's automated hacking engine offers hands-free pwning of the world|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/|accessdate=March 23, 2014|publisher=Ars Technica|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Industrial-Scale Exploitation|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/industrial-scale-exploitation/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Technology Directorate Analysis of Converged Data|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-technology-directorate-analysis-converged-data/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There Is More Than One Way to Quantum|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Phishing Tactics and Man in the Middle Attacks|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quantum Insert Diagrams|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/quantum-insert-diagrams/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TURBINE and TURMOIL|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/turbine-turmoil/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NSA and GCHQ’s QUANTUMTHEORY Hacking Tactics|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Menwith Hill Station Leverages XKeyscore for Quantum Against Yahoo and Hotmail|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/menwith-hill-station-leverages-xkeyscore-quantum-yahoo-hotmail/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Eyes Hacking Large Routers|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selector Types|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/selector-types/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VPN and VOIP Exploitation With HAMMERCHANT and HAMMERSTEIN|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/vpn-voip-exploitation-hammerchant-hammerstein/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Tarikh-i-Chitral''''' is a [[book]] compiled and finalized in 1921 by [[Muhammad Ghufran|Mirza Muhammad Ghufran]] on the order of [[Shuja ul-Mulk|Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk]] (r. 1895-1936). It was written in [[Persian language|Persian]] between 1911 and 1919, with its publication following in the year 1921 in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[British Raj|India]].  After its publication Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk ordered the burning of all copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chitralnews.com/MirzaGhufran-11-Sep-2011.htm|title=Mirza Muhammad Ghufran: A Chitrali Courtier, Historiographer and Poet 1857—1926.|last=Ur Rahman|first=Hidayat|date=11 September 2011|website=Chitral News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=yUf96ofNKowC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=mirza+muhammad+ghufran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU6vi_6bzUAhWIPY8KHU-JDhAQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mirza%20muhammad%20ghufran&amp;f=false|title=Fragments of the Afghan Frontier|last=Marsden|first=Magnus|last2=Hopkins|first2=Benjamin D.|date=2011|publisher=Hurst|year=|isbn=9781849040723|location=|pages=259|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=pIsMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=mirza+muhammad+ghufran&amp;dq=mirza+muhammad+ghufran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU6vi_6bzUAhWIPY8KHU-JDhAQ6AEISTAI|title=Swat State (1915-1969) from Genesis to Merger: An Analysis of Political, Administrative, Socio-political, and Economic Development|last=Sultan-i-Rome|first=|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195471137|location=|pages=350|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=5_1tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Tarikh-e-Chitral&amp;dq=Tarikh-e-Chitral&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9p6HIhMXUAhWMgI8KHayqDVIQ6AEIPTAH|title=The last Eden|last=Lines|first=Maureen|date=2003|publisher=Alhamra|year=|isbn=9789695161265|location=|pages=327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book remained clandestinely in [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]] until the authors son Ghulam Murtaza recovered a copy and together with Wazir Ali Shah used it as a reference to compile the [[Nayi Tarikh-i-Chitral|''Nayi Tarikh-i-Chitral (1962)'']]. The ''[[Nayi Tarikh-i-Chitral]]'' is an [[Urdu]] [[translation]] of the original ''Tarikh-i-Chitral'' albeit with considerable additions based on the notes of [[Nasir ul-Mulk|Mehtar Nasir ul-Mulk]] (r. 1936-1943).

&lt;/ref&gt; The project was conceived by John Holmgren of [[Shafer, Minnesota|Shafer]], [[Minnesota]] in the [[United States]] after hearing the song "Have You Forgotten" by country singer [[Darryl Worley]].&lt;ref name=startribune&gt;{{cite web |first=Katherine |last=Kersten |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=One man and a big truck take on the duty of patriotism |url=http://www.startribune.com/stories/191/5554123.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813014805/http://www.startribune.com/stories/191/5554123.html |work=Think Again |publisher=[[Star Tribune]] |date=2005-08-11 |archivedate=2005-08-13 |accessdate=2006-12-18 |quote=One Minnesotan -- John Holmgren, a truck driver from Shafer […] turned his 18-wheeler into a rolling memorial to the Americans who died that day. […] One day in 2003, he and a buddy were listening to the radio when country singer Darryl Worley's song about 9/11, 'Have You Forgotten?' came on. An idea flashed into Holmgren's head: 'Wouldn't it be cool to do a 9/11 truck?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An over-the-road truck driver, Holmgren transformed his 18-wheeler into the tribute with the help of a mural artist.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The mural image, along with the names of the victims of the attack, were printed onto [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] sheets and applied to the truck at a cost of nearly $40,000 [[USD]].&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt; Holmgren sold t-shirts, toy models of the truck&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmgren attributes the popularity of his truck to an e-mail forward, which apparently started in 2004 with a food company employee who photographed the truck. The e-mail eventually made its way into the hands of celebrities such as [[Jimmy Buffett]] and [[Reba McEntire]], who then asked Holmgren to bring his truck to their concerts. The truck was also invited to "ground zero" for a special commemorative ceremony in 2004.&lt;ref name=customsemi&gt;{{cite book |title=Custom Semi |last=Garber |first=Bette S. |authorlink=Bette Garber |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-7603-2133-1 |page=98 |date=2005-11-10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1uQBOQ3gZsC&amp;pg=PT101 |oclc=61200816 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmgren displays the truck all over the U.S. and continues to use it to transport freight when possible.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; In an interview with the [[Star Tribune]], he said "Troopers pull me over just to get a picture with the truck. Once I even got out of a ticket. The guy said, 'I can't give this to you, knowing what you're doing.'"&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt; Holmgren has received emails from over 20 countries, and there are several websites devoted to his truck.&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt; He has also met with families of 9/11 victims.&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt;

There was a plan to donate the truck to New York City in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Garber|first=Bette S.|authorlink=Bette Garber|publication-date=|date= October 2004|title='The Rolling Memorial'|periodical=RoadStar|series=|publication-place=|place=|publisher=Newport Communications Group|volume=6|issue=10|pages=34, 38|url=http://www.roadstaronline.com/2004/10/034a0410.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808025329/http://www.roadstaronline.com/2004/10/034a0410.asp|archivedate=2007-08-08|issn=|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no evidence this has happened.

In [[astrobiology]], the '''Uniformity of Motive''' theory suggests that any civilization in the [[universe]] would go through similar technological steps in their development. This theory supports the idea that at some point in their history, advanced alien civilizations would use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] medium for communications, and thus would emit radio waves that could be detected by projects such as [[SETI]].

The fact that no artificial EM band communications have ever been detected supports the [[Fermi Principle]], which in conjunction with the Uniformity of Motive theory, and [[Occam's razor]] suggests that a civilization that uses this medium is a unique occurrence in Earth's region of the Milky Way Galaxy and perhaps the universe.

An '''unstructured interview''' or non-directive interview is an [[interview]] in which questions are not prearranged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Carl R.|title=Frontier Thinking in Guidance|date=1945|publisher=Science research associates|location=University of California|pages=105–112|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=aVUwVeHFKI3qoATB_IHQAQ&amp;id=3OdBAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=frontiers+of+guidance+Non-directive+counselling+as+an+effective+technique&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Non-directive+counselling+as+an+effective+technique|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These non-directive interviews are considered to be the opposite of a [[structured interview]] which offers a set amount of standardized questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=compiled and edited by Richard Thorpe, and Robin|title=The SAGE Dictionary of Qualitative Management Research.|date=2007|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=1849203415|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the unstructured interview varies widely, with some questions being prepared in advance in relation to a topic that the researcher or interviewer wishes to cover. They tend to be more informal and free flowing than a structured interview, much like an everyday conversation. Probing is seen to be the part of the research process that differentiates the in-depth, unstructured interview from an everyday conversation.&lt;ref name="Qualitative research in the study of leadership"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klenke|first1=Karin|title=Qualitative research in the study of leadership|date=2008|publisher=Emerald Group Pub.|location=Bingley, UK|isbn=0080464106|page=129|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nature of conversation allows for spontaneity and for questions to develop during the course of the interview, which are based on the interviewees' responses. The chief feature of the unstructured interview is the idea of probe questions that are designed to be as open as possible.&lt;ref name="Methods of Social Research"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Kenneth D.|title=Methods of Social Research|date=2008|publisher=Free Press|isbn=1439118892|page=194|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[qualitative research|qualitative]] [[research method]] and accordingly prioritizes [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and the depth of the interviewees' answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Matthew|last2=Sutton|first2=Carole D.|title=Social research : the basics|date=2009|publisher=Sage Publ|location=London|isbn=0761973672|page=87|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the potential drawbacks  is the loss of reliability, thereby making it more difficult to draw patterns among interviewees' responses in comparison to structured interviews.&lt;ref name="Indigenous research methodologies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chilisa|first1=Bagele|title=Indigenous research methodologies|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=9781412958820|pages=206–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unstructured interviews are used in a variety of fields and circumstances, ranging from research in [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], to college and job interviews.&lt;ref name="Indigenous research methodologies"/&gt; Fontana and Frey have identified three types of in depth, ethnographic, unstructured interviews - [[oral history]], creative interviews (an unconventional interview in that it does not follow the rules of traditional interviewing), and [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fontana|first1=Andrea|last2=Frey|first2=James H.|title=The Handbook of Qualitative Research|date=1994|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible characteristics of a less structured interview==
While the method of the unstructured interview varies widely, the chief feature of the unstructured interview is to reveal information from the respondent in a more neutral environment with less attached bias from the interviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowling|first1=Ann|title=Research Methods In Health: Investigating Health And Health Services|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0335262740|pages=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the unstructured interview an advantage over the structured interview in that it produces more reliable information and may enable the interview subject to bring forward experiences and knowledge that the interviewer had not previously considered. Each unstructured depends on the interviewer and interviewee together to create knowledge, and therefore the characteristics of the interview can vary from one conversation to another &lt;ref name="Indigenous research methodologies"/&gt;

===Light structure and preparation===
To achieve the level of depth and detail sought after using the method of the unstructured interview, the researcher or interviewer may choose main questions to focus on, probing questions and follow-up questions.&lt;ref name="Qualitative research in the study of leadership"/&gt; A central idea or topic is typically chosen before beginning an unstructured interview. Because the interview is occurring as a way of collecting data, it is also typical for the interviewer to gather knowledge of his or her respondent, whether that is about their career, studies, or work, as a place to start and continue the conversation. While the unstructured interview does not always have all these features, these main topics or questions serve to provide the conversation’s “skeleton” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Herbet J.|last2=Rubin|first2=Irene S.|title=Qualitative Interviewing: The Art of Hearing Data|date=2011|publisher=Sage publishing|isbn=9781452285863|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgekGK_xpYsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Qualitative+Interviewing:+The+Art+of+Hearing+Data&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DWkwVZnBDtbpoASSqIHQBQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Qualitative%20Interviewing%3A%20The%20Art%20of%20Hearing%20Data&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes too much preparation is made when attempting to conduct an unstructured interview, and while not a negative method, such planning may lead to a semi-structured interview rather than an unstructured interview.

===Open ended questions===
Open ended questions have no prepared response choices which enables and empower the interviewee to shift the direction of the interview and to bring in unanticipated information. Whereas closed ended questions require only that the interviewer read the question and marks the appropriate answer, “open ended questions can require the interview to transcribe a lengthy statement”.&lt;ref name="Methods of Social Research"/&gt; It can require a skillful interviewer to bring a talkative respondent back on topic. However, these open ended questions give the ability for the respondent to reply about a topic which neither the interviewee nor the interviewer may have thought about before. Some evidence shows that using open ended questions in interviews “result in greater reporting of sensitive or socially disapproved behavior than when closed-ended questions on a self-reporting questionnaire are used”.&lt;ref name="Research methods in social work"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Royse|first1=David|title=Research methods in social work|date=2008|publisher=Brooks/Cole-Thomson Learning|location=Australia|isbn=0495115665|page=183|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although open-ended questions can be used in both quantitative and qualitative studies, they are much more prominent and favored in qualitative work as they produce information from the respondents with greater detail and depth &lt;ref name="Research methods in social work"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Research methods for social work"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babbie|first1=Allen Rubin, Earl R.|title=Research methods for social work|date=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495811718|page=134|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutral probes/ non-biased encouragement===
Although the method of the unstructured interview allows for social interaction and different modes of communication between the interviewer and interviewee, some maintain that it is important that interviewers resist the urge to agree, disagree, or give biased probes and encouragement to interviewees so that they do not potentially introduce biased topics.&lt;ref name="Qualitative research in the study of leadership"/&gt; Interviewers must remember to minimize any form of bias within the conversation. This way, the interviewee is able to freely discuss the topic given or their work from their own point of view, typically something the researcher hopes for in their search for information. Others maintain that the interviewer may introduce encouraging nods, expressions and non-directive, neutral probes. From the participant, “They are generally very short, such as ‘Why?’ or ‘Uh, huh’ or ‘That’s interesting.’ The non-directive interview originated in psychotherapy, intending to neutrally probe the respondent’s deepest and most subjective feelings".&lt;ref name="Methods of Social Research"/&gt; These acknowledgments such as “yeah,” “right,” “great,” “okay,” and “mhm” show response or influence from the interviewee’s answers can have on interviewer, not through contributions to the development of the topic but through minimal feedback.&lt;ref name="Applied Linguistics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Rod|authorlink1=Between Speaking and Listening: The Vocalization of Understanding|title=Applied Linguistics|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=University of Sydney|pages=204–205|url=https://www.academia.edu/6474636/Between_Speaking_and_Listening_The_Vocalisation_of_Understandings_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these acknowledgements are not used then the conversation can be seen as problematic.&lt;ref name="Applied Linguistics"/&gt; However, at its extremes, these neutral probes may activate repressed feelings that the respondent may or may not know he or she had or was not willing to admit to him or herself originally before the conversation.&lt;ref name="Methods of Social Research"/&gt; Typically these probes uncover important issues and topics that can eventually guide future inquiries.

===Silence===
Silence, being the apparent opposite of speech, is sometimes used in the method of the unstructured or non-directive interview. It is often suggested that silences may often be seen as awkward and are an enduring feature of human interaction.&lt;ref name="Reading Between the Lines: Interpreting Silences in Qualitative Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poland|first1=Blake|last2=Pederson|first2=Ann|title=Reading Between the Lines: Interpreting Silences in Qualitative Research|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|date=1998|volume=4|issue=2|pages=293–312|url=http://qix.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/107780049800400209|doi=10.1177/107780049800400209}}&lt;/ref&gt; During more organized and highly structured interviews, questions are given and answered one after another, typically transcribed with little or no silences evident in between the responses. Oftentimes, it is up to the interviewer to present their interviewing skills by making sure the conversation does not hold any silences. However, with the fact that the unstructured interview is more like an everyday conversation, silence or the use of silence can be observed as a very important aspect of a natural conversation and in fact current research suggests that being attentive to silences will tell us a lot about how knowledge is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bierema|first1=Laura L.|last2=Merriam|first2=Sharan B.|title=Adult learning linking theory and practice|date=2013|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=1118416317|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YGuAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically silence is overlooked in qualitative research, keeping in mind that there are multiple meanings involved in the conversation involving the interplay between speech and silence, it can be seen as one of the best types of probes used in interviews.&lt;ref name="Qualitative research in the study of leadership"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reading Between the Lines: Interpreting Silences in Qualitative Research"/&gt; Silences are profoundly meaningful as they can signify a withholding or resistance, can reflect a cultural mode of self-representation, or may represent a topic or idea as unthinkable.&lt;ref name="Reading Between the Lines: Interpreting Silences in Qualitative Research"/&gt; Many see the possible utility of silence as a strategic device to enhance data collection, while others argue that silence can be seen to represent failure on the part of the interviewer to ‘draw out’ information from the respondent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kvale|first1=Steinar|title=Interviews : an introduction to qualitative research interviewing.|date=1996|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=080395820X|pages=133–135|edition=5. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spradley|first1=James P.|title=The ethnographic interview|date=1997|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|location=Fort Worth [u.a.]|isbn=0030444969|edition=[Nachdr.]|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=zYckVZ7KHMu1ogTbo4CIDw&amp;id=XP5_AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=spradley+1979+the+ethnographic+interview&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=silence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===More complex issues can be probed===
An unstructured interview allows for the interviewer to build better rapport with the interviewee due to its parallels with a normal conversation. Unstructured interviews can be particularly useful when asking about personal experiences. In an unstructured interview the interviewer is able to discover important information which did not seem relevant before the interview and the interviewer can ask the participant to go further into the new topic. For this reason they are often considered to be a better methodology for researching sensitive subjects, such as [[domestic violence]], whereas structured interviews are often considered intimidating due to their formality and can often make the interviewee subject to [[social desirability bias]], a tendency for participants to answer questions inaccurately to suit response that can be viewed favorably by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=Juliet|last2=Morse|first2=Janice M.|title=The Unstructured Interactive Interview: Issues of Reciprocity and Risks when Dealing with Sensitive Topics|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|date=2003|volume=9|pages=335–354|doi=10.1177/1077800403009003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryman|first1=Alan|title=Social research methods|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199588058|page=227|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Readability and validity of the unstructured interview===
It is argued that the unstructured interview can sometimes be more valid than the highly structured interview.&lt;ref name="Interviewing: Strategy, Techniques, and Tactics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorden|first1=Raymond L.|title=Interviewing: Strategy, Techniques, and Tactics|date=1969|publisher=Dorsey Press|pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gorden, more valid responses may be created by letting the respondent follow what he calls “the natural paths of free association”.&lt;ref name="Interviewing: Strategy, Techniques, and Tactics"/&gt; “The universe of discourse” varies from respondent to respondent so that the interviewer must change the question wording to meet the understanding of each individual participant.&lt;ref name="Methods of Social Research"/&gt; Another situation where the unstructured interview is said to be more valid than the structured interview is where the respondent is experiencing memory failure. The unstructured interview enables the interviewer to return to the same topic numerous times, allowing the interviewee is able to produce information with stimulated memory.&lt;ref name="Methods of Social Research"/&gt; With the interview being more like an everyday conversation, a safe and relaxed environment can be created within the space of the interview; unlike the highly structured interview where the respondent may feel stressed in its more hurried and formal environment and may not respond accurately if they feel the need to move on to the next question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Stephen|title=People resourcing|date=2005|publisher=Chartered Inst. of Personnel and Development|location=London|isbn=1843980770|page=129|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6f-Yk35qMqcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=People+Resourcing.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1LMwVZT9OMb1oATNrIHoCQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=People%20Resourcing.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance in power relationships===
The in-depth non-directive interviewing method implies an egalitarian relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee.&lt;ref name="Qualitative research in the study of leadership"/&gt; Rather than focusing on the interview as a method of data retrieval, it is the interviewee’s unique account which is being sought and highly valued. Instead of entering into the conversation formally with structure where the interviewer holds power over the conversation and determines how it evolves, “the interviewer attempts to retrieve interviewee’s world by understanding their perspective in a language that is natural to them”.&lt;ref name="Qualitative research in the study of leadership"/&gt; Ethnographic interviewing methods are a large example of how unstructured interviews can balance power relationships between the interviewer and interviewee. Ethnographic interviewing originated in studies of cultural anthropology, emphasizing on the quality of the relationship with respondents.&lt;ref name="The Sage dictionary of social research methods"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Jupp|editor1-first=Victor|title=The Sage dictionary of social research methods|date=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=1847877141|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnographic interviews are normally conducted in the form of the unstructured interview with participants from a particular culture in which the interviewer or researcher wishes to obtain knowledge from. The key feature to this approach is that the "researcher is there to learn from the respondent rather than impose an external frame of reference, epitomized in Spradely's (1979: 34) representation of the researcher's posture as being that 'I want to know what you know in the way that you know it...Will you become my teacher and help me understand?'".&lt;ref name="The Sage dictionary of social research methods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spradley|first1=James P.|title=The ethnographic interview|date=1997|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|location=Fort Worth [u.a.]|isbn=978-0030444968|page=34|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Life history (sociology)|Life history]] interviews can be seen as a form of the ethnographic interview using the unstructured interview approach as they often share emphases documenting the respondent's life, or an aspect of it that has developed over the life course.&lt;ref name="The Sage dictionary of social research methods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jupp|first1=Victor|title=The SAGE dictionary of social and cultural research methods|date=2004|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=9780761962984|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

===Time Consuming===
Unstructured interviews are a lot more time consuming in comparison to other research methods. This is due because there are typically no prearranged questions asked during an unstructured interview and if there are questions prepared, they are open ended questions which prioritize elaborated answers. These “open ended questions can require the interview to transcribe a lengthy statement”, making it difficult and it is problematic and elimination total in posivite attraction if the interviews are not broadcast unllimited in full in the whole world without them in general sporting events and re-proposing the complete interviews still in the world there is not yet a TV in the world that has done this to determine and enforce a set time for the unstructured interview to be conducted within.&lt;ref name="Methods of Social Research"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indigenous research methodologies"/&gt; As a result, the unstructured interview is sometimes expensive and only feasible with small samples. With the fact that it is difficult to interview a large sample, this affects the data's [[Generalisation|generalizability]] and representativeness. However, current research shows there is a need to take up the unstructured interview regardless of how this research method takes to address unbalanced minority powers in research methods.&lt;ref name="Indigenous research methodologies"/&gt;

===Opportunity for bias===
It is important to understand that bias or the use of bias during an interview from the researcher is an important aspect that greatly affects validity of the interview's gathered knowledge. Since the interview is more like an everyday conversation, some claim that there are opportunities for the interviewer’s bias to be brought into discussion and to intervene than with the structured interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathers|first1=Nigel|last2=Fox|first2=Nick|last3=Hunn|first3=Amanda|title=Using Interviews in a Research Project|journal=Trent Focus for Research and Development in Primary Health Care|date=1998|page=8|url=http://faculty.cbu.ca/amolloy/MBA603/MBA603_files/UsingInterviews.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others maintain that “Although there is invariable potential for the interviewer bias in qualitative interviews, it is offset, at least to some extent, by the greater participation and involvement of the interviewer in the interaction aimed at reaching greater depth”.&lt;ref name="Qualitative research in the study of leadership"/&gt; While the unstructured interview can be seen to be unreliable due to the interviewer, bias can be easily be built into a highly structured interview.&lt;ref name="Interviewing: Strategy, Techniques, and Tactics"/&gt; However, it is important to find where one stands with their bias, acknowledging their biases rather than trying to do away with it. The notion of bias is evident in that anything quantitative already holds bias and biases are already built into everyday form. "Although typical of the selection process, the research on interviews suggests that unstructured procedures are vulnerable to a variety of biases that can lower the quality of decisions," such as gathering information on an applicant's traits during a job interview and selecting applicants determined by their qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dipboye|first1=Robert L.|editor1-last=Ferris|editor1-first=Gerald R.|title=Research in personnel and human resources management.|date=1994|publisher=JAI Press|location=Greenwich, Conn.|isbn=1-55938-733-5|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Dipboye/publication/234095559_STRUCTURED_AND_UNSTRUCTURED_SELECTION_INTERVIEWS_BEYOND_THE_JOB-FIT_MODEL/links/0fcfd50f07cc277c11000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any interview can also be subject to [[stereotype]]s and [[discrimination]]. Newell and Rice suggest that many of the problems involved with predictive validity during interviews are due to interpersonal perception, the interpretation of the interviewee's personality or social identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newell|first1=S.|last2=Rice|first2=C.|editor1-last=Millmore|editor1-first=M.|title=Assessment, selection and evaluation: problems and pitfalls|journal=The Irish Journal of Management|date=1999|volume=Just How Extensive is the Practice of Strategic Recruitment and Selection?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race, gender, class, religion, [and forms of disabilities] are all aspects of society that feed into the development of our social identity, however these can also be factors which bias people's interpretations in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawley|first1=Daniel King, Scott|title=Organizational behaviour|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=019960309X|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived difficulties in comparing data===
The outcome of unstructured interviews results in diverse types of information collected from interviewees who are asking different questions. While the data from an unstructured interview has more quality than that obtained from a structured interview, in the sense that the participant has more of an opportunity to say what they like freely, the data collected in unstructured interviews is also prone to digression and much of the data collected could be worthless. Some suggest that this limits the comparability of responses and the outcome is thereby a less systematic and comprehensive set of data which  may make organization and analysis of the data difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patton|first1=Michael Quinn|title=Qualitative research &amp; evaluation methods|date=2004|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0761919711|page=349|edition=3. ed., [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data gathered though unstructured interviews are difficulty to analyze because the kind of data obtained during the interview are unpredictable and open in nature, thereby making it hard to make comparisons across data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allison|first1=Desmond|title=Approaching English language research|date=2002|publisher=Singapore Univ. Press, National Univ. of Singapore|location=Singapore|isbn=9971692589|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zacharias|first1=Nugrahenny T.|title=Qualitative research methods for second language education: a coursebook|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=144383551X|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of use in feminist research methods==
Feminist researchers often use unstructured interviews as opposed to more structured interview in terms of research techniques because it attempts to eliminate power imbalances in the relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=Juliet|last2=Morse|first2=Janice M.|title=The Unstructured Interactive Interview: Issues of Reciprocity and Risks When Dealing With Sensitive Topics|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|date=2003|volume=9|issue=3|page=340|url=http://members.shaw.ca/dlecky/masters/ed561/narrative/unstructured_interviews_on_sensitive_topics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist researchers are influenced by the works of writer and researcher, Ann Oakley, who pioneered an interview methodology based on an anti-oppression framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Ian|title=Theory and Practice in Sociology|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317904847|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8aOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;dq=ann+oakley+unstructured+interview&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=abowVe62LcipogSf4IG4Dw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ann%20oakley%20unstructured%20interview&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley argues that the form of structured interviews positions the interviewee as a subordinate, which supports the masculine "paradigm of inquiry" and produces a "perfect interview" that is "morally indefensible".&lt;ref name="Interviewing women: a contradiction in terms"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oakley|first1=Ann|authorlink1=Interviewing women: a contradiction in terms|editor1-last=Roberts|editor1-first=Helen|title=Doing feminist research|date=1981|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakley argues that interviews need to be conducted as equal relationships so that the research can lead to a retrieval of more fruitful and significant data.&lt;ref name="Interviewing women: a contradiction in terms"/&gt;

To break down imbalances of power within the relationships of the interviewer and the interviewee, the unstructured interview approach to research maximizes the ability to explore a full account of life experience. It can be seen that the principle belief of feminist research "must begin with an open-ended exploration of women's experiences, since only from that vantage point is it possible to see how their world is organized and the extent to which it differs from that of men".&lt;ref name="Researching women's lives from a feminist perspective"/&gt; It is also important to note that this approach to research is used to explore life experience from those belonging to all other minority groups.&lt;ref name="Indigenous research methodologies"/&gt;

==Notable examples==

===Ann Oakley===
Distinguished British [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[Feminism|feminist]], and writer, [[Ann Oakley]] has written numerous academic works focusing on the lives and roles of women in society. Oakley is a well-known pioneer in the unstructured interview research approach directed towards qualitative research that challenges existing power imbalances within the relationships of the interviewer and the interviewee. Oakley sees both issues as interlinked or, as she puts it "no intimacy without reciprocity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oakley|first1=Ann|title=Subject women : [where women stand today - politically, economically, socially, emotionally]|date=1981|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0394521706|page=41|edition=1. American}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Oakley interviewed women twice before the birth of their children and then twice afterwards.&lt;ref name="The sociology of housework"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oakley|first1=Ann|title=The sociology of housework|date=1985|publisher=B. Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=0631139249|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each woman was interviewed for around nine hours on average. The women also asked her questions during the interviews and Oakley responded as openly and honestly as she wished for them to respond.&lt;ref name="The sociology of housework"/&gt; Oakley wanted the respondents to be collaborators in her research rather than just interviewees causing the women to become increasingly interested in the research and contacting her with any information they thought important after the interviews. Oakley as well used the unstructured interview approach to study women's experiences of both house work and maternity care. Oakley interviewed 40 women about how much housework they did and how they and their partners organised domestic work.&lt;ref name="Theory and Practice in Sociology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Ian|title=Theory and Practice in Sociology|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317904842|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8aOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;dq=ann+oakley+unstructured+interview&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vXAxVYGDLI_uoAS5-4C4Ag&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both unstructured interview studies "were aimed at raising awareness of women's experiences and of promoting policy changes - for example, Oakley called for domestic work to be recognized as 'work' and to be given an appropriate status in relation to paid employment".&lt;ref name="Theory and Practice in Sociology"/&gt; These are prime examples of the advantages of rapport and the depth of information even beyond the interview using the unstructured interview research approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10744">'''White Croatia''' (also '''Great Croatia''' or '''Chrobatia''') was the ill-defined homeland of the [[White Croats]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] Europe. After the migration of the White Croats in the 7th century, it gradually lost its primacy under the influence of other Slavic peoples such as [[Czechs]] and [[Poles]].{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=52}} It is considered that White Croatia ceased to exist as separate ethnopolitic state in the 10th century.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=52}} According to the ''[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]'', there existed another White Croatia along [[Red Croatia]] in [[Dalmatia]].{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=169–185}}

==Etymology==
The epithets "white" for Croats and their homeland Croatia, as well "great" (''megali'') for Croatia, is in relation to the symbolism used in ancient times. The epithet "white" is related to the use of colors for [[Cardinal direction#Cardinal directions in world cultures|cardinal directions]] among Eurasian people. It meant "Western Croats/Croatia", in comparison to lands where they lived before. The epithet "great" signified "subsequently populated" land, but also "old, ancient, former"{{sfn|Živković|2012|p=84–88}} homeland for the newly arrived Croats to the Roman province of Dalmatia.{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=122–125}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hyun Jin Kim |year=2013 |title=The Huns, Rome and the Birth of Europe |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=fX8YAAAAQBAJ |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=146, 262 |isbn=9781107009066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' recounts, in 30th chapter "The Story of the Province of Dalmatia", that "''the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bagibareia (usually considered [[Bavaria]]), where the Belocroats are now... The rest of the Croats stayed over near [[Francia]], and are now called the Belocroats, that is, the [[White Croats]], and have their own archon; they are subject to [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], the great king of Francia, which is also [[Saxony]], and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the [[Hungarians|Turks]]''", while in 31st chapter "Of the Croats and of the Country They Now Dwell in", that "''are descended from the unbaptized Croats, also called the ‘white’, who live beyond [[Hungary|Turkey]] and next to [[Francia]], and they border the Slavs, the unbaptized Serbs... ancient Croatia, also called "white", is still unbaptized to this day, as are also its neighboring [[White Serbia|Serbs]]... constantly plundered by the [[Franks]] and Turks and [[Pechenegs]]... live far away from sea; it takes 30 days of travel from the place where they live to the sea. The sea to which they come down to after 30 days, is that which is called dark (usually considered [[Baltic Sea]])''", while in 32nd chapter "Of the Serbs and of the Country They Now Dwell in", that "''...their neighbor is Francia, as is also Megali Croatia, the unbaptized, also called ‘white’''".{{sfn|Živković|2012|p=49, 54, 83, 88, 111–122, 152}} Other sources (see [[White Croats#Middle Ages]]) suggest that Croats in the 10th century lived between Moravians and Czechs on Upper [[Elbe]], as well in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in the vicinity of [[Kievan Rus]].{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=52–53}}

===Dispute===
In modern scholarship, the widespread opinion is that there's no simple answer on the location of White Croatia.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=58}} Initially was considered it was situated on the river Elbe in [[Bohemia]], and around [[Vistula]] and [[Lesser Poland]].{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=125}} However, while some Polish and Czech scholars often neglected the existence of Croats in respective territories, the Ukrainian and Russian scholars consider the Croats had large and influential territories.{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=92}}

[[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] and [[Lubor Niederle]] placed ''megali'' Croatia in Eastern Galicia to the Vistula in the East.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=54}} N. P. Barsov situated the Croats in the wide area of [[Carpathian Mountains]], on the slopes of [[Tatra Mountains]] to the river [[Tisza]] and [[Prut]] on the South, to [[Dniester]] to the East, and Vistula to the North.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=54}}{{sfn|Korčinskij|2006|p=33}} O. A Kupchynsʹkyĭ considered that ethnic boundaries of Eastern Croats with West Slavs went from [[Prykarpattia]] (interfluve of rivers [[Laborec]] and [[Ondava]] until the tops of the Carpathians), valley of [[Beskids]], Western coast of the river [[Wisłoka]], along [[Sandomierz]] valley until middle [[San (river)|San]], near [[Dunajec]] and left coast of Vistula, while in regard to Ukraine-Slovakia border most probably upper part of Tisza river.{{sfn|Korčinskij|2006|p=38}} Russian archaeologist and Slavist Valentin Vasilyevich Sedov considered them as Southeastern neighbours of [[Dulebes]] living in the Northern and Southern area of Northern Prykarpattia, and along B. O. Tymoshchuk argued that Slavic [[Gord (archaeology)|Gords]] in [[Bukovina]] were abandoned by Croats.{{sfn|Korčinskij|2006|p=33}} Many other scholars also located the Croats in the territory of Galicia,{{sfn|Korčinskij|2006|p=31–33}}{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=54}} and such localization is supported by ''DAI'' according to which they were plundered by the Pechenegs which would not be possible if the Croats were located further in the West like the Czech Republic.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=69}} Ukrainian archaeologist and historian Orest Korčinski attribute to White Croatia several big Gords, including Revno, Stiljsko, [[Zhydachiv]], Kotorin complex, Klyuchi, Stuponica, [[Krylos]], Pidhorodyshche, [[Terebovlia]], Ganachivka, Solonsko among others.{{sfn|Korčinskij|2006|p=38–39}}

In comparison, some scholars placed it on more narrow territory, from North-Eastern [[Bohemia]] to Upper Vistula.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=55}} This consideration is based on ''DAI'' description that they lived South-East of Bavaria, north of Hungary, and south of the White Serbs.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=50–51, 55}} Others placed it in more broader territory, according to [[Francis Dvornik]], White Croatia extended from Southern [[Bug River|Bug]] and rivers [[Wieprz]] and [[San (river)|San]] in Poland-Ukraine border, to slopes of Carpathian Mountains, including Northern part of Slovakia, then from river Netolica and Dudleba in upper [[Vltava]], over [[Cidlina]] until [[Krkonoše]] Mountains to the North and North-West.{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=125}} Similarly, Aleksandar V. Majorov acknowledged both the Dvornik's Croatia in the Czech Republic and Lesser Poland, and another Croatia in the Carpathians (Western Ukraine).{{sfn|Budak|2018|p=92}} Some scholars considered that White Croatia embraced [[Lusatian Neisse|Nisa]] and Upper Elbe in the West, to [[Bug River|Bug]] and Upper Prut and [[Siret River|Siret]] in the East.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=55}} In other words, lands of present-day Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=55}} [[Nada Klaić]] considered Croats arrived from [[Carantania]], rather than Lesser Poland.{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=128}}{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=57, 63}}

It is considered that in the 10th century there were only remnants of the Croats, scattered in the West in Bohemia, and another in the East in Poland, Ukraine and Slovakia.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=58}} This theory would abide by the tradition of using colours for cardinal directions.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=58–59}} According to the thesis, L. V. Vojtovič argued that alleged Great Croatia from the 6th century did not exist anymore in the 10th century, and in the Western part of its territory was formed White Croatia.{{sfn|Majorov|2012|p=59}}

'''Yangon''' ({{lang-my|ရန်ကုန်မြို့}}, MLCTS ''rankun mrui'', {{IPA-my|jàɴɡòʊɴ mjo̰|pron}}; formerly known as '''Rangoon''', lit. "End of Strife") is the capital of the [[Yangon Region]] of [[Myanmar]] (also known as Burma). Yangon served as the [[capital of Myanmar]] until 2006, when the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]] relocated the capital to the purpose-built city of [[Naypyidaw]] ({{IPA-my|nèpjìdɔ̀|pron}}) in central Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4848408.stm | title =Burma's new capital stages parade |publisher=BBC News | date =27 March 2006 | accessdate =3 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 7 million people, Yangon is Myanmar's largest city and its most important commercial centre.

The mausoleum of the [[Bahadur Shah II|last Mughal Emperor]] is located in Yangon, where he had been exiled following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]] of 1857.

Yangon suffers from deeply inadequate [[infrastructure]], especially compared to other major cities in [[Southeast Asia]]. Though many historic residential and commercial buildings have been renovated throughout central Yangon, most satellite towns that ring the city continue to be profoundly impoverished and lack basic infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapid migration and lack of cheap housing fuels Yangon slum growth|url=http://www.myanmar-now.org/news/i/?id=15af2551-98ae-4b69-bc63-9091702da2fa|website=Myanmar Now|accessdate=8 April 2017|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Yangon" ({{lang-my-Mymr|ရန်ကုန်}}) is derived from the combination of the [[Burmese language|Burmese]] words ''yan'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ရန်}}) and ''koun'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ကုန်}}), which mean "enemies" and "run out of", respectively. This word combination is commonly translated as "End of Strife". 

The city's colonial era name, "Rangoon", likely is derived from the [[Anglicization]] of the [[Arakanese language|Arakanese]] pronunciation of "Yangon",{{fact|date=July 2017}} which is {{IPA|[rɔ̀ɴɡʊ́ɴ]}}.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Yangon|List of name changes in Yangon}}

===Early history===
Yangon was founded as ''[[Dagon Township|Dagon]]'' in the early 11th century ({{circa|1028–1043}}) by the [[Mon people|Mon]], who dominated Lower Burma at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Founded during the reign of King Pontarika, per {{cite book | title=Legendary History of Burma and Arakan | year=1882 | author=Charles James Forbes Smith-Forbes | publisher=The Government Press | page=20}}; the king's reign was 1028 to 1043 per {{cite book | last = Harvey| first = G. E.| title = History of Burma: From the Earliest Times to 10 March 1824 | publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co. Ltd | year = 1925| location = London | page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagon was a small fishing village centred about the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. In 1755, [[Alaungpaya|King Alaungpaya]] conquered Dagon, renamed it "Yangon", and added settlements around Dagon. The [[British Empire|British]] captured Yangon during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–26), but returned it to Burmese administration after the war. The city was destroyed by a fire in 1841.&lt;ref name=mcy&gt;{{Cite book| title=Megacity yangon: transformation processes and modern developments | author=Kyaw Kyaw | isbn=978-3-8258-0042-0 |editor1=Frauke Krass |editor2=Hartmut Gaese |editor3=Mi Mi Kyi | pages=333–334 | publisher=Lit Verlag | location=Berlin | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial Rangoon===

[[File:RangoonStreetView.jpg|thumb|left|Damage of central Rangoon in the aftermath of World War II.]]
The British seized Yangon and all of [[Lower Burma]] in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon into the commercial and political hub of British Burma. In 1853, the British moved the capital of Burma from [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]] (present-day [[Mawlamyine]]) to Yangon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3578993.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Asia-Pacific {{!}} Burma maintains bygone buildings|publisher=BBC|access-date=27 July 2017|date=2004-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/moulmein-first-british-capital-of-myanmar-back-on-the-tourist-map/article5000457.ece|title=Moulmein, first British capital of Myanmar, back on the tourist map|work=The Hindu|access-date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yangon is also the place where the British sent [[Bahadur Shah II]], the last [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor, to live after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Based on the design by army engineer Lt. Alexander Fraser, the British constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land, bounded to the east by the [[Pazundaung Creek]] and to the south and west by the [[Yangon River]]. Yangon became the capital of all [[British Burma|British-ruled Burma]] after the British had captured [[Upper Burma]] in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1885. By the 1890s Yangon's increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential suburbs to the north of [[Kandawgyi Lake|Royal Lake]] (Kandawgyi) and [[Inya Lake]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/Yangon |title=Yangon Summary Review and Analysis |publisher=Bookrags.com |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British also established hospitals including [[Yangon General Hospital|Rangoon General Hospital]] and colleges including [[Yangon University|Rangoon University]].

Colonial Yangon, with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture, was known as "the garden city of the East."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt; By the early 20th century, Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Falconer| first=John| year=2001| title=Burmese Design &amp; Architecture| isbn=978-962-593-882-0| publisher=Periplus| location=Hong Kong|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War II]], about 55% of Yangon's population of 500,000 was [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] or [[South Asian]], and only about a third was [[Bamar]] (Burman).&lt;ref name=tmmt&gt;{{Cite book| title=Indian Communities in south-east Asia – Some Aspects of Indians in Rangoon| last=Tin Maung Maung Than| publisher=Institute of south-east Asian Studies| year=1993| pages=585–587| isbn= 9789812304186}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karens]], the [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]], the [[Anglo-Burmese]] and others made up the rest.

After [[World War I]], Yangon became the epicentre of Burmese independence movement, with leftist Rangoon University students leading the way. Three nationwide strikes against the [[British Empire]] in 1920, 1936 and 1938 all began in Yangon. Yangon was under [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation (1942–45), and incurred heavy damage during World War II. The city was retaken by the Allies in May 1945.

Yangon became the capital of the Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 when the country regained independence from the British Empire.

===Contemporary Yangon===
Soon after Burma's independence in 1948, many colonial names of streets and parks were changed to more nationalistic Burmese names. In 1989, the current [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]] changed the city's English name to "Yangon", along with many other changes in English transliteration of Burmese names. (The changes have not been accepted by many Burmese who consider the junta unfit to make such changes, nor by many publications and news bureaus, including, most notably, the [[BBC]] and foreign nations including the United Kingdom and United States.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Who, What, Why? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7013943.stm |title=Should it be Burma or Myanmar? |publisher=BBC News |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | title=Background Note: Burma | publisher=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, US Department of State | accessdate=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since independence, Yangon has expanded outwards. Successive governments have built satellite towns such as [[Thaketa Township|Thaketa]], [[North Okkalapa Township|North Okkalapa]] and [[South Okkalapa Township|South Okkalapa]] in the 1950s to [[Hlaingthaya Township|Hlaingthaya]], [[Shwepyitha Township|Shwepyitha]] and [[South Dagon Township|South Dagon]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=mcy/&gt; Today, Greater Yangon encompasses an area covering nearly {{convert|600|km2}}.&lt;ref name=uncrd/&gt;

During [[Ne Win]]'s isolationist rule (1962–88), Yangon's infrastructure deteriorated through poor maintenance and did not keep up with its increasing population. In the 1990s, the current military government's more open market policies attracted domestic and foreign investment, bringing a modicum of modernity to the city's infrastructure. Some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns. Many colonial-period buildings were demolished to make way for high-rise hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls,&lt;ref name="beyondrangoon"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Beyond Rangoon| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5745&amp;page=3| date=1 May 2006| author=Edward Blair| publisher=The Irrawaddy}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading the city government to place about 200 notable colonial-period buildings under the [[Yangon City Heritage List]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Special Report| url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no87/New/14.htm| date=4 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five new highways linking the city to its industrial back country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-333/b006.htm| title=Pioneering FMI City 'the best in Yangon'| author=Zaw Htet| work=The Myanmar Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cemm/eng/zt/zmjjqd/jmgxgk/t198979.htm| title=Yangon-Thanlyin Bridge| accessdate=7 September 2008}}{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ngamoeyeik"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/2-2001/nga.htm | title=Ngamoeyeik Bridge| author=Kyi Kyi Hla| date=1 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, much of Yangon remains without basic municipal services such as 24-hour electricity and regular garbage collection.

Yangon has become much more indigenous Burmese in its ethnic make-up since independence. After independence, many South Asians and Anglo-Burmese left. Many more South Asians were forced to leave during the 1960s by Ne Win's xenophobic government.&lt;ref name=tmmt/&gt; Nevertheless, sizeable South Asian and Chinese communities still exist in Yangon. The Anglo-Burmese have effectively disappeared, having left the country or intermarried with other Burmese groups.

Yangon was the centre of major anti-government protests in 1974, 1988 and 2007. The 1988 [[People Power uprising]] resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of Burmese civilians, many in Yangoon where hundreds of thousands of people flooded into the streets of the then capital city. The [[Saffron Revolution]] saw mass shootings and the use of crematoria in Yangoon by the Burmese government to erase evidence of their crimes against monks, unarmed protesters, journalists and students.&lt;ref&gt;Burmese Human Rights Yearbook, 2007, http://www.burmalibrary.org/show.php?cat=1320&amp;lo=d&amp;sl=0&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's streets saw bloodshed each time as protesters were gunned down by the government.

In May 2008, [[Cyclone Nargis]] hit Yangon. While the city had few human casualties, three-quarters of Yangon's industrial infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, with losses estimated at US$800&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/b004.htm | title=Long road back for industrial recovery | date=14 July 2008 | author=Ye Lwin | work=The Myanmar Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the military government designated [[Naypyidaw]], {{convert|320|km|mi|0}} north of Yangon, as the new administrative capital, and subsequently moved much of the government to the newly developed city. At any rate, Yangon remains the largest city, and the most important commercial centre of Myanmar.

==Geography==

It is primarily due to the heavy rainfall received during the rainy season that Yangon falls under the tropical monsoon climate category. During the course of the year 1961 to 1990s, average temperatures show little variance, with average highs ranging from {{convert|29|to|36|C|F}} and average lows ranging from {{convert|18|to|25|C|F}}.

[[File:Yangon map.svg|thumb|Map of Yangon]]

Until the mid-1990s, Yangon remained largely constrained to its traditional peninsula setting between the [[Bago River|Bago]], Yangon and [[Hlaing River]]s. People moved in, but little of the city moved out. Maps from 1944 show little development north of [[Inya Lake]] and areas that are now layered in cement and stacked with houses were then virtual backwaters. Since the late 1980s, however, the city began a rapid spread north to where [[Yangon International Airport]] now stands. But the result is a stretching tail on the city, with the downtown area well removed from its geographic centre.&lt;ref name="future-yangon"&gt;{{Cite journal| title=The Future of Yangon| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-325/b008.htm| date=16 July 2006| author=May Thanda Win| journal=The Myanmar Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's area has steadily increased from {{convert|72.52|km2|sqmi}} in 1901 to {{convert|86.2|km2|sqmi}} in 1940 to {{convert|208.51|km2|sqmi}} in 1974, to {{convert|346.13|km2|sqmi}} in 1985, and to {{convert|598.75|km2|sqmi}} in 2008.&lt;ref name=uncrd&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.uncrd.or.jp/env/3rd-regional-est-forum/doc/23_Myanmar.pdf| title=Third Regional EST Forum: Presentation of Myanmar| publisher=Ministry of Transport, Myanmar| location=Singapore| date=17–19 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcy-znm&gt;{{Cite book| title=Megacity yangon: transformation processes and modern developments | author=Zin Nwe Myint | isbn=978-3-8258-0042-0 |editor1=Frauke Krass |editor2=Hartmut Gaese |editor3=Mi Mi Kyi | page=264 | publisher=Lit Verlag | location=Berlin | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Yangon City Development Committee]] created a [[Yangon City Heritage List]] of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/colonial-past-could-be-the-saving-of-rangoon-2219991.html|title=Colonial past could be the saving of Rangoon|last=Kennedy|first=Phoebe|date=20 February 2011|work=The Independent |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the city of Yangon imposed a 50-year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than 50 years.&lt;ref name="rob"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/366b4332-69b5-11e1-8996-00144feabdc0.html|title=Myanmar pushes to save colonial buildings|last=Robinson|first=Gwen|date=9 March 2012|work=Financial Times|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yangon Heritage Trust]], an NGO started by [[Thant Myint-U]], aims to create heritage areas in Downtown, and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use.&lt;ref name="rob"/&gt;

A latter day hallmark of Yangon is the eight-story [[apartment building]]. (In Yangon parlance, a building with no [[elevator]]s (lifts) is called an apartment building and one with elevators is called a [[condominium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=City living: condos vs apartments| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/Construction/con13.htm| date=1 September 2007| journal=The Myanmar Times| access-date=12 September 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720094137/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/Construction/con13.htm| archive-date=20 July 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condos which have to invest in a local power generator to ensure 24-hour electricity for the elevators are beyond the reach of most Yangonites.) Found throughout the city in various forms, eight-story apartment buildings provide relatively inexpensive housing for many Yangonites. The apartments are usually eight stories high (including the ground floor) mainly because city regulations, until February 2008, required that all buildings higher than {{convert|75|ft|m}} or eight stories to install lifts.&lt;ref name=lift&gt;{{Cite news| title=Lift regulation changed| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no409/n013.htm| date=10 March 2008| author=Yi Yi Htwe| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=1 January 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216085020/http://mmtimes.com/no409/n013.htm| archive-date=16 December 2010| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current code calls for elevators in buildings higher than {{convert|62|ft|m}} or six stories, likely ushering in the era of the six-story apartment building. Although most apartment buildings were built only within the last 20 years, they look much older and rundown due to shoddy construction and lack of proper maintenance.

[[File:Downtownflatsyangon.jpg|thumb|An apartment building in the city centre]]
Unlike other major Asian cities, Yangon does not have any skyscrapers. Aside from a few high-rise hotels and office towers, most high-rise buildings (usually 10 stories and up) are "condos" scattered across prosperous neighbourhoods north of downtown such as [[Bahan Township|Bahan]], [[Dagon Township|Dagon]], [[Kamayut Township|Kamayut]] and [[Mayangone Township|Mayangon]]. The tallest building in Yangon, Pyay Gardens, is a 25-story condo in the city's north.

Older satellite towns such as [[Thaketa Township|Thaketa]], [[North Okkalapa Township|North Okkalapa]] and [[South Okkalapa Township|South Okkalapa]] are lined mostly with one to two-story detached houses with access to the city's electricity grid. Newer satellite towns such as [[North Dagon Township|North Dagon]] and [[South Dagon Township|South Dagon]] are still essentially slums in a grid layout. The satellite towns—old or new—receive little or no municipal services.

===Road layout===
[[File:Yangon at night.jpg|thumb|[[Downtown Yangon]] at night]]
[[File:Corner of Sule Pagoda &amp; City Hall.JPG|thumb|Corner of Sule Pagoda and City Hall]]
[[Downtown Yangon]]'s road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:
* Broad 49-m wide roads running west to east
* Broad 30-m wide roads running south to north
* Two narrow 9.1-m wide streets running south to north
* Mid-size 15-m wide streets running south to north

The east-west grid of central was laid out by British military engineers Fraser and Montgomerie after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]].&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt; The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers. The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.

For example, the {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} Lanmadaw Road is followed by {{convert|30|ft|m|sing=on}}-wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}} Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.

The roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (née Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.

[[File:Kandawgyi Lake, Yangon.jpg|thumb|[[Kandawgyi Lake]], a popular park near downtown Yangon]]

===Parks and gardens===
The largest and best maintained parks in Yangon are located around [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. To the south-east of the gilded stupa is the most popular recreational area in the city – [[Kandawgyi Lake]]. The 150-acre (61-ha) lake is surrounded by the 110-acre (45-ha) [[Kandawgyi Nature Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-yangon/kandawgyi-garden.htm| title=Kandawgyi Garden| accessdate=21 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 69.25-acre (28-ha) [[Yangon Zoological Gardens]], which consists of a zoo, an aquarium and an amusement park.&lt;ref name="yz"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.yangonzoo.com/profile.html| title=History of Zoological Gardens (Yangon)| accessdate=27 September 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802013535/http://www.yangonzoo.com/profile.html| archivedate=2 August 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; West of the pagoda towards the former Hluttaw (Parliament) complex is the 130-acre (53-ha) [[People's Square and Park]], (the former parading ground on important national days when Yangon was the capital.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://myanmargeneva.org/basicfacts/cap.htm| title=Nation's Capital Yangon| accessdate=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few miles north of the pagoda lies the 37-acre (15-ha) [[Inya Lake|Inya Lake Park]] – a favourite hangout place of [[Yangon University]] students, and a well-known place of romance in Burmese popular culture.

[[Hlawga National Park]] and [[Taukkyan War Cemetery|Allied War Memorial]] at the outskirts of the city are popular day-trip destinations with the well-to-do and tourists.

==Administration==
[[File:Yangoncityhall.PNG|thumb|Yangon City Hall]]
Yangon is administered by the [[Yangon City Development Committee]] (YCDC). YCDC also coordinates [[urban planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chijihon.metro.tokyo.jp/asianet/participating_cities/yangon.htm| title=Yangon| accessdate=13 August 2006| publisher=Asian Network of Major Cities 21| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620010837/http://www.chijihon.metro.tokyo.jp/asianet/participating_cities/yangon.htm| archivedate = 20 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is divided into four districts. The districts combined have a total of 33 townships. The [[List of mayors of Yangon|current mayor of Yangon]] is [[Maung Maung Soe]]. Each township is administered by a committee of township leaders, who make decisions regarding city beautification and infrastructure. ''Myo-thit'' (lit. "New Towns", or [[satellite town]]s) are not within such jurisdictions.

Yangon is a member of [[Asian Network of Major Cities 21]].

==Transport==
Yangon is Burma's main domestic and international hub for air, rail, and ground transportation.

===Air===

[[File:Ygnbusyairport.jpg|thumb |Inside T2, [[Yangon International Airport]]]]
[[Yangon International Airport]], located 12&amp;nbsp;miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) from the centre, is the country's main gateway for domestic and international air travel. The airport has three terminals, known as T1, T2 and T3 which is also known as Domestic. It has direct flights to regional cities in Asia, mainly: [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], [[Dhaka]], [[Kolkata]], [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Tokyo]], [[Beijing]], [[Phnom Penh]], [[Seoul]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Taipei]], [[Bangkok]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Kunming]] and [[Singapore]]. Although domestic airlines offer service to about twenty domestic locations, most flights are to tourist destinations such as [[Bagan]], [[Mandalay]], [[Heho]] and [[Ngapali]], and to the capital [[Naypyidaw]].

===Railways===
[[File:Myanmar-Yangon-Main train station.jpg|thumb|[[Yangon Central Railway Station]]]]
[[Yangon Central Railway Station]] is the main terminus of [[Myanmar Railways]]' {{convert|5403|km|mi|0|sing=on}} rail network&lt;ref name=nlm-rail&gt;{{Cite news| title=MR to link Mandalay and Bhamo | date=22 February 2010 | publisher=New Light of Myanmar}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose reach covers Upper Myanmar ([[Naypyidaw]], [[Mandalay]], [[Shwebo]]), upcountry ([[Myitkyina]]), Shan hills ([[Taunggyi]], [[Lashio]]) and the Taninthayi coast ([[Mawlamyine]], [[Dawei]]).

[[Yangon Circular Railway]] operates a {{convert|45.9|km|mi|sing=on}} 39-station commuter rail network that connects Yangon's satellite towns. The system is heavily used by the local populace, selling about 150,000 tickets daily.&lt;ref name="railway bazzar"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/multimedia.php?art_id=10074| title=The Railway Bazaar| date=30 January 2008| author=Yeni| publisher=The Irrawaddy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the commuter line has jumped since the government reduced petrol subsidies in August 2007.&lt;ref name="railway bazzar"/&gt;

===Buses and cars===
Yangon has a {{convert|4456|km|mi|sing=on}} road network of all types (tar, concrete and dirt) in March 2011. Many of the roads are in poor condition and not wide enough to accommodate an increasing number of cars.&lt;ref name=w11-30yr-plan/&gt; The vast majority of Yangon residents cannot afford a car and rely on an extensive network of buses to get around. Over 300 public and private bus lines operate about 6,300 crowded buses around the city, carrying over 4.4&amp;nbsp;million passengers a day.&lt;ref name=uncrd/&gt;&lt;ref name="bus"&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes18-341/n008.htm| title=First private bus line in Yangon launched| author=Yan Naing Hein| journal=The Myanmar Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; All buses and 80% of the taxis in Yangon run on [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), following the 2005 government decree to save money on imported petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=14444| title=Rangoon Commuters Afraid of Gas Explosions| date=14 October 2008| author=Wai Moe| publisher=The Irrawaddy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highway buses to other cities depart from Dagon Ayeyar Highway Bus Terminal for Irrawaddy delta region and Aung Mingala Highway Bus Terminal for other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="mm-net"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-yangon/yangon.htm#Getting_Around| title=Getting Around Yangon| accessdate=14 October 2008| publisher=Myanmar's Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2017, city bus network system [[Yangon Bus Service]] (YBS) was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/business/24560-new-day-dawns-for-yangon-bus-system.html|title=New day dawns for Yangon bus system|last=Aye Nyein Win|date=16 January 2017|work=[[Myanmar Times]]|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motor transportation in Yangon is highly expensive for most of its citizens. As the government allows only a few thousand cars to be imported each year in a country with over 50 million people,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/world/asia/29aid.html?scp=18&amp;sq=myanmar&amp;st=nyt| title=Burmese Economy Is an Obstacle to Aid| date=29 May 2008|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; car prices in Yangon (and in Burma) are among the highest in the world.{{fact|date=July 2017}} In July 2008, the two most popular cars in Yangon, 1986/87 Nissan Sunny Super Saloon and 1988 Toyota Corolla SE Limited, cost the equivalent of about US$20,000 and US$29,000 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/care2008/care05.htm| title=Clash of the titans on streets of Yangon| date=2 June 2008| author=Thomas Kean| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=2 June 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104080833/http://mmtimes.com/feature/care2008/care05.htm| archive-date=4 January 2010| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sports utility vehicle, imported for the equivalent of around US$50,000, goes for US$250,000.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Illegally imported unregistered cars are cheaper – typically about half the price of registered cars. Nonetheless, car usage in Yangon is on the rise, a sign of rising incomes for some, and already causes much traffic congestion in highway-less Yangon's streets. In 2011, Yangon had about 300,000 registered motor vehicles in addition to an unknown number of unregistered ones.&lt;ref name=w11-30yr-plan/&gt;

Since 1970, cars have been driven on the right side of the road in Burma, as part of a military decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Burma Makes Road Switch | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/07/archives/burma-makes-road-switch.html | work=The New York Times | date=7 December 1970 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the government has not required [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left hand drive]] (LHD) cars to accompany the right side road rules, many cars on the road are still right hand drive (RHD) made for driving on the left side. Japanese used cars, which make up most of the country's imports, still arrive with RHD and are never converted to LHD. As a result, Burmese drivers have to rely on their passengers when passing other cars.
[[File:Yangon taxi 02.jpg|thumb|A taxi in Yangon]]
Within Yangon city limits, it is illegal to drive [[trishaw]]s, bicycles, and motorcycles. Since February 2010, [[pick-up truck]] bus lines have been forbidden to run in 6 townships of central Yangon, namely [[Latha Township|Latha]], [[Lanmadaw Township|Lanmadaw]], [[Pabedan Township|Pabedan]], [[Kyauktada Township|Kyauktada]], [[Botahtaung Township|Botahtaung]] and [[Pazundaung Township]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html|title=Authorities ban light truck buses in downtown areas|author=Nay Nwe Moe Aung|work=Myanmar Times|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143017/http://mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html|archive-date=16 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of Downtown Yangon to reduce [[noise pollution]].&lt;ref name="symo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no396/n008.htm|title=Vehicle horn penalties increased|author=Shwe Yinn Mar Oo|date=10 December 2007|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.&lt;ref name="symo"/&gt;

===River===
Yangon's four main passenger jetties, all located on or near downtown waterfront, mainly serve local ferries across the river to [[Dala Township|Dala]] and [[Thanlyin]], and regional ferries to the [[Irrawaddy delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/myanmar-burma/yangon-rangoon/transport/getting-there-away | title=Yangon – Getting there and around | accessdate=26 July 2009 | publisher=Lonely Planet | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120115352/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/myanmar-burma/yangon-rangoon/transport/getting-there-away | archive-date=20 January 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 22-mile (35&amp;nbsp;km) [[Twante Canal]] was the quickest route from Yangon to the Irrawaddy delta until the 1990s when roads between Yangon and the Irrawaddy Division became usable year-round. While passenger ferries to the delta are still used, those to Upper Burma via the Irrawaddy river are now limited mostly to tourist river cruises. In 2017 October, a New Yangon Water Bus was launched.

Yangon is the most populous city by far in Burma although estimates of the size of its population vary widely. All population figures are estimates since no official census has been conducted in Burma since 1983. A UN estimate&lt;ref name=un/&gt; puts the population as 4.35&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 but a 2009 US State Department estimate&lt;ref name=usdos&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | title=Background note: Burma | accessdate=6 March 2010 | publisher=US Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; puts it at 5.5&amp;nbsp;million. The US State Department's estimate is probably closer to the real number since the UN number is a straight-line projection, and does not appear to take the expansion of city limits in the past two decades into account. The city's population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s. Immigrants have founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government's decision to move the nation's administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from Yangon.

Yangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While [[Burmese Indians|Indians]] formed the slight majority prior to World War II,&lt;ref name=tmmt/&gt; today, the majority of the population is of indigenous [[Bamar]] (Burman) descent. Large communities of Indians/South Asian Burmese and the [[Chinese people in Burma|Chinese Burmese]] exist especially in the traditional downtown neighbourhoods. A large number of [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] and [[Karen people|Karen]] also live in the city.

[[Burmese language|Burmese]] is the principal language of the city. English is by far the preferred second language of the educated class. In recent years, however, the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages: [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] is most popular, followed by Japanese, and French.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Cite news| title=Language training centres open doors to new worlds| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm| date=14 May 2007| author1=Kyaw Soe Linn| author2=Phyo Wai Kyaw| lastauthoramp=yes| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=1 January 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720094651/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm| archive-date=20 July 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religions===
The primary religions practised in Yangon are [[Buddhism]], Christianity, [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]]. Shwedagon Pagoda is a famous religious landmark in the city.

===Media===
[[File:Central Yangon.jpg|thumb|left|Central Yangon]]
Yangon is the country's hub for the movie, music, advertising, newspaper and book publishing industries. All media is heavily regulated by the military government. Television broadcasting is off limits to the private sector. All media content must first be approved by the government's media censor board, [[Press Scrutiny and Registration Division]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648| title=Burma: The Censored Land| date=1 March 2008| author=Yeni| publisher=The Irrawaddy| access-date=20 March 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311223612/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648| archive-date=11 March 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon. [[TV Myanmar]] and [[Myawaddy TV]] are the two main channels, providing Burmese-language news and entertainment programmes. Other special interest channels are MWD-1 and MWD-2, [[MRTV-3]], the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via Internet, [[MRTV-4]] and [[Channel 7 (Yangon)|Channel 7]] are with a focus on non-formal education programs and movies, and Movie 5, a pay-TV channel specialising in broadcasting foreign movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Digital television take-up slower than expected| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no429/b004.htm| date=3 August 2008| author=Kyaw Hsu Mon| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=8 August 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430045926/http://www.mmtimes.com/no429/b004.htm| archive-date=30 April 2011| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yangon has three radio stations. [[Myanmar Radio National Service]] is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese (and in English during specific times.) Pop culture oriented [[Yangon City FM]] and [[Mandalay City FM]] radio stations specialise in Burmese and English pop music, entertainment programs, live celebrity interviews, etc. New radio channels such as Shwe FM and Pyinsawaddy FM can also be tuned with the city area.

Nearly all print media and industries are based out of Yangon. All three national newspapers – two Burmese language dailies ''[[The New Light of Myanmar|Myanma Alin]]'' ({{my|မြန်မာ့အလင်း}}) and ''[[Kyemon]]'' ({{my|ကြေးမုံ}}), and the English language ''[[The New Light of Myanmar]]'' – are published by the government. Semi-governmental ''[[The Myanmar Times]]'' weekly, published in Burmese and in English, is mainly geared for Yangon's expatriate community. Over twenty special interest journals and magazines covering sports, fashion, finance, crime, literature (but never politics) vie for the readership of the general populace.

Access to foreign media is extremely difficult. Satellite television in Yangon, and in Burma, is very expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of one million kyats.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Straits Times]]'' can be found only in a few (mostly downtown) bookstores. Internet access in Yangon, which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country, is slow and erratic at best, and the Burmese government implements one of the world's most restrictive regimes of Internet control.&lt;ref name="oni"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://opennet.net/studies/burma| title=Internet Filtering in Burma in 2005: A Country Study| date=1 October 2005| accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; International text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in August 2008.&lt;ref name="sms"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962| title=International Text Messaging Approved in Burma| author=Min Lwin| date=21 August 2008| publisher=The Irrawaddy| access-date=30 August 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811233000/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962| archive-date=11 August 2010| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
Common facilities taken for granted elsewhere are luxury prized items in Yangon and Burma. The price of a [[GSM]] mobile phone was about K1.1&amp;nbsp;million in August 2008.&lt;ref name="sms"/&gt; In 2007, the country of 55 million had only 775,000 phone lines (including 275,000 mobile phones),&lt;ref name="ict"&gt;{{Cite news| title=ICT Statistics Collection and Analysis| url=http://www.unescap.org/icstd/events/Info-Society-Stats-Workshop-2007/Myanmar.pdf| publisher=The Government of the Union of Myanmar Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development| author=Central Statistical Organization| date=6 November 2007| format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/03/content_7913706.htm| title=Mobile phones in Myanmar increase to over 200,000 in 2007| date=3 April 2008| accessdate=1 September 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703022656/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/03/content_7913706.htm| archive-date=3 July 2009| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 400,000 computers.&lt;ref name="ict"/&gt; Even in Yangon, which has the best infrastructure, the estimated telephone penetration rate was only 6% at the end of 2004, and the official waiting time for a telephone line was 3.6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Myanmar (Burma) – Telecoms, Mobile &amp; Internet | url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9fc71c/myanmar_burma | publisher=Research and Markets | date=19 July 2010 | location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people cannot afford a computer and have to use the city's numerous Internet cafes to access a heavily restricted Internet, and a heavily censored local intranet.&lt;ref name="oni"/&gt; According to official statistics, in July 2010, the country had over 400,000 Internet users, with the vast majority hailing from just two cities, Yangon and Mandalay.

Yangon's property market is the most expensive in the country and beyond the reach of most Yangonites. Most rent outside the centre and few can afford to rent such apartments. (In 2008, rents for a typical {{convert|650|to|750|sqft|m2|adj=on}} apartments in the centre and vicinity range between K70,000 and K150,000 and those for high end condos between K200,000 and K500,000.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/b006.htm| title=Rentals brisk in lead up to Waso| date=14 July 2008| author=Aye Sabae Phyu| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=6 July 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430045857/http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/b006.htm| archive-date=30 April 2011| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most men of all ages (and some women) spend their time at ubiquitous tea-shops, found in any corner or street of the city. Watching European football (mostly English [[Premier League]] with occasional [[La Liga]], [[Serie A]], [[Bundesliga]]) matches while sipping tea is a popular pastime among many Yangonites. The average person stays close to his or her residential neighbourhood. The well-to-do tend to visit shopping malls and parks on weekends. Some leave the city on weekends for [[Chaungtha, Pathein|Chaungtha]] and [[Ngwesaung]] beach resorts in [[Ayeyarwady Division]].

[[File:Hindu temple procession cart, Yangon.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] temple procession cart]]
Yangon is also home to many [[pagoda festival]]s (''paya pwe''), held during dry-season months (November – March). The most famous of all, the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival in March, attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country.

[[List of museums in Yangon|Yangon's museums]] are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals.

Most of Yangon's larger hotels offer some kind of nightlife entertainment, geared towards tourists and the well-to-do Burmese. Some hotels offer traditional Burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional Burmese orchestra. The pub scene in larger hotels is more or less the same as elsewhere in Asia. Other options include karaoke bars and pub restaurants in Yangon [[Chinatown]].

Due to the problems of high inflation, the lack of high denomination notes, and the fact that many of the population do not have access to checks, or credit or debit cards, it is common to see citizens carrying a considerable amount of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Myanmar new 10,000-kyat note confirmed|author1=Claudio Marana  |author2=Nin Cheun  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=17 June 2012 | journal= Bank Note News | url=http://www.banknotenews.com/files/0cb53d71db0460b4c129de9c869f72a8-2132.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The highest denomination of Burmese currency [[Myanma kyat|kyat]] is 10 000 (~US$10.)) Credit cards are only rarely used in the city, chiefly in the more lavish hotels. Credit cards are also accepted in the major supermarket and convenience store chains.

===Sports===
As the city has the best sporting facilities in the country, most national-level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field, football, volleyball, tennis and swimming are held in Yangon. The 40,000-seat [[Aung San Stadium]] and the 32,000-seat [[Thuwunna Stadium]] are the main venues for the highly popular annual State and Division football tournament. Until April 2009, the now defunct [[Myanmar Premier League]], consisted of 16 Yangon-based clubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Myanmar edges towards pro football| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes14-277/sport.htm| date=1 August 2005| work=The Myanmar Times| author=Zaw Htet| access-date=27 November 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514035649/http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes14-277/sport.htm#| archive-date=14 May 2011| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; played all its matches in Yangon stadiums, and attracted little interest from the general public or commercial success despite the enormous popularity of football in Burma. Most Yangonites prefer watching European football on satellite TV. Teams such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City are among the favourite European teams among the Yangonites. It remains to be seen whether the [[Myanmar National League]], the country's first professional football league, and its Yangon-based club [[Yangon United FC]] will attract a sufficient following in the country's most important media market.

Yangon is also home to annual the Myanmar Open golf tournament, and the Myanmar Open tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1961 and 1969 [[South East Asian Games]]. During colonial times, [[cricket]] was played mostly by British officials in the city. [[First-class cricket]] was played in the city in January 1927 when the touring [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] played [[Burma national cricket team|Burma]] and the [[Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team|Rangoon Gymkhana]]. Two grounds were used to host these matches, the [[BAA Ground]] and the [[Gymkhana Ground, Rangoon|Gymkhana Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/250.html |title=BAA Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 8 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/251.html |title=Gymkhana Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 8 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These matches mark the only time Burma and Rangoon Gymkhana have appeared in first-class cricket, and the only time first-class cricket has been played in Burma. After independence cricket all but died out in the country.

Yangon has a growing population of skateboarders, as documented in the films [[Altered Focus: Burma]] and [[Youth of Yangon]]. German non-profit organisation [[Make Life Skate Life]] has received permission from the [[Yangon City Development Committee]] to construct a concrete skatepark at [[Thakin Mya]] park in downtown, and plans to complete the park in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://makelifeskatelife.org/projects/yangon|title=Make Life Skate Life: Pushing Myanmar Forward|publisher=makelifeskatelife.org|access-date=25 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823105956/http://makelifeskatelife.org/projects/yangon|archive-date=23 August 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yangon is the country's main centre for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment and tourism. The city represents about one fifth of the [[Gross domestic product|national economy]]. According to official statistics for [[Fiscal year|FY]] 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93&amp;nbsp;trillion kyats, or 23% of the national GDP.&lt;ref name=mt-&gt;{{cite news | title=Yangon Region govt facing K22b budget black hole | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/600/news60002.html | author1=Kyaw Hsu Mon | author2=Yadana Htun | lastauthoramp=yes | date=7 November 2011 | work=The Myanmar Times | access-date=9 March 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617115438/http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/600/news60002.html | archive-date=17 June 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is Lower Burma's main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic food stuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city's severely underdeveloped banking industry and communication infrastructure. [[Bayinnaung Market]] is the largest wholesale centre in the country for rice, [[beans]] and [[pulses]], and other agricultural commodities.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-332/b007.htm| title=Market reforms lead to Bayintnaung boom| author1=Zaw Htet| author2=May Thanda Win| lastauthoramp=yes| date=4 September 2006| journal=The Myanmar Times| access-date=27 November 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129150553/http://myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-332/b007.htm#| archive-date=29 January 2009| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the country's legal imports and exports go through [[Thilawa Port]], the largest and busiest port in Burma. There is also a great deal of informal trade, especially in street markets that exist alongside street platforms of Downtown Yangon's townships. However, on 17 June 2011, the YCDC announced that street vendors, who had previously been allowed to legally open shop at 3&amp;nbsp;pm, would be prohibited from selling on the streets, and permitted to sell only in their townships of residence, presumably to clean up the city's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mmtimes.com/2011/news/580/news58002.html|title=Vendors belong in markets, says YCDC|author=Nay Nwe Moe Aung|author2=Moh Moh Thaw|date=20 June 2011|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002061657/http://mmtimes.com/2011/news/580/news58002.html|archive-date=2 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 December 2009, [[high-density polyethylene]] [[plastic bag]]s have been banned by city authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no496/n010.htm|title=Mayor reiterates bag ban|author=Myo Myo|date=9 November 2009|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612212418/http://www.mmtimes.com/no496/n010.htm|archive-date=12 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism represents a major source of foreign currency for the city although by south-east Asian standards the number of foreign visitors to Yangon has always been quite low—about 250,000 before the [[Saffron Revolution]] in September 2007. The number of visitors dipped even further following the Saffron Revolution and [[Cyclone Nargis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://burmadigest.info/2008/11/27/tourism-decline-in-burma-in-2008/ |title=Tourism decline in Burma in 2008 |date=27 November 2008 |work=Weekly Eleven Journal |publisher=Burma Digest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509094945/http://burmadigest.info/2008/11/27/tourism-decline-in-burma-in-2008/ |archivedate=9 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent improvement in the country's political climate has attracted an increasing number of businessmen and tourists.

There are over 20 universities and colleges in the city. While [[Yangon University]] remains the best known (its main campus is a part of popular Burmese culture e.g. literature, music, film, etc.), the nation's oldest university is now mostly a graduate school, deprived of undergraduate studies. Following the 1988 nationwide uprising, the military government has repeatedly closed universities, and has dispersed most of undergraduate student population to new universities in the suburbs such as [[Dagon University]], the [[University of East Yangon]] and the [[University of West Yangon]]. Nonetheless many of the country's most selective universities are still in Yangon. Students from around the country still have to come to study in Yangon as some subjects are offered only at its universities. The [[University of Medicine 1, Yangon|University of Medicine 1]], [[University of Medicine 2, Yangon|University of Medicine 2]], [[Yangon Technological University]], [[University of Computer Studies, Yangon|University of Computer Studies]] and [[Myanmar Maritime University]] are the most selective in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu08/e001.htm| title=HR key to development| date=28 March 2008| author=Minh Zaw| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=23 April 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720031121/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu08/e001.htm| archive-date=20 July 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care==

[[File:General Hospital, Yangon.jpg|thumb|Yangon General Hospital]]
The general state of health care in Yangon is poor. According to a 2007 estimate, the military government spends 0.4% of the national budget on health care, and 40% to 60% on defence.&lt;ref name=dumber/&gt; By the government's own figures, it spends 849 kyats (US$0.85) per person.&lt;ref name=malpractice&gt;{{Cite news | title=Another Medical Malpractice Death in Rangoon | url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17547 | author=Arkar Moe | publisher=The Irrawaddy | date=8 January 2010 | access-date=18 December 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112075354/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17547 | archive-date=12 January 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals including the flagship [[Yangon General Hospital]] lack many of the basic facilities and equipment.

Wealthier Yangonites still have access to country's best medical facilities and internationally qualified doctors. Only Yangon and [[Mandalay]] have any sizeable number of doctors left as many Burmese doctors have emigrated. The well-to-do go to private clinics or hospitals like Pun Hlaing International Hospital and Bahosi Medical Clinic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} [[Medical malpractice]] is widespread, even in private clinics and hospitals that serve the well-to-do. In 2009 and 2010, a spate of high-profile deaths&lt;ref name=malpractice/&gt; brought out the severity of the problem, even for the relatively well off Yangonites. The wealthy do not rely on domestic hospitals and travel abroad, usually [[Bangkok]] or Singapore, for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h012.htm| title=Medical tourism gives patients options| author=Thein Win Nyo| work=The Myanmar Times| date=11 June 2007| access-date=1 January 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720093301/https://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h012.htm| archive-date=20 July 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2474">'''Émile Bourgeois''' (24 July 1857	- 25 August 1934) was a French historian.

==Life ==
Born at Paris, Bourgeois was educated at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in rue d'Ulm and later taught at the [[École supérieure de journalisme de Paris]]. A specialist in 17th century history, in 1895 Bourgeois was appointed as ''maître de conférence'' at an École normale supérieure, but he gave up the post in 1904 to accept a professorship in history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he remained until he retired in 1921. Early in the 20th century he became a contributor to ''[[The Cambridge Modern History]]''.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;'M. ÉMILE BOURGEOIS (1857-1934)' in ''Revue des travaux de l'Académie des sciences morales &amp; politiques et comptes rendus de ses séances'', vol. 98, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 he was elected to the ''[[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]]'' and died in 1934.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;
