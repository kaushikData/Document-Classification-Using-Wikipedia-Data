'''Age of consent reform''' is efforts to change [[age of consent]] laws.  Proposed reforms typically include raising, lowering, or abolishing the age of consent, applying (or not applying) close-in-age exemptions, changing penalties, or changing how cases are examined in court. A related issue is whether or not to apply ages of consent to [[homosexual]] relationships that are different from those applied to [[heterosexual]] relationships.  Organized efforts have ranged from academic discussions to political petitions.

==Initiatives to change the age of consent==
There have been many initiatives to raise the age of consent. [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], a canon lawyer in the 12th century, stated that consent could not take place before 7 years of age. The English government eventually decided on age of 12 for women as their limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |title=Age of Consent – Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the age was about 12 in most countries. Today it is usually set between 15 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm |title=Worldwide Ages of Consent |publisher=Avert.org |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Age of consent reform (UK)}}
In 1275, the age of consent in England was set at 12 (Westminster 1 statute), the first time an age of consent had been set in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robertson, Stephen|title=Age of Consent Laws|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230|website=Children and Youth in History|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=3 August 2015|location=[[Sydney]], [[Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1875 the [[Offences against the Person Act 1875|Offence Against the Persons Act]] raised it to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland. The [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885]] raised it to 16.&lt;ref name="Odem1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary E.

According to sociologist Matthew Waites, in the 1970s, a number of grassroots political actions took place in Britain in favor of lowering the age of consent, which he described as based on claims of children's rights, gay liberation, or as a way to avoid unwanted pregnancies or [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref name=waites&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Waites|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-age-of-consent-matthew-waites/?K=9781403921734|date=15 August 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-23718-6}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=kLhhPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=he+Age+of+Consent+%E2%80%93+Young+People,+Sexuality+and+Citizenship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aQNAVc7IG_P9sATxj4DwDw&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA Google books link])&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1974, the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]] suggested a basic age of consent of 16, but 12 "in cases where a defendant could prove the existence of meaningful consent".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., pp. 132 and 243, Note 6.6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay News, no. 46, 9 May 1974, p.3 – 'CHE Report angers reformers'.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1974, the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society|Sexual Law Reform Society]] proposed lowering the age of consent to 14, with the requirement that below the age of 18  the burden of proof that consent for sexual activities between the parties existed would be the responsibility of the older participant.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., p.132).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the British political advocacy group [[Liberty (pressure group)|the National Council for Civil Liberties]] (now known as ''Liberty'') published a proposal advocating reducing the age of consent laws to 10 years of age, only when both individuals are younger than 14, with a close-in-age exemption of two years if one of the involved individuals is older than 14 but younger than 16.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, p.135-136).

===Russia===
Russia in 1998 lowered the age of consent from 16 to 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_19123/#p29 | title=25 июня 1998 года N 92-ФЗ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2002 raised the age of consent from 14 back to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_45408/#p243| title=8 декабря 2003 года N 162-ФЗ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |title=Russia – Age of Consent |author=Peter Graff |date=June 28–29, 2002 |publisher=Reuters (via Age of Consent) |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121103/http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |title=Russia |publisher=Age of Consent |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121103/http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then penalties have also generally increased. Vladimir Putin said that a party advocating lowering the age of consent cannot be legally registered (hence, be a legal party) in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===India===
In January 2004, a [[Division bench]] of the [[Kerala]]'s [[Kerala High Court|High Court]] in Southern [[India]] suggested that the age of consent should be raised from 16 to 18 in that state. Justice R. Basant said he considered "illogic(al)" that a legal system in which an age of 18 is used for other purposes – like the Indian Majority Act, the Contract Act, the [[Juvenile Justice Act]], the [[Child Marriage in India|Child Marriage Restraint Act]] and the Representation of People Act – has a different approach in the case of sexual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiansexgazette.com/asg/south_asia/southasia03news67.htm |title=Kerala, Raise age-limit for giving consent for sexual intercourse to 18 – South Asia |publisher=Asian Sex Gazette |date=2004-01-21 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of consent in India was raised from 16 to 18 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-23/india/31826039_1_children-from-sexual-offences-sexual-abuse-courts-for-speedy-trial | work=The Times Of India | title=Parliament clears bill against child abuse | date=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Ages of consent in the United States}}
Over the course of American history, the most commonly observed age of consent was 10 years. In 1880, 37 states had an age of consent of 10 years while 10 states kept an age of consent at 12, and Delaware maintained its age of consent at seven years, having lowered it from 10 in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=[[:s:The_New_York_Times/1895/10/15/Purity_Congress_Meets|PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

In the late-19th century, a "[[social purity movement]]" composed of Christian feminist reform groups began advocating a raise in the age of consent to 16, with the goal of raising it ultimately to 18, and by 1920 almost all states had raised their age of consent to 16 or 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/teacher/aoc.htm |title=The Campaign to Raise the Age of Consent 1885–1914 |author= |date= |work=Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600–2000 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, there was widespread sympathy among homosexual activist groups for lowering the age of consent for all sexual activities (partially due to the disparate ages of consent for same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activity),&lt;ref name="Warner2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Warner|title=Never Going Back: A History of Queer Activism in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdo-95q2EYgC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8460-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many gay publications freely discussing lowering it for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t3RDzkqR_88C|publisher = Oxford University Press, USA|date = 2006-03-15|isbn = 9780198039723|first = Philip Jenkins Distinguished Professor of History and Religious Studies Pennsylvania State|last = University|page = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions and antagonisms continued among activist circles until the 1980s; however, since the 1970s, [[gay liberation]]ist groups promoting frontline advocacy against the age of consent were falling into decline.&lt;ref name="Warner2002" /&gt; 

A small number of voices continued into the 2000s among self-declared pedophiles on certain [[internet]] websites and chatrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = On the Web, Pedophiles Extend Their Reach|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/technology/21pedo.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2006-08-21|access-date = 2015-10-20|issn = 0362-4331|first = Kurt|last = Eichenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two final states legislating their ages of consent into the 15–18 range were Georgia and Hawaii, from 14, raised in 1995 and 2001, respectively.

As of August 1, 2018, the age of consent in each state in the United States was either 16 years of age, 17 years of age, or 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Age of Consent across the United States |url = https://www.ageofconsent.net/states|work = AgeOfConsent.net|access-date = 2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alabama====
In 2012, Alabama State Representative Mac McCutcheon sponsored a bill to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://whnt.com/2012/04/30/lawmaker-pushes-bill-to-raise-age-of-consent-in-alabama/&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2018, the age of consent in Alabama remains 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = State-by-State Marriage "Age of Consent" Laws|url = https://family.findlaw.com/marriage/state-by-state-marriage-age-of-consent-laws.html|work = FindLaw.com|access-date = 2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In 2001, the legislature in Hawaii voted to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=e5Az1lGCJwQC |page=1118 }} |title=Far East and Australasia 2003 – Eur |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
In June 2005, a bill was proposed before the General Assembly of Georgia (USA) to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb722.htm |title=hb722.html |publisher=Legis.state.ga.us |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804092842/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb722.htm |archivedate=2009-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/search/hb722.htm |title=Georgia General Assembly – HB 722 |publisher=Legis.ga.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722045004/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/search/hb722.htm |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill failed, however. 

Georgia was the most notoriously resistant state to raising its age of consent in the early 1900s.  Georgia's age of consent was  10 until 1918, and even then the age of consent was only raised to 14. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=KtMRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA336&amp;lpg=PA336&amp;dq=1918+georgia+age+of+consent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-35YG3-ON2&amp;sig=5-9-iSWz7tDGkAQo8AqaUc2F_mU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjriceHwd3YAhUlTd8KHTnJDkEQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=1918%20georgia%20age%20of%20consent&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;Even after raising the age of consent in 1918, Georgia was still the only state in the United States to have an age of consent lower than 16. &lt;ref&gt;http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230?section=primarysources&amp;source=24&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia's age of consent remained at 14 until 1995, when a bill proposed by senator Steve Langford to make the age of consent 16 passed.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19950207&amp;id=gU5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CRUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2408,2396348&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2006, following the infamous case of Genarlow Wilson ([[Wilson v. State]]), aggravated child molestation was reduced to a misdemeanor with a maximum of one year in prison if the offender was under 19, the victim was either 14 or 15 years old, and the offender is no more than 48 months older than the victim. (Georgia penal code, 16-6-4). Previously aggravated child molestation (at any age) carried 10–20 years imprisonment regardless of the age difference between the victim and offender.

====Kentucky====
In 2007 in Kentucky Representative JR Gray sponsored legislation in the state legislature that passed making it a felony for a teacher to have sex with a student under the age of 18. He also discussed the possibility of raising the age of consent from 16 to 18 but a bill was not produced for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-11-02-misconduct_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Robert | last=Tanner | title=States target sexual misconduct in schools | date=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Missouri====
In 2008 a bill was proposed in the Missouri legislature to raise the age of consent from 17 to 18. It was sponsored by Representative Stanley Cox.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joplinglobe.com/local/x212127249/Missouri-House-bill-would-raise-age-of-consent-to-18&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Carolina====
In South Carolina in 2007 a bill was proposed before the legislature to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrdw.com/home/headlines/5431721.html&lt;/ref&gt; It did not succeed.

====Wisconsin====
Prior to 1981 Wisconsin had an exception to the law that allowed adults who were guilty of sex with minors 15 or older to use as a defense that the victim understood the nature of the sexual act, but there was a rebuttable presumption in Wisconsin that minors under the age of 18 were not capable of informed consent to sex, but as stated, this could be argued against by the defendant in the court of law if the minor was 15 years of age or older. In 1981 the age of consent was lowered from 18 to 16 in Wisconsin, but at the same time it was made an automatic felony to have sex with anyone under 16, informed consent for a 15-year-old was no longer a defense an adult defendant could use in court. In 1983 the age of consent in Wisconsin was raised from 16 to 18, under the new law sex with a minor 16 or older carried the lesser penalty of a Class A Misdemeanor. A marital exemption was included in the law for an adult who was married to a minor 16 or older, but no close-in-age exception was.&lt;ref&gt;Owzsewski, DJ Statutory Rape in Wisconsin 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main article|Age of consent reform in Canada}}
In June 2006, the Canadian government proposed a bill to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16 (in 1890, it was raised from 12 to 14), while creating a near-age exemption for sex between 14- to 15-year-olds and partners less than 5 years older, and keeping an existing near-age clause for sex between 12–13 year olds and partners less than 2 years older.

Between 1990 and 2002, the Netherlands operated what was in effect an age of consent of 12, subject to qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=yit1CY_4BRMC }} |title=Regulating Sex: The politics of Intimacy and Identity |author=Elizabeth Bernstein, Laurie Schaffner |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant law, passed in November, 1990, permitted sexual intercourse for young people between 12 and 16, but allowed a challenge by parents based on erosion of parental authority or child exploitation, which would be heard by a Council for the Protection of Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=David T. |year=1993 |title=Sexual Citizenship: The Material Construction of Sexualities |page=208 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-05799-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=no-94x3v74IC&amp;pg=PT208&amp;dq=evans+1993+Sexual+Citizenship:+The+Material+Construction+of+Sexualities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=puc_VfLwD_XfsATrsoE4&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=netherlands&amp;f=false}} (link is to the 2013 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Dutch [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] supported an unsuccessful petition to lower the age of consent to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brongersma |first=Edward |year=1988 |chapter=Schutzalter 12 Jahre? – Sex mit Kindern in der niederländischen Gesetzgebung |trans-chapter=Age of Consent 12 years?

===Peru===
The age of consent in [[Peru]] was increased from 14 to 18 in 2006 as elections approached, but in 2007, Peru's new Congress voted to return the age to 14 regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Peru001 &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/22/world/main2970190.shtml |title=Peru Lowers Age Of Consent To 14 |publisher=CBS News |date=22 June 2007  |accessdate=28 Jan 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after strong public opposition, the law was raised back to 18 on June 27, 2007, by a vote of 74 to zero (22 abstentions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/CNnoticiasanteriores/fc34916372aa85c9052573070053ab5a?OpenDocument |title=Pleno Reconsidero Exoneracion de Sedunda Votacion a Proyecto Sobre Libertad Sexual |date=2007-06-27 |publisher=El Heraldo |language=Spanish |trans-title=House Reconsidered and Excluded Second Vote for Project on Sexual Freedom |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was returned to 14 in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tc.gob.pe/jurisprudencia/2013/00008-2012-AI.pdf| title = Demanda de inconstitucionalidad interpuesta por diez mil seiscientos nueve ciudadanos contra el artículo 1° de la Ley N° 28704 que modifica el artículo 173°, inciso 3° del Código Penal, sobre delito de violación sexual contra víctima entre 14 y 18 años de edad | language = Spanish | date = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1977 while a reform in the French penal code was under discussion in the parliament, a [[French petition against age of consent laws|petition to decriminalize]] all consented relations between adults and [[minor (law)|minor]]s below the age of fifteen was sent to Parliament but did not succeed in changing the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink=Michel Foucault |title=Politics, Philosophy, Culture: Interviews and Other Writings 1977–1984 |editor-first=Lawrence D. |editor-last=Krizman |location=New York / London |year=1988 |publisher=Routledge |pages=272–273 |isbn=0-415-90082-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 the petition was discussed in a broadcast by radio [[France Culture]] in the program "Dialogues", with the transcript later published under the title [[Sexual Morality and the Law]] in a book by [[Michel Foucault]]. The participants, including Foucault, play-writer/actor [[Jean Danet]] and novelist/gay activist [[Guy Hocquenghem]] had all signed the petition.

===Pedophile advocacy===
Some [[pedophiles]] have called to abolish the age of consent to allow adults to have sex freely with  prepubescent children, arguing they can consent.&lt;ref name=jenkins2006&gt;{{cite book|title=Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America |first=Philip |last=Jenkins |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=120|isbn=0-19-517866-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Abuse of Males: The Sam Model of Theory and Practice |last= Spiegel |first=Josef |year=2003 |pages=5, p9 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 1-56032-403-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups advocating pedophilia and the abolishment of age of consent laws include [[NAMBLA]] in the United States and [[Vereniging Martijn]] in the Netherlands.

==Close-in-age exemptions==
{{main article|Statutory rape#Romeo and Juliet laws|l1=Romeo and Juliet laws}}
In the United States, many states have adopted close-in-age exemptions.

{{Mental state}}
{{Emotion}}

'''Apathy''' is a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, and concern about something of great importance.  Apathy is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as [[Worry|concern]], [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]], [[motivation]], or [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, or physical life and the world.

The apathetic may lack a sense of purpose, worth, or [[Positive psychology#The meaningful life|meaning in their life]]. An apathetic person may also exhibit insensibility or sluggishness. In [[positive psychology]], apathy is described as a result of the individuals feeling they do not possess the level of skill required to confront a challenge (i.e. "[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]"). It may also be a result of perceiving no challenge at all (e.g. the challenge is irrelevant to them, or conversely, they have [[learned helplessness]]). Apathy may be a sign of more specific mental problems such as [[schizophrenia]] or [[dementia]].  However, apathy is something that all people face in some capacity.  It is a natural response to disappointment, dejection, and stress.  As a response, apathy is a way to forget about these negative feelings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This type of common apathy is usually only felt in the short-term and when it becomes a long-term or even lifelong state is when deeper social and psychological issues are most likely present.

Apathy should be distinguished from [[Reduced affect display|reduced affect]], which refers to reduced [[Affect display|emotional expression]] but not necessarily reduced emotion.

==Etymology==
Although the word ''apathy'' was first used in 1594&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apathy |title=Apathy - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀπάθεια}} (''[[apatheia]]''), from {{lang|grc|ἀπάθης}} (''apathēs'', "without feeling" from ''a-'' ("without, not") and ''[[pathos]]'' ("emotion")),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)pa%2Fqeia |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, ἀπάθ-εια |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is important not to confuse the two terms.  Also meaning "absence of passion," "apathy" or "insensibility" in Greek, the term ''apatheia'' was used by the [[Stoics]] to signify a (desirable) state of indifference towards events and things which lie outside one's control (that is, according to their philosophy, all things exterior, one being only responsible for one's own representations and judgments).&lt;ref&gt;William Fleming (1857). ''The vocabulary of philosophy, mental, moral, and metaphysical''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=S-MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Fleming+Stoics+apathy&amp;ei=PvdKSvHZEoS8yQSYxaD0DQ p.&amp;34]. Reprinted by [[Kessinger Publishing]] as paperback (2006; {{ISBN|978-1-4286-3324-7}}) and in hardcover (2007; {{ISBN|978-0-548-12371-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to ''apathy'', ''apatheia'' is considered a [[virtue]], especially in [[Orthodox monasticism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  In the [[Philokalia]] the word ''dispassion'' is used for ''apatheia'', so as not to confuse it with ''apathy''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== History and other views ==
[[Christian]]s have historically condemned apathy as a deficiency of love and devotion to [[God]] and his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v3.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=G543&amp;t=KJV |title=Greek Lexicon :: G543 (KJV) |publisher=V3.blueletterbible.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of apathy is also referred to as [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] and is listed among the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. [[Clemens Alexandrinus]] used the term to draw to Christianity [[philosopher]]s who aspired after virtue.

The modern concept of apathy became more well-known after [[World War I]], when it was one of the various forms of "[[shell shock]]". Soldiers who lived in the trenches amidst the bombing and machine gun fire, and who saw the battlefields strewn with dead and maimed comrades, developed a sense of disconnected numbness and indifference to normal [[social interaction]] when they returned from combat.

In 1950, US novelist [[John Dos Passos]] wrote: "Apathy is one of the characteristic responses of any living organism when it is subjected to stimuli too intense or too complicated to cope with. The cure for apathy is [[Understanding|comprehension]]."

[[Douglas Hofstadter]] suggests that, recognizing that the human brain's "ego" is nothing but a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]], no emotion is necessary. Since the realization of the [[future of an expanding universe]], apathy is the only intelligent response. It is in contrast to the [[contentment|contented]] feeling of self-satisfaction of complacency, driven by the illusion of the "ego".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Technology===
Apathy is a normal way for humans to cope with stress. Being able to "shrug off" disappointments is considered an important step in moving people forward and driving them to try other activities and achieve new goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/A-Br/Apathy.html |title=Apathy - effects, withdrawal, people, effect, health, mood, Definition, Description |publisher=Minddisorders.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping seems to be one of the most important aspects of getting over a tragedy and an apathetic reaction may be expected. With the addition of the handheld device and the screen between people, apathy has also become a common occurrence on the net as users observe others being bullied, slandered, threatened or even sent horrific pictures. The bystander effect grows to an apathetic level as people lose interest in caring for others who are not in their “circle,” even going so far as to join in the torment as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://64.225.152.8/files/prefaces/jeco%20preface%203(4).pdf |title=Consumer Apathy and the Emerging Revenue Model of the Internet : The Economic Case for Spyware |publisher=64.225.152.8 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019212911/http://64.225.152.8/files/prefaces/jeco%20preface%203%284%29.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social origin ===
There may be other things contributing to a person's apathy. Activist David Meslin argues that people often care, and that apathy is often the result of social systems actively obstructing engagement and involvement. He describes various obstacles that prevent people from knowing how or why they might get involved in something. Meslin focuses on design choices that unintentionally or intentionally exclude people. These include: [[capitalistic]] media systems that have no provisions for ideas that are not immediately (monetarily) profitable, government and political media (e.g. notices) that make it difficult for potentially interested individuals to find relevant information, and media portrayals of [[hero]]es as "chosen" by outside forces rather than self-motivated. He moves that we redefine social apathy to think of it, not as a population that is stupid or lazy, but as a result of poorly designed systems that fail to invite others to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_meslin_the_antidote_to_apathy.html |title=Dave Meslin: The antidote to apathy &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/dave_meslin.html |title=Dave Meslin &amp;#124; Profile on |publisher=Ted.com |date=17 July 2010 |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apathy has been socially viewed as worse than things such as hate or anger.  Not caring whatsoever, in the eyes of some, is even worse than having distaste for something.  Author [[Leo Buscaglia]] is quoted as saying "I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate-it's apathy.  It's not giving a damn."  [[Helen Keller]] claimed that apathy is the "worst of them all" when it comes to the various evils of the world.  French social commentator and political thinker [[Charles de Montesquieu]] stated that "the tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in the democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psysci.co/12-famous-quotes-about-apathy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527111513/http://www.psysci.co/12-famous-quotes-about-apathy/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 May 2015 |title=12 Famous Quotes About Apathy |publisher=psysci.co |date= 2015-04-30|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen by these quotes and various others, the social implications of apathy are great.  Many people believe that not caring at all can be worse for society than individuals who are overpowering or hateful.

===In the school system===
{{One source section|date=March 2016}}
Apathy in students, especially those in high school, is a growing phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Apathy in schools is most easily recognized by students being unmotivated or, quite commonly, being motivated by outside factors. For example, when asked about their motivation for doing well in school, fifty percent of students cited outside sources such as "college acceptance" or "good grades". On the contrary, only fourteen percent cited "gaining an understanding of content knowledge or learning subject material" as their motivation to do well in school. As a result of these outside sources, and not a genuine desire for knowledge, students often do the minimum amount of work necessary to get by in their classes.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This then leads to average grades and test grades but no real grasping of knowledge.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Many students cited that "assignments/content was irrelevant or meaningless" and that this was the cause of their apathetic attitudes toward their schooling. These apathetic attitudes lead to teacher and parent frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pan.intrasun.tcnj.edu/501/projects/Sanders/inquiry%20project.htm |title=Finding the Root Cause of Student Apathy |publisher=Pan.intrasun.tcnj.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of apathy in students include situations within their home life, media influences, peer influences, and school struggles and failures. Some of the signs for apathetic students include declining grades, skipping classes, routine illness, and behavioral changes both in school and at home.

===Bystander===
Also known as the [[bystander effect]], bystander apathy occurs when, during an emergency, those standing by do nothing to help but instead stand by and watch.  Sometimes this can be caused by one bystander observing other bystanders and imitating their behavior.  If other people are not acting in a way that makes the situation seem like an emergency that needs attention, often other bystanders will act in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/latane_bystand.html |title=Latane and Darley: Bystander Apathy |publisher=Faculty.babson.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diffusion to responsibility can also be to blame for bystander apathy.  The more people that are around in emergency situations, the more likely individuals are to think that someone else will help so they do not need to.  This theory was popularized by social psychologists in response to the 1964 [[Kitty Genovese]] murder.  The murder took place in New York and the victim, Genovese, was stabbed to death as bystanders reportedly stood by and did nothing to stop the situation or even call the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/bystander-effect |title=Bystander Effect |publisher=Psychology Today |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305230120/http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/bystander-effect |archivedate=5 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bibb Latané|Latane]] and [[John M. Darley|Darley]] are the two psychologists who did research on this theory.  They performed different experiments that placed people into situations where they had the opportunity to intervene or do nothing.  The individuals in the experiment were either by themselves, with a stranger(s), with a friend, or with a confederate.  The experiments ultimately led them to the conclusion that there are many social and situational factors that are behind whether a person will react in an emergency situation or simply remain apathetic to what is occurring.

===Communication===
Apathy is one psychological barrier to [[communication]]. An apathetic listener creates a communication barrier by not caring or paying attention to what they are being told.  An apathetic speaker, on the other hand, tends to not relate information well and, in their lack of interest, may leave out key pieces of information that need to be communicated.  Within groups, an apathetic communicator can be detrimental.  Their lack of interest or passion can inhibit the other group members in what they are trying to accomplish.  Within [[interpersonal communication]], an apathetic listener can make the other feel that they are not cared for or about.  Overall, apathy is a dangerous barrier to successful communication.  Apathetic speakers and listeners are individuals that have no care for what they are trying to communicate, or what is being communicated to them.

==Measuring==

===Apathy Evaluation Scale===
Developed by Robert Marin in 1991, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a way of measuring as related to brain-related pathology.  Centered around evaluation, the scale can either be self-informed or other-informed.  The three versions of the test include self, informant such as a family member, and clinician.  The scale is based around questionnaires that ask about topics including interest, motivation, socialization, and how the individual spends their time.  The individual or informant answers on a scale of "not at all", "slightly", "somewhat" or "a lot".  Each item on the evaluation is created with positive or negative syntax and deals with cognition, behavior, and emotion.  Each item is then scored and, based on the score, the individual's level of apathy can be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dementia-assessment.com.au/symptoms/AES_self.pdf |title=Apathy Evaluation Scale (Self rated) |publisher=Dementia-assessment.com.au |accessdate=25 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126074628/http://dementia-assessment.com.au/symptoms/AES_self.pdf |archivedate=26 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===
{{Main|Major depressive disorder}}
Mental health journalist and author John McManamy argues that although [[psychiatrist]]s do not explicitly deal with the condition of apathy, it is a psychological problem for some [[clinical depression|depressed]] people, in which they get a sense that "nothing matters", the "lack of will to go on and the inability to care about the consequences".&lt;ref name="McManamy"&gt;John McManamy. "[http://www.mcmanweb.com/apathy.html Apathy Matters - Apathy and Depression: Psychiatry may not care about apathy, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't]".&lt;/ref&gt; He describes depressed people who "...cannot seem to make [themselves] do anything", who "can't complete anything", and who do not "feel any excitement about seeing loved ones".&lt;ref name="McManamy" /&gt; He acknowledges that the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' does not discuss apathy.

In a ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'' article from 1991, Robert Marin, MD, claimed that apathy occurs due to brain damage or neuropsychiatric illnesses such as Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, or Huntington's, or else an event such as a stroke. Marin argues that apathy should be regarded as a syndrome or illness.&lt;ref name="McManamy" /&gt;

A review article by Robert van Reekum, MD, et al. from the [[University of Toronto]] in the ''Journal of Neuropsychiatry'' (2005) claimed that an obvious relationship between depression and apathy exists in some populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/jnp.17.1.7 |pmid=15746478 |title=Apathy: Why Care? |journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=7–19 |year=2005 |last1=Van Reekum |first1=Robert |last2=Stuss |first2=Donald T. |last3=Ostrander |first3=Laurie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alzheimer's===
Apathy affects nearly 50–70 percent of individuals with [[Alzheimer's disease]].  It is a neuropsychiatric symptom of Alzheimer's associated with functional impairment.  There are two main causes of apathy that have been recognized in patients with Alzheimer's.  First, dysfunction in frontal systems of the brain is thought to be an important neurobiological basis for the onset of apathy.  Second, the neuropathological changes associated with dementia, and therefore Alzheimer's, may also result in apathy. [[Cholinesterase inhibitors]], used as the first line of treatment for the cognitive symptoms associated with dementia, have also shown some modest benefit for behavior disturbances such as apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malloy |first=Paul F. |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/apathy-and-its-treatment-alzheimers-disease-and-other-dementias |title=Apathy and Its Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias |publisher=Psychiatric Times |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methylphenidate]] has been the most widely studied drug for the treatment of apathy in dementia. Management of apathetic symptoms using methylphenidate have shown promise in randomized placebo controlled trials of Alzheimer's patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/jcp.0b013e318172b479 |pmid=18480686 |title=Methylphenidate for the Treatment of Apathy in Alzheimer Disease |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=296–301 |year=2008 |last1=Herrmann |first1=Nathan |last2=Rothenburg |first2=Lana S. |last3=Black |first3=Sandra E. |last4=Ryan |first4=Michelle |last5=Liu |first5=Barbara A. |last6=Busto |first6=Usoa E. |last7=Lanctôt |first7=Krista L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.12m08099 |pmid=24021498 |pmc=3902018 |title=Safety and Efficacy of Methylphenidate for Apathy in Alzheimer's Disease |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=810–816 |year=2013 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Paul B. |last2=Lanctôt |first2=Krista L. |last3=Drye |first3=Lea T. |last4=Herrmann |first4=Nathan |last5=Scherer |first5=Roberta W. |last6=Bachman |first6=David L. |last7=Mintzer |first7=Jacobo E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1041610213001762 |pmid=24169147 |pmc=3927455 |title=Effect of methylphenidate on attention in apathetic AD patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial |journal=International Psychogeriatrics |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=239–246 |year=2014 |last1=Lanctôt |first1=Krista L. |last2=Chau |first2=Sarah A. |last3=Herrmann |first3=Nathan |last4=Drye |first4=Lea T. |last5=Rosenberg |first5=Paul B. |last6=Scherer |first6=Roberta W. |last7=Black |first7=Sandra E. |last8=Vaidya |first8=Vijay |last9=Bachman |first9=David L. |last10=Mintzer |first10=Jacobo E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A phase III multi-centered randomized placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy is currently underway and planned for completion in August 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02346201|Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxiety===
While apathy and [[anxiety]] may appear to be separate, and different, states of being, there are many ways that severe anxiety can cause apathy.  First, the emotional fatigue that so often accompanies severe anxiety leads to one's emotions being worn out, thus leading to apathy.  Second, the low serotonin levels associated with anxiety often lead to less passion and interest in the activities in one's life which can be seen as apathy.  Third, negative thinking and distractions associated with anxiety can ultimately lead to a decrease in one's overall happiness which can then lead to an apathetic outlook about one's life.  Finally, the difficulty enjoying activities that individuals with anxiety often face can lead to them doing these activities much less often and can give them a sense of apathy about their lives.  Even behavioral apathy may be found in individuals with anxiety in the form of them not wanting to make efforts to treat their anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/apathy |title=Apathy: Anxiety's Unusual Symptom |publisher=Calm Clinic |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Often, apathy is felt after witnessing horrific acts, such as the killing or maiming of people during a [[war]], e.g. [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. It is also known to be a distinct psychiatric syndrome that is associated with many conditions, some of which are: [[CADASIL syndrome]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Chagas disease]], [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], [[dementia]] (and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia), [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], [[Hypervitaminosis D|excessive vitamin D]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[hyperthyroidism]], general fatigue, [[Huntington's disease]], [[Pick's disease]], [[progressive supranuclear palsy]] (PSP), [[brain damage]], [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoid personality disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[autism spectrum]] disorders, [[ADHD]], and others. Some medications and the heavy use of drugs such as [[opiate]]s or [[GABA]]-ergic drugs may bring apathy as a side effect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Evidence for a group difference in intelligence==

Ashkenazi Jews have had success in a variety of academic fields disproportionate to their small population size, including science, technology, politics, and law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Chosen Calling: Jews in Science in the Twentieth Century (Medicine, Science, and Religion in Historical Context)  |last=Efron |first=Noah J. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1421413815 |pages=15–16|series=Medicine, Science, and Religion in Historical Context |publication-date=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Ashkenazi Jews have won more than one quarter of [[Fields Medal]]s, [[Turing Award]]s, and [[Regeneron Science Talent Search]] awards. People of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are also disproportionately represented among [[List of Jewish chess players|world chess champions]] (54 percent),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Abraham's Children: Race, Identity, and the DNA of the Chosen People |last=Entine |first= Jon  |publisher= Grand Central Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-0446580632 |publication-date=October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Medal of Science Laureate|National Medal of Science]] recipients (37 percent), U.S. [[List of Jewish Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize winners]] (29 percent),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and Nobel laureates in medicine or physiology (42 percent).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, Jews comprise up to one third of the student populace at Ivy League schools&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and 30 percent of U.S. Supreme Court law clerks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count |last= Nisbett |first=Richard E. |publisher=WW Norton |year=2010 |isbn=978-0393337693 |publication-date=January 26, 2010 |pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashkenazi Jews have also had disproportionate success in non-academic fields such as business and commerce. According to the 1931 census of Poland, Jews comprised 9.8 percent of the Polish population but controlled 22.4 percent of the wealth in the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite their small population, Ashkenazi Jews in Poland also owned 55 percent of large and medium-sized commercial businesses in 1938 and dominated the textile, chemical, food, transportation, paper manufacturing, and building material industries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A more direct approach is to measure intelligence with [[psychometrics|psychometric tests]]. Different studies have found different results, but most have found above-average verbal and [[mathematical logic|mathematical intelligence]] in Ashkenazi Jews, along with below-average spatial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, M. E. (1972) "Patterns of mental abilities: ethnic, socioeconomic and sex differences." ''American Educational Research Journal'', 9, 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, B.M. &amp; Block, Z. (1977) "Goodenough-Harris drawings of Jewish children of orthodox background." ''Psychological Reports'' 41, 155–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic explanations==
Assuming that today there is a statistical difference in intelligence between Ashkenazi Jews and other ethnic groups, there still remains the question of how much of the difference is caused by genetic factors.

=== "Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence" ===
"Natural History of Intelligence",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a 2005 paper by [[Gregory Cochran]], Jason Hardy, and [[Henry Harpending]], put forth the conjecture that the unique conditions under which Ashkenazi Jews lived in medieval Europe [[natural selection|selected]] for high verbal and mathematical intelligence but not spatial intelligence. Their paper has four main premises:
# Today's Ashkenazi Jews have a higher average mathematical and verbal [[IQ]] and an unusual cognitive profile compared to other ethnic groups, including [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and Oriental Jews.
# From roughly 800 to 1650 [[Common Era|CE]], Ashkenazi Jews in Europe were a mostly isolated genetic group. When Ashkenazi Jews married non-Jews, they usually left the Jewish community; few non-Jews married into the Jewish community.
# During the same period, laws barred Ashkenazi Jews from most jobs, including farming and crafts, and forced them into finance, management, and international trade. Wealthy Jews had several more children per family than poor Jews. So, genes for cognitive traits such as verbal and mathematical talent, which make a person successful in the few fields where Jews could work, were favored; genes for irrelevant traits, such as spatio-visual abilities, were supported by less [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] than in the general population.
# Today's Ashkenazi Jews suffer from a number of congenital diseases and mutations at higher rates than most other ethnic groups; these include [[Tay–Sachs disease]], [[Gaucher's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;It has been noted that precisely Jews with Gaucher's disease are likely to work in positions demanding very high IQ. See [http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/nisbett2012int.pdf Nisbett 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bloom's syndrome]], and [[Fanconi anemia]], and mutations at [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]]. These mutations' effects cluster in only a few [[metabolic pathways]], suggesting that they arise from selective pressure rather than [[genetic drift]]. One cluster of these diseases affects [[sphingolipid]] storage, a secondary effect of which is increased growth of [[axons]] and [[dendrites]]. At least one of the diseases in this cluster, [[torsion dystonia]], has been found to correlate with high [[IQ]]. Another cluster disrupts [[DNA]] repair, an extremely dangerous sort of mutation which is lethal in [[homozygotes]]. The authors speculate that these mutations give a cognitive benefit to [[heterozygotes]] by reducing inhibitions to neural growth, a benefit that would not outweigh its high costs except in an environment where it was strongly rewarded.

Other scientists gave the paper a mixed reception, ranging from outright dismissal to acknowledgement that the hypothesis might be true and merits further research.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt;

In a television interview, Cochran said:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Laughing Man|title=Hjernevask - Brainwashing (Eng Sub) Part 6 - Race|date=2014-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve6uK00AvNo&amp;t=1201|accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It doesn't have to be extremely heritable for this [intelligence inheritance] to have happened, because you only need small changes in each generation, and there might be forty generations over 1000 years. So if [Ashkenazi Jews] increased a third of an IQ point per generation, that would almost certainly be enough to make this effect happen."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other proposed genetic explanations===
The enforcement of a religious norm requiring Jewish fathers to educate their sons, whose high cost caused voluntary conversions, might explain a large part of a reduction in the size of the Jewish population.&lt;ref name="HandE2007"&gt;Botticini, Maristella; and [[Zvi Eckstein]]. "From Farmers to Merchants, Conversions and Diaspora: Human Capital and Jewish History", September 2007, Vol. 5, No. 5, Pages 885–926 {{DOI|10.1162/JEEA.2007.5.5.885}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persecution of Jews|Persecution of European Jews]] may have fallen disproportionately on people of lower intelligence.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;Wade, Nicholas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/03gene.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=efcc603583e17b54&amp;ex=1275451200&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss "Researchers Say Intelligence and Diseases May Be Linked in Ashkenazic Genes"], ''The New York Times'', June 3, 2005. Retrieved February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the genetic explanations===
In medieval Ashkenazi society, wealth, social status, and occupation were largely inherited. The wealthy had more children than the poor, but it was difficult for people born into a poor social class to advance or enter a new occupation. Leading families held their positions for centuries. Without upward social mobility, genes for greater talent at calculation or languages would likely have had little effect on reproductive success. So, it is not clear that mathematical and verbal talent were the prime factors for success in the occupations to which Jews were limited at the time. Social connections, social acumen, willingness to take risks, and access to capital through both skill and [[nepotism]] could have played at least as great a role.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt;

On the other hand, controversial research by [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has indicated that social mobility has been consistently low but non-negligible throughout history, and that social mobility was no lower in previous centuries than it has been in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Gregory|authorlink=Gregory Clark (economist)|title=[[The Son Also Rises (book)|The Son Also Rises]]|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic studies have suggested that most Ashkenazi Jewish congenital diseases arose from [[genetic drift]] after a [[population bottleneck]], a phenomenon known as the [[founder effect]], rather than from [[selective pressure]] favoring those genes as called for by the Cochran, ''et al.'' hypothesis.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bray2010 /&gt; To take one example, the mutation responsible for Tay–Sachs disease arose in the 8th or 9th century, when the Ashkenazi Jewish population in Europe was small, just before they spread throughout Europe. The high frequency of this disease among Ashkenazi Jews today might simply be the result of their not marrying outside their group, not because the gene for Tay–Sachs disease confers an advantage that more than makes up for the fact that the disease usually kills by age three.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt; However, an examination of the frequencies and locations of the genes for 21 Ashkenazi Jewish congenital diseases suggested that six of them do appear to result from selective pressure, including the mutation for Tay–Sachs disease.&lt;ref name=Bray2010 /&gt; There is still no evidence one way or the other about whether the reason for this is increased intelligence for commercial skills or something else.&lt;ref name=wills /&gt;

Evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] suggested that "[t]he most obvious test of a genetic cause of Ashkenazi the advantage would be a cross-adoption study that measured the adult IQ of children with Ashkenazi biological parents and gentile adoptive parents, and vice versa", but noted, "No such study exists, so [Cochran]'s evidence is circumstantial."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. "[http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2006_06_17_thenewrepublic.html The Lessons of the Ashkenazism: Groups and Genes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105135315/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2006_06_17_thenewrepublic.html |date=January 5, 2008 }}". ''The New Republic''. Posted June 17, 2006. Retrieved August 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural explanations==
Another type of explanation for higher intelligence in Ashkenazi Jews is differences in culture which tend to promote cultivation of intellectual talents.

For example, after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 [[Common Era|CE]], [[Jewish culture]] replaced its emphasis on ritual with an emphasis on study and scholarship.&lt;ref name=Botticini /&gt; Unlike the surrounding cultures, most Jews, even farmers,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; were taught to read and write in childhood. [[Talmud]]ic [[scholarly method|scholarship]] became a leading key to social status. The Talmudic tradition may have made the Jews well suited for financial and managerial occupations at a time when these occupations provided new opportunities.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt;

The emphasis on scholarship came before the Jews turned from agriculture to urban occupations. This suggests that premise #3 of Cochran et al. may have the causal direction backward: mastery of written language enabled Jews to thrive in finance and international trade rather than the other way around.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt; Similar cultural traditions continue to the present day, possibly providing a non-genetic explanation for contemporary Ashkenazi Jews' high IQs and prevalence in intellectual fields.&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt;

Other proposed cultural explanations:

* Talmudic scholarship was so respected in European Ashkenazi Jewish ghetto society that outstanding (though often poor) scholars were highly sought after as husbands for the daughters of even the wealthiest merchants, who could afford to support the married couples. A father who made it possible for the groom to devote himself to Talmud study was performing a mitzvah. This attitude provided selection pressure in favor of intellectual aptitude, and enhanced social mobility.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanner2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ralph E. S. Tanner |title=Chance and Probability: The Limitations of the Social Sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2KYnWnAlkkC&amp;pg=PA96 |year=2011 |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=978-81-8069-729-6 |pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ashkenazi Jews (as well as other ethnic Jews) were marginalized by pogroms and discrimination, and therefore had to put more effort to survive and be outstanding.&lt;ref name="JaušovecPahor2017"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Norbert Jaušove |author2=Anja Pahor|title=Increasing Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Go3fDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|date=30 January 2017|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-813430-6|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The rise of [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] created demand for educated professionals with intellectual skills. According to Eckstein and Botticini, between 750 and 900 AD, nearly all the Jews in Mesopotamia and Persia left farming and moved to the big cities of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], where they specialized in jobs more lucrative than farming. Jews had a clear advantage in these professions as a result of centuries of literacy.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Red_and_blue_pill.jpg|thumb|In the film ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo is offered the option of consuming either [[Red pill and blue pill|the red pill or the blue pill]]. Picking the red pill would result in the truth of Neo's world being revealed to him, while picking the blue pill would allow him to continue in [[ignorance]]. Thus, Neo must judge the merits of the possible outcomes of his choice.]]

'''Choice''' involves [[decision making]]. It can include [[judging]] the merits of multiple [[wikt:option|option]]s and [[wikt:select|select]]ing one or more of them. One can make a choice between imagined options ("What would I do if...?") or between real options followed by the corresponding action. For example, a traveller might choose a route for a journey based on the [[preference]] of arriving at a given destination as soon as possible. The preferred (and therefore chosen) route can then follow from information such as the length of each of the possible routes, traffic conditions, etc.  The arrival at a choice can include more complex motivators such as [[cognition]], [[instinct]], and [[feeling]].

Simple choices might include what to eat for dinner or what to wear on a Saturday morning – choices that have relatively low-impact on the chooser's [[personal life|life]] overall.  More complex choices might involve (for example) what candidate to vote for in an election, what profession to pursue, a life partner, etc. – choices based on multiple influences and having larger ramifications.

Freedom of choice is generally cherished, whereas a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing, and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion, regret of the alternatives not taken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;&lt;ref&gt;
Barry Schwartz: ''[[The Paradox of Choice]]'' (2004)
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the illusion that choosing an object or a course, necessarily leads to the control of that object or course, can cause [[psychological]] problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Types==
There are four main types of decisions, although they can be expressed in different ways. [[Brian Tracy]] breaks them down into:&lt;ref&gt;''Time Power'', Brian Tracy, 2007, pg. 153 {{ISBN|0-8144-7470-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Command decisions, which can only be made by you, as the "Commander in Chief"; or owner of a company.
# Delegated decisions, which may be made by anyone, such as the [[color of the bike shed]], and should be delegated, as the decision must be made but the choice is inconsequential.
# Avoided decisions, where the outcome could be so severe that the choice should not be made, as the consequences can not be recovered from if the wrong choice is made. This will most likely result in negative actions, such as death.
# "No-brainer" decisions, where the choice is so obvious that only one choice can reasonably be made.
A fifth type, however, or fourth if avoided and "no-brainer" decisions are combined as one type, is the [[collaborative]] decision, which should be made in consultation with, and by agreement of others. Collaborative Decision Making revolutionized air-traffic safety by not deferring to the [[Pilot in command|captain]] when a lesser crew member becomes aware of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.fly.faa.gov/|title=CDM CDM - Collaborative Decision Making|author=|date=|website=cdm.fly.faa.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of looking at decisions focuses on the thought mechanism used, is the decision:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/types-of-decision-making.html|title=Types of decision making - an overview|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rational
* Intuitive
* Recognition based
* Combination

Recognizing that "type" is an imprecise term, an alternate way to classify types of choices is to look at outcomes and the impacted entity. For example, using this approach three types of choices would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-solutions.com/types_of_decision_making.html|title=Types of Decision Making|work=decision-making-solutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business 
* Personal
* Consumer

In this approach, establishing the types of choices makes it possible to identify the related decisions that will influence and constrain a specific choice as well as be influenced and constrained by another choice.

There are many "executive decision maker" products available, such as the decision wheels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/decision-wheels.html|title=A variety of decision wheels!|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Magic 8-Ball]], which randomly produce yes/no or other "decisions" for someone who cannot make up their mind or just wants to delegate.

A [[ouija]] board is also a delegated decision.

As a moral principle, decisions should be made by those most affected by the decision, but this is not normally applied to persons in jail, who might likely make a decision other than to remain in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethical leadership in schools'', Kenneth A. Strike, 2006, pg. 5 {{ISBN|1-4129-1351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gates]] cited this principle in allowing photographs of returning war dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/02/pentagon_report.html|title=Pentagon ends photo ban on war dead return|author=|date=|website=boston.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluability in economics==
When choosing between options one must make judgments about the quality of each option's attributes. For example, if one is choosing between candidates for a job, the quality of relevant attributes such as previous work experience, college or high school GPA, and letters of recommendation will be judged for each option and the decision will likely be based on these attribute judgments. However, each attribute has a different level of ''evaluability'', that is, the extent to which one can use information from that attribute to make a judgment.

An example of a highly evaluable attribute is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good. Because the distribution of scores on this attribute is relatively well known it is a highly evaluable attribute. Compare the SAT score to a poorly evaluable attribute, such as the number of hours spent doing homework. Most employers would not know what 10,000 hours spent doing homework means because they have no idea of the distribution of scores of potential workers in the population on this attribute.

As a result, evaluability can cause preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations. For example, Hsee, [[George Loewenstein]], Blount &amp; Bazerman (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Hsee, C.K., Loewenstein, G.F., Blount, S., Bazerman, M.H. (1999). Preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations of option: A review and theoretical analysis. Psychological Bulletin 125(5), 576–590.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at how people choose between options when they are directly compared because they are presented at the same time or when they cannot be compared because one is only given a single option. The canonical example is a hiring decision made about two candidates being hired for a programming job. Subjects in an experiment were asked to give a starting salary to two candidates, Candidate J and Candidate S. However, some viewed both candidates at the same time (joint evaluation), whereas others only viewed one candidate (separate evaluation). Candidate J had experience of 70 KY programs, and a GPA of 2.5, whereas Candidate S had experience of 10 KY programs and a GPA of 3.9. The results showed that in joint evaluation both candidates received roughly the same starting salary from subjects, who apparently thought a low GPA but high experience was approximately equal to a high GPA but low experience. However, in the separate evaluation, subjects paid Candidate S, the one with the high GPA, substantially more money. The explanation for this is that KY programs is an attribute that is difficult to evaluate and thus people cannot base their judgment on this attribute in separate evaluation.

Personal factors determine food choice. They are [[preference]], [[association (psychology)|associations]], [[habit (psychology)|habits]], [[ethnic heritage]], [[tradition]], [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social pressure]], [[emotion|emotional comfort]], [[availability]], [[convenience]], [[economy]], [[image]], [[medical conditions]], and [[nutrition]].

==Number of options and paradox==
A number of research studies in economic psychology have focused on how individual behavior differs when the choice set size (the number of choices to choose from) is low versus when it is high. Of particular interest is whether individuals are more likely to purchase a product from a large versus a small choice set. Currently, the effect of choice set size on the probability of a purchase is unclear. In some cases, large choice set sizes discourage individuals from making a choice&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar and Lepper.&lt;/ref&gt; and in other cases it either encourages them or has no effect.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Norwood, Lusk, Arunachalam, and Henneberry.&lt;/ref&gt; One study compared the allure of more choice to the tyranny of too much choice. Individuals went virtual shopping in different stores that had a randomly determined set of choices ranging from 4 to 16, with some being good choices and some being bad. Researchers found a stronger effect for the allure of more choice. However, they speculate that due to random assignment of number of choices and goodness of those choices, many of the shops with fewer choices included zero or only one option that was reasonably good, which may have made it easier to make an acceptable choice when more options were available.&lt;ref&gt;White, C. M., &amp; Hoffrage, U. (2009). Testing the tyranny of too much choice against the allure of more choice. Psychology &amp; Marketing, 26(3), 280-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that while greater choice has the potential to improve a person's welfare, sometimes there is such a thing as too much choice. For example, in one experiment involving a choice of free soda, individuals explicitly requested to choose from six as opposed to 24 sodas, where the only benefit from the smaller choice set would be to reduce the cognitive burden of the choice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A recent study supports this research, finding that human services workers indicated preferences for scenarios with limited options over extensive-options scenarios. As the number of choices within the extensive-options scenarios increased, the preference for limited options increased as well.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D. D., DiGennaro Reed, F. D., Chok, J., &amp; Brozyna, G. A. (2011). The 'tyranny of choice': Choice overload as a possible instance of effort discounting. The Psychological Record, 61(4), 547-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain why choice can demotivate someone from a purchase have focuses on two factors. One assumes that perusing a larger number of choices imposes a cognitive burden on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood&lt;/ref&gt; The other assumes that individuals can experience [[regret (emotion)|regret]] if they make a suboptimal choice, and sometimes avoid making a choice to avoid experiencing regret.&lt;ref&gt;Irons and Hepburn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research has expanded on [[choice overload]], suggesting that there is a [[paradox of choice]]. As increasing options are available, three problems emerge. First, there is the issue of gaining adequate information about the choices in order to make a decision. Second, having more choices leads to an escalation of expectation. When there are increased options, people’s standards for what is an acceptable outcome rise; in other words, choice “spoils you.” Third, with many options available, people may come to believe they are to blame for an unacceptable result because with so many choices, they should have been able to pick the best one. If there is one choice available, and it ends up being disappointing, the world can be held accountable. When there are many options and the choice that one makes is disappointing, the individual is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2000). Self-determination: The tyranny of freedom. American Psychologist, 55(1), 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a recent meta-analysis of the literature on choice overload calls such studies into question (Scheibehenne, Greigeneder, and Todd, 2010). In many cases, researchers have found no effect of choice set size on people's beliefs, feelings, and behavior. Indeed, overall, the effect of "too many options" is minimal at best.

While it might be expected that it is preferable to keep one’s options open, research has shown that having the opportunity to revise one’s decisions leaves people less satisfied with the decision outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Daniel T., Ebert, Jane E. J. (2002). Decisions and revisions: The affective forecasting of changeable outcomes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 82(4). 503-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study found that participants experienced higher regret after having made a reversible decision. The results suggest that reversible decisions cause people to continue to think about the still relevant choice options, which might increase dissatisfaction with the decision and regret.&lt;ref&gt;Bullens, L., van Harreveld, F., &amp; Förster, J. (2011). Keeping one's options open: The detrimental consequences of decision reversibility. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 47(4), 800-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual personality plays a significant role in how individuals deal with large choice set sizes. Psychologists have developed a personality test that determines where an individual lies on the satisficer-maximizer spectrum. A maximizer is one who always seeks the very best option from a choice set, and may anguish after the choice is made as to whether it was indeed the best. Satisficers may set high standards but are content with a good choice, and place less priority on making the best choice. Due to this different approach to decision-making, maximizers are more likely to avoid making a choice when the choice set size is large, probably to avoid the anguish associated with not knowing whether their choice was optimal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; One study looked at whether the differences in choice satisfaction between the two are partially due to a difference in willingness to commit to one’s choices. It found that maximizers reported a stronger preference for retaining the ability to revise choices. Additionally, after making a choice to buy a poster, satisficers offered higher ratings of their chosen poster and lower ratings of the rejected alternatives. Maximizers, however, were less likely to change their impressions of the posters after making their choice which left them less satisfied with their decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, E. A., Ehrlinger, J., &amp; Eibach, R. P. (2012). Failing to commit: Maximizers avoid commitment in a way that contributes to reduced satisfaction. Personality And Individual Differences, 52(1), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximizers are less happy in life, perhaps due to their obsession with making optimal choices in a society where people are frequently confronted with choice.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that maximizers reported significantly less [[life satisfaction]], happiness, optimism, and self-esteem, and significantly more regret and depression, than did satisficers. In regards to buying products, maximizers were less satisfied with consumer decisions and were more regretful. They were also more likely to engage in social comparison, where they analyze their relative social standing among their peers, and to be more affected by social comparisons in which others appeared to be in higher standing than them. For example, maximizers who saw their peer solve puzzles faster than themselves expressed greater doubt about their own abilities and showed a larger increase in negative mood.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Ward, A., Monterosso, J., Lyubomirsky, S., White, K., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (2002). Maximizing versus satisficing: Happiness is a matter of choice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(5) 1178-97.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people who refrain from taking better choices through drugs or other forms of escapism tend to be much happier in life.

Others{{Who|date=May 2013}} say that there is never too much choice and that there is a difference between happiness and satisfaction: a person who tries to find better decisions will often be dissatisfied, but not necessarily unhappy since his attempts at finding better choices did improve his lifestyle (even if it wasn't the ''best decision'' he will continually try to ''incrementally improve'' the decisions he takes).

[[Choice architecture]] is the process of encouraging people to make good choices through grouping and ordering the decisions in a way that maximizes successful choices and minimizes the number of people who become so overwhelmed by complexity that they abandon the attempt to choose.  Generally, success is improved by presenting the smaller or simpler choices first, and by choosing and promoting sensible default options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sheena Iyengar |title=The Art of Choosing |publisher=Twelve |location= |year=2010 |pages=208–213 |isbn=0-446-50410-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to identity==
[[File:Headresser.jpg|thumb|Choosing a hairstyle.]]
Certain choices, as personal preferences, can be central to expressing one's concept of [[self-identity]] or values.  In general, the more utilitarian an item, the less the choice says about a person's self-concept.  Purely functional items, such as a [[fire extinguisher]], may be chosen solely for function alone, but non-functional items, such as music, clothing fashions, or home decorations, may instead be chosen to express a person's concept of self-identity or associated values.&lt;ref&gt;

Both the [[Imperial unit|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|United States customary]] [[systems of measurement]] derive from earlier [[English units|English systems]] used in the Middle Ages, that were the result of a combination of the local [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] units inherited from German tribes and [[Ancient Roman weights and measures|Roman units]] brought by [[William the Conqueror]] after the [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066.

Having this shared heritage, the two systems are quite similar, but there are differences. The US customary system is based on English systems of the 18th century, while the Imperial system was defined in 1824, after [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|American independence]].

==Volume==

Volume may be measured either in terms of units of cubic length or with specific volume units. The units of cubic length (the cubic inch, cubic foot, cubic mile, etc.) are the same in the imperial and US customary systems but with the specific units of volume (the [[bushel]], [[gallon]], [[fluid ounce]], etc.) they differ. The US customary system has one set of units for fluids and another set for dry goods. The imperial system has only one set defined independently of and subdivided differently from its US counterparts.

By the end of the eighteenth century various systems of volume measurement were in use throughout the British Empire. Wine was measured with [[English wine cask units|units]] based on the [[wine gallon|Queen Anne's gallon]] of 231 cubic inches (3.785&amp;nbsp;L). Beer was measured with [[English brewery cask units|units]] based on an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches (4.621&amp;nbsp;L). Grain was measured with the [[Winchester measure]] with a gallon of approximately 268.8 cubic inches (one eighth of a Winchester bushel or 4.405&amp;nbsp;L). In 1824 these were replaced with a single system based on the imperial gallon.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wine gallons, however, continued to be used for tax purposes in the UK until the late 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Originally defined as the volume of {{convert|10|lb|kg|1|lk=in}} of distilled water (under certain conditions),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The water was to be weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at {{convert|30|inHg|0|lk=in}} at a temperature of {{convert|62|°F|°C|0|lk=in}}. In 1963 these conditions were redefined such that the water was to have a density of {{val|0.998859|u=g/mL}} and to be weighed in air of density {{val|0.001217|u=g/mL}} against weights of density 8.136&amp;nbsp;g/mL.&lt;/ref&gt; then redefined by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]] to be exactly {{val|4.54609|u=L}} (277.4&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in), the imperial gallon is close in size to the old ale gallon&lt;!-- 1.6243% smaller --&gt;.

The Winchester measure was made obsolete in the British Empire but remained in use in the US.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally defined as the volume of a cylinder {{convert|18+1/2|in}} in diameter and {{convert|8|in}} deep, the Winchester bushel was redefined in the US as {{val|2150.42}} cubic inches.&lt;/ref&gt; The Winchester bushel was replaced with an imperial bushel of 8 imperial gallons.  The subdivisions of the bushel were maintained. As with US dry measures the imperial system divides the bushel into 4 pecks, 8 gallons, 32 quarts or 64 pints. Thus all of these imperial measures are about 3% larger than their US dry measure counterparts.

Fluid measure is not as straightforward. The American colonists adopted a system based on the 231-cubic-inch wine gallon for all fluid purposes. This became the US fluid gallon. Both the imperial and US fluid gallon are divided into 4 quarts, 8 pints or 32 [[Gill (unit)|gills]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gill is no longer in common use.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whereas the US gill is divided into 4 US fluid ounces, the imperial gill is divided into 5 imperial fluid ounces. So whilst the imperial gallon, quart, pint and gill are about 20% larger than their US fluid measure counterparts, the fluid ounce is about 4% smaller.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The now rarely used [[apothecaries' system]] of fluid measures further divides the fluid ounce into 8 [[dram (unit)|fluid drams]] or 480 [[minim (unit)|minims]]. Also in the imperial system there is a fluid scruple of 20 minims which is absent from the US customary system. Like the fluid ounce the dram and minim are about 4% smaller in the imperial system.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that one [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois ounce]] of water has an approximate volume of one imperial fluid ounce at 62&amp;nbsp;°F (16.67&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref group=note&gt;160 imperial fluid ounces is equivalent to one imperial gallon, which is the approximate volume of 10 pounds or 160 avoirdupois ounces of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;/ref&gt; This convenient fluid-ounce-to-avoirdupois-ounce relation does not exist in the US system.

One noticeable comparison between the imperial system and the US system is between some Canadian and American beer bottles. Many Canadian brewers package beer in a 12-imperial-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 341&amp;nbsp;mL each. American brewers package their beer in 12-US-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 355&amp;nbsp;mL each. This results in the Canadian bottles being labelled as 11.5&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz in US units when imported into the United States. Because Canadian beer bottles predate the adoption of the Metric System in that country, they are still sold and labelled in Canada as 341&amp;nbsp;mL. Canned beer in Canada is sold and labelled in 355&amp;nbsp;mL cans, and when exported to the US are labelled as 12&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz.

==Length==
The international [[yard]] is defined as exactly 0.9144 [[metre]]s. This definition was agreed by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand through the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959.

The US survey [[foot (unit)|foot]] and survey mile have been maintained as separate units for surveying purposes to avoid the accumulation of error that would follow replacing them with the international versions, particularly with [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s. (The choice of unit for [[surveying]] purposes is based on the unit used when the [[Earth ellipsoid|overall framework]] or [[geodetic datum]] for the region was established, so that - for example - much of the former British empire still uses the Clarke foot for surveying.) The US survey foot is defined so that 1 metre is exactly 39.37&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]es, making the international foot of 0.3048&amp;nbsp;metres exactly two parts per million shorter. This is a difference of just over 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm or a little over one eighth of an inch per mile.

The main units of length (inch, foot, yard and international [[mile]]) were the same in the US, though the US rarely uses some of the intermediate units, such as the [[chain (unit)|(surveyor's) chain]] (22&amp;nbsp;yards) and the [[furlong]] (220&amp;nbsp;yards).

At one time the definition of the [[nautical mile]] was based on the sphere whose surface is the same as the Clarke Ellipsoid.  In the US, the full value of 1853.256 metres was used, but in the Commonwealth, this was rounded to 6080&amp;nbsp;feet (1853.184&amp;nbsp;m). These have been replaced by the international version, which rounds the sixtieth part of the 45° to the nearest metre, as 1852 metres.

==Weight and mass==
[[File:English mass units graph.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|Relation of English mass weights to one another]]
Traditionally, both Britain and the US used three different weight systems:  [[troy weight]] for precious metals, [[avoirdupois]] weight for most other purposes and [[apothecaries' weight]] for medicines.  However, apothecaries' weight has now been superseded by the metric system.

One important difference is the widespread use in Britain of the [[stone (weight)|stone]] of 14 pounds ({{val|6.35029318|u=kg}}) for body weight. This unit is not used in the United States, although its influence was seen in the practice, until World War II, of selling [[flour]] by a barrel of 196 pounds (14 stone). Another difference arose when Britain abolished the ''[[troy pound]]'' ({{val|373.2417216|u=g}}) on January 6, 1879, &lt;!-- should this be 1 Jan? It's in Weights and Measures Act of 1878 --&gt;leaving only the ''[[troy ounce]]'' ({{val|31.1034768|u=g}}) and its [[decimal]] subdivisions, whereas the troy pound (of 12 troy ounces) and [[pennyweight]] are still legal in the United States, although no longer widely used.

In all the systems, the fundamental unit is the [[pound (mass)|pound]] (lb), and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it. The tables of imperial troy mass and apothecaries' mass are the same as the corresponding United States tables, except for the British spelling "drachm" in the table of apothecaries' mass. The table of imperial avoirdupois mass is the same as the United States table up to 1 pound, but above that point the tables differ.

The imperial system has a hundredweight, defined as eight stone or 112&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|50.80234544|u=kg}}), whereas a US hundredweight is 100&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|45.359237|u=kg}}). In both systems, 20 hundredweights make a [[ton]]. In the US, the terms ''[[long ton]]'' ({{val|2240|u=lb}}, {{val|1016.0469088|u=kg}}) and ''[[short ton]]'' ({{val|2000|u=lb}}; {{val|907.18474|u=kg}}) are used to distinguish them. The term ''metric ton'' is also used to denote a [[tonne]] ({{val|1000|u=kg}}, {{val|2204.622|u=lb}}), which is about 2% less than the long ton.

The '''conflict tactics scale''' ('''CTS'''), created by [[Murray A.

the National Violence Against Women Survey (1998), which, according to Straus, used a "feminist version" of the CTS in order to minimize data on female perpetration of [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.breakingthescience.org/StrausSaysTjadenThoennesBiased.php | title=Straus Says National Violence Against Women Survey is Biased | last=Rosenthal | first=Mark B. | date=April 4, 2005 | publisher= Breaking the Science | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neglect | volume=33 | issue=2 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | pages=84–93}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major international survey to use the CTS was the 2006 International Dating Violence Study, which investigated IPV amongst 13,601 college students across thirty-two different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=March 2008 | title=Dominance and symmetry in partner violence by male and female university students in 32 nations | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID41-PR41-Dominance-symmetry-In-Press-07.pdf | journal=Children and Youth Services Review | volume=30 | issue=3 | pages=252–275 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 article in the ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence'', Jennifer Langhinrichsen-Rohling listed the CTS amongst the most important advances in the field of IPV research, stating it "was revolutionary because it allowed researchers to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] study events that had often been ignored culturally and typically took place in private."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling | first1=Jennifer | date=January 2005 | title=Top 10 Greatest "Hits": Important Findings and Future Directions for Intimate Partner Violence Research | url=http://rzukausk.home.mruni.eu/wp-content/uploads/Intimate-Partner-Violence-Research.pdf | journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume=20 | issue=1 | page=108 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1177/0886260504268602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the CTS is one of the most widely criticized domestic violence measurement instruments due to its exclusion of context variables and motivational factors in understanding acts of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobash | first1=Russel P. | last2=Dobash | first2=R. Emerson | date=May 2004 | title=Women's Violence to Men in Intimate Relationships: Working on a Puzzle | url=http://www.brown.uk.com/domesticviolence/dobash.pdf | journal=British Journal of Criminology | volume=44 | issue=3 | pages=324–349 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1093/crimin/azh026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Colarossi | first1=Linda | date=May 2004 | title=A Response to Danis &amp; Lockhart: What Guides Social Work Knowledge About Violence Against Women? | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5175/JSWE.2005.200400418#.VEy0bWcfz4Y | journal=Journal of Social Work Education | volume=41 | issue=1 | page=151 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.5175/JSWE.2005.200400418}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute of Justice]] cautions that the CTS may not be appropriate for IPV research "because it does not measure control, coercion, or the motives for conflict tactics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/intimate-partner-violence/measuring.htm | title= Measuring Intimate Partner (Domestic) Violence | publisher=[[National Institute of Justice]] | date=May 12, 2010 | accessdate= May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The scales are based on the premise that [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] is an inevitable aspect of all human association, but that the use of [[coercion]] (including force and violence) as a conflict-resolution tactic is harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=February 1979 | title=Measuring intra family conflict and violence: The Conflict Tactics (CT) Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS41%20(CTS2x-Abridged).pdf | journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume=41 | issue=1 | page=75 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.2307/351733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus190&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor1-first=Nicky Ali | editor1-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=190 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTS focuses on "conflict tactics" – the method used to advance one's own interest within a conflict – as a behavior, and measures the conflict tactic behaviors of both the respondent and their partner/primary caregiver. However, the CTS "deliberately excludes attitudes, emotions, and cognitive appraisal of the behaviors" measured. This is because many victims of IPV do not see themselves as suffering abuse, and as such, their cognitive appraisal of their situation can affect the measurements of the CTS. Straus explains that the "discrepancy between the behavior and the cognitive appraisal of the behavior is important for understanding family violence and for designing programs of prevention and treatment. However, it is possible to identify the discrepancy only if there is an instrument such as the CTS which obtains the behavioral data."&lt;ref name=Straus191&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor1-first=Nicky Ali | editor1-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=191 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CTS-based study would ideally include data from respondents and their partners/primary caregivers in order to investigate the degree of symmetry or asymmetry between their responses. The CTS can be administered through an in-person interview, telephone interview, self-administered questionnaire, and/or computer-administered questionnaire.

===Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2)===
The revised CTS2 measures a total of 39 behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/research/screening.shtml | title=Screening Measures for Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Physical Assault | last=Acierno | first=Ron | publisher=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center, [[Medical University of South Carolina]] | date= 2000 | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these behaviors, or "items", is divided into five categories: "Negotiation", "Psychological Aggression", "Physical Assault", "Sexual Coercion" and "Injury." Each of the five categories is then further subdivided into two subscales: "Negotiation" is subdivided into "Cognitive" and "Emotional", while the other four categories are subdivided into "Minor" and "Severe." There are six items in "Negotiation", eight in "Psychological Aggression," twelve in "Physical Assault," seven in "Sexual Coercion," and six in "Injury."&lt;ref name=CTS2&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | last2=Hamby | first2=Sherry L. | last3=Boney-McCoy | first3=Susan | last4=Sugarman | first4=David B. | date=May 1996 | title=The Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2): Development and Preliminary Psychometric Data | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS15.pdf | journal=Journal of Family Issues | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=308–309 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1177/019251396017003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples from each category include:

* ''Negotiation:'' "I showed I cared about my partner even though we disagreed" (emotional); "Suggested a compromise to a disagreement" (cognitive).
* ''Psychological Aggression:'' "Shouted or yelled at my partner" (minor); "Threatened to hit or throw something at my partner" (severe).
* ''Physical Assault:'' "Slapped my partner" (minor); "Kicked my partner" (severe)
* ''Sexual Coercion:'' "Insisted on sex when my partner did not want to (but did not use physical force)" (minor); "Used force (like hitting, holding down, or using a weapon) to make my partner have sex" (severe)
* ''Injury:'' "Had a sprain, bruise, or small cut because of a fight with my partner" (minor); "Needed to see a doctor because of a fight with my partner, but I didn't" (severe).&lt;ref name=CTS2/&gt;

CTS2 questions are presented in pairs. The first question in the pair asks respondents to indicate how often they carried out each item, in a range from "never" to "more than 20 times," in the referent period. The second asks how often the partner carried out each item within the same referent period. Default referent periods are usually 12 months, but other spans of time can be used.&lt;ref name=Straus191/&gt; Subscales measuring the degree of severity of "less severe" and "more severe" behaviors are included for all CTS scales, "based on the presumed greater harm resulting from acts in the severe subscale."&lt;ref name=Straus191/&gt; The severity of behaviors can also be measured by analyzing the frequency of the acts and by whether an injury was reported by the respondent.

===CTSPC===
The CTSPC (parent-child relationships) has scales to measure:
* physical assault (with subscales for [[corporal punishment]] and physical abuse),
* psychological aggression,
* non-violent [[discipline]] techniques.
The CTSPC also includes supplementary questions on instances of neglect, sexual abuse, and discipline in the past week.&lt;ref name=Straus1998 /&gt;

===Scoring===
There are many ways to score the CTS.&lt;ref name=Douglas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=July 23, 2004 | title=Scoring the CTS2 and CTSPC | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS28a3.pdf | journal=Family Research Laboratory, University of New Hampshire | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common scoring methods include:

* ''Prevalence'': Results in the percentage of respondents who reported being a victim of or perpetrating an item (or items) one or more times.&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;
* ''Frequency'': Results in the number of times an item occurred in the past year. A limitation of this score is that, for general population samples, "the distribution is so skewed that the [[mean]] is not an appropriate measure of central tendency." However, a sample of known offenders or victims will have a much higher frequency score "that can be very useful for measuring the chronicity of maltreatment."&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;
* ''Severity level and mutuality types'': The severity level classifies each case into three categories: "none", "minor only", or "severe". The mutuality types classify each case as "respondent only", "partner only", or "both". Straus writes "the mutuality types may be particularly useful in couples therapy because over a hundred studies have found that when there is violence, 50 percent or more of the time it is by both partners."&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Archer | first1=John | date=September 2000 | title=Sex Differences in Aggression between Heterosexual Partners: A Meta-Analytic Review | url=http://www.batteredmen.com/ArcherSexDifferencesMeta-AnalyticReviewf2000.pdf | journal=Psychological Bulletin | volume=126 | issue=5 | pages=651–680 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 | pmid=10989615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | last2=Ramirez | first2=Ignacio | date=July 2007 | title=Gender symmetry in prevalence, severity, and chronicity of physical aggression against dating partners by university students in Mexico and USA. | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID12F.pdf | journal=Aggressive Behavior | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=281–290 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1002/ab.20199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the CTS argue it is an ineffective tool with which to measure IPV rate because, although it counts the number of acts of violence, it does not provide information about the context in which such acts occur (including the initiation, intention, history, or pattern of violence). Critics say such contexts cannot be divorced from the act itself, and therefore the CTS misrepresents the characteristics of violence between partners. Straus responds to this criticism by stating "the idea that the CTS physical assault scale is defective because it does not take into account the context, meaning, causes, and consequences of the violent acts is analogous to declaring a reading ability test invalid because it does not provide data on why a child reads poorly (such as limited exposure to books at home or test anxiety), or for not measuring the harmful effects of reading difficulty (such as low self-esteem or dropping out of school)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor-first=Nicky Ali | editor-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=194 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor-first=M.R. | editor-last=Walsh | title=Women, Men and Gender: Ongoing Debates | publisher=Yale University Press | location=New Haven | year=1997 | page=218 | chapter=Physical Assaults by Women Partners: A Major Social Problem | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB33.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael S. Kimmel|Michael Kimmel]] says of this argument, "such an analogy is utterly inadequate. It is more akin to a teacher who doesn't look at how far off the spelling mistakes are or whether there is a pattern in the mistakes that might point to a physiological problem like dyslexia or some other learning disability, as compared to academic laziness, and thus leaving the learning problems untouched and misdirecting funds away from towards punitive after-school programs for lazy students."&lt;ref name="kimmel"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | title = 'Gender symmetry' in domestic violence: a substantive and methodological research review | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 1332–1363 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/107780102237407 | date = November 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107780102237407 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016110040/http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common criticism is that the CTS carries ideological assumptions about domestic violence, such as the notion that partner violence is the result of an "argument" rather than an attempt to control one's partner.&lt;ref name="kimmel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/AR_ctscrit.pdf | title=Measuring the extent of woman abuse in intimate heterosexual relationships: a critique of the Conflict Tactics Scales | last1=DeKeseredy | first1= Walter S. | last2=Schwartz | first2=Martin D. | date=February 1998 | publisher=VAWnet.org | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the CTS asks about frequency only in the past twelve months and fails to detect ongoing systematic patterns of abuse.&lt;ref name="kimmel"/&gt; It also excludes incidents of violence that occur after separation and divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood |title= Claims about 'husband battering' |journal= DVIRC Newsletter | pages = 3–8 |publisher= Domestic Violence and Incest Resource Centre, Melbourne |date= Summer 1999  |url= http://www.xyonline.net/content/claims-about-husband-battering | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20Husband%20Battering.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The CTS also does not measure economic abuse, manipulation involving children, isolation, or intimidation – all common measures of violence from a victim-advocacy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf |title=Power and Control Wheel |publisher=National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence |accessdate=May 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314062136/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another methodological problem is that [[Inter-rater reliability|interobserver reliability]] (the likelihood that the two members of the measured [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] respond similarly) is near zero for tested husband and wife couples. That is, the chances of a given couple reporting similar answers about events they both experienced is no greater than chance.&lt;ref name="dobash"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobash | first1=Russel P. | last2=Dobash | first2=R. Emerson | last3=Wilson | first3=Margo | last4=Daly | first4=Martin | title=The myth of sexual symmetry in marital violence | journal=Social Problems | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=71–91 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] via [[JSTOR]] | doi = 10.2307/3096914 | jstor = 3096914 | date=February 1992 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3096914 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the most severe CTS items, husband-wife agreement is actually below chance: "On the item "beat up," concordance was nil: although there were respondents of both sexes who claimed to have administered beatings and respondents of both sexes who claimed to have been on the receiving end, there was not a single couple in which one party claimed to have administered and the other to have received such a beating."&lt;ref name="dobash" /&gt;

{{quote box|I am particularly fond of this example [the Linda problem] because I know that the [conjoint] statement is least probable, yet a little [[homunculus]] in my head continues to jump up and down, shouting at me—"but she can’t just be a bank teller; read the description."|[[Stephen J. Gould]]&lt;ref name="Gould (1988)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gould|first=Stephen J.|title=The Streak of Streaks|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1988/aug/18/the-streak-of-streaks/?pagination=false|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=25%|align=right}}

The most often-cited example of this fallacy originated with [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]].&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Kahneman 1982"&gt;Tversky, A. and Kahneman, D. (1982) "Judgments of and by representativeness". In D. Kahneman, P. Slovic &amp; A. Tversky (Eds.), ''Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt; Although the description and person depicted are fictitious, Amos Tversky's secretary at Stanford was named Linda Covington, and he named the famous character in the puzzle after her.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.''

Which is more probable?
# Linda is a bank teller.
# Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority of those asked chose option 2. However, the [[probability]] of two events occurring together (in "[[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone—formally, for two events ''A'' and ''B'' this inequality could be written as &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A \land B) \leq \Pr(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A \land B) \leq \Pr(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, even choosing a very low probability of Linda being a bank teller, say Pr(Linda is a bank teller) = 0.05 and a high probability that she would be a feminist, say Pr(Linda is a feminist) = 0.95, then, assuming [[statistical independence|independence]], Pr(Linda is a bank teller ''and'' Linda is a feminist)&amp;nbsp;= 0.05&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.95 or&amp;nbsp;0.0475, lower than Pr(Linda is a bank teller).

Tversky and Kahneman argue that most people get this problem wrong because they use a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] (an easily calculated) procedure called [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]] to make this kind of judgment: Option 2 seems more "representative" of Linda based on the description of her, even though it is clearly mathematically less likely.&lt;ref name="tk83"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2=Kahneman |first2=Daniel |date=October 1983 |title=Extension versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=293–315 |url=http://content2.apa.org/journals/rev/90/4/293 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223193247/http://content2.apa.org/journals/rev/90/4/293 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other demonstrations, they argued that a specific scenario seemed more likely because of representativeness, but each added detail would actually make the scenario less and less likely. In this way it could be similar to the [[misleading vividness]] or [[slippery slope]] fallacies. More recently Kahneman has argued that the conjunction fallacy is a type of [[extension neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, Daniel. (2000). "Evaluation by moments, past and future". In Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (Eds.). ''Choices, Values and Frames.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint versus separate evaluation==

In some experimental demonstrations, the conjoint option is evaluated separately from its basic option. In other words, one group of participants is asked to rank order the likelihood that Linda is a bank teller, a high school teacher, and several other options, and another group is asked to rank order whether Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement versus the same set of options (without "Linda is a bank teller" as an option). In this type of demonstration, different groups of subjects rank order Linda as a bank teller and active in the feminist movement more highly than Linda as a bank teller.&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt;

Separate evaluation experiments preceded the earliest joint evaluation experiments, and Kahneman and Tversky were surprised when the effect was still observed under joint evaluation.&lt;ref name="tk2011-15"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |title=Thinking, Fast and Slow |chapter=Linda: Less is More |year=2011 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn= |pages=156–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In separate evaluation, the term '''conjunction effect''' may be preferred.&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and [[Ralph Hertwig]] criticized the Linda problem on grounds such as the [[wording effect|wording]] and [[framing effect|framing]]. The question of the Linda problem may violate [[conversational maxim]]s in that people assume that the question obeys the maxim of relevance. Gigerenzer argues that some of the terminology used have [[polysemy|polysemous]] meanings, the alternatives of which he claimed were more "natural". He argues that the meaning of ''probable'' ("what happens frequently") corresponds to the mathematical probability people are supposed to be tested on, but the meanings of ''probable'' ("what is plausible" and "whether there is evidence") do not.&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=Gerd|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky|journal=Psychological Review|date=1996|volume=103|issue=3|pages=592–596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hertwig &amp; Gigerenzer (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertwig|first=Ralph|last2=Gigerenzer|first2=Gerd|title=The 'Conjunction Fallacy' Revisited: How Intelligent Inferences Look Like Reasoning Errors|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|year=1999|volume=12|issue=4|pages=275–305|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0771(199912)12:4&lt;275::aid-bdm323&gt;3.3.co;2-d}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "and" has even been argued to have relevant polysemous meanings.&lt;ref name="Mellers, Hertwig &amp; Kahneman (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mellers|first1=B.|last2=Hertwig|first2=R.|last3=Kahneman|first3=D.|title=Do frequency representations eliminate conjunction effects?

Many variations in wording of the Linda problem were studied by Tversky and Kahneman.&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt; If the first option is changed to obey conversational relevance, i.e., "Linda is a bank teller whether or not she is active in the feminist movement" the effect is decreased, but the majority (57%) of the respondents still commit the conjunction error.  If the probability is changed to frequency format (''see debiasing section below'') the effect is reduced or eliminated. However, studies exist in which indistinguishable conjunction fallacy rates have been observed with stimuli framed in terms of probabilities versus frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite journal|last1=Tentori|first1=Katya|last2=Bonini|first2=Nicolao|last3=Osherson|first3=Daniel|title=The conjunction fallacy: a misunderstanding about conjunction?|journal=Cognitive Science|date=2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=467–477|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2803_8}} Or: {{cite journal|last1=Wedell|first1=Douglas H.|last2=Moro|first2=Rodrigo|title=Testing boundary conditions for the conjunction fallacy: Effects of response mode, conceptual focus, and problem type|journal=Cognition|date=2008|volume=107|issue=1|pages=105–136|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.08.003|pmid=17927971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording criticisms may be less applicable to the conjunction effect in separate evaluation.{{vague|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1996)" /&gt; The "Linda problem" has been studied and criticized more than other types of demonstration of the effect (some described below).&lt;ref name="tk2011-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellers, Hertwig &amp; Kahneman (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahneman &amp; Tversky (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=On the reality of cognitive illusions.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1996|volume=103|issue=3|pages=582–591|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.582|pmid=8759048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an incentivized experimental study, it has been shown that the conjunction fallacy decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109001103|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2009|pages = 147–152|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|first = Jörg|last = Oechssler|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Roider|first3 = Patrick W.|last3 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that the conjunction fallacy becomes less prevalent when subjects are allowed to consult with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the conjunction fallacy in probability judgment: New experimental evidence regarding Linda|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825609001742|journal = Games and Economic Behavior|date = 2010|pages = 551–556|volume = 68|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.geb.2009.09.003|first = Gary|last = Charness|first2 = Edi|last2 = Karni|first3 = Dan|last3 = Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other demonstrations==

Policy experts were asked to rate the probability that the [[Soviet Union]] would invade [[Poland]], and the [[United States]] would break off [[diplomatic relations]], all in the following year. They rated it on average as having a 4% probability of occurring. Another group of experts was asked to rate the probability simply that the United States would break off relations with the Soviet Union in the following year. They gave it an average probability of only 1%.&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt;

In an experiment conducted in 1980, respondents were asked the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose [[Björn Borg]] reaches the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] finals in 1981. Please rank order the following outcomes from most to least likely.
* Borg will win the match
* Borg will lose the first set
* Borg will lose the first set but win the match
* Borg will win the first set but lose the match&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On average, participants rated "Borg will lose the first set but win the match" more likely than "Borg will lose the first set".&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt;

In another experiment, participants were asked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider a regular six-sided die with four green faces and two red faces. The die will be rolled 20 times and the sequence of greens (G) and reds (R) will be recorded. You are asked to select one sequence, from a set of three, and you will win $25 if the sequence you choose appears on successive rolls of the die.

# RGRRR
# GRGRRR
# GRRRRR&lt;/blockquote&gt;

65% of participants chose the second sequence, though option 1 is contained within it and is shorter than the other options. In a version where the $25 bet was only hypothetical the results did not significantly differ. Tversky and Kahneman argued that sequence 2 appears "representative" of a chance sequence&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt; (compare to the ''[[clustering illusion]]'').

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider another example: 
Which of the following events is most likely to occur within the next year?

1. The United States will withdraw all troops from Iraq.
2. The United States will withdraw all troops from Iraq and bomb North Korean nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The probability of the conjunctions is never greater than that of its conjuncts. Therefore, the first choice is more probable. No matter how unlikely it is that America will withdraw troops within the year from Iraq, it is even less likely they will do so ''and'' bomb nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conjunction Fallacy|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/conjunct.html#Answer|website=fallacyfiles.org|accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debiasing==

Drawing attention to set relationships, using [[frequentism|frequencies]] instead of probabilities and/or thinking [[venn diagram|diagrammatically]] sharply reduce the error in some forms of the conjunction fallacy.&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hertwig &amp; Gigerenzer (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellers, Hertwig &amp; Kahneman (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1991)" /&gt;

In one experiment the question of the Linda problem was reformulated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 100 persons who fit the description above (that is, Linda’s). How many of them are:&lt;/p&gt;
* Bank tellers?  __ of 100
* Bank tellers and active in the feminist movement?  __ of 100&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas previously 85% of participants gave the wrong answer (bank teller and active in the feminist movement), in experiments done with this questioning none of the participants gave a wrong answer.&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gigerenzer |first=G. |year=1991 |title=How to make cognitive illusions disappear: Beyond ‘heuristics and biases.’ |journal=European Review of Social Psychology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=83–115 |doi=10.1080/14792779143000033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were forced to use a mathematical approach and thus recognised the difference more easily.

However, in some tasks only based on frequencies, not on stories, that used clear logical formulations, conjunction fallacies continued to occur dominantly when the observed pattern of frequencies resembled a conjunction (only few exceptions).&lt;ref name="von Sydow (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Sydow|first=M. |year=2011 |title=The Bayesian Logic of Frequency-Based Conjunction Fallacies. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=119–139 |doi=10.1016/j.jmp.2010.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In topology, a branch of mathematics, a '''cosheaf''' with values in an [[∞-category]] ''C'' that admits colimits is a functor ''F'' from the category of open subsets of a topological space ''X'' (more precisely its [[nerve (category theory)|nerve]]) to ''C'' such that
*(1) The ''F'' of the empty set is the initial object.
*(2) For any increasing sequence &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; of open subsets with union ''U'', the canonical map &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim F(U_i) \to F(U)&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence.
*(3) &lt;math&gt;F(U \cup V)&lt;/math&gt; is the pushout of &lt;math&gt;F(U \cap V) \to F(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(U \cap V) \to F(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

The basic example is &lt;math&gt;U \mapsto C_*(U; A)&lt;/math&gt; where on the right is the [[singular chain complex]] of ''U'' with coefficients in an abelian group ''A''.

Example:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/282ynotes/LectureIX-NPD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If ''f'' is a continuous map, then &lt;math&gt;U \mapsto f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is a cosheaf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8705">'''Distinction bias''', a concept of [[decision theory]], is the tendency to view two options as more distinctive when evaluating them simultaneously than when evaluating them separately.

One writer has presented what he called "a simplistic view" of distinction bias: When asked if someone would like an apple, they may say "Yes". So, an apple is placed before them and they begin to eat it and are happy. But what if two apples were placed on the table - one was the one they would have happily eaten and the other which is slightly fresher looking. The individual will choose the fresher apple and eat it and be happy but if asked, "would you have enjoyed eating that other apple", they would likely say "No". Even though in the alternate, no-choice reality they were perfectly happy with the apple. Moreover, if presented with five apples on a table, they might examine each apple so that they would be sure they had the best one, even though the time spent making that decision would be wasted. The reason for this is that distinction bias causes individuals to "over-examine and over-value the differences between things as we scrutinize them."&lt;ref name="Real Decisions or Reflexive Nitpicking"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Jim|title=Real Decisions or Reflexive Nitpicking: Distinction Bias|url=http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2011/07/real-decisions-or-reflexive-nitpicking-distinction-bias.html|publisher=Our Founder|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hsee and Zhang ==
The concept of the distinction bias was advanced by Christopher K. Hsee and Jiao Zhang of the [[University of Chicago]] as an explanation for differences in evaluations of options between joint evaluation mode and separate evaluation mode (2004). Evaluation mode is a contextual feature in decision making. Joint evaluation mode is when options are evaluated simultaneously, and separate evaluation mode is when each option is evaluated in isolation (e.g., Hsee, 1998; Hsee &amp; Leclerc, 1998). Research shows that evaluation mode affects the evaluation of options, such that options presented simultaneously are evaluated differently from the same options presented separately.

Hsee and Zhang (2004) offered a number of potential explanations for this change in preferences from joint evaluation to separate evaluation, including the distinction bias. The distinction bias suggests that comparing two options, as done in joint evaluation, makes even small differences between options salient. In other words, viewing options simultaneously makes them seem more dissimilar than when viewing and evaluating each in isolation.

When predictions or choices are made, explained Hsee and Zhang in their 2004 paper, people are often in the joint evaluation (JE) mode but when people experience an event, they are often in the single evaluation (SE) mode. The 'utility function' of an attribute can vary between single evaluation and joint evaluation. When people in joint evaluation make predictions or decisions for events to be experienced in single evaluation, they often resort to their joint evaluation preferences rather than single evaluation preferences and over-predict the difference that different values of an attribute will lead their happiness in single evaluation. This over-prediction is referred to as the distinction bias.&lt;ref name="Hsee &amp; Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsee|first1=Christopher|last2=Zhang|first2=Jiao|title=Distinction Bias: Misprediction and Mischoice Due to Joint Evaluation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2004|volume=86|issue=5|pages=680–695|ssrn=929932|accessdate=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.680|pmid=15161394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and applications==
For example, when televisions are displayed next to each other on the sales floor, the difference in quality between two very similar, high-quality televisions may appear great. A consumer may pay a much higher price for the higher-quality television, even though the difference in quality is imperceptible when the televisions are viewed in isolation. Because the consumer will likely be watching only one television at a time, the lower-cost television would have provided a similar experience at a lower cost.

The same calculus can apply when one is choosing between a cheaper store-brand food product and a more expensive brand-name product. In many cases, the difference in taste between the two products would not be worth the difference in price. If the products were sampled in isolation, the difference in taste would be unnoticeable or negligible; consequently, the difference in price, not the difference in taste, ought to determine which choice the consumer makes. In 2010, a magazine asked consumers to try 12 brands of baked beans. Branston won the taste test, followed by Asda, Morrisons, and Heinz. The Morrisons beans, in other words, were preferred over the Heinz beans, even though, as it happened, they were half the price.&lt;ref name="How To Get Your Own Way"&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Get Your Own Way (Critical Thinking)|url=http://www.howtogetyourownway.com/biases/distinction_bias.html|website=How To Get Your Own Way|publisher=How To Get Your Own Way|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One writer has discussed the distinction bias in connection with such matters as choosing a job or a house. When making a choice between an interesting job that pays $60,000 a year and a boring job that pays $70,000 a year or a choice between two equally priced houses, one of them larger but farther from work, the average individual is likely to make false assumptions – for example, that $70,000 will make them feel exactly one-sixth better than $60,000, or that 4,000 square-foot house is one-third better than a 3,000 square-foot house. In reality, on average, we don't actually feel one-sixth better having the extra money or one-third better having the extra space. The more sensible approach, the writer advises in accordance with the research of Hsee and Zhang, is to avoid comparing two jobs, or houses, directly. Instead, consider each job, or house, individually and make an overall assessment of each one on its own, and then compare assessments, which allows them to make a choice that accurately predicts future experience.&lt;ref name="Spring"&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Avoid Choosing the Wrong Job or House: Fight the Distinction Bias|url=http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/05/how-to-avoid-choosing-wrong-job-or.php|publisher=Psyblog|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further studies==
In 2009, Margaret E. Brooks, Ashley M. Guidroz, and Madhura Chakrabarti reported on two studies in which they had examined the reactions of job applicants to alternative approaches to diversity in employment decisions. The applicants preferred the so-called holistic approaches, and the magnitude of their preference was considerably greater when both approaches were evaluated simultaneously. The researchers found that the results, which they viewed as important for "applicant reactions research, human resource decision making, and policy formation", were consistent with distinction bias.&lt;ref name="International Journal of Selection and Assessment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Margaret|last2=Guidroz|first2=Ashley M.|last3=Chakrabarti|first3=Madhura|title=Distinction Bias in Applicant Reactions to Using Diversity Information in Selection|journal=International Journal of Selection and Assessment|date=12 November 2009|volume=17|issue=4|pages=377–390|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2389.2009.00480.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{watergate|White House}}
'''Egil "Bud" Krogh Jr.''' (born August 3, 1939) is an American lawyer who became infamous as an official of the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] Administration and who was imprisoned for his part in the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate Affair]].  He is currently Senior Fellow on Ethics and Leadership at the [[Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress]] and Counselor to the Director at the [[School for Ethics and Global Leadership]].

==Education==
Krogh was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and raised in [[Seattle]], Washington; his father was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigrant. He graduated with highest honors from [[Principia College]], [[Elsah, Illinois]] in 1961. After service in the [[U.S. Navy]] as a communications officer aboard [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']] (1962–1965), he graduated from the [[University of Washington School of Law]] in 1968.

==Legal career==
He was employed by Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts and Hodge, the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] law firm of family friend [[John Ehrlichman]], and joined Ehrlichman in the counsel's office of Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign.  After Nixon was elected, Krogh helped with the arrangements for the [[inauguration]].  Krogh joined the Nixon [[White House]] as an advisor on the [[District of Columbia]] and later served as liaison to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]].  It was there he met [[G. Gordon Liddy]].

==Elvis Presley==
Because of his work regarding illegal drugs, Krogh managed the visit of [[Elvis Presley]] to the White House on December 21, 1970. Presley had arrived at the gate with a letter for President Nixon requesting a personal meeting to discuss how he could help the government fight the drug trade. The meeting took place and Nixon gave Presley an actual narcotics agent badge. Krogh wrote a book about these events: ''The Day Elvis Met Nixon'' (Pejama Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9640251-0-8}}).

==SIU==
Ehrlichman made Krogh head of the "Special Investigation Unit" in the White House, charged with investigating information given covertly to the press by administration staffers. Krogh and his associates were known familiarly as the "[[White House Plumbers|Plumbers]]"—a secret team of operatives charged with fixing "[[political leak|leaks]]." It was an unlikely choice: Krogh had a reputation as someone who obeyed the law so scrupulously that his friends gave him the ironic nickname "Evil Krogh". [[Theodore H. White|Theodore White]] would write "to put Egil Krogh in charge of a secret police operation was equivalent to making [[Frank Merriwell]] chief executive of a [[KGB]] squad." Krogh brought Liddy into his new office.

When the administration decided to pursue the [[Pentagon Papers]] leakers, it was Krogh who approved the September 1971 burglary of the office of [[Lewis Fielding]], the psychiatrist seeing [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. Liddy and [[E. Howard Hunt]] would commit the actual break-in. Ehrlichman, who himself went to prison for Watergate related crimes, would later write in his memoirs this was an example of "such doubtful personal judgment ... that it has to be said [Krogh] materially contributed to the demise of the Nixon administration."

Krogh's employment with the SIU was terminated when he refused to authorize a wiretap. On November 30, 1973, Krogh pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to violate Fielding's civil rights and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.  He was sentenced to two to six years in prison, though he served only four-and-a-half months.&lt;ref name=oped&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4273">{{Distinguish|Face-to-face interaction}}
The '''face-to-face''' relation ({{lang-fr|rapport de face à face}}) is a concept in the French [[philosopher]] [[Emmanuel Lévinas]]' thought on human sociality. It means that, ethically, people are responsible to one-another in the face-to-face encounter. Specifically, Lévinas says that the human face "orders and ordains" us. It calls the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] into “giving and serving” the Other.&lt;ref&gt;Lévinas, ''Ethics and Infinity'', 1985, pp. 95, 98, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marcus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxP92H6LFs8C&amp;dq= ''In Search of the Good Life: Emmanuel Levinas, Psychoanalysis and the Art of Living''], Karnac Books, 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Lévinas' phenomenological account of the "face-to-face" encounter serves as the basis for his [[ethics]] and the rest of his philosophy. For Lévinas, "Ethics is the first philosophy." Lévinas argues that the encounter of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] through the [[Face (sociological concept)|face]] reveals a certain poverty which forbids a reduction to [[identity (philosophy)|Sameness]] and, simultaneously, installs a responsibility for the Other in the [[Self (philosophy)|Self]].

Lévinas' account of the face-to-face encounter bears many similarities to [[Martin Buber]]'s "[[I and Thou]]" relation. Its influence is also particularly pronounced in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ethical writings. (However, some post-structuralist thinkers maintain that Derrida does not agree with Lévinas. See, perhaps most significantly, [[Martin Hägglund]].)

The major difference between Buber's account of the [[I and Thou]] relation and the ethics of the face-to-face encounter is the application of Lévinas' asymmetry towards the other.  For Buber, ethical relation meant a "symmetrical co-presence," while Lévinas, on the other hand, considers the relation with the other as something inherently asymmetrical: the other as they appear, the face, gives itself priority to the self, its first demand even before I react to it, love it or kill it, is: "thou shalt not kill me". Such a demand for Lévinas is prior to any reaction or any assertion of freedom by a subject. The face of the other in this sense looms above the other person and traces "where God passes." God (the [[infinite Other]]) here refers to the God of which one cannot refuse belief in Its history, that is the God who appears in traditional belief and of scripture and not some conceptual God of philosophy or [[ontotheology]].

{{quote|The face, in its nudity and defenselessness, signifies: “Do not kill me.” This defenseless nudity is therefore a passive resistance to the desire that is my freedom. Any exemplification of the face's expression, moreover, carries with it this combination of resistance and defenselessness: Lévinas speaks of the face of the other who is “widow, orphan, or stranger.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/ |title=Emmanuel Levinas |first=Bettina |last=Bergo |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the face-to-face encounter we also see how Lévinas splits ethics from morality.  Ethics marks the primary situation of the face-to-face whereas morality comes later, as some kind of, agreed upon or otherwise, set of rules that emerge from the social situation, wherein there are more than just the two people of the face-to-face encounter.
This ethical relation for Lévinas is prior to an [[ontology]] of nature, instead he refers to it as a [[meontology]], which affirms a meaning beyond [[Being]], a mode of non-Being (Greek: ''me on'').

==Comparison==
Face-to-face is similar to [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s ethical concept in art and answerability and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concept of the authentic guilt (present/face-to-face) as opposed to an inauthentic other.

{{Feminism sidebar |concepts}}
Feminism has affected culture in many ways, and has famously been theorised in relation to culture by [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Laura Mulvey]] and others. Timothy Laurie and Jessica Kean have argued that "one of [feminism's] most important innovations has been to seriously examine the ways women receive popular culture, given that so much pop culture is made by and for men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Why consenting adults should see 50 Shades of Grey - and take their teens | first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Jessica | last2= Kean | newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald | year= 2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/10818672}} February 19&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in a variety of forms, including literature, music, film and other screen cultures.

== Women's writing ==

{{Main|Women's writing (literary category)}}
{{See also|Feminist literary criticism|Écriture féminine}}
Women's writing came to exist as a separate category of scholarly interest relatively recently. In the West, second-wave feminism prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical contributions, and various academic sub-disciplines, such as [[Women's history]] (or [[herstory]]) and women's writing (including [[Women's writing in English|in English]]) (a [[list of feminist literature|list]] is available), developed in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia; Grundy, Isobel |title=The Feminist Companion to Literature in English: Women Writers From the Middle Ages to the Present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |page=1231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia Blain et al. characterize the growth in interest since 1970 in women's writing as "powerful".&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt; Much of this early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. Studies such as Dale Spender's ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s, Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of eighteenth-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Gilbert, Sandra M., ''Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: Women Who Created the Novel'', in ''New York Times'', May 4, 1986].&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Broadview Press has begun to issue eighteenth- and nineteenth-century works, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women's novels. There has been commensurate growth in the area of [[List of biographical dictionaries of women writers|biographical dictionaries of women writers]] due to a perception, according to one editor, that "most of our women are not represented in the 'standard' reference books in the field".&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;

=== Science fiction ===
{{Main|Feminist science fiction}}
In the 1960s, the genre of science fiction combined its sensationalism with political and technological critiques of society to produce [[feminist science fiction]]. With the advent of feminism, questioning women's roles became fair game to this "subversive, mind expanding genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Clute, John |author2=Nicholls, Peter |title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=0-312-13486-X |page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two early texts are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969) and [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970). They serve to highlight the socially constructed nature of gender roles by creating [[utopia]]s that do away with gender.&lt;ref&gt;Helford, Elyce Rae, in Westfahl, Gary, ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'' (Greenwood Press, 2005), 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Both authors were also pioneers in feminist criticism of science fiction in the 1960s and '70s, in essays collected in ''The Language of the Night'' (Le Guin, 1979) and ''How To Suppress Women's Writing'' (Russ, 1983). Another major work of feminist science fiction has been&lt;ref&gt;Sturgis, Susanna, ''Octavia E. Butler: June 22, 1947 &amp;mdash; February 24, 2006'', in ''The Women's Review of Books'', '''23'''(3): 19 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' by [[Octavia Butler]].

== Women's films ==
{{Main|Women's cinema}}
{{See also|Feminist film theory}}

The term "women's cinema" usually refers to the work of women [[film director]]s. It can also designate the work of other women behind the camera such as [[cinematographers]] and [[screenwriter]]s. Although the participation of women [[film editor]]s, [[costume designer]]s, and [[production designer]]s is usually not considered to be decisive enough to justify the term "women's cinema", it does have a large influence on the visual impression of any movie.

In a film from popular culture although not in women's film, an early reference to the "feminist movement" is heard from [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the 1942 movie ''[[Woman of the Year]]''.

== Women's music ==
{{main| Women's music}}

[[Women's music]] (or womyn's music or wimmin's music) is the music by women, for women, and about women.&lt;ref name="NoSmPvtPty"&gt;Lont, Cynthia, ''Women's Music: No Longer a Small Private Party'', in Reebee Garofalo, ed., ''Rockin' the Boat: Mass Music &amp; Mass Movements'' (Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 1992 ({{ISBN|0-89608-427-2}}), p. 242).&lt;/ref&gt; The genre emerged as a musical expression of the [[second-wave feminist]] movement&lt;ref&gt;Peraino, Judith, ''Girls with Guitars and Other Strange Stories'', in ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', vol. 54, no. 3 (2001), p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[civil rights]], and [[peace movement]]s.&lt;ref name="RadHarmonies"&gt;Mosbacher, Dee, ''Radical Harmonies'', ''Woman Vision'' (2002 (OCLC 53071762)). See also [http://www.woman-vision.org/radicalharmonies/index.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was started by lesbians such as [[Cris Williamson]], [[Meg Christian]], and [[Margie Adam]], African-American women activists such as [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]] and her group [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], and peace activist [[Holly Near]].&lt;ref name="RadHarmonies" /&gt; Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include [[studio musicians]], [[record producer|producers]], [[sound engineer]]s, [[technician]]s, cover artists, [[distributors]], [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]]s, and festival organizers who are also women.&lt;ref name="NoSmPvtPty" /&gt;

== Riot grrrl movement ==
{{Main|Riot Grrrl}}
[[File:Khanna.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Kathleen Hanna]] was the lead singer of [[Bikini Kill]], a [[riot grrrl]] music band formed in 1990.]]

''Riot grrrl'' (or ''riot grrl'') is an underground feminist [[Punk rock|punk]] movement that started in the 1990s and is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]] (it is sometimes seen as its starting point). It was grounded in the [[DIY ethic|DIY philosophy]] of [[Punk ideologies#Punk ethics|punk values]]. Riot grrrls took an [[anti-corporate]] stance of [[self-sufficiency]] and [[Individualism|self-reliance]].&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Rowe-Finkbeiner, Kristin |title=The F-Word: Feminism In Jeopardy&amp;mdash;Women, Politics and the Future |year=2004 |publisher=Seal Press |isbn=1-58005-114-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrls' emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_Garofalo"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Rosenberg, Jessica |title=Riot Grrrl: Revolutions From Within; Spring 1998 |journal=Signs |volume=23 |issue=Feminisms and Youth Cultures; number 3 |doi=10.1086/495289 |page=809 |author2=Gitana Garofalo |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment. Some bands associated with the movement are [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Free Kitten]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], and [[Team Dresch]]. In addition to a music scene, riot grrrl is also a [[subculture]]; [[zines]], the [[DIY]] ethic, art, political action, and activism are part of the movement. Riot grrrls hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.&lt;ref name="Schilt"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Schilt, Kristen |title='A Little Too Ironic': The Appropriation and Packaging of Riot Grrrl Politics by Mainstream Female Musicians |journal=Popular Music and Society |year=2003 |volume=26| issue =  1 |url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kleong/riottgrrl%20analysis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riot grrrl movement sprang out of [[Olympia, Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], in the early 1990s.

{{Main|Feminist views on pornography}}
The [[feminist sex wars]] is a term for the acrimonious debates within the feminist movement in the late 1970s through the 1980s around the issues of feminism, sexuality, sexual representation, [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[transwomen]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The [[Feminist views on pornography|feminist debate on porn]] pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name="Duggan"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex Wars: Sexual Dissent and Political Culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-91036-6 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Hansen, Karen Tranberg; |author2=Philipson, Ilene J. |title=Women, Class, and the Feminist Imagination: A Socialist-Feminist Reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-87722-630-X |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhard"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring Revolution: Second-Wave Feminism and the Rewriting of American Sexual Thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leidholdt"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Leidholdt, Dorchen; |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |author2=Raymond, Janice G. |title=The Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=0-04-440593-6 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-pornography movement ===
[[Anti-pornography movement#Feminist objections|Anti-pornography feminists]], such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Robin Morgan]], and [[Dorchen Leidholdt]], put [[pornography]] at the center of a feminist explanation of women's oppression.&lt;ref name="XXX"&gt;{{Cite book |author=McElroy, Wendy |title=XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-13626-9 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminists, such as [[Diana E. H. Russell|Diana Russell]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Susan Brownmiller]], [[Dorchen Leidholdt]], [[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]], [[Robin Morgan]], and [[Feminists Fighting Pornography|Page Mellish]], argue that pornography is degrading of women and complicit in [[violence against women]] both in its production (whereby, they charge, abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (whereby, they charge, pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]).&lt;ref name= "Dworkin"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dworkin, Andrea |authorlink=Andrea Dworkin |title=Pornography: Men Possessing Women |year=1989 |publisher=Plume |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26793-5 |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1970s, [[Feminist views on pornography#Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography]] [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] formed organizations such as [[Women Against Pornography]] and [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] that provided educational events, including slide-shows, speeches, and guided tours of the sex industry in [[Times Square]], [[New York City]], in order to raise awareness of the content of pornography and the sexual subculture in pornography shops and live sex shows.&lt;ref name="Brownmiller"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Brownmiller, Susan |title=In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution |year=1999 |publisher=Dial Press |location=New York |isbn=0-385-31486-8 |page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Dworkin and Robin Morgan began articulating a vehemently anti-porn stance based in radical feminism beginning in 1974 and anti-porn feminist groups, such as [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] in San Francisco, became highly active in various U.S. cities during the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Dworkin" /&gt;

=== Sex-positive movement ===
{{Main|Sex-positive feminism}}
[[Sex-positive feminism]] is a movement that was formed in order to address issues of women's sexual pleasure, freedom of expression, [[sex work]], and inclusive gender identities. [[Ellen Willis]]' 1981 essay, "Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex?" is the origin of the term, "pro-sex feminism"; the more commonly used variant, "sex positive feminism" arose soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Willis |first=Ellen |date=1981-06-17 |title=Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex?|periodical = [[Village Voice]]|issue=17 June 1981|doi=|oclc = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some sex-positive feminists, such as [[Betty Dodson]], were active in the early 1970s, much of sex-positive feminism largely began in the late 1970s and 1980s as a response to the increasing emphasis in radical feminism on anti-pornography activism.

Sex-positive feminists are also strongly opposed to radical feminist calls for legislation against pornography, a strategy they decried as [[censorship]], and something that could, they argued, be used by social conservatives to censor the sexual expression of women, gay people, and other sexual minorities. The initial period of intense debate and acrimony between sex-positive and anti-pornography feminists during the early 1980s is often referred to as the [[feminist sex wars]]. Other sex-positive feminists became involved not in opposition to other feminists but in direct response to what they saw as patriarchal control of sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

== Sex work and sex industry ==
{{Main|Feminist views on prostitution}}
Feminist views on sex work and prostitution vary. Feminist supporters of [[sex worker rights]] and decriminalization argue that women's right to control their own bodies and sexuality includes the right to engage in consensual sexual commerce. They also argue that criminalization and social stigmatization of [[sex work]] and sex workers only worsens the existing marginalization and victimization that sex workers are often subjected to. On the other hand, feminist opponents of prostitution argue that prostitution is so tangled with forced prostitution, [[human trafficking]], exploitation, and violence as to be inseparable from these ills in practice. They also argue that prostitution and other forms of sex work are inherently a product of [[patriarchy]] and [[sexism]], and that the presence even of consensual sex work is harmful to society and women in particular. While feminists across all positions generally agree that direct criminalization of women in prostitution should be ended, there is little or no consensus on much else on the topics of legal approaches to the sex trade, the status of sex workers, or the nature of sex work itself.&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;

Meffe, C. Ronald Carroll and Contributors. ''Principles of Conservation Biology'' (3rd ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool used in [[wildlife conservation]] to identify gaps in conservation lands (e.g., [[protected area]]s and [[nature reserve]]s) or other wildlands where significant plant and animal species and their habitat or important ecological features  occur. 

Conservation managers or scientists can use it as a basis for providing recommendations to improve the representativeness of nature reserves or the effectiveness of protected areas so that these areas provide the best value for conserving [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. With the information that a gap analysis yields, the boundaries of protected areas may be designed to subsume 'gaps' containing significant populations of wildlife species that can enhance the long-term survival of a larger [[metapopulation]] of the species already within the managed or protected area, or to include a diversity of wildlife species or [[ecosystem]]s that merit protection but are inadequately represented in an existing protected area network. Gap assessments can be done using the [[geographic information system]]: land maps that delineate topography, biological and geological features ([[forest cover]], plains, rivers, etc.), boundaries, land ownership and use are overlaid with the distribution of wildlife species. How much of the species' distribution fall within or without the conservation lands, or within a highly exploited area etc. can be identified.


At its simplest, a gap analysis is an assessment of the extent to which a protected area system meets protection goals set by a nation or region to represent its biological diversity. Gap analyses can vary from simple exercises based on a spatial comparison of biodiversity with existing protected areas to complex studies that need detailed data gathering and analysis, mapping and use of software decision packages. All gap analyses should consider a range of different “gaps” in a protected area network:


'''Representation gaps:''' either no representations of a particular species or ecosystem in any protected area, or not enough examples of the species or ecosystem represented to ensure long-term protection.

'''Ecological gaps:''' while the species or ecosystem occurs in the protected area system, occurrence is either of inadequate ecological condition, or the protected area(s) fail to address species'' movements or specific ecological conditions needed for long-term survival or ecosystem functioning.

'''Management gaps:''' protected areas exist but management regimes (management objectives, governance types, or management effectiveness) do not provide full security for particular species or ecosystems given local conditions.

However, things would later get hairy when she threatens to call her attorney when they were unable to produce the ring, going so far as refusing to take a monetary offer for it, as the ring had more sentimental value than monetary value. Also: a man comes in to sell pictures of the astronauts from the early-1960s, including [[John Glenn]], though its value will depend on whether or not [[autopen]] was used. And a man sells a [[Prosthesis|prosthetic leg]] that he claimed came from the Civil War era.

| ShortSummary     = Wayne and Randy take in some [[Freemasonry]] memorabilia from a family who believed that their house became haunted because of it. However, after they took possession of it, the store itself became haunted, to a point where it took a dangerous turn when Hymie accidentally dropped acid used for gold testing in his eye instead of eye drops, which was right next to the bottle of acid. As a result, Wayne became reluctant to buy the items for any price, as he fears for his life, but Randy, however, was still game, chalking everything up to odd coincidences. To help calm everybody's nerves, they call in Masonic expert [[Christopher L. Hodapp]], who gets to the bottom of things.

| ShortSummary     = A circus freak, who was capable of eating light bulbs (which he demonstrated), stopped by to sell a [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] [[calf]] with two heads and five legs. Wayne and Randy were skeptical at first, thinking it was fake, but when an expert proved that it was real, Wayne saw it as an opportunity to use it to promote the shop -- providing that he reaches a favorable deal with the seller. Also: a man, just released from prison, came to redeem his pawn for his watch, only to learn that pawns don't wait for prison terms to finish.

A buyer is interested in purchasing the safe, but Wayne wants to know what was inside first. Also: a man gets very belligerent when he demands proper payment for his heavily flawed diamond. And another man came to pawn his 1969 [[Yenko Camaro]], but Randy tries to talk him into selling it instead.

Whether or not Randy's attitude changes depends on the contents of the safe. Also: a couple try to sell several designer handbags, which was proven by an expert to be fake.

Later, he gets very angry when he found out that Hymie sold the watch by mistake, and he refuses any money to make up for it. As a result, Randy and Wayne visit the person who bought the watch, with Randy offering as much money as it takes to get it back -- but the buyer refuses to sell the watch back at any cost. But Wayne comes up with a solution, involving the watch's backstory.

But Wayne ended up learning about food sales the hard way -- from the lobster restaurant next door (for stealing his customers), another hot dog vendor (for invading his territory), the sanitary inspector (for selling spoiled, out of date hot dogs without a license), Degrazzi (for making him look bad), and even Randy (for losing money for the pawn shop).

They would later find out that that other seller was actually the expert that they hired.

In the 19th century, hegemony came to denote the "Social or cultural predominance or ascendancy; predominance by one group within a society or milieu". Later, it could be used to mean "a group or regime which exerts undue influence within a society".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'': Def's 2a and 2b.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it could be used for the geopolitical and the cultural predominance of one country over others, from which was derived ''hegemonism'', as in the idea that the [[Great power|Great Powers]] meant to establish [[European colonialism|European hegemony]] over [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Fontana"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Alan |editor1-last=Bullock |editor2-first= Stephen |editor2-last=Trombley |title=The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought |edition=Third |year=1999 |location= London |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=387–388 |isbn= 0-00-255871-8}}{{Request quotation|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international relations theory]], hegemony denotes a situation of (i) great material asymmetry in favour of one state, who has (ii) enough military power to systematically defeat any potential contester in the system, (iii) controls the access to raw materials, natural resources, capital and markets, (iv) has competitive advantages in the production of value added goods, (v) generates an accepted ideology reflecting this status quo; and (vi) is functionally differentiated from other states in the system, being expected to provide certain public goods such as security, or commercial and financial stability.

The [[Marxist]] theory of [[cultural hegemony]], associated particularly with [[Antonio Gramsci]], is the idea that the [[ruling class]] can manipulate the [[value system]] and [[mores]] of a society, so that their view becomes the world view (''[[Weltanschauung]]''): in Terry Eagleton's words, "Gramsci normally uses the word hegemony to mean the ways in which a governing power wins consent to its rule from those it subjugates".&lt;ref&gt;Terry Eagleton, ''Ideology: An Introduction'' (London: Verso, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule, cultural hegemony "is hegemonic only if those affected by it also consent to and struggle over its common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Masculinity Studies and the Jargon of Strategy: Hegemony, Tautology, Sense |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |newspaper=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912537 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:362BCThebanHegemony.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Ancient Greece]] under the hegemony of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], 371–362 BC]]

In [[cultural imperialism]], the leader state dictates the internal politics and the [[Society|societal]] character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic [[sphere of influence]], either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government.

==Etymology==
[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The League of Corinth hegemony: the Kingdom of Macedonia (362 BC) (red) and the Corinthian League (yellow)]]
From the post-classical Latin word ''hegemonia'' (from 1513 or earlier) from the Greek word ἡγεμονία ''hēgemonía'', meaning "authority, rule, political supremacy", related to the word ἡγεμών ''hēgemōn'' "leader".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 8th–1st centuries BC ===
In the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco–Roman]] world of 5th century BC European [[classical antiquity]], the [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]] was the ''hegemon'' of the [[Peloponnesian League]] (6th to 4th centuries BC) and King [[Philip II of Macedon]] was the hegemon of the [[League of Corinth]] in 337 BC (a kingship he willed to his son, [[Alexander the Great]]). Likewise, the role of [[Athens]] within the short-lived [[Delian League]] (478–404 BC) was that of a "hegemon".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "Greeks, Romans, and barbarians (from Europe, history of)": "Fusions of power occurred in the shape of leagues of cities, such as the Peloponnesian League, the Delian League, and the Boeotian League. The efficacy of these leagues depended chiefly upon the hegemony of a leading city (Sparta, Athens, or Thebes)"&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient historians such as [[Xenophon]] and [[Ephorus]] were the first who used the term in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Wickersham, JM., [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9_7b1J19i0C&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=hegemony+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OgNhVOyUF8iHsQTNzoKABA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20history&amp;f=false ''Hegemony and Greek Historians'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1994, p. x.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient [[East Asia]], Chinese hegemony existed during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (c. 770–480 BC), when the weakened rule of the [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] led to the relative autonomy of the [[Five Hegemons (Spring and Autumn period)|Five Hegemons]] (''Ba'' in Chinese [霸]). They were appointed by [[Feudalism|feudal]] lord conferences, and thus were nominally obliged to uphold the [[imperium]] of the Zhou Dynasty over the subordinate states.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "Ch'i":
"As a result, Ch'i began to dominate most of China proper; in 651 BC it formed the little states of the area into a league, which was successful in staving off invasions from the semibarbarian regimes to the north and south. Although Ch'i thus gained hegemony over China, its rule was short-lived; after Duke Huan's death, internal disorders caused it to lose the leadership of the new confederation"&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 16th and 17th-century Holland, the Dutch Republic's [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] dominion was an early instance of commercial hegemony, made feasible with the development of wind power for the efficient production and delivery of goods and services. This, in turn, made possible the Amsterdam [[stock market]] and concomitant dominance of world trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "Financial and economic affairs. (from Colbert, Jean-Baptiste)".&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1638–1715) and ([[Emperor of the French|Emperor]]) [[Napoleon]] I (1799–1815) attempted French true hegemony via economic, cultural and military domination of most of [[Continental Europe]]. However, Jeremy Black writes that, because of Britain, France "was unable to enjoy the benefits" of this hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Black, J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qV8GPUJkyEC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=hegemony+napoleon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BMZgVICfH63CsAS7uYKgCw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20napoleon&amp;f=false ''Great Powers and the Quest for Hegemony: The World Order Since 1500''], Routledge, 2007, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat and exile of Napoleon, hegemony largely passed to the [[British Empire]], which became the largest empire in history, with [[Queen Victoria]] (1837–1901) ruling over one-quarter of the world's land and population at its zenith.  Like the Dutch, the British Empire was primarily seaborne; many British possessions were located around the rim of the [[Indian Ocean]], as well as numerous islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Britain also controlled the [[Indian subcontinent]] and large portions of [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=CTkb4yIR8pIC&amp;dq=hegemony+british+emp+iii&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume III: The Nineteenth Century''], Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Germany, rather than Britain, may have been the strongest power after 1871, but Samuel Newland writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Bismarck defined the road ahead as … no expansion, no push for hegemony in Europe. Germany was to be the strongest power in Europe but without being a hegemon. … His basic axioms were first, no conflict among major powers in Central Europe; and second, German security without German hegemony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newland |first=Samuel J |title=Victories Are Not Enough: Limitations of the German Way of War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ehS8Dg8sdQC&amp;pg=PA30 |publisher=DIANE Publishing |year=2005 |page=30 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 20th century ===
The early 20th century, like the late 19th century was characterized by multiple [[Great Powers]] but no global hegemon. World War I weakened the strongest of the [[Imperialism|Imperial Powers]], Great Britain, but also strengthened the United States and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Both of these states' governments pursued policies to expand their regional [[spheres of influence]], the US in [[Banana Wars|Latin America]] and Japan in [[Empire of Japan|East Asia]]. France, the UK, Italy, the Soviet Union and later [[Nazi Germany]] (1933–1945) all either maintained imperialist policies based on spheres of influence or attempted to conquer territory but none achieved the status of a global hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |title=Why Orwell Matters |year=2002 |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |pages=86–87 |isbn=0-465-03049-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the [[United Nations]] was established and the five strongest global powers (China, France, the UK, the US, and the USSR) were given permanent seats on the [[U.N. Security Council]], the organization's most powerful decision making body. Following the war, the US and the USSR were the two strongest global powers and this created a bi-polar power dynamic in international affairs, commonly referred to as the [[Cold War]]. The hegemonic conflict was [[Ideology|ideological]], between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], as well as geopolitical, between the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (1955–1991) and [[NATO]]/[[SEATO]]/[[CENTO]] countries (1949–present). During the Cold War both hegemons competed against each other directly (during the [[arms race]]) and indirectly (via [[proxy war]]s). The result was that many countries, no matter how remote, were drawn into the conflict when it was suspected that their governments' policies might destabilize the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]. Reinhard Hildebrandt calls this a period of "dual-hegemony", where "two dominant states have been stabilizing their European spheres of influence ''against and alongside each other''."&lt;ref&gt;Hilderbrandt, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=FavTTdW2YqEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hegemony+USA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SIFfVMGHF4KP7AbStoDIDA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cold%20war%22%20hegemony&amp;f=false ''US Hegemony: Global Ambitions and Decline : Emergence of the Interregional Asian Triangle and the Relegation of the US as a Hegemonic Power, the Reorientation of Europe''], Peter Lang, 2009, p. 14. (Author's italics).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Proxy wars became battle grounds between forces supported either directly or indirectly by the hegemonic powers and included the [[Korean War]], the [[Laotian Civil War]], the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan War]], the [[Angolan Civil War]], and the [[Central American crisis|Central American Civil Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=3UgSAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=proxy+wars&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Proxy Warfare''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, pp. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 the United States was the world's sole hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrandt, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=FavTTdW2YqEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hegemony+USA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SIFfVMGHF4KP7AbStoDIDA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20USA&amp;f=false ''US Hegemony: Global Ambitions and Decline : Emergence of the Interregional Asian Triangle and the Relegation of the US as a Hegemonic Power, the Reorientation of Europe''], Peter Lang, 2009, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
Various perspectives on whether the US was or continues to be a hegemon have been presented since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The American political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Joseph Nye]] have argued that the US is not a true hegemon because it has neither the financial nor the military resources to impose a proper, formal, global hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph S., Sr. |last=Nye |title=Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=276–77 |isbn=0-06-500720-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Anna Cornelia Beyer, in her book about counter-terrorism, argues that [[global governance]] is a product of American leadership and describes it as hegemonic governance.&lt;ref name="Beyer" /&gt;

[[File:Gramsci.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937), the [[Intellectual|theoretician]] of [[cultural hegemony]]]]

In the historical writing of the 19th century, the denotation of ''hegemony'' extended to describe the predominance of one country upon other countries; and, by extension, ''hegemonism'' denoted the Great Power politics (c. 1880s – 1914) for establishing hegemony (indirect imperial rule), that then leads to a definition of [[imperialism]] (direct foreign rule). In the early 20th century, in the field of [[international relations]], the Italian [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Antonio Gramsci]] developed the theory of [[Cultural hegemony|cultural domination]] (an analysis of [[economic class]]) to include [[social class]]; hence, the philosophic and sociologic theory of [[cultural hegemony]] analysed the [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] that established the [[social structure]]s (social and economic classes) with which the [[ruling class]] establish and exert cultural [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance]] to impose their ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' (world view)—justifying the social, political, and economic ''[[status quo]]''—as natural, inevitable, and beneficial to every social class, rather than as artificial [[social construct]]s beneficial solely to the ruling class.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fontana" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K. J. |last=Holsti |title=The Dividing Discipline: Hegemony and Diversity in International Theory |year=1985 |location=Boston |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=0-04-327077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Gramsci analysis derived the [[political science]] denotation of hegemony as ''leadership''; thus, the historical example of [[Prussia]] as the militarily and culturally predominant province of the [[German Empire]] (Second Reich 1871–1918); and the personal and intellectual predominance of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]] upon the [[French Consulate]] (1799–1804).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Cook |title=Dictionary of Historical Terms |year=1983 |location=London |publisher=MacMillan |page=142 |isbn=0-333-44972-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporarily, in ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'' (1985), [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]] defined hegemony as a political relationship of [[power (philosophy)|power]] wherein a sub-ordinate society (collectivity) perform social tasks that are culturally unnatural and not beneficial to them, but that are in exclusive benefit to the [[Imperialism|imperial]] interests of the hegemon, the superior, ordinate power; hegemony is a military, political, and economic relationship that occurs as an [[Articulation (sociology)|articulation]] within political [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernest |last=Laclau |first2=Chantal |last2=Mouffe |title=Hegemony and Socialist Strategy |edition=Second |year=2001 |location=London |publisher=Verso |pages=40–59, 125–44 |isbn=1-85984-330-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyer analysed the contemporary hegemony of the United States at the example of the Global War on Terrorism and presented the mechanisms and processes of American exercise of power in 'hegemonic governance'.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beyer |first=Anna Cornelia |title=Counterterrorism and International Power Relations |year=2010 |location=London |publisher=I.

== Sociology ==
Academics have argued that in the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of hegemony, imperial dominance is established by means of [[cultural imperialism]], whereby the leader state (hegemon) dictates the internal politics and the [[Society|societal]] character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic [[sphere of influence]], either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government. The imposition of the hegemon's way of life—an imperial ''[[lingua franca]]'' and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] (social, economic, educational, governing)—transforms the concrete imperialism of direct military domination into the abstract [[Political power|power]] of the ''status quo'', indirect imperial domination.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kG2hAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=impose+cultural+imperialism&amp;q=%22power+imposing%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22power%20imposing%22&amp;f=false ''Imperialism and Postcolonialism''], Routledge, 2014, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have said that this view is "deeply condescending" and "treats people&amp;nbsp;... as blank slates on which global capitalism's moving finger writes its message, leaving behind another cultural automaton as it moves on."&lt;ref&gt;Brutt-Griffler, J., in Karlfried Knapp, Barbara Seidlhofer, H. G. Widdowson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3klgGNmjVpEC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=impose+cultural+imperialism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4fFgVJe-L6jLsAT7soGgCg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=impose%20cultural%20imperialism&amp;f=false ''Handbook of Foreign Language Communication and Learning''], Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested examples of cultural imperialism include the latter-stage [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[British Empire]]s, the 19th- and 20th-century [[Reich]]s of [[German Unification|unified Germany]] (1871–1945),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry |last=Kissinger |authorlink=Henry Kissinger |title=Diplomacy |year=1994 |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-65991-X |pages=137–38 |quote=European coalitions were likely to arise to contain Germany's Nazis growing, potentially dominant, power}} As well as p. 145: "Unified Germany was achieving the strength to dominate Europe all by itself—an occurrence which Great Britain had always resisted in the past when it came about by conquest".&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the 20th century, the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally, hegemony also is established by means of [[language]], specifically the imposed ''lingua franca'' of the hegemon (leader state), which then is the official source of [[information]] for the people of the society of the sub-ordinate state. Writing on language and power, Andrea Mayr says, "As a practice of power, hegemony operates largely through language."&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIjpTHCNYsUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=language+hegemony&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6NtfVO74C8qu7AamioDoAw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20hegemony&amp;f=false ''Language and Power: An Introduction to Institutional Discourse''], A&amp;C Black,  2008, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary society, an example of the use of language in this way is in the way Western countries set up educational systems in African countries mediated by Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, T., [https://books.google.com/books?id=fKQ4csjlktIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20language&amp;f=false ''Rethinking Hegemony''], James Nicholas Publishers, 2006, pp. 202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of this is found in the way language helped "diminish the traditions" of African Americans in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Semmes, CE., [https://books.google.com/books?id=OU2vSHLUZuMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=hegemony+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UNFfVKOmN46TsQT7roCwBA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20language&amp;f=false ''Cultural Hegemony and African American Development''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard Rachlin''' (born 1935) is an American psychologist and the founder of [[teleological behaviorism]]. He is Emeritus Research Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychology, State University of New York, Stony Brook ([[State University of New York|SUNY]], Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA.  His initial work was in the quantitative analysis of operant behavior in pigeons, on which he worked with [[William M. Baum]], developing ideas from [[Richard Herrnstein]]'s [[matching law]].  He subsequently became one of the founders of [[Behavioral Economics]].  His current research focuses on patterns of choice over time and how those patterns affect self-control (on which he worked with [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]]), including cooperation over time. His interests in Behavioral Economics include: decision making, the [[prisoner's dilemma]], addiction, and  gambling. He was one of the first board members of the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].

The '''Human Dimension Implementation Meeting''' is a human rights and democracy conference held by the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) on an annual basis in [[Warsaw]] ([[Poland]]).

The two-week conference is attended by some 1000 government representatives, international experts, non-governmental organizations, and human rights activists. Organized every autumn by the Warsaw-based OSCE [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR), the meeting is considered to be Europe's largest human rights conference.

The Human Dimension Implementation Meeting (HDIM) was established in the early 1990s to create a forum for participating States of the OSCE to discuss the implementation of the "human dimension" commitments they have adopted by consensus at prior Summits and Ministerial Meetings. In OSCE parlance, the term "human dimension" describes the set of norms and activities
related to human rights, the rule of law, and democracy that are regarded within the OSCE
as one of the three pillars of its comprehensive security concept, along with the politico-military
and the economic and environmental dimensions.

One of the distinct features setting the HDIM apart from other high-level human rights conferences is its openness to the participation of [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). NGOs can participate in the conference on an equal footing with government representatives. For NGOs from states where civil society is weak and constrained, the HDIM can be one of the few opportunities they have to make their voices heard before an international audience.

The plenary sessions of the conference are supposed to review the progress made over the past year by participating States and remaining shortcomings with respect to realizing their human dimension commitments.

The agenda is set by the OSCE's Permanent Council. Regular sessions cover the full range of OSCE commitments related to human rights and democracy. Three days are reserved for more in-depth discussions of three different topics selected by the Permanent Council every year.

On the sidelines of the HDIM, dozens of side events are organized by participating delegations and NGOs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">In mathematics, the '''indicator vector''' or '''characteristic vector''' or '''incidence vector''' of a [[subset]] ''T'' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is the vector &lt;math&gt;x_T := (x_s)_{s\in S}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_s = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s \notin T.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''S'' is [[countable set|countable]] and its elements are numbered so that &lt;math&gt;S = \{s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_T = (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_i = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s_i \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s_i \notin T.&lt;/math&gt;

To put it more simply, the indicator vector of ''T'' is a vector with one element for each element in ''S'', with that element being one if the corresponding element of ''S'' is in ''T'', and zero if it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical Classification and Clustering|first= Boris Grigorʹevich |last=Mirkin|page=112|isbn=0-7923-4159-7|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brzLe4X4ypEC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=indicator+vector+subset&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plX5UpzkFITPkQfklIDQDQ&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=indicator%20vector%20subset&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering|first=Ulrike|last=von Luxburg|work=Statistics and Computing|volume=17|issue=4|year=2007|page=2|url=http://www.kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/Luxburg07_tutorial_4488%5B0%5D.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Decoding Linear Codes Via Optimization and Graph-based Techniques|first=Mohammad H. |last=Taghavi|page=21|publisher=ProQuest|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UCpDYih3WcC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22indicator+vector%22+subset&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c2T5UteBMsOfkAeitoDQBg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22indicator%20vector%22%20subset&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An indicator vector is a special (countable) case of an [[indicator function]].

==Example==
If ''S'' is the set of [[natural number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and ''T'' is some subset of the natural numbers, then the indicator vector is naturally a single point in the [[Cantor space]]: that is, an infinite sequence of 1's and 0's, indicating membership, or lack thereof, in ''T''.  Such vectors commonly occur in the study of [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 3D rendering of Indra's net.]]
'''Indra's net''' (also called '''Indra's jewels''' or '''Indra's pearls''', [[Sanskrit]] ''Indrajāla'') is a [[metaphor]] used to illustrate the concepts of [[Śūnyatā]] (emptiness),{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}} [[pratītyasamutpāda]] (dependent origination),&lt;ref name="Lee_2005_473" &gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2005|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhist_philosophy#Huayan|interpenetration]]&lt;ref name="Odin_1982_17" &gt;{{harvnb|Odin|1982|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Buddhist philosophy]].

The metaphor was developed by the [[Mahayana|Mahayana school]] in the 3rd century ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' and later by the [[Huayan school]] between the 6th and 8th centuries.{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}}

==Avatamsaka Sutra==
[[File:Indras Net-02.png|thumb|right|250px]]
{{Main|Indra|Avatamsaka Sutra|Huayan school}}

"Indra's net" is an infinitely large net of cords owned by the [[Vedic]] [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Indra]], which hangs over his palace on [[Mount Meru]], the [[axis mundi]] of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. In this metaphor, Indra's net has a multifaceted jewel at each vertex, and each jewel is reflected in all of the other jewels.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|2000|p=225}} 

In the [[Huayan school]] of [[Chinese Buddhism]], which follows the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]], the image of "Indra's net" is used to describe the interconnectedness of the universe.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|2000|p=225}} Francis H Cook describes Indra's net thus:

{{quote|Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each "eye" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering "like" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected ''all'' the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.{{sfn|Cook|1977}}}}

The Buddha in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'s 30th book states a similar idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:If untold buddha-lands are reduced to atoms,
:In one atom are untold lands,
:And as in one,
:So in each.
:The atoms to which these buddha-lands are reduced in an instant are unspeakable,
:And so are the atoms of continuous reduction moment to moment
:Going on for untold eons;
:These atoms contain lands unspeakably many,
:And the atoms in these lands are even harder to tell of.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 891-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book 30 of the sutra is named "The Incalculable" because it focuses on the idea of the [[infinitude]] of the universe and as Cleary notes, concludes that "the cosmos is unutterably infinite, and hence so is the total scope and detail of knowledge and activity of enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; In another part of the sutra, the Buddhas' knowledge of all phenomena is referred to by this metaphor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They [Buddhas] know all phenomena come from interdependent origination.
They know all world systems exhaustively. They know all the
different phenomena in all worlds, interrelated in Indra's net.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In Huayan texts==
The metaphor of Indra's net of jewels plays an essential role in the Chinese Huayan school,{{sfn||Cook|1977|p=2}} where it is used to describe the interpenetration (Wylie: ''zung-'jug''; Sanskrit: yuganaddha) of microcosmos and macrocosmos.{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=16-17}} The Huayan text entitled "Calming and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan" (Huayan wujiao zhiguan 華嚴五教止觀, T1867) attributed to the first Huayan patriarch [[Dushun]] (557–640) gives an extended overview of this concept:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The manner in which all dharmas interpenetrate is like an imperial net of
celestial jewels extending in all directions infinitely, without limit. … As for the imperial net of heavenly jewels, it is known as Indra’s Net, a net which is made entirely of jewels. Because of the clarity of the jewels, they are all reflected in and enter into each other, ad infinitum. Within each jewel, simultaneously, is reflected the whole net. Ultimately, nothing comes or goes. If we now turn to the southwest, we can pick one particular jewel and
examine it closely. This individual jewel can immediately reflect the image
of every other jewel. 
As is the case with this jewel, this is furthermore the case with all the rest of the jewels–each and every jewel simultaneously and immediately reflects each and every other jewel, ad infinitum. The image of each of these limitless jewels is within one jewel, appearing brilliantly. None of the other jewels interfere with this. When one sits within one jewel, one is simultaneously sitting in all the infinite jewels in all ten directions. How is this so? Because within each jewel are present all jewels. If all jewels are present within each jewel, it is also the case that if you sit in one jewel you sit in all jewels at the same time. The inverse is also understood in the same way. Just as one goes into one jewel and thus enters every other jewel while never leaving this one jewel, so too one enters any jewel while never leaving this particular jewel.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Alan. The Practice of Huayan Buddhism, http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~cbs/pdf/2013%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E9%9B%86/q16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Huayan Patriarch [[Fazang]] (643–712) used the golden statue of a lion to demonstrate the Huayan vision of interpenetration to empress Wu:{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=17}}

{{quote|In each of the lion's eyes, in its ears, limbs, and so forth, down to each and every single hair, there is a golden lion. All the lions embraced by each and every hair simultaneously and instantaneously enter into one single hair. Thus, in each and every hair there are an infinite number of lions... The progression is infinite, like the jewels of Celestial Lord Indra's Net: a realm-embracing-realm ad infinitum is thus established, and is called the realm of Indra's Net.{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=17}}}}

==Atharva Veda==
According to Rajiv Malhotra, the earliest reference to a net belonging to Indra is in the [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]] (c. 1000 [[BCE]]).{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=4-5, 210}} Verse 8.8.6. says: 
{{quote|Vast indeed is the tactical net of great Indra, mighty of action and tempestuous of great speed. By that net, O Indra, pounce upon all the enemies so that none of the enemies may escape the arrest and punishment.{{sfn|Ram|2013|p=910}}}}

And verse 8.8.8. says:
{{quote|This great world is the power net of mighty Indra, greater than the great. By that Indra-net of boundless reach, I hold all those enemies with the dark cover of vision, mind and senses.{{sfn|Ram|2013|p=910-911}}}}

The net was one of the weapons of the sky-god Indra, used to snare and entangle enemies.{{sfn|Beer|2003|p=154}} The net also signifies [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[Maya (illusion)|illusion]].{{sfn|Debroy|2013}} According to Teun Goudriaan, Indra is conceived in the Rg Veda as a great magician, tricking his enemies with their own weapons, thereby continuing human life and prosperity on earth.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=211}} Indra became associated with earthly magic, as reflected in the term ''indrajalam'', "Indra's Net", the name given to the occult practices magicians.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=211}} According to Goudriaan, the term ''indrajalam'' seems to originate in verse 8.8.8 from the Atharva Veda, of which Goudriaan gives a different translation:{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}
{{quote|This world was the net of the great Sakra (Indra), of mighty size; by means of this net of Indra I envelop all those people with darkness.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}}}

According to Goudriaan, the speaker pretends to use a weapon of cosmical size.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}} The net being referred to here 
{{quote|...was characterized there as the ''antariksa-'', the intermediate space between heaven and earth, while the directions of the sky were the net's sticks (''dandah'') by means of which it was fastened to the earth. With this net Indra conquered all his enemies.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}}}

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach''===
In ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979), [[Douglas Hofstadter]] uses Indra's net as a metaphor for the complex interconnected networks formed by relationships between objects in a system—including [[social network]]s, the interactions of particles, and the "[[Symbolic interactionism|symbols]]" that stand for [[idea]]s in a [[brain]] or [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last1 =  Hofstadter| first1 = Douglas R.  | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter  | title = [[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]  | publisher = Basic Books  | year = 1999  | page = 266  | isbn = 0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vermeer's Hat''===
In ''[[Vermeer's Hat]]'' (2007), a history book written by [[Timothy Brook]], the author uses the metaphor:
{{quote| Buddhism uses a similar image to describe the interconnectedness of all phenomena. It is called Indra's Net. When Indra fashioned the world, he made it as a web, and at every knot in the web is tied a pearl. Everything that exists, or has ever existed, every idea that can be thought about, every datum that is true—every dharma, in the language of Indian philosophy—is a pearl in Indra's net. Not only is every pearl tied to every other pearl by virtue of the web on which they hang, but on the surface of every pearl  is reflected every other jewel on the net. Everything that exists in Indra's web implies all else that exists.&lt;ref name="VH(p22)"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;!--end quote--&gt;
Writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', Sarah Burton explains that Brook uses the metaphor, and its interconnectedness, 
{{quote|to help understand the multiplicity of causes and effects producing the way we are and the way we were [...] In the same way, the journeys through Brook's picture-portals intersect with each other, at the same time shedding light on each other.&lt;ref name="Spectator-Burton"&gt;{{cite web | last = Burton | first = Sarah | title = The Net Result | publisher = ''[[The Spectator]]'' | date = 2 August 2008 | url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/866241/part_2/the-net-result.thtml | accessdate = 2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Indra's Net: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity''===
In ''[[Indra's Net (book)|Indra's Net]]'' (2014), [[Rajiv Malhotra]] uses the image of Indra's net as a metaphor for
{{quote|
the profound cosmology and outlook that permeates Hinduism. Indra's Net symbolizes the universe as a web of connections and interdependences [...] I seek to revive it as the foundation for Vedic cosmology and show how it went on to become the central principle of Buddhism, and from there spread into mainstream Western discourse across several disciplines.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=4}}

==Description==
Typically, a parent may take a sick child to a traditional healer, who will look in the child's mouth and attribute the illness to "[[tooth worms]]". The healer will point out the small, white, developing [[Tooth development#The developing tooth bud|tooth buds]] as being "tooth worms", and then dig the "worms" out of the gums without [[anaesthesia]] using a non-sterile tool such as a hot or sharpened nail, a bicycle spoke, or a knitting needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Harm==
This practice inflicts pain and suffering on a child who may already be sick (or who may be teething), and in some cases it is carried out on a healthy child in a bid to prevent illness. The procedure may lead to shock, and loss of blood may lead to [[anaemia]]. The unhygienic methods can cause [[blood infection]]s, [[tetanus]], pass on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and can on occasion be fatal.&lt;ref name="john"&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Intima Virtual Base''' is an institute for contemporary arts founded by the director and artist [[Igor Štromajer]]. It is an institution dealing with media, contemporary performing arts, radio and sound projects, performance and theory, body-related theory, music, dance, choreography, and computer graphics. In 2001 [[Igor Štromajer]] and Brane Zorman embarked on projects that they named Ballettikka Internetikka.

==Ballettikka Internettikka==
Ballettika Internetikka is a series of projects which began in 2001 during the time when the internet was only a small part of peoples lives. It explores wireless internet ballet performances combined with tactics from the guerrilla performances and mobile live internet broadcasting strategies. The projects began in 2002 and they are still happening around the world from Germany, Norway and Italy, to Russia, Antarctica, Hong Kong and Japan.

===Ballettikka Internettikka – Part One: Net.Ballet (2001)===
The event was exploring how ballet can be performed with a series of still images via live Webcam video capture and an automatic change of the images every 20 seconds on the Net. The choreography was based on the HTML and JavaScript codes enhanced with sound/music. It explored the movements of a dancer’s body and how a ballet story can be told, shown and danced with a series of still images. Anything that the dancer was doing between those 20 seconds was not shown to the viewers.

===Ballettikka Internettikka – Part Two: Ballet.Net (2002)===
The second phase of the project took place in the building of the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] in Moscow, Russia, exactly one year after Part One – net.ballet. Requests to perform Ballettika Internettika on stage were sent to the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] company. There was no reply so on 28 March 2002 [[Igor Štromajer]] and Brane Zorman entered the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] from the main entrance with a rack sack on their backs and valid tickets for that night’s performance. They were asked to leave their sacks before entering, but that was impossible since all the equipment that where needed for the live web show was in there.

Plan B was now their only way to perform live, they entered from a small window in the left wing of the building and they performed the ballet.net in an abandoned part of the cellar. The illegal action was classed as an invasion; everything was planned, watches were synchronized, hi-tech mobile and wireless equipment for the broadcast were used along with portable computers, mp3 audio systems and mini digital cameras. Štromajer says:
"It's the top place for dancing and we wanted to demystify it. I wanted to dance there as a non-dancer and was dancing there in the name of all the ballet dancers world-wide: all of them who cannot dance in the Bolshoi, but would like to, because the Bolshoi is an international symbol for classical ballet."

Štromajer says: ‘‘The new general director of the [[Bolshoi theatre]], Anatoliy Iksanov, told the press in Moscow that he would like to include new dynamics into his theatre. Well, Ballettikka would certainly be an opportunity for him.’’

===Ballettikka Interettikka: M-III Robot Net Ballet (2003)===
After establishing the fact that they can dance and broadcast themselves on the Net, [[Igor Štromajer]] and Brane Zorman decided to replace their human bodies with robots. The next project took place in the International Theatre of Bergen in Norway. The project came to life with help and collaboration from the choreographer Hooman Sharifi.

===Ballettikka RealVideo Internettika (2003)===
The project was premiered in Moderna galerija Ljubljana – Slovene Museum of Contemporary arts &amp; Television Slovenia Kultura – Lijubjana, Slovenia on December 2003. Štromajer and Zorman brought together two Moscow acts; one was the Internet Ballet and their illegal invasion of Moscow’s [[Bolshoi Theatre]] and the second one was the Chechen terrorist act in the Dubrovka Theatre in October 2002.

The condensed version of Ballettikka RealVideo Internettikka consists of a video with [[Morse-code]] [[dramaturgy]]. After the terrorist attack, Štromajer realised that his invasion in the [[Bolshoi theatre]] could have easily ended up being a terrorist attack instead of an artistic piece. The two acts were sharing common methods and actions; the homicidal – suicidal terrorist act represents the ritual materialization of the intimate sacrifice of the one’s own body, as well as of those of others, while ballet represents a strategic sacrifice of the dancer’s body as it is honed into a perfectly functioning machine. Brian Jenkins says: ‘‘Terrorism is theatre’’ but in the end all the artistic standards are left on the side and the only thing that is left is tactics, both in art and terrorism. Ballettikka RealVideo Internettikka makes an input to the misunderstanding of contemporary postmodern terrorism and democracy’s fear of extremist dedication; it symbolizes a fascination with criticism of the system and with appeals to the beauty of dying. The Chechen terrorist Barayev said: ‘‘We have come here to die!’’ as him and his group disrupted the Moscow performance of the musical [[Nord-Ost]]. "We have come here to dance," wrote Štromajer, as an Internet link was launched with the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. The wireless ballet began, seven months before Barayev died.

===Ballettikka Internettikka – Auto Mobillikka (2004)===

The project was located on the Ljubljana Beltway - Motorway Ring in south Slovenia. On 4 October 2004 Stromajer and Zorman were manipulating two remote-controlled toy-ballet robots with wireless cameras and broadcasting live video and audio signal GPRS/GSM mobile phones on the internet. Everything was set up on a car, laptops, speakers and mobile phones. Two video cameras were attached to the remote controlled cars and they were broadcasting the movements of the ballet robot. The project in Ljubljana Beltway opened the doors for the following project in Italy.

===Balletikka Internettikka – Illigalikka Robottikka (2004)===
On 13 November 2004 [[Igor Štromajer]] and Brane Zorman were ready to act out the next project. Based on the previous project Ballettikka Internettikka – Auto Mobillikka they took it a step further where this time they made the robots perform in the kitchen of the famous [[Teatro Alla Scala]] were bio-food for artists is prepared. The two artists once again they used the two remote controlled cars with the two web cameras and they broadcast the toy robot while he was ballet dancing in the Kitchen. The toy robot was transformed into a [[Guerrilla theatre|guerrilla]]-ballet dancer. Hi-tech mobile and wireless equipment were used for the invasion and the broadcasting once again.

Dancing an illegal wireless roboballet in the kitchen of the [[Teatro alla Scala]] was a challenge to the Intima Virtual Base, as a result the preparations have been taken seriously, safety procedures have been taken, and the previous experience from the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow has been a great help.

In November 2004, [[Teatro alla Scala]] was temporarily closed for the public due to renovation works; therefore all the performances took place at the [[Teatro degli Arcimboldi]]. So the project was not affected by any means from the theatre management.

===Ballettikka Internettikka - VolksNetBallet (People's Internet Ballet) (2006)===
People's Internet Ballet was performed on Sunday, 9 July 2006 at 9 PM GMT+1 (Berlin/Paris local time) at, and secretly broadcast (as six one-minute live streaming videos) from the Basement Toilet in [[Volksbühne]] at [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz|Rosa-Luxemburg Square]] in Berlin, Germany. Here is a description of the performance:

''' "Stromajer and Zorman manipulated a semi-automatic flying cow and eleven robots dancing an internet ballet, MC Brane conducted an MP3 orchestra!" '''

VolksNetBallet was broadcast in the form of six one-minute streaming videos, almost live, with only two minutes delay. It means that the visitors could see and hear in six steps what had just happened only two minutes earlier during the VolksNetBallet in [[Volksbühne]] Basement Toilet. All six videos were edited live in-camera, using only STOP and REC functions, then immediately converted to Real Media files using Real Producer, and finally, transferred to the server for viewing.

The artists utilized low-tech mobile and wireless equipment for the invasion and live broadcast: a public unprotected wireless internet connection point (wLAN), available for free at the Rosa-Luxemburg Square in Berlin (ID: Helmut22; signal strength in the basement of [[Volksbühne]]: 2/5), free RealProducer (version 11.0) and Live LE software for streaming video and audio live manipulation.
Ballettikka Internettikka: VolksNetBallet took place on the very same evening and at the very same time as another huge people's festivity—the final match of the World Soccer Cup 2006, which also took place in Germany.

Dancing a wireless people's internet ballet in [[Volksbühne]] Berlin represented a challenge to the Intima Virtual Base and all the collaborators, therefore, the preparations were taken seriously, safety measures were calculated, and the previous experiences from the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow, [[La Scala]] in Milan and The National Theatre in Belgrade were used.

The project was supported by The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia.

===Ballettikka Internettikka: RenminNetBallet (2007)===
RenminNetBallet is an re-enactment/remake/reinterpretation of the VolksNetBallet guerrilla net ballet action (Berlin 2006) and was performed as a part of the Microwave Festival - Media x Activism Poster Conference in Hong Kong on Saturday 17 November 2007 at 4PM Hong Kong Standard Time (GMT+8). It took place in the Hong Kong City Hall toilet for disabled persons and presented in the Innocentre, Hong Kong.
The artists used a Mac Book Pro laptop computer and low-technology mobile and wireless equipment: Mini DV cam, MP3 players, remote controlled toy-robot etc.

===Ballettikka Internettikka: Stattikka (2007)===
Stromajer and Zorman furtively performed a new internet ballet—Ballettikka Internettikka: Stattikka—as a part of the Tele-Plateau - Performative Installation in Hellerau, Dresden, broadcasting live from the roof of the targeted skyscraper in Hong Kong (Lippo Centre 2), in front of the dense cityscape, using a commercial Silverlit R/C Robot Program-a-BOT, dancing an Almost Static But Still Transitive Net Ballet for 30 minutes in the Hong Kong dawn. This happened on Saturday 17 November 2007 at 10 PM Central European Time (GMT+1) and lasted for 30 mins.

===Ballettikka Internettikka: Olymppikka (2008)===
It took place on Monday 24 March 2008. At the same time that the official 2008 [[Olympic Torch]] was being kindled by the light of the Sun ([[Olympia, Greece]]), Stromajer &amp; Zorman digitally ignited a robot with computer software.

===Ballettikka Internettikka: Hydraullikka (2008)===
Hydraullikka took place at Plaza del Rey, Madrid, on 10 May 2008. It consisted of two robots being placed in a hydraulic press machine where they were crushed, pressed, and ground together to symbolise love and togetherness.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaIoE25Y-TM Video of Performance]

===Ballettikka Internettikka: Intermenttikka (2008)===
Intermenttikka was performed as part of the Digital Playground 2008, secretly broadcasting live from the target construction site in Seoul, performing a robotic ballet after sunrise. It consisted of a Live Internet Broadcast from Seoul, Korea on Tuesday 22 July 2008 at 6 AM Korean Time (GMT/UTC+9). The artists covered the commercial Silverlit R/C toy-robot with cement and placed it into reinforced ferroconcrete foundations of the target construction site (the rising Dongdaemun (Great East Gate) / Tongdaemun Market), to stay there forever.

The interred robot was equipped with a QSTARZ BT-Q818 extreme GPS transmitter which was broadcasting the signal until the transmitter run out of batteries. The signal was edited live by the computer software.

From 22 July to 24 August the Ballettikka Internettikka Intermenttikka project (including the selected history of Ballettikka Internettikka since 2001) was exhibited in TMCA (Total Museum of Contemporary Art) in Seoul, as a part of the Digital Playground 2008 - "Hack the City!" exhibition curated by Nathalie Boseul Shin.

Norddikka was a live Internet Broadcast from Svalbard, Arctic Ocean on Wednesday 31 December 2008 at 23:55 PM Central European Time (GMT/UTC+1). 0Svalbard is a cluster of islands) in the Arctic Ocean north of mainland Europe, about midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, and forms the northernmost part of Norway and the northernmost lands of Europe.

The largest island is Spitsbergen (37,673 km2 or 14,550 square miles), and the largest settlement is Longyearbyen (approximately 2,075 inhabitants, the administrative centre of Svalbard, located on Spitsbergen).
Svalbard lies far north of the Arctic Circle. In Longyearbyen, the polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February.  From 12 November to the end of January there is civil polar night, a continuous period without any twilight bright enough to permit outdoor activities in the absence of artificial light.

Stromajer and Zorman conducted and monitored the leaving of the robot in the deep snow of the white spaciousness of the Arctic glacier (Olav V Land, Svalbard) on New Year's Eve. They were located in their Control Centre in Ljubljana (CCL), Slovenia.

Receiving instructions from CCL, two executants, Nils Are Mohn and Åsmund Njøs, keepers of the Indian research base on Svalbard (NCAOR - Indian National Research Centre; opened in July 2008 in collaboration with the Norwegian Polar Institute, as one of the twelve international permanent research bases in Svalbard), abandoned the robot on the glacier.

Mohn and Njøs started their journey to the foothills of the Olav V Land glacier seven minutes before midnight. They were in permanent video contact (UMTS webcam) with the CCL. Exactly at midnight (Central European Time/also local Svalbard time), when the year 2008 turned into 2009, they reached Point Zero (78N, 17E) and prepared a platform for the robot, using a snow shovel. They also thrust the Slovenian national flag into the snow next to the robot. The action was performed in the complete dark (civil polar night) and the Live broadcast lasted 10 minutes, starting 31 December 2008 at 23:55, ending 1 January 2009 at 00:05.

===Ballettikka Internettikka: Nipponnikka (2009)===
Nipponnikka was done on the Japanese island of Minami Torishima on 23 November 2009, at sunrise and was a Live Internet Broadcast. Stromajer and Zorman abandoned two robots in the Pacific Ocean.

The act of abandoning is the act of liberation: if you love something, set it free! Štromajer and Zorman therefore abandoned two of their  Silverlit R/C Program-a-BOT robots (€36 in retail) in the loneliness of the Pacific Ocean, at the easternmost point of Japan, the Land of the Rising Sun—two suns, one for each robot!

[[Minami Torishima]] is an isolated island in the north-western Pacific Ocean. The hottest place in Japan, it is the easternmost Japanese territory, lying some 1,848 kilometres southeast of Tokyo. It takes about 45 minutes to walk around the triangular-shaped, low-lying island which has an area of 1.2 square kilometres. The island is unusual because the closer to the coast, the higher the elevation: the central area of the island is 1 metre below sea level whilst the coast is about 5 to 8 metres above. There is an airport and a radio station on the island. The island is presently used for weather observation, but little else.

===The Future of Ballettikka Internettikka (2009 - Present)===
Igor wants to complete one more project with the robots. He plans on travelling to Antarctica to abandon another robot. He is abandoning the next robot in Antarctica as he wants the robots to be at every point on a compass. He has already placed them in the north and east, however, he said he will not be leaving one in the west, for unclear reasons. Igor said this isn’t the end of Ballettikka Internettikka.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19491">{{Judaism}}The relationship between '''[[Judaism]] and [[politics]]''' is a historically complex subject, and has evolved over time concurrently with both changes within Jewish society and religious practice, and changes in the secular societies that [[Jews]] live in. In particular, Jewish political thought can be split into four major eras: '''biblical''' (prior to Roman rule), '''rabbinic''' (from roughly the 100 BCE to 600 CE), '''medieval''' (from roughly 600 CE to 1800 CE), and '''modern''' (18th century to the present day). 

Political leadership is a common topic in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and several different political models are described across its canon, usually composed of some combination of [[Tribe|tribal]] [[federation]], [[monarchy]], a [[Kohen|priestly]] [[theocracy]], and rule by [[Prophet|prophets]]. Political organization during the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]] and [[History of European Jews in the Middle Ages|Medieval]] generally involved semi-autonomous rule by Jewish councils and courts (with council membership often composed purely of [[Rabbi|rabbis]]) that would govern the community and act as representatives to [[secular]] authorities outside the Jewish community. Beginning in the 19th century, and coinciding with the expansion of the political rights accorded to individual Jews in European society, Jews would affiliate with and contribute theory to a wide range of political movements and philosophies.

==Biblical Models==

{{MoreInfo}}

There are many models for political leadership described in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Stuart Cohen has pointed out that there are three separate power centers depicted in the Hebrew Bible: the priesthood, the royal throne, and the prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Cohen, ''The Three Crowns''&lt;/ref&gt;

One model of Biblical politics is the model of the tribal federation, where power is shared among different tribes and institutions. Another is the model of limited constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"&gt;Daniel Elazar, [http://www.jcpa.org/dje/books/kincon-ch1.htm "Covenant as the Basis of the Jewish Political Tradition"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible appears to command appointing a king in the Book of Deuteronomy with the following command: "When you come into the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, and you take hold of it and dwell in it, and you say, 'Let me put a king over me like all the nations that are around me', you shall surely put over you a king whom the Lord your God chooses..." (Deut. 17:14-15).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains a complex [[chronicle]] of the [[Kings of Israel]] and [[Kings of Judah|Judah]], written over the course of many generations by authors whose relationships and intimacy with the rulers of the several kingdoms fluctuated widely in both intimacy and respect. Some historical passages of the Hebrew Bible contain intimate portrayals of the inner workings of the royal households of [[Saul]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]]; the accounts of subsequent monarchs are frequently more distanced and less detailed, and frequently begin with the judgement that the monarch "did evil in the sight of the Lord".

[[Daniel Elazar]] has argued that the concept of [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] is the fundamental concept in the Biblical political tradition and in the later Jewish thought that emerges from the Bible.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"/&gt;

==Rabbinic Period==

=== The Sanhedrin ===
{{Main articles|Sanhedrin}}
In [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judea,]] Jewish communities were governed by rabbinical courts known as [[Sanhedrin]]. Lesser Sanhedrin composed of 23 judges were appointed to each city, while a Great Sanhedrin with 71 judges was the highest authority, taking cases appealed from the lower courts. The Sanhedrin served as the leadership of the Jewish community under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, and served as emissaries to the imperial authorities in addition to overseeing religious practice and collecting taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Lightstone; Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion (13 May 2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=s42kv4NGBU4C&amp;pg=PA189 ''Mishnah and the social formation of the early Rabbinic Guild: a socio-rhetorical approach'']. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-0-88920-375-4}}. Retrieved 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish governing body of the [[Second Temple period]], and the codification of the [[Mishnah]] by the [[Tannaim]] during this period laid the foundations for later [[Rabbinic Judaism]].

=== Talmudic sources on political philosophy ===
{{See also|Talmud}}
A statement by Rabbi Judah in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 20b) depicts kingship as the ideal form of Jewish governance, following the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] statement that, "When you come into the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, and you take hold of it and dwell in it, and you say, 'Let me put a king over me like all the nations that are around me', you shall surely put over you a king whom the Lord your God chooses..." (Deut. 17:14-15).&lt;ref name="schechter.org.il"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110821083739/http://www.schechter.org.il/iyounei_chabate.asp?id=238&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Talmud also brings a different interpretation of this verse from Rabbi Nehorai, who is quoted as explaining that, "This section was spoken only in anticipation of their future murmurings, as it is written, and you say, Let me put a king over me..." (Sanhedrin 20b). In many interpretations, Rabbi Nehorai does not think of appointing a king as a strict obligation, but as a concession to later "murmurings" from Israel.&lt;ref name="schechter.org.il"/&gt;

In addition to imagining ideal forms of governance, the rabbis accept a principle to obey the government currently in power. The Talmud makes reference to the principle of ''dina de-malkhuta dina'' ("the law of the land is law"), a principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to any laws of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0005_0_05228.html Dina de-Malkhutah dina ''Jewish Virtual Library'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t9QUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 ''The Jewish Law Annual 1978 p 146 Maimonedes on '''Din de-Malkhuta dina''' (The Law of the State is Law) '' Shmuel Shilo ''Senior Lecturer in Jewish Law. Hebrew University of Jerusalem'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Period==
{{MoreInfo}}

=== The Qahal ===
{{Main articles|Qahal}}
An autonomous form Jewish government in the Middle Ages was known as the [[Qahal|Qahal{{Clarify|reason=Where and when were Qahal'im convened?|date=April 2018}}]] (more often spelled ''Kahal''), a form of government which many Jews saw as exemplifying Jewish principles. The kahal had regulatory control over Jewish communities in a given region; they administered commerce, hygiene, sanitation, charity, [[Jewish education]], ''[[kashrut]]'', and relations between landlords and their tenants. It provided a number of community facilities, such as a [[rabbi]], a [[mikveh|ritual bath]], and an [[gemach|interest-free loan facility for the Jewish community]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Louis Finkelstein]], ''Jewish Self-Government in the Middle Ages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Caro]], ''[[Shulkhan 'Arukh]]'', ''[[Hoshen Mishpat]]'' chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; The kahal even had sufficient authority that it could arrange for individuals to be expelled from [[synagogue]]s, [[excommunication|excommunicating]] them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'', (1989) volume 2, entry for ''Kahal''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Jewish political philosophy ===
Some medieval political theorists such as [[Maimonides]] and [[Rabbeinu Nissim]] saw kingship as ideal. Maimonides' views the commandment in Deuteronomy to appoint a king as a clear positive ideal, following the Talmudic teaching that "three commandments were given to Israel when they entered the land: to appoint a king, as it says, 'You shall surely put over you a king'..."&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', "The Laws of Kings and their Wars" 1:1)&lt;/ref&gt; A large section of Maimonides' legal code, the [[Mishneh Torah]], titled "The Laws of Kings and their Wars", deals with the ideal model of kingship, especially in the messianic era, and also concerning ruling over non-Jewish subjects through the [[Noachide laws]]. Other sections of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (mostly also in Sefer Shofetim, the book of Judges, where the laws of kingship are also found) is dedicated to the laws relating to legislators and judges.

Whereas Maimonides' idealized kingship, other medieval political theorists, such as [[Abravanel]], saw kingship as misguided. According to Abravanel, the commandment in Deuteroneomy to appoint a king is not a positive commandment at all. Rather, monarchy is a bad model, as "kingship is very harmful to the general public".&lt;ref name="schechter.org.il"/&gt; Later on, other Jewish philosophers such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] would lay the groundwork for [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], arguing for ideas such as the [[separation of church and state]]. Spinoza's writings caused him to be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]]&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, Steven M. (2001). Spinoza's Heresy: Immortality and the Jewish Mind. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 120. {{ISBN|0-19-926887-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Jewish community of [[Amsterdam]], although his work and legacy has been largely rehabilitated, especially amongst [[Secular Judaism|secular Jews]] in the 20th and 21st centuries&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1EFC3E54167A93C7AB178FD85F4D8285F9 &lt;nowiki&gt;"Einstein believes in "Spinoza's God"; Scientist Defines His Faith in Reply, to Cablegram From Rabbi Here.

Retrieved 8 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Modern Period==

{{MoreInfo}}

With [[Jewish Emancipation]], the institution of the Qahal as an autonomous entity was officially abolished. Jews increasingly became participants in the wider political and social sphere of larger nations. As Jews became citizens of states with various political systems, and argued about whether to [[Zionism|found their own state]], Jewish ideas of the relationship between Judaism and politics developed in many different directions.

===In Europe===

In the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, when there was a large Jewish population in Europe, some Jews favored various forms of [[liberalism]], and saw them as connected with Jewish principles. Some Jews allied themselves with a range of [[Jewish political movements]]. These included [[Socialism|Socialist]] and [[Bundism|labor]] movements favored by the [[Jewish left]], [[Zionist]] movements, [[Jewish Autonomist]] movements, [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|Territorialist]] movements, and [[Jewish Anarchism]] movements. [[Haredi]] Jews formed an organization known as [[World Agudath Israel]] which espoused Haredi Jewish political principles. 

==== 21st Century ====
In the 21st century, shifts are occurring. The Jewish community in Great Britain, one of the largest in the diaspora, is leaning conservative, as a poll published by the Jewish Chronicle in early 2015 shows. Of British Jews polled, 69% would vote for the Conservative Party, while 22% would vote for the Labour Party. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the voter population, which, according to a BBC poll, had Conservatives and Labor almost tied at about a third each. Jews have typically been a part of the British middle class, traditional home of the Conservative Party, though the number of Jews in working-class communities of London is in decline. The main voting bloc of poorer Jews in Britain now, made up primarily of ultra-Orthodox, votes "en masse" for the Conservatives. Attitudes toward [[Israel]] influence the vote of three out of four of British Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/133505/huge-majority-british-jews-will-vote-tory-jc-poll-reveals Huge majority of British Jews will vote Tory, JC poll reveals] The JC.com, 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/218262/how-ed-miliband-lost-britains-jewish-voters/ How Ed Miliband Lost Britain's Jewish Voters] The Jewish Daily Forward, 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A shift toward conservatism has also been exhibited in France, where about half of the Jewish population is Sephardic. Jérôme Fourquet, director of the IFOP, the French polling organization, notes that there is a "pronounced preference" for right-wing politics among French Jews. During the 2007 election, Jews (Orthodox or not) represent the strongest pillar of support for Sarkozy after observant Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/151738/french-jews-mostly-side-with-sarkozy/ French Jews Mostly Side With Sarkozy] The jewish Daily Forward, 22 february 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{List|section|date=November 2017}}
{{See also|Jews and politics in the United States}}

=== 19th Century ===

==== American Civil War ====
During the [[American Civil War]], Jews were divided in their views of [[slavery]] and [[Abolitionism|abolition]]. Prior to 1861, there were virtually no rabbinical sermons on slavery. The silence on this issue was probably a result of fear that the controversy would create conflict within the Jewish community. Some Jews owned slaves or traded them, and the livelihoods of many in the Jewish community of both the North and South were tied to the slave system. Most southern Jews supported slavery, and some, like Judah P. Benjamin, advocated its expansion. The abolitionist Ben Wade, who knew Benjamin in the U.S. Senate, described him as "an Israelite with Egyptian principles". Northern Jews sympathized with the South, and few were abolitionists, seeking peace and remaining silent on the subject of slavery. America's largest Jewish community, New York's Jews, were "overwhelmingly pro-southern, pro-slavery, and anti-Lincoln in the early years of the war". However, eventually, they began to lean politically toward "Father Abraham", his Republican party, and emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/179441/jews-mostly-supported-slavery-or-kept-silent-d/?p=all Jews Mostly Supported Slavery — Or Kept Silent — During Civil War] The Jewish Daily Forward, 5 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st Centuries ===
While earlier Jewish immigrants tended to be politically conservative, the wave of Eastern European Jews starting in the early 1880s, were generally more liberal or left-wing, and became the political majority.&lt;ref name="Hasia Diner 2004"&gt;[[Hasia Diner]], ''The Jews of the United States. 1654 to 2000'' (2004), ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the 20th century since 1936, the vast majority of Jews in the United States have been aligned with the Democratic Party. Many religious supporters of the [[Jewish left]] have argued that left-wing values vis-à-vis [[social justice]] can be traced to [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious texts, including the [[Tanakh]] and later texts, which include a strong endorsement of hospitality to "the stranger" and the principle of [[Income redistribution|redistribution of wealth]] in the Biblical idea of [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee]] - as well as a tradition of challenging authority, as exemplified by the Biblical [[Prophet]]s.

American rabbinic leaders who have advanced a progressive political agenda grounded in Jewish principles have included:
*[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)]] of the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement
*[[Arthur Waskow]] of the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement
*[[Jill Jacobs (rabbi)|Jill Jacobs]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]
*[[David Saperstein (rabbi)|David Saperstein]] of [[Reform Judaism]]

Other prominent Jews who have argued based on Jewish principles for a progressive political agenda have included:
*[[Ruth Messinger]]

Towards the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] launched initiatives to woo American Jews away from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. While a solid majority of American Jews continues to be aligned with the Democratic Party, many have argued that there is increased Jewish support for political conservatism. (The "[[List of Jewish American politicians]]" illustrates the diversity of Jewish political thought and of the roles Jews have played in American politics.)

Rabbinic leaders who have advanced a conservative political agenda grounded in Jewish principles have included:
*[[Seymour Siegel]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]
*[[David Dalin]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]

Other prominent Jews who have argued based on Jewish principles for a conservative political agenda have included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=Murray |title=The Changing Jewish Political Profile |journal=American Jewish History |date=2003 |volume=91 |issue=3/4 |pages=423–438 |jstor=23887289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish political philosophy in North America====

Significant Jewish political philosophers in North America have included:
*[[David Novak]], a rabbi and philosopher at the [[University of Toronto]], associated with the [[Union for Traditional Judaism]]
*[[Alan Mittleman]], a rabbi and philosopher at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]
*[[Daniel Elazar]], a professor of [[political science]] at [[Bar-Ilan University]] and [[Temple University]]
*[[Michael Walzer]], a political theorist at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]
*[[Michael Sandel]], a political philosopher at [[Harvard University]]
*[[Robert Nozick]], a late political philosopher at [[Harvard University]]
*[[Murray Rothbard]], a late anarcho-capitalist philosopher and economist at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]
*[[Ronald Dworkin]], a philosopher of law and political philosopher at [[New York University]]

===In Israel===
{{Main|Religious Zionism}}
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}

The development of a political system in Israel drew largely on European models of governance, rather than on models from the Jewish political tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Elazar, [http://www.jcpa.org/dje/books/kincon-intro.htm The Jews' Rediscovery of the Political and its Implications], sees a "strong inclination toward centralized control of every aspect of public life brought from their European experiences by the state's molders and shapers".&lt;/ref&gt; Some political figures in Israel, however, have seen their principles as based in Judaism. This is especially pronounced in political parties that see themselves as religious parties, such as [[Shas]], [[United Torah Judaism]], and [[The Jewish Home]].

Recent interest in developing political theory grounded in Jewish sources has been spurred on by the activities of the neo-conservative [[Shalem Center]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/funded-by-u-s-neocons-think-tank-researchers-now-carving-israeli-policy-1.276236&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''k''-synchronized sequence}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], a '''''k''-synchronized sequence''' is an infinite [[sequence]] of terms ''s''(''n'') characterized by a [[Finite-state machine|finite automaton]] taking as input two strings ''m'' and ''n'', each expressed in some fixed [[Radix|base]] ''k'', and accepting if ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''(''n''). The class of ''k''-synchronized sequences lies between the classes of [[Automatic sequence|''k''-automatic sequences]] and [[k-regular sequence|''k''-regular sequences]].

==Definitions==

===As relations===
Let Σ be an alphabet of ''k'' symbols where ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, and let [''n'']&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the base-''k'' representation of some number ''n''. Given ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, a subset ''R'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^{r}&lt;/math&gt; is ''k''-synchronized if the relation {([''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., [''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)} is a right-synchronized&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Frougny | first1 = C. | last2 = Sakarovitch | first2 = J. | title = Synchronized rational relations of finite and infinite words | journal = Theoret. Comput. Sci. | volume = 108 | year = 1993 | pages = 45–82 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(93)90230-Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rational set#Rational relations and rational functions|rational relation]] over Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, where (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''R''.&lt;ref name=CM&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language-theoretic===
Let ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 be a natural number and let ''f'': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; be a map, where both ''n'' and ''f''(''n'') are expressed in base ''k''. The sequence ''f''(''n'') is ''k''-synchronized if the language of pairs &lt;math&gt;\{(n, f(n))\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Regular language|regular]].

==History==
The class of ''k''-synchronized sequences was introduced by Carpi and Maggi.&lt;ref name=CM /&gt;

==Example==

===Subword complexity===
Given a ''k''-automatic sequence ''s''(''n'') and an infinite string ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''(1)''s''(2)..., let ρ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(n) denote the subword complexity of ''S''; that is, the number of distinct [[Substring|subwords]] of length ''n'' in ''S''. Goč, Schaeffer, and Shallit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Goč | first1 = D. | last2 = Schaeffer | first2 = L. | last3 = Shallit | first3 = J. | others = Editors Béal MP., Carton O. | title = Subword complexity and ''k''-synchronization | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume=7907 | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year=2013 | isbn=978-3-642-38770-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that there exists a finite automaton accepting the language
:&lt;math&gt;
\{(n, m)_k \mid n \geq 0 \text{ and } m = \rho_S(n)\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This automaton guesses the endpoints of every contiguous block of symbols in ''S'' and verifies that each subword of length ''n'' starting within a given block is novel while all other subwords are not. It then verifies that ''m'' is the sum of the sizes of the blocks. Since the pair (''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is accepted by this automaton, the subword complexity function of the ''k''-automatic sequence ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-synchronized.

==Properties==
''k''-synchronized sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties. A non-exhaustive list of these properties is presented below.
*Every ''k''-synchronized sequence is [[k-regular sequence|''k''-regular]].&lt;ref name=CM26&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every [[Automatic sequence|''k''-automatic sequence]] is ''k''-synchronized. To be precise, a sequence ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-automatic if and only if ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-synchronized and ''s''(''n'') takes on finitely many terms.&lt;ref name=CM28&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.8&lt;/ref&gt; This is an immediate consequence of both the above property and the fact that every ''k''-regular sequence taking on finitely many terms is ''k''-automatic.
*The class of ''k''-synchronized sequences is closed under termwise sum and termwise composition.&lt;ref name=CM21&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CM22&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;
*The terms of any ''k''-synchronized sequence have a linear growth rate.&lt;ref name=CM25&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.5&lt;/ref&gt;
*If ''s''(''n'') is a ''k''-synchronized sequence, then both the subword complexity of ''s''(''n'') and the palindromic complexity of ''s''(''n'') (similar to subword complexity, but for distinct [[palindrome]]s) are ''k''-regular sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Carpi | first1 = A. | last2 = D'Alonzo | first2 = V. | title = On factors of synchronized sequences | journal = Theoret.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20720">[[Brazil]] has established a strong public policy using Clean Development Mechanism Projects to reduce [[methane emissions]] from [[landfill]]s. An important component of these projects is the sale of avoided emissions by the private market to generate revenue.

==Introduction==
Faced with serious pollution challenges, [[Brazil]] established [[public policy]] that would create incentives for the foreign and national private market to invest financial, technological, and human resources in the country.  The premise is that experienced companies would bring their technology to Brazil, in an effort to reduce [[methane]] gas emissions.  The specific technology and projects discussed in this article refer to [[landfill gas]] projects.  Although this technology was new to Brazil in the early 2000s when companies first began implementing them, these methods were not new to [[Europe]] or [[North America]].  Additionally, Brazil is just one of many countries participating in similar projects around the world.

==Background==
Brazil signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on April 29, 1998 and ratified it on August 23, 2002.&lt;ref name="UNFCCC PDF"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Estimated projections by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) show that by 2012, Brazil will have 102 million [[certified emission reductions]] (CER), a $1,225 million value.  Unlike its fellow BRIC countries, in Brazil the largest component of potential CER projects is landfill gas projects, with a 31.3% share.&lt;ref name="BRIC Plus" /&gt;  According to the national survey on basic sanitation (PNSB) conducted in 2008, all of the 5,564 municipalities have access to basic sanitation.&lt;ref name="PNSB 2008 Study"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Environmental Sanitation Technology Company (CETESB) study, the 6,000 waste sites in Brazil receive 60,000 tonnes of waste per day.  Seventy-six percent (76%) of this waste goes to dumps with no management, gas collection, or water treatment.  This same study showed that 83.18% of Brazil's methane gas emissions come from uncontrolled waste sites.&lt;ref name="CETESB Study"&gt;

==Landfill gas projects==
Private companies have submitted CDM projects to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) to use [[landfill gas]] (LFG) discharges from waste management sites to earn carbon credits or CER.  There are over 100 LFG CDM projects in Brazil.&lt;ref name="BRIC Plus" /&gt;  The diagram below illustrates the process.&lt;ref name = "LFG White Paper"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carbon Credit Flow Chart.png|center|750px]]
First, once the waste management company has developed the landfill with the new technology, (1a) it calculates how much methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) would have been emitted into the air '''without''' its intervention.  (1b) Then it converts the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into carbon equivalents (C0&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;).  (2a) Next, the company projects how much methane it expects to emit into the air, '''with''' the new technology.  Again, (2b) it converts the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into C0&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;.  (3) Next, the company determines the avoided emissions or CER but subtracting the emission projections with the technology from the baseline emissions without the technology.  (4) Once credited, the company sells the CER through a broker to companies that will produce emissions greater than their allotted capacity.

===SASA===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; landfill is located in Tremembé in São Paulo State of Brazil.  Onyx SASA is a subsidiary of [[Veolia Environnement]] and is an officially registered project with UNFCCC, as of November 24, 2005.  SenterNovem, an agency of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Netherlands, is a partner in the project.  The following flow chart depicts the process used by the landfill:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Landfill Gas Clean Development Mechanism Monitoring System.png|center|750px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or carbon equivalents (CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;) are captured by the vertical wells.  (2) Next, a horizontal drain that is connected to the vertical wells extracts the CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;.  (3) Then, a high density collection pipe captures the CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; and transfers it to the evaporator.  (4) Any CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; that did not evaporate, is transferred to an enclosed flare.	(5) The remaining emissions are then vented into the air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the filing of the report, Onyx SASA anticipated the landfill would accrue 700,625 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; from 2003 through 2012 in CER.  As of 2011, Onyx SASA has filed monitoring reports for the periods of 2003 through 2007.  The following chart outlines the actual CER realized to date:

&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of the EPLGP is to reduce greenhouse emissions.  The following schematic illustrates the process of capturing and recycling the gas emissions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Active Gas Recovery Landfill.png|center|500px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
As illustrated above, (1) wells installed in the landfill collect the methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  (2) Next, high density pipes connected to the wells transfer the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to the blower.  (3) Any remaining CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is then sent to the flare.  (4) Last, the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is flared into the air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
^The notable increase in actual CER versus the projected CER is due to the increase in waste received by the landfill, from 2.5 tons per day as reported in the CDM application to 5 tons per day.

===Presidential decree N° 7.390 of 2010===
The decree specifies how Brazil quantifies greenhouse emissions, how it will achieve the reduction, and a legal requirement for estimating annual emissions.  The policy will use Brazil's 2005 emission rate as the business as usual base line for comparison of future emissions.  The Policy:&lt;ref name="Pres Climate Decree 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil Policy Memo"&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Incorporating Climate Change Policy into Domestic Legislation
| accessdate = March 5, 2011
| author = Brazilian Embassy
| date = December 9, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provides authority for adopting mitigation actions to achieve the reduction goal
* Requires reduction efforts to be compatible with sustainable development and economic and social interests
* Designates instruments for implementation, include the National Climate Change Plan and the National Climate Change Fund
* Establishes sectoral plans for mitigation and adaptation in forests, agriculture, energy, and transportation
* Creates the Brazilian Market for Emissions Reductions (MBRE) for trading in avoided emissions certificates

Specifically, the decree lists the following Action Plans:&lt;ref name="Pres Climate Decree 2010" /&gt;
#Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon
#Prevention and Control of Deforestation and Forest Fires in the Cerrado
#Ten Year Plan for Expansion of Energy
#Consolidation of an Economy of Low-Carbon in Agriculture
#Reducing Emissions from Steel

Per the decree, the Sectoral Plans will include:&lt;ref name="Pres Climate Decree 2010" /&gt;
#Emission reduction target in 2020 and incremental goals with a maximum interval of three years
#Actions to be implemented
#Definition of indicators for monitoring and evaluating effectiveness
#Proposed regulatory instruments and incentives for implementation
#Competitive alignment with industry studies' estimated costs and impacts

Per the decree, the following sectors are included in the estimations:&lt;ref name="Pres Climate Decree 2010" /&gt;
#Change of Land Use: 1,404 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; (e=equivalent)
#Energy: 868 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;
#Agriculture: 730 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;
#Industrial Processes and Waste: 234 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;

The National Climate Change Fund "supports mitigation and adaptation projects and will rely principally on a to-be-determined portion of future oil and gas revenues."&lt;ref name="Pres Climate Decree 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil Policy Memo" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12091">'''Language expectancy theory''' ('''LET''') is a theory of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985; M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994; M. Burgoon, Jones &amp; Stewart, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The theory assumes language is a rules-based system, in which people develop expected norms as to appropriate language usage in given situations.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;M. Burgoon and Miller. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, unexpected linguistic usage can affect the receiver's behavior resulting from attitudes towards a persuasive message.

==Background==
Created by Michael Burgoon, a retired professor of medicine from the University of Arizona, and Gerald R. Miller, the inspiration for LET was sparked by Brooks' work on expectations of language in 1970. Burgoon, Jones and Stewart furthered the discussion with the idea of linguistic strategies and message intensity in an essay published in 1975. The essay linked linguistic strategies, or how a message is framed, to effective persuasive outcomes. The original work for the language expectation theory was published in 1978. Titled "An empirical test of a model of resistance to persuasion", it outlined the theory through 17s.

==Expectations==
The theory views language expectancies as enduring patterns of anticipated communication behavior which are grounded in a society's [[psychological]] and [[culture|cultural norms]]. Such [[social influence|societal forces]] influence language and enable the identification of non-normative use; violations of linguistic, syntactic and semantic expectations will either facilitate or inhibit an audience's receptivity to persuasion.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Burgoon claims applications for his theory in management, media, politics and medicine, and declares that his empirical research has shown a greater effect than [[expectancy violations theory]], the domain of which does not extend to the spoken word.

LET argues that typical language behaviors fall within a normative "bandwidth" of [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s determined by a source's perceived credibility, the individual listener's normative expectations and a group's [[normative social influence|normative social climate]], and generally supports a [[sexism|gender-stereotypical reaction]] to the use of [[profanity]], for example.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994"&gt;M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication expectancies are said to derive from three factors: 
#  The communicator – individual features, such as [[ethos]] or [[source credibility]], personality, appearance, social status and [[gender]].
#  The relationship between a receiver and a communicator, including factors such as attraction, similarity and status equality.
#  Context; i.e., privacy and formality constraints on interaction.

==Violations==
Violating social norms can have a positive or negative effect on persuasion. Usually people use language to conform to social norms; but a person's intentional or accidental deviation from expected behavior can have either a positive or negative reaction.Language Expectancy Theory assumes that language is a rule-governed system and people develop expectations concerning the language or message strategies employed by others in persuasive attempts (Burgoon, 1995). Expectations are a function of cultural and sociological norms and preferences arising from cultural values and societal standards or ideals for competent communication.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

When observed, behavior is preferred over what was expected or when a listener's initial negative evaluation causes a speaker to conform more closely to the expected behavior. The deviation can be seen as positive,&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon, 1994; M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; but when language choice or behavior is perceived as unacceptable or inappropriate behavior, the violation is negatively received and can inhibit the receptivity to a persuasive appeal.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994"/&gt;

Positive violations occur (b) when negatively evaluated sources conform more closely than expected to cultural values or situational norms. This can result in overly positive evaluation of the source and change promoted by the actor (Burgoon, 1995).

Negative violations, resulting from language choices that lie outside socially acceptable behavior in a negative direction, produce no attitude or behavior change in receivers.

==Summary of propositions==
Language expectancy theory is based on 17 propositions.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Those propositions can be summarized as listed below:
* 1, 2 and 3: People create expectations for language. Those expectations determine whether messages will be accepted or rejected by an individual. Breaking expectations positively results in a behavior change in favor of the persuasive message while a breaking expectations negatively results in no change or an opposite behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;
* 4, 5 and 6: Individuals with perceived credibility (those who hold power in a society) have the freedom in persuasion to select varied language strategies (wide bandwidth). Those with low credibility and those unsure of their perceived credibility are restricted to low aggression or compliance-gaining messages to be persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7, 8 and 9:  Irrelevant fear and anxiety tactics are better received using low-intensity and verbally unaggressive compliance-gaining. Intense and aggressive language use result in lower levels of persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10, 11 and 12: For the persuader, an individual who is experiencing cognitive stress will use lower intensity messages. If a communicator violates his/her norms of communication, they will experience cognitive stress.&lt;ref name="Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 126"&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
* 13 and 14: Pretreatments forewarn receivers of the persuasive attacks (supportive, refutational or a combination). When Persuasive messages do not violate expectations created by the pretreatments, resistance to persuasion is conferred. When pretreatment expectations of persuasive messages are violated, receivers are less resistant to persuasion.&lt;ref name="Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 126"/&gt;   
* 15, 16 and 17: Low intensity attack strategies are more effective than high intensity attack strategies when overcoming resistance to persuasion created in pretreatment. The first message in a string of arguments methodically affects the acceptance of the second message. When expectations are positively violated in the first message, the second will be persuasive. When expectations are negatively violated in the first message, the second will not be persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard &amp; Pfau, 2001, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of intensity==
These propositions give rise to the impact of [[language intensity]]—defined by [http://comm.colorado.edu/bowersj John Waite Bowers]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} as a quality of language that "indicates the degree to which the speaker's attitude toward a concept deviates from neutrality"&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 1963, p. 345; 1964, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;—on persuasive messages.&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon and Miller, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists have concentrated on two key areas: (1) intensity of language when it comes to gender roles and (2) credibility.

The perceived credibility of a source can greatly affect a message's persuasiveness. Researchers found that credible sources can enhance their appeal by using intense language; however, less credible speakers are more persuasive with low-intensity appeals.&lt;ref name="bdd"&gt;M. Burgoon, Dillard &amp; Doran, 1983; M. Burgoon, Hunsaker &amp; Dawson, 1994; M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, females are less persuasive than males when they use intense language because it violates the expected behavior,&lt;ref name="bdd"/&gt; but are more persuasive when they use low-intensity language. Males, however, are seen as weak when they argue in a less intense manner. Theorists argue further that females and speakers perceived as having low credibility have less freedom in selecting message strategies and that the use of aggressive language negatively violates expectations.&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgoon, Dillard &amp; Doran, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
To better explain the theory we look at the expectations and societal norms for a man and a woman on their first date. If the man pushed for further physical intimacy after dinner, the societal expectation of a first date would be violated. The example below with Margret and Steve depicts such a scene. 

Margret: ''"I had a really good time tonight, Steve. We should do it again."''

Steve: ''"Let's cut the crap. Do you want to have sex?"''

Margret: ''"Uhhh..."''

Margret's language expectations of a first date were violated. Steve chooses an aggressive linguistic strategy. If Margret views Steve as a credible and appealing source, she may receive the message positively and, thus, the message would be persuasive. If Margret perceives Steve as an ambiguous or low-credible source, Steve will not be persuasive. In such a case, Steve should have used a low-aggressive message in his attempt to win Margret to his idea of having sex.

==Criticism==
* Determining whether a positive or negative violation has occurred can be difficult.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, 1993"&gt;M. Burgoon, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; When there is no attitude or behavior change it may be concluded that a negative violation has occurred (possibly related to a boomerang effect). Conversely, when an attitude or behavior change does occur it may be too easy to conclude a positive violation of expectations has occurred.
* Scholars are beginning to see LET as out of date research. The theory itself may be plausible, but the assumption women, who use intense language, are low credible communicators is less prevalent in a society moving towards greater rights for minorities and the oppressed.
* The theory has also been critiqued for being too "grand" in its predictive and explanatory goals.&lt;ref name="M. Burgoon, 1993"/&gt; Burgoon counters that practical applications of his research conclusions are compelling enough to negate this criticism.

'''Life-cycle engineering''' (LCE) is an approach to assess the environmental impacts in conjunction with economic impacts under consideration of technical boundary conditions. Scope of the assessment is usually the whole life cycle of a product consisting of production, use phase and end of life.
The [[environmental impact]]s are assessed using environmental [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA). The economic impacts are assessed according to the [[Whole-life cost|life cycle costing]] (LCC) approach. Technical boundary conditions are taken into account providing some limitations on the model, thus verifying the technical feasibility.

LCE aims to deliver a consistent standard of living for future generations that can be maintained indefinitely. Not only does LCE aim to reduce negative impacts on the environment but it can also be used to reduce [[Cost|economic costs]] for businesses and every day society. 

One aspect of LCE for businesses is the extension of a part of a [[Product life cycle|products life-cycle]]. The method of involving incremental innovation within production can be seen as a main way to achieve this. The combination of innovation together with technology allows for the function of products to be pushed further, allowing designers to improve the quality of how products meet expanding customer needs. 
The key themes are economic, social, environmental and technological. All these themes are interlinking and can be influenced by life cycle engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">A '''limit-experience''' ({{lang-fr|expérience limite}}) is a type of action or experience which approaches the edge of living in terms of its intensity and its seeming impossibility.  This approach has led to the seeking of limit experiences as a sort of dark [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  A limit experience breaks the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] from itself.  The idea is associated with writers [[Georges Bataille]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], and [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=University of Wellington Research Archive|url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical instances of limit experiences include abandonment, fascination, suffering, madness, and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2007) p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bataille==

Working in a French tradition of [[abjection]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; reaching back to [[Baudelaire]] and his paradoxes - "O filthy grandeur! O sublime disgrace!"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Boris Cyrulnik, ''Resilience'' (2009) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; - Bataille was early struck by what he saw as "the fact that these two complete contrasts were identical - divine ecstasy and extreme horror".&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to challenge [[surrealism]] with a kind of anti-idealism searching for what he called the impossible by breaking rules until you reached something beyond all rules.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, he strove for what Foucault would call "the point of life which lies as close as possible to the impossibility of living, which lies at the limit or the extreme".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "The 'Experience Book'," in Remarks on Marx: Conversations with Duccio Trombadori,
trans. R. James Goldstein and James Cascaito [New York: Semiotext(e),
1991], 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the edge of limits where the ability to comprehend experience breaks down that Bataille sought to live.&lt;ref&gt;B. Noys, ''George Bataille, : A Critical Introduction'' (2000) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foucault==

For Foucault, "the idea of a limit-experience that wrenches the subject from itself is what was important to me in my reading of [[Nietzsche]], Bataille, and Blanchot".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gutting ed., p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the systems of philosophy and psychology, and their conceptions of reality and the unified subject, could be challenged and exposed, in favour of what systems/consciousness had to refuse and exclude.&lt;ref&gt;Gutting ed., p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

How far Foucault's fascination with intense experiences provides a key to his entire body of work is however the subject of debate, with limit experiences arguably being absent from his later writings on sexuality and discipline, if strongly associated with the cult of the mad artist in ''[[The History of Madness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gutting ed., p. 23-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Limit-experience is a type of somaesthetic "edgework" that goes on to test the limits of ordered reality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Lacan==

Influenced by Bataille, from whom he drew the idea of impossibility,&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] explored the role of limit-experiences - such as "Desire, boredom, confinement, revolt, prayer, sleeplessness...and panic"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ėcrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; - in the formation of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].

He also adopted some of Bataille's views on love, seeing it as predicated on man having previously "experienced the limit within which, like desire, he is bound".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; He saw [[Sadomasochism|masochism]] in particular as a limit experience&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (1996)p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; - something which fed into his article ''Kant avec Sade''.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Concepts'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taylor==

In describing the conditions of belief Taylor attests to a sense of fullness, joy and fulfillment:

[...]an experience which unsettles and breaks through our ordinary sense of being in the world, with its familiar objects, activities and points of reference [...] when "ordinary reality is 'abolished' and something terrifyingly other shines through"[...]&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], ''A Secular Age'' (2007) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider ramifications==

Concern for limit experiences fed into [[existential phenomenology]];&lt;ref&gt;T. Rajan et al, ''After Poststructuralism'' (2002) p. 248-9&lt;/ref&gt; and through figures like [[Sartre]] reached the anti-psychiatrists of the 1960s with their cult of authenticity in the pain of extreme madness.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Diski, ''The Sixties'' (2009) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12847">[[Image:Economics Gini coefficient2.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|A typical Lorenz curve]]
In [[economics]], the '''Lorenz curve''' is a graphical representation of the [[distribution of income]] or of [[wealth]]. It was developed by [[Max O. Lorenz]] in 1905 for representing [[Economic inequality|inequality]] of the [[wealth distribution]].

The curve is a [[graph of a function|graph]] showing the proportion of overall income or wealth assumed by the bottom ''x''% of the people, although this is not rigorously true for a finite population (see below). It is often used to represent [[income distribution]], where it shows for the bottom ''x''% of households, what percentage (''y''%) of the total income they have. The [[percentage]] of households is plotted on the ''x''-axis, the percentage of income on the ''y''-axis.  It can also be used to show distribution of [[Asset (economics)|asset]]s.  In such use, many economists consider it to be a measure of [[social inequality]].

The concept is useful in describing inequality among the size of individuals in [[ecology]]&lt;ref name=EcolgyArticle&gt;{{cite journal

==Explanation==
Points on the Lorenz curve represent statements like "the bottom 20% of all households have 10% of the total income."

A perfectly equal income distribution would be one in which every person has the same income.  In this case, the bottom ''N''% of society would always have ''N''% of the income.  This can be depicted by the straight line ''y'' = ''x''; called the "line of perfect equality."

By contrast, a perfectly unequal distribution would be one in which one person has all the income and everyone else has none.  In that case, the curve would be at ''y'' = 0% for all ''x'' &lt; 100%, and ''y'' = 100% when ''x'' = 100%. This curve is called the "line of perfect inequality."

The [[Gini coefficient]] is the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the observed Lorenz curve to the area between the line of perfect equality and the line of perfect inequality. The higher the coefficient, the more unequal the distribution is. In the diagram on the right, this is given by the ratio ''A''/(''A+B''), where ''A'' and ''B'' are the areas of regions as marked in the diagram.

== Definition and calculation==
The Lorenz curve can usually be represented by a function ''L''(''F''), where ''F'', the cumulative portion of the population, is represented by the horizontal axis, and ''L'', the cumulative portion of the total wealth or income, is represented by the vertical axis.

For a population of size ''n'', with a sequence of values ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1 to ''n'', that are indexed in non-decreasing order ( ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;), the Lorenz curve is the [[continuous function|continuous]] [[piecewise linear function]] connecting the points ( ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ), ''i'' = 0 to ''n'', where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, and for ''i'' = 1 to ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;F_i = i/n\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_i = \Sigma_{j=1}^i \; y_j\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_i = S_i / S_n \, &lt;/math&gt;

For a [[probability mass function|discrete probability function]] ''f''(''y''), let ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1 to ''n'', be the points with non-zero probabilities indexed in increasing order ( ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;).  The Lorenz curve is the continuous piecewise linear function connecting the points ( ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ), ''i'' = 0 to ''n'', where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, and for ''i'' = 1 to ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;F_i = \Sigma_{j=1}^i \; f(y_j)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_i = \Sigma_{j=1}^i \; f(y_j)\,y_j\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_i = S_i / S_n \, &lt;/math&gt;

For a [[probability density function]] ''f''(''x'') with the cumulative distribution function  ''F''(''x''), the Lorenz curve ''L'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; L(F(x))=\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{x} t\,f(t)\,dt}{\int_{-\infty}^\infty t\,f(t)\,dt} =\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{x} t\,f(t)\,dt}{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; denotes the average. The Lorenz curve ''L(F)'' may then be plotted as a function parametric in x: ''L(x)'' vs. ''F(x)''. In other contexts, the quantity computed here is known as the length biased (or size biased) distribution; it also has an important role in renewal theory.

Alternatively, for a [[cumulative distribution function]] ''F''(''x'') with inverse ''x''(''F''), the Lorenz curve ''L''(''F'') is directly given by:

:&lt;math&gt; L(F)=\frac{\int_0^F x(F_1)\,dF_1}{\int_0^1 x(F_1)\,dF_1} &lt;/math&gt;

The inverse ''x''(''F'') may not exist because the cumulative distribution function has intervals of constant values.   However, the previous formula can still apply by generalizing the definition of ''x''(''F''):
:''x''(''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = [[infimum|inf]] {''y'' : ''F''(''y'') &amp;ge; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}

For an example of a Lorenz curve, see [[Pareto distribution]].

==Properties==
[[File:Lorenz curve of Denmark, Hungary, and Namibia.png|thumb|A practical example of a Lorenz curve: the Lorenz curves of Denmark, Hungary, and Namibia|upright=1.2]]
A Lorenz curve always starts at (0,0) and ends at (1,1).

The Lorenz curve is not defined if the mean of the probability distribution is zero or infinite.

The Lorenz curve for a probability distribution is a [[continuous function]].  However, Lorenz curves representing discontinuous functions can be constructed as the limit of Lorenz curves of probability distributions, the line of perfect inequality being an example.

The information in a Lorenz curve may be summarized by the [[Gini coefficient]] and the [[Lorenz asymmetry coefficient]].&lt;ref name=EcolgyArticle /&gt;

The Lorenz curve cannot rise above the line of perfect equality. 

If the variable being measured cannot take negative values, the Lorenz curve:
*cannot sink below the line of perfect inequality,
*is [[increasing function|increasing]].
Note however that a Lorenz curve for [[net worth]] would start out by going negative due to the fact that some people have a negative net worth because of debt.

The Lorenz curve is invariant under positive scaling.  If '''''X''''' is a random variable, for any positive number ''c'' the random variable ''c'' '''X''' has the same Lorenz curve as '''''X'''''.

The Lorenz curve is flipped twice, once about F = 0.5 and once about ''L'' = 0.5, by negation.  If '''''X''''' is a random variable with Lorenz curve ''L''&lt;sub&gt;'''X'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''), then &amp;minus;'''''X''''' has the Lorenz curve:
: ''L''&lt;sub&gt; &amp;minus; '''X''' &lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; ''L''&lt;sub&gt; '''X''' &lt;/sub&gt;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''F'')

The Lorenz curve is changed by translations so that the equality gap ''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''L''(''F'') changes in proportion to the ratio of the original and translated means.  If '''''X''''' is a random variable with a Lorenz curve ''L''&lt;sub&gt; '''X''' &lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') and mean ''μ''&lt;sub&gt; '''X''' &lt;/sub&gt;, then for any constant ''c'' ≠ &amp;minus;''μ''&lt;sub&gt; '''X''' &lt;/sub&gt;, '''''X''''' + ''c'' has a Lorenz curve defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;F - L_{X+c}(F) = \frac{\mu_X}{\mu_X + c} ( F - L_X(F))\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a cumulative distribution function ''F''(''x'') with mean ''μ'' and (generalized) inverse ''x''(''F''), then for any ''F'' with 0 &amp;lt; ''F'' &amp;lt; 1 :
*If the Lorenz curve is differentiable:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d L(F)}{d F} = \frac{x(F)}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
*If the Lorenz curve is twice differentiable, then the probability density function ''f''(''x'') exists at that point and:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 L(F)}{d F^2} = \frac{1}{\mu\,f(x(F))}\,&lt;/math&gt;
*If ''L''(''F'') is continuously differentiable, then the tangent of ''L''(''F'') is parallel to the line of perfect equality at the point ''F''(''μ'').  This is also the point at which the equality gap ''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''L''(''F''), the vertical distance between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, is greatest.  The size of the gap is equal to half of the relative [[mean absolute deviation]]:
::&lt;math&gt;F(\mu) - L(F(\mu)) = \frac{\text{mean absolute deviation}}{2\,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4390">'''Meaning''' is a concept used in psychology as well as in other fields such as philosophy, linguistics, semiotics and sociology. 

These [[multidisciplinary]] uses of the term are not independent and can more or less overlap. Within each of these fields, there are different ways in which the term ''meaning'' is constructed and used; each construction can match related constructions in other fields. At the deepest level, each construction is associated with an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] position. The concept of "meaning" is thus used differently in different epistemological traditions in each field. The [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]], for example, associated meaning with scientific verification.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[The verifiability theory of meaning]].&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of meaning is therefore understood differently in different schools of psychology (as well as in different schools overall).

==Behaviorism==

According to [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], meaning is the modern version of "idea". Like an idea, a meaning is said to be expressed or communicated by an utterance. A meaning explains the occurrence of a particular word in the sense that if there had been a different meaning to be expressed, a different word would probably have appeared. Meaning has certain advantages over ideas because they have the possibility to be located outside the skin, and thus, according to Skinner, meanings can be observed directly.&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Wilfrid (1980). ''Behaviorism, language and meaning''. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 61, 3-30. http://www.ditext.com/sellars/blm.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Verbal Behavior. Chapter One. B.F. SKINNER. 1947

==Cognitive psychology==
[[Jerome Bruner]], one of the founding fathers of cognitive psychology, wrote: "Very early on, ... emphasis began shifting from 'meaning' to 'information', from the construction of meaning to the processing of information. These are profoundly different matters. The key factor in the shift was the introduction of computation as the ruling metaphor and of computability as a necessary criterion of a good theoretical model. Information is indifferent with respect to meaning..." (Bruner, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, Jerome (1990). Acts of meaning. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==German critical psychology== 
German [[critical psychology]] provides a metatheoretical framework for research on both psychological and computational tasks. One important part of this is the logical-historical development of the meaning category. It is shown that meaning is nothing absolute but subjective. Meaning is neither a property of things nor only present as an imagination of cognition. Thus, meanings cannot be "defined" or "assigned" as commonly thought. Meanings arise from societal production of use-value." (Meretz, 1999, p. 126)&lt;ref&gt;Meretz, Stefan (1999). Meaning concepts used in psychology and computer sciences. In: Maiers, Wolfgang et al. ''Challenges to theoretical psychology'' North York, Ontario: Captus Press, Inc. (pp. 120-128).&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar understanding developed in cultural studies of science: "Cultural studies thereby articulate dynamic, expressive conceptions of meaning, knowledge, and power, which contrast sharply with the standard approaches to these phenomena within philosophy and social theory (Rouse 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Rouse J. (1996). ''Engaging Science: How to Understand its Practices Philosophically''. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; 1999&lt;ref&gt;Rouse J. (1999). Understanding scientific practices. In: Biagioli M (ed.) ''The Science Studies Reader''. Routledge, New York,
pp. 442-456.&lt;/ref&gt;). On such accounts, meaning is not a property of utterances or actions; the term `meaning' instead articulates the ways in which such performances inferentially draw upon and transform the field of prior performances in which they are situated." (Rouse, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;3126)&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, J. (2001). Cultural Studies of Science. In: Smelser, N. J. &amp; Baltes, P. B. (eds.) International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Amsterdam: Elsevier. (Pp. 3125-3127).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Modernism/modernity''''' is a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] established in 1994 by Lawrence Rainey and Robert van Hallberg. It covers methodological, archival, and theoretical approaches to [[Modernism|modernist studies]] in the long modernist period. Since 2001 it has been the official publication of the [[Modernist Studies Association]].

In February 2014, the journal started operating with two editorial offices: a permanent MSA office and a permanent office at the University of York. It is published quarterly in January, April, September, and November by [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. The journal is also available in digital form through library databases such as [[Project Muse]].

Each issue includes a section of thematic essays, multi-work review essays, individual [[book review]]s, and a list of "recent books of interest." The journal occasionally has guest-edited or special issues, with a series of related essays on one topic. The journal has also launched an "Out of the Archives" series, in which out-of-print and neglected works of [[modernism]] are reintroduced to its readership.

The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Debra Rae Cohen ([[University of South Carolina]]) and Christopher Bush ([[Northwestern University]]). Previous editors include Ann Ardis ([[University of Delaware]]), Cassandra Laity ([[Drew University]]), and [[Jeffrey Schnapp]] ([[Harvard University]]).

In 2003, ''Modernism/modernity'' won the Phoenix Award from the [[Council of Editors of Learned Journals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celj.org/phoenix The Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620041839/http://www.celj.org/phoenix |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Scheman received her bachelor's in philosophy from [[Barnard College]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She went on to receive a master's and doctorate in philosophy from [[Harvard University]], in 1971 and 1978, respectively.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Scheman is currently a professor at University of Minnesota, and a guest professor at [[Umeå University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  During her time at the University of Minnesota, she served as the chair of the Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies department from 1986-1989, and has served as the Director of Graduate Studies since 2007.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  Prior to her current positions, Scheman has held appointments at the [[University of Ottawa]],  [[Columbia University]], the [[Center for Advanced Feminist Studies]] (including serving as director from 1991-1992 and associate dean of the graduate school from 2000-2003,) and the [[University of Gothenburg]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Scheman also serves as a member of the editorial boards of ''[[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]]'' and ''NORA (the Nordic Women's Studies Journal)''.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She also served as an associate editor of ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'' between 1990 and 1993.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas==
Scheman was one of the first academics to read [[Wittgenstein]] in a feminist light, and, likewise, was one of the first academics to bring Wittgenstein's ideas to feminism.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=June 2012: Naomi Scheman|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/june2012naomischeman|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Scheman's work has centered around the implications of the interactions between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  Scheman is especially interested in the ways in which transgressive practices shine light on the actions of [[normative|normal people]], and on how insights gleaned from these observations allow for the chance of acting differently.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; (Scheman is also a strong believer that mental phenomena such as race and class are socially constructed, and is a strong opponent of [[physicalism]].)&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;

==Publications==

A '''noble savage''' is a literary [[stock character]] who embodies the concept of the [[Indigenous peoples|indigene]], outsider, wild human, an "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]" who has not been "corrupted" by [[civilization]], and therefore symbolizes humanity's innate goodness.

In English, the phrase first appeared in the 17th century in [[John Dryden]]'s heroic play ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (1672),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27Av0zEmlqkC&amp;pg=PA106 |first=Earl |last=Miner |contribution=The Wild Man Through the Looking Glass |editor1-first=Edward |editor1-last=Dudley |editor2-first=Maximillian E |editor2-last=Novak |title=The Wild Man Within: An Image in Western Thought from the Renaissance to Romanticism |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1972 |page=106|isbn=9780822975991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was used in reference to newly created man. "Savage" at that time could mean "wild beast" as well as "wild man".&lt;ref&gt;OED s.v. "savage" B.3.a.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase later became identified with the idealized picture of "nature's gentleman", which was an aspect of 18th-century [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]]. The noble savage achieved prominence as an [[oxymoron]]ic rhetorical device after 1851, when used sarcastically as the title for a satirical essay by English novelist [[Charles Dickens]], who some believe may have wished to disassociate himself from what he viewed as the "feminine" [[sentimentality]] of 18th and early 19th-century romantic [[primitivism]].{{efn|Grace Moore speculates that Dickens, although himself an abolitionist, was motivated by a wish to differentiate himself from what he believed was the feminine sentimentality and bad writing of female philanthropists and writers such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], with whom he, as a reformist writer, was often associated.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Moore, "Reappraising Dickens's 'Noble Savage'", ''The Dickensian'' 98:458 (2002): 236–243.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The idea that humans are essentially good is often attributed to the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]],{{Citation needed|reason=debate about the goodness of man goes back much earlier, in Christian philosophy, original sin is the concept of people being born with inherent sinfulness|date=February 2018}} a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] supporter of [[constitutional monarchy]]. In his ''Inquiry Concerning Virtue'' (1699), Shaftesbury had postulated that the [[Moral sense theory|moral sense]] in humans is natural and innate and based on feelings, rather than resulting from the indoctrination of a particular [[religion]]. Shaftesbury was reacting to [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s justification of an absolutist [[Centralized government|central state]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', "Chapter XIII", in which Hobbes famously holds that the [[state of nature]] is a "war of all against all" in which men's lives are "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". Hobbes further calls the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] an example of a contemporary people living in such a state. Although writers since antiquity had described people living in pre-civilized conditions, Hobbes is credited with inventing the term "State of Nature". [[Ross Harrison (academic)|Ross Harrison]] writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term."&lt;ref&gt;''Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece'', Ross Harrison, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what is sometimes believed, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] never used the phrase ''noble savage'' (French ''[[:fr:bon sauvage|bon sauvage]]''). However, the character of the ''noble savage'' appeared in French literature at least as early as [[Jacques Cartier]] (coloniser of [[Québec]], speaking of the [[Iroquois]]) and [[Michel de Montaigne]] (philosopher, speaking of the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]]) in the 16th century.

==Pre-history of the noble savage==
[[File:Southerne Oroonoko 1776 performance.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Illustration of a 1776 performance of Oroonoko.|right|200px|Oroonoko kills Imoinda in a 1776 performance of [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''[[Oroonoko]].'']]

[[Tacitus]]' [[Germania (book)|''De origine et situ Germanorum'']] (''Germania''), written {{circa}} 98 AD, has been described as a predecessor of the modern noble savage concept, which started in the 17th and 18th centuries in [[Western literature|western European]] [[travel literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradies auf Erden?: Mythenbildung als Form von Fremdwahrnehmung : der Südsee-Mythos in Schlüsselphasen der deutschen Literatur Anja Hall Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 16th and 17th centuries, the figure of the indigene or "savage"—and later, increasingly, the "good savage"—was held up as a reproach to European civilization, then in the throes of the [[French Wars of Religion]] and [[Thirty Years' War]]. During the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (1572), some ten to twenty thousand men, women, and children were massacred by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] mobs, chiefly in [[Paris]], but also throughout France. This horrifying breakdown of civil control was deeply disturbing to thoughtful people on both sides of the religious divide.

{{quotation|Foremost among the atrocities connected with the religious conflict was the St. Batholomew's massacre (August 224, 1572) ... The Parisian populace [was] inflamed by anti-Protestant preaching, and a general massacre ensued, devastating the Huguenot community of Paris. Bodies were stripped naked, mutilated, and thrown into the Seine. The massacres spread throughout France into the fall of 1572, spreading as far as Bordeaux [home of Montaigne]. ... Estimates of the total number of deaths vary widely; modern historians tend to accept the approximate number of ten thousand. ... Huguenots were not entirely innocent of massacres themselves|Ullrich Langer, "Montaigne's political and religious context", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Montaigne''&lt;ref&gt;"Montaigne's political and religious context" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Montaigne'' (Cambridge, 2005), p. 14 (cf. also Tom Conley, "The ''Essays'' and the New World" p. 80 in the same volume.)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In his famous essay "Of Cannibals" (1580),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/montaigne.html Essay "Of Cannibals"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel de Montaigne]]—himself a Catholic—reported that the [[Tupinambá people]] of Brazil ceremoniously eat the bodies of their dead enemies as a matter of honour. However, he reminded his readers that Europeans behave even more barbarously when they burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion (he implies): "One calls 'barbarism' whatever he is not accustomed to."

{{quotation|The cannibal practices are admitted [by Montaigne] but presented as part of a complex and balanced set of customs and beliefs which "make sense" in their own right. They are attached to a powerfully positive morality of valor and pride, one that would have been likely to appeal to early modern codes of honor, and they are contrasted with modes of behavior in the France of the wars of religion which appear as distinctly less attractive, such as torture and barbarous methods of execution (...)&lt;ref&gt;Terence Cave, ''How to Read Montaigne'' (London: Granta Books, 2007), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "Of Cannibals", Montaigne uses [[cultural relativism|cultural]] (but not [[moral relativism|moral]]) [[relativism]] for the purpose of satire. His cannibals are neither noble nor especially good, but not worse than 16th-century Europeans. In this [[Classical liberalism|classical]] [[Humanism|humanist]] view, [[Convention (norm)|customs]] differ but people everywhere are prone to cruelty, a quality that Montaigne detested.

{{quotation|In his ''Essais'' ... Montaigne discussed the first three wars of religion (1562–63; 1567–68; 1568–70) quite specifically; he had personally participated in them, on the side of the royal army, in southwestern France. The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre led him to retire to his lands in the Périgord region, and remain silent on all public affairs until the 1580s. Thus, it seems that he was traumatized by the massacre. To him, cruelty was a criterion that differentiated the Wars of Religion from previous conflicts, which he idealized. Montaigne considered that three factors accounted for the shift from regular war to the carnage of civil war: popular intervention, religious demagogy and the never-ending aspect of the conflict..... He chose to depict cruelty through the image of hunting, which fitted with the tradition of condemning hunting for its association with blood and death, but it was still quite surprising, to the extent that this practice was part of the aristocratic way of life. Montaigne reviled hunting by describing it as an urban massacre scene. In addition, the man-animal relationship allowed him to define virtue, which he presented as the opposite of cruelty. … [as] a sort of natural benevolence based on ... personal feelings. … Montaigne associated the propensity to cruelty toward animals, with that exercised toward men. After all, following the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, the invented image of Charles IX shooting Huguenots from the Louvre palace window did combine the established reputation of the king as a hunter, with a stigmatization of hunting, a cruel and perverted custom, did it not?|David El Kenz|Massacres During the Wars of Religion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massviolence.org/Massacres-during-the-Wars-of-Religion?cs=print David El Kenz,"Massacres During the Wars of Religion", 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The treatment of indigenous peoples by the Spanish [[Conquistador]]s also produced a great deal of bad conscience and recriminations.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, ''The Fall of the Natural Man: the American Indian and the origins of comparative ethnology. Cambridge Iberian and Latin American Studies.''(Cambridge University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who witnessed it, may have been the first to idealize the simple life of the indigenous Americans. He and other observers praised their simple manners and reported that they were incapable of lying.

European angst over [[colonialism]] inspired fictional treatments such as [[Aphra Behn]]'s novel ''[[Oroonoko]], or the Royal Slave'' (1688), about a [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in [[Suriname|Surinam]] in the [[West Indies]]. Behn's story was not primarily a protest against [[slavery]]; rather, it was written for money, and it met readers' expectations by following the conventions of the European [[romance novel]]la. The leader of the revolt, Oroonoko, is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince, and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a classical [[Golden Age]]. He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. Behn's story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright [[Thomas Southerne]], who stressed its sentimental aspects, and as time went on, it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism, remaining very popular throughout the 18th century.

==Origin of term==
In English, the phrase ''Noble Savage'' first appeared in poet [[John Dryden]]'s heroic play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (1672):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I am as free as nature first made man,
Ere the base laws of servitude began,
When wild in woods the noble savage ran.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hero who speaks these words in Dryden's play is here denying the right of a prince to put him to death, on the grounds that he is not that prince's subject. These lines were quoted by Scott as the heading to Chapter 22 of his "A Legend of Montrose" (1819). "Savage" is better taken here in the sense of "wild beast", so that the phrase "noble savage" is to be read as a witty conceit meaning simply the beast that is above the other beasts, or man.

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologist]] Ter Ellingson believes that Dryden had picked up the expression "noble savage" from a 1609 travelogue about Canada by the French explorer [[Marc Lescarbot]], in which there was a chapter with the ironic heading: "The Savages are Truly Noble", meaning simply  that they enjoyed the right to hunt game, a privilege in France granted only to hereditary aristocrats. It is not known if Lescarbot was aware of Montaigne's stigmatization of the aristocratic pastime of hunting, though some authors believe he was familiar with Montaigne. Lescarbot's familiarity with Montaigne, is discussed by Ter Ellingson in ''The Myth of the Noble Savage''.&lt;ref&gt;The Myth of the Noble Savage, Ter Ellingson, (University of California, 2001), note p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dryden's day the word "savage" did not necessarily have the connotations of cruelty now associated with it. Instead, as an adjective, it could as easily mean "wild", as in a wild flower, for example. Thus he wrote in 1697, 'the savage cherry grows. ...';.&lt;ref&gt;(OED 'Savage', A, I, 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar, Audrey Smedley, believes that: "English conceptions of 'the savage' were grounded in expansionist conflicts with Irish pastoralists and more broadly, in isolation from, and denigration of neighboring European peoples." and Ellingson agrees that "The ethnographic literature lends considerable support for such arguments"&lt;ref&gt;(Ellingson [2001], p. 389).&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the [[Stock character|stock figure]] that in English is called the "noble savage" has always been simply "le bon sauvage", "the good wild man", a term without any of the paradoxical frisson of the English one. [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] is generally credited for being at the origin of this myth in his [[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]] (1580), especially "Of Coaches" and "Of Cannibals". This character, an idealized portrayal of "Nature's Gentleman", was an aspect of 18th-century [[sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]], along with other stock characters such as, the Virtuous Milkmaid, the Servant-More-Clever-than-the-Master (such as [[Sancho Panza]] and [[Figaro (character in operas and plays)|Figaro]], among countless others), and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born. The use of stock characters (especially in theater) to express moral truths derives from classical antiquity and goes back to [[Theophrastus]]'s ''Characters'', a work that enjoyed a great vogue in the 17th and 18th centuries and was translated by [[Jean de La Bruyère]]. The practice largely died out with advent of 19th-century [[Literary realism|realism]] but lasted much longer in genre literature, such as adventure stories, Westerns, and, arguably, science fiction. Nature's Gentleman, whether European-born or exotic, takes his place in this cast of characters, along with the Wise Egyptian, Persian, and Chinaman. "But now, alongside the Good Savage, the Wise Egyptian claims his place." Some of these types are discussed by Paul Hazard in ''The European Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;''The European Mind'', Paul Hazard (1680–1715) (Cleveland, Ohio: Meridian Books [1937], 1969), pp. 14–24 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;

He had always existed, from the time of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', where he appears as [[Enkiddu]], the wild-but-good man who lives with animals. Another instance is the untutored-but-noble medieval knight, [[Parsifal]]. The [[Bible|Biblical]] shepherd boy [[David]] falls into this category. The association of virtue with withdrawal from society—and specifically from cities—was a familiar theme in religious literature.

''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' an Islamic philosophical tale (or thought experiment) by [[Ibn Tufail]] from 12th-century [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]], straddles the divide between the religious and the secular. The tale is of interest because it was known to the [[New England Puritan culture and recreation|New England Puritan]] divine, [[Cotton Mather]]. Translated into English (from Latin) in 1686 and 1708, it tells the story of Hayy, a [[Feral child|wild child]], raised by a gazelle, without human contact, on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean. Purely through the use of his reason, Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society, where he revealed to be a believer of [[Natural Theology|natural religion]], which Cotton Mather, as a Christian Divine, identified with [[Primitive Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle R. Quiggle, “Ibn Tufayl's Hayy Ibn Yaqdan in New England: A Spanish-Islamic Tale in Cotton Mather's ''Christian Philosopher''?” ''Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory'', 64: 2 (Summer 2008): 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian, but not a Noble Savage.

The ''locus classicus'' of the 18th-century portrayal of the American Indian are the famous lines from [[Alexander Pope]]'s "[[Essay on Man]]" (1734):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind
Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
His soul proud Science never taught to stray
Far as the solar walk or milky way;
Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,
Behind the cloud-topp'd hill, a humbler heav'n;
Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,
Some happier island in the wat'ry waste,
Where slaves once more their native land behold,
No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold!
To be, contents his natural desire;
He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire:
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
His faithful dog shall bear him company.''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Pope, writing in 1734, the Indian was a purely abstract figure— "poor" either meant ironically, or applied because he was uneducated and a heathen, but also happy because he was living close to Nature. This view reflects the typical [[Age of Reason]] belief that men are everywhere and in all times the same as well as a Deistic conception of natural religion (although Pope, like Dryden, was Catholic). Pope's phrase, "Lo the Poor Indian", became almost as famous as Dryden's "noble savage" and, in the 19th century, when more people began to have first hand knowledge of and conflict with the Indians, would be used derisively for similar sarcastic effect.{{efn|In 1859, journalist Horace Greeley, famous for his advice to "Go west, young man", used "Lo, The Poor Indian" as the title for a letter written from Colorado:
{{quotation|I have learned to appreciate better than hitherto, and to make more allowance for, the dislike, aversion, contempt wherewith Indians are usually regarded by their white neighbors, and have been since the days of the Puritans. It needs but little familiarity with the actual, palpable aborigines to convince anyone that the poetic Indian—the Indian of Cooper and Longfellow—is only visible to the poet's eye. To the prosaic observer, the average Indian of the woods and prairies is a being who does little credit to human nature—a slave of appetite and sloth, never emancipated from the tyranny of one animal passion save by the more ravenous demands of another. As I passed over those magnificent bottoms of the Kansas, which form the reservations of the Delawares, Potawatamies, etc., constituting the very best corn-lands on earth, and saw their owners sitting around the doors of their lodges at the height of the planting season and in as good, bright planting weather as sun and soil ever made, I could not help saying, "These people must die out—there is no help for them. God has given this earth to those who will subdue and cultivate it, and it is vain to struggle against His righteous decree."|"Lo!

The term was also “a sarcastic reference to those eastern humanitarians whose idea of the Indian was so at variance with the frontiersman's bloodthirsty savage. "The ''Leavenworth, Kansas, Times and Conservative'', for example, commented indignantly on the story of Thomas Alderdice, whose wife was captured and killed by Cheyennes: 'We wish some philanthropists who talk about civilizing the Indians, could have heard this unfortunate and almost broken-hearted man tell his story. We think they would at least have wavered a little in their opinion of the Lo family'"&lt;ref&gt;Louise Barnett, in ''Touched by Fire: the Life, Death, and Mythic Afterlife of George Armstrong Custer'' (University of Nebraska Press [1986], 2006), pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Attributes of romantic primitivism==
{{quotation|On our arrival upon this coast we found there a savage race who ... lived by hunting and by the fruits which the trees spontaneously produced. These people ... were greatly surprised and alarmed by the sight of our ships and arms and retired to the mountains. But since our soldiers were curious to see the country and hunt deer, they were met by some of these savage fugitives. The leaders of the savages accosted them thus: "We abandoned for you, the pleasant sea-coast, so that we have nothing left but these almost inaccessible mountains: at least it is just that you leave us in peace and liberty. Go, and never forget that you owe your lives to our feeling of humanity. Never forget that it was from a people whom you call rude and savage that you receive this lesson in gentleness and generosity. ... We abhor that brutality which, under the gaudy names of ambition and glory, ... sheds the blood of men who are all brothers.  ...  We value health, frugality, liberty, and vigor of body and mind: the love of virtue, the fear of the gods, a natural goodness toward our neighbors, attachment to our friends, fidelity to all the world, moderation in prosperity, fortitude in adversity, courage always bold to speak the truth, and abhorrence of flattery. ...  If the offended gods so far blind you as to make you reject peace, you will find, when it is too late, that the people who are moderate and lovers of peace are the most formidable in war.|[[Fénelon]]|[[Les Aventures de Télémaque|The Adventures of Telemachus]] (1699)&lt;ref&gt;François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, Encounter with the Mandurians, in Chapter IX of ''Telemachus, son of Ulysses'', translated by Patrick Riley (Cambridge University Press, [1699] 1994), pp. 130–131. This didactic novel (arguably the first "boys' book") by the Archbishop of Cambrai, tutor to the seven-year-old grandson of Louis XIV, was perhaps the most internationally popular book of the 18th and early 19th centuries, a favorite of [[Montesquieu]], [[Rousseau]], [[Herder]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], and countless others. Patrick Riley's translation is based on that of Tobias Smollett, 1776 (op cit p. xvii).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1st century AD, sterling qualities such as those enumerated above by Fénelon (excepting perhaps belief in the brotherhood of man) had been attributed by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' to the German barbarians, in pointed contrast to the softened, Romanized [[Gauls]]. By inference Tacitus was criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots—which was the perennial function of such comparisons. Tacitus's Germans did not inhabit a "[[Golden Age]]" of ease but were tough and inured to hardship, qualities which he saw as preferable to the decadent softness of civilized life. In antiquity this form of "hard primitivism", whether admired or deplored (both attitudes were common), co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the "soft primitivism" of visions of a lost [[Golden Age]] of ease and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;For the distinction between "hard" and "soft" primitivism see [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'', Baltimore, I, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

As art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains:{{quotation|There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas,  conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.|[[Erwin Panofsky]], art historian&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Et in Arcadia Ego", in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 18th century the debates about primitivism centered around the examples of the people of Scotland as often as the American Indians. The rude ways of the Highlanders were often scorned, but their toughness also called forth a degree of admiration among "hard" primitivists, just as that of the [[Sparta]]ns and the Germans had done in antiquity. One Scottish writer described his Highland countrymen this way:{{quotation|They greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility; they are incredibly abstemious, and patient of hunger and fatigue; so steeled against the weather, that in traveling, even when the ground is covered with snow, they never look for a house, or any other shelter but their plaid, in which they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope of heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers, must be invincible ...|[[Tobias Smollett]]|[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Smollett]], ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' ([1771] London: Penguin Books, 1967), p. 292. One of the characters in Smollett's ''Humphry Clinker'', Lieutenant Lismahago, is a kind of ludicrous noble savage. A proud and irascible Scotsman of good family and advancing years, Lismahago has been so poorly requited by the government for his services in the Canadian wars that he is planning to return to Canada to live out his days with his Native American common-law wife, in squalor but with more honor and decency than would be possible as a pauper at home.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reaction to Hobbes==
Debates about "soft" and "hard" primitivism intensified with the publication in 1651 of [[Hobbes]]'s ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (or ''Commonwealth''), a justification of absolute monarchy. Hobbes, a "hard Primitivist", flatly asserted that life in a [[state of nature]] was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"—a "war of all against all":

{{quotation|Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of Warre, where every man is Enemy to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short|Hobbes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3207 ''Leviathan'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Reacting to the wars of religion of his own time and the previous century, he maintained that the absolute rule of a king was the only possible alternative to the otherwise inevitable violence and disorder of civil war. Hobbes' hard primitivism may have been as venerable as the tradition of soft primitivism, but his use of it was new. He used it to argue that the state was founded on a [[social contract]] in which men voluntarily gave up their liberty in return for the peace and security provided by total surrender to an absolute ruler, whose legitimacy stemmed from the Social Contract and not from God.

Hobbes' vision of the natural depravity of man inspired fervent disagreement among those who opposed absolute government. His most influential and effective opponent in the last decade of the 17th century was [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]. Shaftesbury countered that, contrary to Hobbes, humans in a state of nature were neither good nor bad, but that they possessed a moral sense based on the emotion of sympathy, and that this emotion was the source and foundation of human goodness and [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]. Like his contemporaries (all of whom who were educated by reading classical authors such as [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Horace]]), Shaftesbury admired the simplicity of life of classical antiquity. He urged a would-be author “to search for that simplicity of manners, and innocence of behavior, which has been often known among mere savages; ere they were corrupted by our commerce” (''Advice to an Author'', Part III.iii). Shaftesbury's denial of the innate depravity of man was taken up by contemporaries such as the popular Irish essayist [[Richard Steele]] (1672–1729), who attributed the corruption of contemporary manners to false education. Influenced by Shaftesbury and his followers, 18th-century readers, particularly in England, were swept up by the cult of [[Sensibility]] that grew up around Shaftesbury's  concepts of [[sympathy]] and benevolence.

Meanwhile, in France, where those who criticized government or Church authority could be imprisoned without trial or hope of appeal, primitivism was used primarily as a way to protest the repressive rule of Louis XIV and XV, while avoiding censorship. Thus, in the beginning of the 18th century, a French travel writer, the [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Baron de Lahontan]], who had actually lived among the [[Wyandot people|Huron Indians]], put potentially dangerously radical [[Deist]] and egalitarian arguments in the mouth of a Canadian Indian, Adario, who was perhaps the most striking and significant figure of the "good" (or "noble") savage, as we understand it now, to make his appearance on the historical stage:

{{quotation|Adario sings the praises of Natural Religion. ... As against society he puts forward a sort of primitive Communism, of which the certain fruits are Justice and a happy life. ... He looks with compassion on poor civilized man—no courage, no strength, incapable of providing himself with food and shelter: a degenerate, a moral ''cretin'', a figure of fun in his blue coat, his red hose, his black hat, his white plume and his green ribands. He never really lives because he is always torturing the life out of himself to clutch at wealth and honors which, even if he wins them, will prove to be but glittering illusions. ... For science and the arts are but the parents of corruption. The Savage obeys the will of Nature, his kindly mother, therefore he is happy. It is civilized folk who are the real barbarians.|Paul Hazard|The European Mind&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Hazard, ''The European Mind (1680–1715)'' ([1937], 1969), pp. 13–14, and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Published in Holland, Lahontan's writings, with their controversial attacks on established religion and social customs, were immensely popular. Over twenty editions were issued between 1703 and 1741, including editions in French, English, Dutch and German.

{{quotation|Interest in the remote peoples of the earth, in the unfamiliar civilizations of the East, in the untutored races of America and Africa, was vivid in France in the 18th century. Everyone knows how Voltaire and Montesquieu used Hurons or Persians to hold up the glass to Western manners and morals, as Tacitus used the Germans to criticize the society of Rome. But very few ever look into the seven volumes of the Abbé Raynal’s ''History of the Two Indies'', which appeared in 1772. It is however one of the most remarkable books of the century. Its immediate practical importance lay in the array of facts which it furnished to the friends of humanity in the movement against negro slavery. But it was also an effective attack on the Church and the sacerdotal system. ... Raynal brought home to the conscience of Europeans the miseries which had befallen the natives of the New World through the Christian conquerors and their priests. He was not indeed an enthusiastic preacher of Progress. He was unable to decide between the comparative advantages of the savage state of nature and the most highly cultivated society. But he observes that “the human race is what we wish to make it", that the felicity of man depends entirely on the improvement of legislation, and ... his view is generally optimistic.|J.B.

Many of the most incendiary passages in Raynal's book, one of the bestsellers of the eighteenth century, especially in the Western Hemisphere, are now known to have been in fact written by [[Diderot]]. Reviewing Jonathan Israel's ''Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights'', Jeremy Jennings, notes that ''The History of the Two Indies'', in the opinion of Jonathan Israel, was the text that "made a world revolution" by delivering "the most devastating single blow to the existing order":

{{quotation|Usually (and incorrectly) attributed to the pen of the Abbé Raynal, its ostensible theme of Europe's colonial expansion allowed Diderot not only to depict the atrocities and greed of colonialism but also to develop an argument in defense of universal human rights, equality, and a life free from tyranny and fanaticism.

In the later 18th century, the published voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] and [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] seemed to open a glimpse into an unspoiled [[Garden of Eden|Edenic culture]] that still existed in the [[Christianization|un-Christianized]] [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]]. Their popularity inspired [[Diderot]]'s ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville|Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville]]'' (1772), a scathing critique of European sexual hypocrisy and colonial exploitation.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], who had negotiated with the Indians during the French and Indian War, protested vehemently against the Paxton massacre that took place at Conestoga, in western Pennsylvania, of December 1763, in which white vigilantes massacred Indian women and children, many of whom had converted to Christianity. Franklin himself personally organized a Quaker militia to control the white population and "strengthen the government". In his pamphlet ''[[Bagatelles and satires (Benjamin Franklin)#Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America|Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America]]'' (1784), Franklin deplored the use of the term "savages" for Native Americans:

{{quote|Savages we call them, because their manners differ from ours, which we think the perfection of civility; they think the same of theirs.|author=[[Benjamin Franklin]]&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt;}}

Franklin used the massacres to illustrate his point that no race had a monopoly on virtue, likening the Paxton vigilantes to  "Christian White Savages'". Franklin cried out to a just God to punish those who carried the Bible in one hand and the hatchet in the other: 'O ye unhappy Perpetrators of this Horrid Wickedness!'"&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt; Franklin praised the Indian way of life, their customs of hospitality, their councils, which reached agreement by discussion and consensus, and noted that many white men had voluntarily given up the purported advantages of civilization to live among them, but that the opposite was rare.

{{quotation|Franklin's writings on American Indians were remarkably free of ethnocentricism, although he often used words such as "savages," which carry more prejudicial connotations in the twentieth century than in his time. Franklin's cultural relativism was perhaps one of the purest expressions of Enlightenment assumptions that stressed racial equality and the universality of moral sense among peoples. Systematic racism was not called into service until a rapidly expanding frontier demanded that enemies be dehumanized during the rapid, historically inevitable westward movement of the nineteenth century. Franklin's respect for cultural diversity did not reappear widely as an assumption in Euro-American thought until Franz Boas and others revived it around the end of the nineteenth century. Franklin's writings on Indians express the fascination of the Enlightenment with nature, the natural origins of man and society, and natural (or human) rights. They are likewise imbued with a search (which amounted at times almost to a ransacking of the past) for alternatives to monarchy as a form of government, and to orthodox state-recognized churches as a form of worship.|[[Bruce E. Johansen]]|Forgotten Founders: Benjamin Franklin, the Iroquois, and the Rationale for the American Revolution&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt;
}}

Though retrospectively it may seem to us that Franklin may have idealized the Indians to make a rhetorical point, the phrase "noble savage" never appears in his writings.

==Erroneous identification of Rousseau with the noble savage==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], like Shaftesbury, also insisted that man was born with the potential for goodness; and he, too, argued that civilization, with its envy and self-consciousness, has made men bad. In his ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Among Men'' (1754), Rousseau maintained that man in a State of Nature had been a solitary, ape-like creature, who was not ''méchant'' (bad), as Hobbes had maintained, but (like some other animals) had an "innate repugnance to see others of his kind suffer" (and this natural sympathy constituted the Natural Man's one-and-only natural virtue).&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy (1923, 1948) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Rousseau's fellow ''[[philosophe]]'', Voltaire, objecting to Rousseau's egalitarianism, who charged him with primitivism and accused him of wanting to make people go back and walk on all fours.{{efn|Voltaire was no believer in human equality: "It is notorious that Voltaire objected to the education of laborers' children"&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gay]], ''The Enlightenment: The Science of Freedom'' (New York: W.W. Norton, [1969] 1977), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Because Rousseau was the preferred philosopher of the radical [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] of the [[French Revolution]], he, above all, became tarred with the accusation of promoting the notion of the "noble savage", especially during the polemics about [[Imperialism]] and [[scientific racism]] in the last half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Ter Ellingson (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the phrase "noble savage" does not occur in any of Rousseau's writings.{{efn|In a review of a book discussing [[Steven Pinker]], Peter Gay writes "As far as the noble savage is concerned, that phrase is from Dryden and does not appear in Rousseau's writings. In the years I taught the history of political theory at Columbia to a sizable class of undergraduates, I would offer students a hundred dollars if they could find "Noble Savage" anywhere in Rousseau.

According to the historian of ideas, Arthur O. Lovejoy:

{{quotation|The notion that Rousseau’s ''Discourse on Inequality'' was essentially a glorification of the State of Nature, and that its influence tended to wholly or chiefly to promote "Primitivism" is one of the most persistent historical errors.|[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O.

}}

In his ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'', Rousseau, anticipating the language of Darwin, states that as the animal-like human species increased there arose a "formidable struggle for existence" between it and other species for food.&lt;ref&gt;(Lovejoy (1960), p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; It was then, under the pressure of necessity, that ''le caractère spécifique de l'espèce humaine''—the specific quality that distinguished man from the beasts—emerged—intelligence, a power, meager at first but yet capable of an "almost unlimited development". Rousseau calls this power the ''faculté de se perfectionner''—perfectibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy attributes the invention of the term to [[Michel-Étienne Turgot|Turgot]] in 1750, but, according to him, it was Rousseau who gave it wide currency. See Lovejoy (1960), p. 24,&lt;/ref&gt; Man invented tools, discovered fire, and in short, began to emerge from the state of nature. Yet at this stage, men also began to compare himself to others: "It is easy to see. ... that all our labors are directed upon two objects only, namely, for oneself, the commodities of life, and consideration on the part of others." ''Amour propre''—the desire for consideration (self regard), Rousseau calls a "factitious feeling arising, only in society, which leads a man to think more highly of himself than of any other." This passion began to show itself with the first moment of human self-consciousness, which was also that of the first step of human progress: "It is this desire for reputation, honors, and preferment which devours us all ... this rage to be distinguished, that we own what is best and worst in men—our virtues and our vices, our sciences and our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers—in short, a vast number of evil things and a small number of good." It is this "which inspires men to all the evils which they inflict upon one another.".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'', as quoted in Lovejoy (1960), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, Rousseau praises the newly discovered "savage" tribes (whom Rousseau does ''not'' consider in a "state of nature"), as living a life that is simpler and more egalitarian than that of the Europeans;  and he sometimes praises this "third stage" it in terms that could be confused with the romantic primitivism fashionable in his times. He also identifies ancient primitive communism under a patriarchy, such as he believes characterized the "youth" of mankind, as perhaps the happiest state and perhaps also illustrative of  how man was intended by God to live. But these stages are not all good, but rather are mixtures of good and bad. According to Lovejoy, Rousseau's basic view of human nature after the emergence of social living is basically identical to that of Hobbes.&lt;ref&gt;"Rousseau's theory of human nature here, in short, is identical with that of Hobbes", Lovejoy (1960), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rousseau does not believe that it is possible or desirable to go back to a primitive state. It is only by acting together in civil society and binding themselves to its laws that men become men; and only a properly constituted society and reformed system of education could make men good.  According to Lovejoy:

{{quotation|For Rousseau, man's good lay in departing from his "natural" state—but not too much; "perfectability" up to a certain point was desirable, though beyond that point an evil. Not its infancy but its ''jeunesse'' [youth] was the best age of the human race. The distinction may seem to us slight enough; but in the mid-eighteenth century it amounted to an abandonment of the stronghold of the primitivistic position. Nor was this the whole of the difference. As compared with the then-conventional pictures of the savage state, Rousseau's account even of this third stage is far less idyllic; and it is so because of his fundamentally unfavorable view of human nature ''quâ'' human. ... His savages are quite unlike Dryden's Indians: "Guiltless men, that danced away their time, / Fresh as the groves and happy as their clime—" or Mrs. Aphra Behn's natives of Surinam, who represented an absolute idea of the first state of innocence, "before men knew how to sin." The men in Rousseau's "nascent society" already had 'bien des querelles et des combats [many quarrels and fights]'; ''l'amour propre'' was already manifest in them ... and slights or affronts were consequently visited with ''vengeances terribles.''&lt;ref&gt;See Lovejoy (1960), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

For Rousseau the remedy was not in going back to the primitive but in reorganizing society on the basis of a properly drawn up social compact, so as to "draw from the very evil from which we suffer [i.e., civilization and progress] the remedy which shall cure it." Lovejoy concludes that Rousseau's doctrine, as expressed in his ''Discourse on Inequality'':

{{quotation|declares that there is a dual process going on through history; on the one hand, an indefinite progress in all those powers and achievements which express merely the potency of man's intellect; on the other hand, an increasing estrangement of men from one another, an intensification of ill-will and mutual fear, culminating in a monstrous epoch of universal conflict and mutual destruction [i.e., the ''fourth'' stage in which we now find ourselves]. And the chief cause of the latter process Rousseau, following Hobbes and Mandeville, found, as we have seen, in that unique passion of the self-conscious animal – pride, self esteem, ''le besoin de se mettre au dessus des autres'' ["the need to put oneself above others"]. A large survey of history does not belie these generalizations, and the history of the period since Rousseau wrote lends them a melancholy verisimilitude. Precisely the two processes, which he described have ... been going on upon a scale beyond all precedent: immense progress in man's knowledge and in his powers over nature, and at the same time a steady increase of rivalries, distrust, hatred and at last "the most horrible state of war" ... [Moreover Rousseau] failed to realize fully how strongly ''amour propre'' tended to assume a collective form ... in pride of race, of nationality, of class.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy (1960), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==19th century belief in progress and the fall of the natural man==
During the 19th century the idea that men were everywhere and always the same that had characterized both classical antiquity and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was exchanged for a more organic and dynamic evolutionary concept of human history. Advances in technology now made the indigenous man and his simpler way of life appear, not only inferior, but also, even his defenders agreed, foredoomed by the inexorable advance of [[social progress|progress]] to inevitable extinction. The sentimentalized "primitive" ceased to figure as a moral reproach to the decadence of the effete European, as in previous centuries. Instead, the argument shifted to a discussion of whether his demise should be considered a desirable or regrettable eventuality. As the century progressed, native peoples and their traditions increasingly became a foil serving to highlight the accomplishments of Europe and the expansion of the European Imperial powers, who justified their policies on the basis of a presumed racial and cultural superiority.&lt;ref&gt;See reference to Frederick E. Hoxie's review of Ter Ellingson's ''Myth of the Noble Savage'' in note 32 below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charles Dickens 1853 article on "The Noble Savage" in ''Household Words''==
In 1853 [[Charles Dickens]] wrote a scathingly sarcastic review in his weekly magazine ''[[Household Words]]'' of painter [[George Catlin]]'s show of American Indians when it visited England. In his essay, entitled [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/2529/ "The Noble Savage"], Dickens expressed repugnance for Indians and their way of life in no uncertain terms, recommending that they ought to be “civilised off the face of the earth”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/2529/ "The Noble Savage"&lt;/ref&gt; (Dickens's essay refers back to Dryden's well-known use of the term, not to Rousseau.) Dickens's scorn for those unnamed individuals, who, like Catlin, he alleged, misguidedly exalted the so-called "noble savage", was limitless. In reality, Dickens maintained, Indians were dirty, cruel, and constantly fighting among themselves. Dickens's satire on Catlin and others like him who might find something to admire in the American Indians or African bushmen is a notable turning point in the history of the use of the phrase.&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"&gt;For an account of Dickens's article see Moore, "Reappraising Dickens's 'Noble Savage'" (2002): 236–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like others who would henceforth write about the topic, Dickens begins by disclaiming a belief in the "noble savage":
{{quotation|To come to the point at once, I beg to say that I have not the least belief in the Noble Savage. I consider him a prodigious nuisance and an enormous superstition. ... I don't care what he calls me. I call him a savage, and I call a savage a something highly desirable to be civilized off the face of the earth.... The noble savage sets a king to reign over him, to whom he submits his life and limbs without a murmur or question and whose whole life is passed chin deep in a lake of blood; but who, after killing incessantly, is in his turn killed by his relations and friends the moment a grey hair appears on his head. All the noble savage's wars with his fellow-savages (and he takes no pleasure in anything else) are wars of extermination—which is the best thing I know of him, and the most comfortable to my mind when I look at him. He has no moral feelings of any kind, sort, or description; and his "mission" may be summed up as simply diabolical.|Charles Dickens&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"/&gt;
}}
Dickens' essay was arguably a pose of manly, no-nonsense realism and a defense of Christianity. At the end of it his tone becomes more recognizably humanitarian, as he maintains that, although the virtues of the savage are mythical and his way of life inferior and doomed, he still deserves to be treated no differently than if he were an Englishman of genius, such as Newton or Shakespeare:

{{quotation|To conclude as I began. My position is, that if we have anything to learn from the Noble Savage, it is what to avoid. His virtues are a fable; his happiness is a delusion; his nobility, nonsense. We have no greater justification for being cruel to the miserable object, than for being cruel to a WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE or an ISAAC NEWTON; but he passes away before an immeasurably better and higher power [i.e., that of Christianity] than ever ran wild in any earthly woods, and the world will be all the better when this place knows him no more.|Charles Dickens&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"/&gt;
}}

==Scapegoating the Inuit: cannibalism and Sir John Franklin's lost expedition==
Although Charles Dickens had ridiculed positive depictions of Native Americans as portrayals of so-called "noble" savages, he made an exception (at least initially) in the case of the Inuit, whom he called  “loving children of the north”,  “forever happy with their lot,” “whether they are hungry or full”, and “gentle loving savages”, who, despite a tendency to steal, have a “quiet, amiable character” ("Our Phantom Ship on an Antediluvian Cruise", ''Household Words'', April 16, 1851). However he soon reversed this rosy assessment, when on October 23, 1854, ''The Times'' of London published a report by explorer-physician [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]] of the discovery by Eskimos of the remains of the [[Franklin's lost expedition|lost Franklin expedition]] along with unmistakable evidence of cannibalism among members of the party:

{{quotation|From the mutilated state of many of the corpses and the contents of the kettles, it is evident that our wretched countrymen had been driven to the last resource—cannibalism—as a means of prolonging existence.
}}

Franklin's widow and other surviving relatives and indeed the nation as a whole were shocked to the core and refused to accept these reports, which appeared to undermine the whole assumption of the cultural superiority of the heroic white explorer-scientist and the imperial project generally. Instead, they attacked the reliability of the Eskimos who had made the gruesome discovery and called them liars. An editorial in ''The Times'' called for further investigation:

{{quotation|to arrive at a more satisfactory conclusion with regard to the fate of poor Franklin and his friends . ... Is the story told by the Esquimaux the true one? Like all savages they are liars, and certainly would not scruple at the utterance of any falsehood which might, in their opinion, shield them from the vengeance of the white man."&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Nayder, “The Cannibal, the Nurse, and the Cook in Dickens’s ‘The Frozen Deep'”, ''Victorian Literature and Culture'' 19 (1991):1.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

This line was energetically taken up by Dickens, who wrote in his weekly magazine:

{{quotation|It is impossible to form an estimate of the character of any race of savages from their deferential behavior to the white man while he is strong. The mistake has been made again and again; and the moment the white man has appeared in the new aspect of being weaker than the savage, the savage has changed and sprung upon him. There are pious persons who, in their practice, with a strange inconsistency, claim for every child born to civilization all innate depravity, and for every child born to the woods and wilds all innate virtue. We believe every savage to be in his heart covetous, treacherous, and cruel; and we have yet to learn what knowledge the white man—lost, houseless, shipless, apparently forgotten by his race, plainly famine-stricken, weak frozen, helpless, and dying—has of the gentleness of the Esquimaux nature.|Charles Dickens|The Lost Arctic Voyagers, Household Words, December 2, 1854.
}}

Dr. John Rae rebutted Dickens in two articles in ''Household Words'': “The Lost Arctic Voyagers”, ''Household Words'', No. 248 (December 23, 1854), and "Dr. Rae’s Report to the Secretary of the Admiralty", ''Household Words'', No. 249 (December 30, 1854). Though he did not call them noble, Dr. Rae, who had lived among the Inuit, defended them as  “dutiful” and “a bright example to the most civilized people”, comparing them favorably with the undisciplined crew of the Franklin expedition, whom he suggested were ill-treated and "would have mutinied under privation", and moreover with the lower classes in England or Scotland generally.&lt;ref&gt;See Lillian Nayder (1991), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Nadyer notes: In their order of appearance, Dickens’s articles are: 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers,' (December 2, 1854); 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers' (December 9, 1854); 'The Lost English Sailors' (February 14, 1857); and 'Official Patriotism' (April 25, 1857). Dr. Rae’s articles are 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers' (December 23, 1854); 'Dr. Rae’s Report to the Secretary of the Admiralty' (December 30, 1854); and 'Sir John Franklin and His Crews' (February 3, 1855)".}}

Dickens and Wilkie Collins subsequently collaborated on a melodramatic play, "[[The Frozen Deep]]", about the menace of cannibalism in the far north, in which "the villainous role assigned to the Eskimos in ''Household Words'' is assumed by a working class Scotswoman.&lt;ref&gt;(Nayder [1991], p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Frozen Deep'' was performed as a benefit organized by Dickens and attended by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and Emperor Leopold II of Belgium, among others, to fund a memorial to the Franklin Expedition. (Dr. Rae himself was Scots).

Rae's respect for the Inuit and his refusal to scapegoat them in the Franklin affair arguably harmed his career. Lady Franklin's campaign to glorify the dead of her husband's expedition, aided and abetted by Dickens, resulted in his being more or less shunned by the British establishment. Although it was not Franklin but Rae who in 1848 discovered the last link in the much-sought-after Northwest Passage, Rae was never awarded a knighthood and died in obscurity in London. (In comparison fellow Scot and contemporary explorer David Livingstone was knighted and buried with full imperial honors in Westminster Abbey). However, modern historians have confirmed Rae's discovery of the Northwest Passage and the accuracy of his report on cannibalism among Franklin's crew.&lt;ref&gt;On cannibalism, see, for example: [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article6912227.ece.  Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, "The Arctic heart of darkness: How heroic lies replaced hideous reality after the grim death of John Franklin", ''Times Literary Supplement'', Nov. 11, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian author [[Ken McGoogan]], a specialist on Arctic exploration, states that Rae's willingness to learn and adopt the ways of indigenous Arctic peoples made him stand out as the foremost specialist of his time in cold-climate survival and travel. Rae's respect for Inuit customs, traditions, and skills was contrary to the prejudiced belief of many 19th-century Europeans that native peoples had no valuable technical knowledge or information to impart.&lt;ref&gt;See Ken McGoogan, ''Fatal Passage: The True Story of John Rae, the Arctic Hero Time Forgot'' (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael introduced into the UK Parliament a motion proposing that the House "regrets that Dr Rae was never awarded the public recognition that was his due". In March 2009 Carmichael introduced a further motion urging Parliament to formally state it "regrets that memorials to Sir John Franklin outside the Admiralty headquarters and inside Westminster Abbey still inaccurately describe Franklin as the first to discover the [North West] passage, and calls on the Ministry of Defence and the Abbey authorities to take the necessary steps to clarify the true position."

Dickens's racism, like that of many Englishmen, became markedly worse after the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] of 1857 in India.

{{quotation|The cruelties of the Sepoy natives [toward the whites] have inflamed the nation to a degree unprecedented within my memory. Peace Societies, Aborigines Protection Societies, and societies for the reformation of criminals are silent. There is one cry for revenge.|Thomas Babington Macaulay|Diary&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ellingson (2001), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

It was said that Dickens's racism, “grew progressively more illiberal over the course of his career".&lt;ref&gt;William Oddie ''Dickens and Carlyle: the Question of Influence'' (London: Centenary) pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Dickens and the Indian Mutiny”, ''Dickensian'' 68 (January 1972), 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myron Magnet, ''Dickens and the Social Order'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Moore, on the other hand, argues that Dickens, a staunch  abolitionist and opponent of imperialism, had views on racial matters that were a good deal more complex than previous critics have suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Moore, ''Dickens And Empire: Discourses Of Class, Race And Colonialism In The Works Of Charles Dickens (Nineteenth Century Series)'' (Ashgate: 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This event, and the virtually contemporaneous occurrence of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1864), which threatened to, and then did, put an end to slavery, coincided with a polarization of attitudes exemplified by the phenomenon of [[scientific racism]].

==Scientific racism==
In 1860, [[John Crawfurd]] and [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] mounted a defense of British [[imperialism]] based on "[[scientific racism]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Ellingson (2001), pp. 249–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawfurd, in alliance with Hunt, took over the presidency of the [[Ethnological Society of London]], which was an offshoot of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]], founded with the mission to defend indigenous peoples against slavery and colonial exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1843raigbi.html History page: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]. The Ethnological Society later merged with the [[Anthropological Society of London]] to form the Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Invoking "science" and "realism", the two men derided their "philanthropic" predecessors for believing in human equality and for not recognizing that mankind was divided into superior and inferior races. Crawfurd, who opposed [[Darwinian evolution]], "denied any unity to mankind, insisting on immutable, hereditary, and timeless differences in racial character, principal amongst which was the 'very great' difference in 'intellectual capacity.'" For Crawfurd, the races had been created separately and were different species. Crawfurd was Scots, and thought the Scots "race" superior to all others; whilst Hunt, on the other hand, believed in the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon "race". Crawfurd and Hunt routinely accused those who disagreed with them of believing in "Rousseau's Noble Savage". The pair ultimately quarreled because Hunt believed in slavery and Crawfurd did not.{{efn|Hunt went on to found the rival Anthropological Society of London, with a mission of "promoting the study of Anthropology in a strictly scientific manner" and focused on the issue of race. Like the Ethnological Society, Hunt's Anthropological Society later merged into the Royal Anthropological Institute.}} "As Ter Ellingson demonstrates, Crawfurd was responsible for re-introducing the Pre-Rousseauian concept of 'the Noble Savage' to modern anthropology, attributing it wrongly and quite deliberately to Rousseau.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/foreign_bodies/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html |title=John Crawfurd – 'two separate races' | publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an otherwise rather lukewarm review of Ellingson's book in ''[[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]]'' 4:1 (Spring 2003), Frederick E. Hoxie writes:

{{quotation|For early modern scholars from [St. Thomas] More to Rousseau, descriptions of Indian cultures could provide opportunities to criticize “civilization.” After Hunt and Crawfurd—or at least at about the middle of the 19th century, when both imperial ambition and racial ideology was hardening into national policy in Europe and the U.S.—Indians became foils of a different kind: people whose traditions underscored the accomplishments of Europe. The imperial powers were now the models of human achievement. Ellingson sees this shift and shows us how profoundly it affected popular conceptions of Native people.|Frederick E. Hoxie
}}

"If Rousseau was not the inventor of the Noble Savage, who was?" writes Ellingson,

{{quotation|One who turns for help to [Hoxie Neale] Fairchild's 1928 study,&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie Neale Fairchild, ''The Noble Savage: A Study in Romantic Naturalism'' (New York, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; a compendium of citations from romantic writings on the "savage" may be surprised to find [his book] ''The Noble Savage'' almost completely lacking in references to its nominal subject. That is, although Fairchild assembles hundreds of quotations from ethnographers, philosophers, novelists, poets, and playwrights from the 17th century to the 19th century, showing a rich variety of ways in which writers romanticized and idealized those who Europeans considered "savages", almost none of them explicitly refer to something called the "Noble Savage". Although the words, always duly capitalized, appear on nearly every page, it turns out that in every instance, with four possible exceptions, they are Fairchild's words and not those of the authors cited.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingson (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Ellingson finds that any remotely positive portrayal of an indigenous (or working class) person is apt to be characterized (out of context) as a supposedly "unrealistic" or "romanticized" "Noble Savage". He points out that Fairchild even includes as an example of a supposed "Noble Savage", a picture of a Negro slave on his knees, lamenting lost his freedom. According to Ellingson, Fairchild ends his book with a denunciation of the (always unnamed) believers in primitivism or "The Noble Savage"—who, he feels, are threatening to unleash the dark forces of irrationality on civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingson (2001), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellingson argues that the term "noble savage", an oxymoron, is a derogatory one, which those who oppose "soft" or romantic primitivism use to discredit (and intimidate) their supposed opponents, whose romantic beliefs they feel are somehow threatening to civilization. Ellingson maintains that virtually none of those accused of believing in the "noble savage" ever actually did so. He likens the practice of accusing anthropologists (and other writers and artists) of belief in the noble savage to a secularized version of the [[inquisition]], and he maintains that modern anthropologists have internalized these accusations to the point where they feel they have to begin by ritualistically disavowing any belief in "noble savage" if they wish to attain credibility in their fields. He notes that text books with a painting of a handsome Native American (such as the one by Benjamin West on this page) are even given to school children with the cautionary caption, "A painting of a Noble Savage". West's depiction is characterized as a typical "noble savage" by art historian Vivien Green Fryd, but her interpretation has been contested.&lt;ref&gt;"British and Indian Identities in a Picture by Benjamin West", Leslie Kaye Reinhardt, ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 31: 3 (Spring 1998): 283–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opponents of primitivism==
The most famous modern example of "hard" (or anti-) primitivism in books and movies was [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', published in 1954. The title is said to be a reference to the Biblical devil, Beelzebub. This book, in which a group of school boys stranded on a desert island "revert" to savage behavior, was a staple of high school and college required reading lists during the Cold War.

In the 1970s, film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] professed his opposition to primitivism. Like Dickens, he began with a disclaimer:

{{quote|Man isn't a noble savage, he's an ignoble savage. He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved—that about sums it up. I'm interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him. And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/013072kubrick-profile.html|last=McGregor|first=Craig|title=Nice Boy From the Bronx?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 30, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The opening scene of Kubrick's movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) depicted prehistoric ape-like men wielding weapons of war, as the tools that supposedly lifted them out of their animal state and made them human.

Another opponent of primitivism is the Australian anthropologist [[Roger Sandall]], who has accused other anthropologists of exalting the "noble savage".&lt;ref&gt;For an appraisal of Roger Sandall, see Patrick Wolfe in'' The Anthropological Book Review'', Sept., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A third is archeologist Lawrence H. Keeley, who has criticised a "widespread myth" that "civilized humans have fallen from grace from a simple primeval happiness, a peaceful golden age" by uncovering archeological evidence that he claims demonstrates that violence prevailed in the earliest human societies. Keeley argues that the "noble savage" paradigm has warped anthropological literature to political ends.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Keeley, ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage'' (Oxford, University Press, 1996), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The noble savage is described as having a natural existence. The term ignoble savage has an obvious negative connotation. The ignoble savage is detested—described as having a cruel and primitive existence. Often, the phrase “ignoble savage” was used and abused to justify colonialism. The concept of the ignoble savage gave Europeans the "right" to establish colonies without considering the possibility of preexisting, functional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ad Borsboom, The Savage In European Social Thought: A Prelude To The Conceptualization Of The Divergent Peoples and Cultures Of Australia and Oceania, KILTV, 1988, 419.&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example would be the use of the [[Discovery Doctrine]] which is still used in the courts of the United States of America.

== In fantasy and science fiction ==
The "noble savage" often maps to uncorrupted races in science fiction and fantasy genres, often deliberately as a contrast to "fallen" more advanced cultures, in films such as ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2009/12/avatar_movie_post.html&lt;/ref&gt; and literature including [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRiViwMylSUC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=%22Ghân-buri-Ghân%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;lr=&amp;ei=B_ygS8S6MoyaMrTdtdQH&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Rutledge, Fleming, ''The Battle for Middle-earth: Tolkien's Divine Design in the Lord of the Rings,''] p. 286, William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Two very famous noble savage characters in fantasy and science fiction that are very well known are [[Tarzan]] created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and [[Conan The Barbarian]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]]. [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], [[Thongor]] and such are lesser known. Tarzan and Conan are not only known through their literature, but by movie adaptations and other licensed material.

== Noble savage idea today ==
According to critics like the ''[[Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'''s Tim Robey, romantically idealized portrayals of non-industrialized or exotic people persist in popular films, as for example in ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''&lt;ref name=Robey&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10481755/Tim-Robey-recommends...The-Lone-Ranger.html | title=Tim Robey recommends...The Lone Ranger | publisher=The Telegraph | date=30 November 2013 | accessdate=11 January 2014 | author=Robey, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-jn9p6uuEAC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22 | title=Media Images and Representations | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year=2009 | accessdate=11 January 2014 | author=King, C.

In [[mathematics]], the '''oscillation''' of a function or a sequence is a number that quantifies how much a sequence or function varies between its extreme values as it approaches infinity or a point. As is the case with [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]s there are several definitions that put the intuitive concept into a form suitable for a mathematical treatment: oscillation of a [[sequence]] of [[real number]]s, oscillation of a real valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a point, and oscillation of a function on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (or [[open set]]).

==Definitions==

===Oscillation of a sequence===
Let &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of real numbers. The oscillation &lt;math&gt;\omega(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; of that sequence is defined as the difference (possibly infinite) between the [[limit superior and limit inferior]] of &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(a_n) = \limsup_{n\to\infty} a_n - \liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The oscillation is zero if and only if the sequence converges. It is undefined if &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}&lt;/math&gt; are both equal to +∞ or both equal to −∞, that is, if the sequence tends to +∞ or −∞.

===Oscillation of a function on an open set===
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued function of a real variable.  The oscillation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in its domain is the difference between the [[supremum]] and [[infimum]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(I) = \sup_{x\in I} f(x) - \inf_{x\in I} f(x).&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, if &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a function on a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (such as a [[metric space]]), then the oscillation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(U) = \sup_{x\in U} f(x) - \inf_{x\in U}f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Oscillation of a function at a point===
The oscillation of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of a real variable at a point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the limit as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt; of the oscillation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \omega_f(x_0-\epsilon,x_0+\epsilon).&lt;/math&gt;
This is the same as the difference between the limit superior and limit inferior of the function at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, ''provided'' the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is not excluded from the limits.

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued function on a [[metric space]], then the oscillation is
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \omega_f(B_\epsilon(x_0)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:The function sin(1 over x).svg|thumb|sin (1/''x'') (the [[topologist's sine curve]]) has oscillation 2 at ''x'' = 0, and 0 elsewhere.]]
*1/''x'' has oscillation ∞ at ''x'' = 0, and oscillation 0 at other finite ''x'' and at −∞ and +∞.
*sin (1/''x'') (the [[topologist's sine curve]]) has oscillation 2 at ''x'' = 0, and 0 elsewhere.
*sin ''x'' has oscillation 0 at every finite ''x'', and 2 at −∞ and +∞.
*The sequence 1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1, ... has oscillation 2.

In the last example the sequence is [[Frequency|periodic]], and any sequence that is periodic without being constant will have non-zero oscillation. However, non-zero oscillation does not usually indicate periodicity.

Geometrically, the graph of an oscillating function on the real numbers follows some  path in the ''xy''-plane, without settling into ever-smaller regions. In [[well-behaved]] cases the path might look like a loop coming back on itself, that is, periodic behaviour; in the worst cases quite irregular movement covering a whole region.

== Continuity ==
Oscillation can be used to define [[continuous function|continuity of a function]], and is easily equivalent to the usual ''ε''-''δ'' definition (in the case of functions defined everywhere on the real line): a function ƒ is continuous at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the oscillation is zero;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, Theorem 3.5.2, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; in symbols, &lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; A benefit of this definition is that it ''quantifies'' discontinuity: the oscillation gives how ''much'' the function is discontinuous at a point.

For example, in the [[classification of discontinuities]]:
* in a removable discontinuity, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation;
* in a jump discontinuity, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value ''at'' the point lies between these limits from the two sides);
* in an essential discontinuity, oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist.

This definition is useful in [[descriptive set theory]] to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than ''ε'' (hence a [[G-delta set|G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]]) – and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the [[Lebesgue integrability condition]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, 3.5 "A More Advanced Look at the Existence of the Proper Riemann Integral", pp. 171–177&lt;/ref&gt;

The oscillation is equivalence to the ''ε''-''δ'' definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit ([[lim sup]], [[lim inf]]) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; there is no ''δ'' that satisfies the ''ε''-''δ'' definition, then the oscillation is at least ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and conversely if for every ''ε'' there is a desired ''δ,'' the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.

==Generalizations==
More generally, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a function from a [[topological space]] ''X'' into a [[metric space]] ''Y'', then the '''oscillation of ''f''''' is defined at each ''x'' ∈ ''X'' by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(x) = \inf\left\{\mathrm{diam}(f(U))\mid U\mathrm{\ is\ a\  neighborhood\ of\ }x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

A '''propositional attitude''' is a mental state held by an agent toward a [[proposition]]. Propositional attitudes are often assumed to be the fundamental units of thought and their contents, being propositions, are true or false from the perspective of the person. An agent can have different propositional attitudes toward the same proposition (e.g., "S believes that her ice-cream is cold," and "S fears that her ice-cream is cold").

Linguistically, propositional attitudes are denoted by a verb  (e.g. "believed") governing an embedded "that" clause, for example, 'Sally believed that she had won'.

Propositional attitudes have [[direction of fit|directions of fit]]:  some are meant to reflect the world, others to influence it.

==Overview==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What sort of name shall we give to verbs like 'believe' and 'wish' and so forth?  I should be inclined to call them 'propositional verbs'.  This is merely a suggested name for convenience, because they are verbs which have the ''form'' of relating an object to a proposition.  As I have been explaining, that is not what they really do, but it is convenient to call them propositional verbs.  Of course you might call them 'attitudes', but I should not like that because it is a psychological term, and although all the instances in our experience are psychological, there is no reason to suppose that all the verbs I am talking of are psychological.  There is never any reason to suppose that sort of thing.  (Russell 1918, 227).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What a proposition is, is one thing.  How we feel about it, or how we regard it, is another.  We can accept it, assert it, believe it, command it, contest it, declare it, deny it, doubt it, enjoin it, exclaim it, expect it.  Different attitudes toward propositions are called ''propositional attitudes'', and they are also discussed under the headings of ''[[intentionality]]'' and ''[[linguistic modality]]''.

Many problematic situations in real life arise from the circumstance that many different propositions in many different modalities are in the air at once.  In order to compare propositions of different colours and flavours, as it were, we have no basis for comparison but to examine the underlying propositions themselves.  Thus we are brought back to matters of language and logic.  Despite the name, propositional attitudes are not regarded as psychological attitudes proper, since the formal disciplines of linguistics and logic are concerned with nothing more concrete than what can be said in general about their formal properties and their patterns of interaction.

One topic of central concern is the relation between the modalities of assertion and belief, perhaps with intention thrown in for good measure.  For example, we frequently find ourselves faced with the question of whether or not a person's assertions conform to his or her beliefs.  Discrepancies here can occur for many reasons, but when the departure of assertion from belief is intentional, we usually call that a ''[[lie]]''.

Other comparisons of multiple modalities that frequently arise are the relationships between belief and knowledge and the discrepancies that occur among observations, expectations, and intentions.  Deviations of observations from expectations are commonly perceived as ''[[surprise (emotion)|surprise]]s'', phenomena that call for ''[[explanation]]s'' to reduce the shock of amazement.

A number of software systems are now available to simulate propositional attitudes for industrial purposes, for customer relation management systems, decision support  and content generation (Galitsky 2012).

==Issues==

In logic, the formal properties of verbs like ''assert'', ''believe'', ''command'', ''consider'', ''deny'', ''doubt'', ''imagine'', ''judge'', ''know'', ''want'', ''wish'', and a host of others that involve attitudes or intentions toward propositions are notorious for their recalcitrance to analysis.
(Quine 1956).

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the fundamental principles governing identity is that of ''[[substitutivity]]''{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, also known as [[fungibility]]&amp;nbsp;— or, as it might well be called, that of ''[[Salva veritate|indiscernibility of identicals]]''.  It provides that, ''given a true statement of identity, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true''.  It is easy to find cases contrary to this principle.  For example, the statements:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (1)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione = Barbarelli,
|-
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (2)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione was so-called because of his size
|}
are true;  however, replacement of the name 'Giorgione' by the name 'Barbarelli' turns (2) into the falsehood:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | &amp;nbsp;
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], Quintessence, extensions, Reference and Modality, P361&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's example here refers to [[Giorgio Barbarelli]]'s [[sobriquet]] "Giorgione", an Italian name roughly glossed as "Big George." The basis of the paradox here is that while the two names signify the same individual (the meaning of the first statement), the names are not themselves identical; the second statement refers to an attribute (origin) that they do not share.

[[Image:Roll-Off.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A roll-off being placed by a roll-off truck.]]

In North America, a '''roll-off''' is a usually open top [[dumpster]] characterized by a rectangular footprint, utilizing wheels to facilitate rolling the dumpster in place.  The container is designed to be transported by special roll-off trucks. Roll-offs are commonly used to contain loads of [[construction and demolition waste]] or other [[waste types]]. While most roll-off containers have a swinging door on the end for easier disposal of waste, some roll-off containers are not open top and are used with commercial or industrial [[trash compactor]]s.

Construction debris may originate from a [[building]] site where something is being built, [[renovation|renovated]], or [[demolition|demolished]]. Roll-off dumpsters are also used for various jobs that need much material to be taken away. The material in the roll-off may be taken to a [[landfill]], [[recycling|recycled]] or disposed/recovered of in some other [[List of solid waste treatment technologies|way]].

== Size ==
Roll-off containers have a rectangular footprint typically determined by the size of typical trucks.  Roll-off container sizes are determined by the amount of debris they can hold, measured in cubic yards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nislybrothers.com/roll-off-dumpster-rental-tips/|title=Roll-Off Dumpster Rental Tips: Choosing Your Dumpster Size and More|website=nislybrothers.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Typical container sizes in the United States are 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 cubic yards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bgm.stanford.edu/pssi_roll-off_boxes | title=Roll-Off Box Sizes | publisher=Stanford Buildings &amp; Grounds Maintenance | accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2-40 cubic meters in other nations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.truckworld.com.au/Blogs/Waste-Truck-Collection-Systems | title=Waste Truck Collection Systems | publisher=TruckWorld.com.au | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the roll-offs may be rented by volume, there may be weight limitations.  Weight limits may be necessary to ensure compliance with road-use and safety laws and regulations.

Most roll-off providers will have a weight limit for each container size.  Containers loaded with more weight than allowed typically result in an overage charge.  The maximum weight is specified at the beginning of the job.  In cases where the material to be disposed of is especially dense, such as concrete, a container with lower sidewalls is used, to help reduce the risk of exceeding the weight limit.

== Operation ==
After the container is picked up, it is taken to a disposal facility where it is weighed before (gross) and after (tare) dumping. The difference is the net weight, and is used to calculate charges to the customer. In order to save time, some facilities pre-record weights of trucks and containers. This allows the tare weight to be looked up and eliminates the need for a second weighing.

Roll-offs are placed by roll-off [[truck]]s.  As the roll-off truck raises its hydraulically operated bed, the roll-off container rolls off the bed. A cable is used to slowly lower the container. After the waste container is loaded, the roll-off truck pulls the filled container onto the roll-off truck by using a cable and winch system. If the roll-off truck is not a winch system, then it is most likely a hook-lift system. A hook-lift system works by the truck extending a 90 degree arm with a hook on the end which hooks under a bar and gently lifts the dumpster onto the truck. Most hook-lift systems are on smaller roll-off trucks as they are usually used for 20 yard containers and under. These smaller systems are usually the preferred option on smaller scale construction jobs such as roof replacement, kitchen remodels, and garage clean-outs. Smaller single-axle trucks are generally viewed as safer operations as they are much lighter and more easily transported in residential areas.  When being carried, the roll-off must be covered.

== Disadvantages ==
One problem often encountered with roll-off containers is the liability of scratching or damaging the surface they are placed on. Most roll-off containers have metal rollers for wheels, which can at times scratch or be abrasive to a concrete or asphalt surface. It is recommended to place a protective board such as [[plywood]] under the container to avoid a situation where the placement surface can be damaged. Most roll-off companies do not offer plywood, but will place the container on the wood if supplied.  The roll-off must be placed on a hard surface other than dirt.  Gravel, asphalt, and concrete are all acceptable.  If the container is placed on dirt, the wheels may sink after a rainfall event and the truck could get stuck.

There are many items that are not accepted by roll-off rental companies.  These items include but are not limited to chemicals, including paint and petroleum products, tires, and electronics.  The prohibition of items is often to comply with laws and regulations concerning disposal of hazardous materials. Roll-off drivers may refuse to pickup loads containing prohibited materials. If the load is picked up, the roll-off rental company may charge the customer additional for cleaning the load and proper handling of the contaminating material.

== Legal issues ==
Some [[Municipality|municipalities]] require that a [[License|permit]] be obtained in order to have a roll-off dumpster delivered.  If the container is being set on [[private property]], most cities will not require a permit.  Some municipalities require the permit to be obtained by the customer, while others require the permit to be obtained by the roll-off provider. However, many cities do not require permits to have a dumpster delivered.

There are usually prohibited items that are commonly not allowed for disposal, such as hazardous materials, tires, freon appliances, televisions, paint, asbestos, batteries, oils, fuels, and tar-treated railroad ties because of reulations affecting final waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dec.vermont.gov/waste-management/solid/materials-mgmt/trash/|publisher=State of Vermont|date=2018|access-date=15 November 2018|title=Items banned from disposal in the State of Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30940">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''semiring''' is an [[algebraic structure]] similar to a [[Ring (algebra)|ring]], but without the requirement that each element must have an [[additive inverse]].

The term '''rig''' is also used occasionally&lt;ref&gt;Głazek (2002) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;—this originated as a joke, suggesting that rigs are ri''n''gs without ''n''egative elements, similar to using ''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]'' to mean a r''i''ng without a multiplicative ''i''dentity.

{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}

== Definition ==

A '''semiring''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' equipped with two [[binary operation]]s + and &amp;sdot;, called addition and multiplication, such that:&lt;ref&gt;Berstel &amp; Perrin (1985), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=GHJHqezwwpcC|page=26|text=a semiring K is a set equipped with two operations}} p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LotIII211&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sak2728&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) pp.27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

* (''R'', +) is a [[commutative monoid]] with [[identity element]] 0:
** (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'')
** 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''
** ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''
* (''R'', &amp;sdot;) is a [[monoid]] with identity element 1:
** (''a''&amp;sdot;''b'')&amp;sdot;''c'' = ''a''&amp;sdot;(''b''&amp;sdot;''c'')
** 1&amp;sdot;''a'' = ''a''&amp;sdot;1 = ''a''
* Multiplication left and right [[distributive law|distributes]] over addition:
** ''a''&amp;sdot;(''b'' + ''c'') = (''a''&amp;sdot;''b'') + (''a''&amp;sdot;''c'')
** (''a'' + ''b'')&amp;sdot;''c'' = (''a''&amp;sdot;''c'') + (''b''&amp;sdot;''c'')
* Multiplication by 0 [[annihilating element|annihilates]] ''R'':
** 0&amp;sdot;''a'' = ''a''&amp;sdot;0 = 0

This last [[axiom]] is omitted from the definition of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]: it follows from the other ring axioms. Here it does not, and it is necessary to state it in the definition.

The difference between rings and semirings, then, is that addition yields only a [[commutative monoid]], not necessarily a [[commutative group]]. Specifically, elements in semirings do not necessarily have an inverse for the addition.

The symbol &amp;sdot; is usually omitted from the notation; that is, ''a''&amp;sdot;''b'' is just written ''ab''. Similarly, an [[order of operations]] is accepted, according to which &amp;sdot; is applied before +; that is, {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bc''}} is {{nowrap|''a'' + (''bc'').}}

A '''commutative semiring''' is one whose multiplication is [[commutative]].&lt;ref name=LotIII212&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.212&lt;/ref&gt;  An '''{{visible anchor|idempotent semiring}}''' is one whose ''addition'' is [[idempotent]]: {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''a'' = ''a''}},&lt;ref name=Esik08/&gt; that is, {{nowrap|(''R'', +, 0)}} is a [[semilattice#Semilattices as algebraic structures|join-semilattice with zero]].

There are some authors who prefer to leave out the requirement that a semiring have a 0 or 1. This makes the analogy between ''[[ring (algebra)|ring]]'' and ''semiring'' on the one hand and ''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'' and ''[[semigroup]]'' on the other hand work more smoothly. These authors often use ''rig'' for the concept defined here.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Rig For an example see the definition of rig on Proofwiki.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

By definition, any ring is also a semiring. A motivating example of a semiring is the set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' (including [[0 (number)|zero]]) under ordinary addition and multiplication. Likewise, the non-negative [[rational number]]s and the non-negative [[real number]]s form semirings. All these semirings are commutative.&lt;ref name=Gut08/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sak28&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR4/&gt;

===In general===
* The set of all [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a given ring form a semiring under addition and multiplication of ideals.
* Any [[quantale|unital quantale]] is an idempotent semiring, or dioid, under join and multiplication.
* Any bounded, [[distributive lattice]] is a commutative, idempotent semiring under join and meet.
* In particular, a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is such a semiring. A [[Boolean ring]] is also a semiring&amp;mdash;indeed, a ring&amp;mdash;but it is not idempotent under ''addition''.  A ''Boolean semiring'' is a semiring isomorphic to a subsemiring of a Boolean algebra.&lt;ref name=Gut08&gt;{{cite book | title=Surveys in Contemporary Mathematics | volume=347 | series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series | issn=0076-0552 | editor1-first=Nicholas | editor1-last=Young | editor2-first=Yemon | editor2-last=Choi | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-521-70564-9 | chapter=Rank and determinant functions for matrices over semirings | first=Alexander E. | last=Guterman | pages=1–33  | zbl=1181.16042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A normal [[skew lattice]] in a ring ''R'' is an idempotent semiring for the operations multiplication and nabla, where the latter operation is defined by &lt;math&gt;a\nabla b=a+b+ba-aba-bab&lt;/math&gt;.
* Any [[c-semiring]] is also a semiring, where addition is idempotent and defined over arbitrary sets.
* Isomorphism classes of objects in any [[distributive category]], under [[coproduct]] and [[Product (category theory)|product]] operations, form a semiring known as a Burnside rig.&lt;ref&gt;Schanuel S.H. (1991) Negative sets have Euler characteristic and dimension. In: Carboni A., Pedicchio M.C., Rosolini G. (eds) Category Theory. Lecture Notes in Mathematics, vol 1488. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt; A Burnside rig is a ring iff the category is [[Category of small categories|trivial]].

===Specific examples===
* The (non-negative) [[Positional notation#Terminating fractions|''terminating fractions'']] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\N_0}{b^{\N_0}} := \left\{mb^{-n}\mid m\in \N_0 \wedge n\in \N_0 \right\} &lt;/math&gt; in a [[positional notation|positional number system]] to a given base &lt;math&gt;b\in \N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;In addition we have &lt;math&gt;\frac{\N_0}{b^{\N_0}} \subseteq \frac{\N_0}{c^{\N_0}}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;b\mid c&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Z_0}{b^{\Z_0}}:= \frac{\N_0}{b^{\N_0}} \cup \left(-\frac{\N_0}{b^{\N_0}}\right) &lt;/math&gt; is the ring of all terminating fractions to base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; which is [[Dense set|dense]] in &lt;math&gt;{\Q}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;|b|&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''extended'' natural numbers {{nowrap|'''N''' ∪ {∞}{{null}}}} with addition and multiplication extended (and {{nowrap|1=0⋅∞ = 0}}).&lt;ref name=Sak28/&gt;
* Given a semiring ''S'', the [[matrix semiring]] &lt;math&gt;M_n(S)&lt;/math&gt; of the square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] form a semiring under ordinary [[Matrix addition|addition]] and [[Matrix multiplication|multiplication]] of matrices, and this semiring of matrices is generally non-commutative even though ''S'' may be commutative. For example, the matrices with non-negative entries, &lt;math&gt;M_n(\N)&lt;/math&gt;, form a matrix semiring.&lt;ref name=Gut08/&gt;
* If ''A'' is a commutative monoid, the set End(''A'') of [[endomorphism]]s {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''A''}} almost form a semiring, where addition is pointwise addition and multiplication is [[function composition]]. The [[zero morphism]] and the identity are the respective neutral elements. This is not a true semiring, as composition does not distribute left over pointwise addition: {{nowrap|''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') ≠ (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'')}}. If ''A'' is the additive monoid of natural numbers we obtain the semiring of natural numbers as End(''A''), and if {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ''S''^''n''}} with ''S'' a semiring, we obtain (after associating each morphism to a matrix) the semiring of square ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with coefficients in ''S''. 
* The '''{{visible anchor|Boolean semiring}}''': the commutative semiring '''B''' formed by the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] and defined by {{nowrap|1=1 + 1 = 1}}:&lt;ref name=LotIII211/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sak28/&gt;&lt;ref name=BR4&gt;Berstel &amp; Reutenauer (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; this is idempotent&lt;ref name=Esik08/&gt; and is the simplest example of a semiring that is not a ring. Given two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', [[binary relation]]s between ''X'' and ''Y'' correspond to matrices indexed by ''X'' and ''Y'' with entries in the Boolean semiring, [[matrix addition]] corresponds to union of relations, and [[matrix multiplication]] corresponds to [[composition of relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=quantum mechanics over a commutative rig |author=[[John C.

{{anchor|binary relations}}
* Given a set ''U'', the set of [[binary relation]]s over ''U'' is a semiring with addition the union (of relations as sets) and multiplication the [[composition of relations]]. The semiring's zero is the [[empty relation]] and its unit is the [[identity relation]].&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt; These relations correspond to the [[matrix semiring]] (indeed, matrix semialgebra) of [[square matrices]] indexed by ''U'' with entries in the Boolean semiring, and then addition and multiplication are the usual matrix operations, while zero and the unit are the usual [[zero matrix]] and [[identity matrix]].
* '''N'''[''x''], [[polynomial]]s with natural number coefficients form a commutative semiring. In fact, this is the [[free object|free]] commutative semiring on a single generator {''x''}.
* [[Tropical semiring]]s are variously defined.  The ''max-plus'' semiring {{nowrap|'''R''' &amp;cup; {&amp;minus;&amp;infin;},}} is a commutative, idempotent semiring with {{nowrap|max(''a'',''b'')}} serving as semiring addition (identity &amp;minus;&amp;infin;) and ordinary addition (identity 0) serving as semiring multiplication.  In an alternative formulation, the tropical semiring is {{nowrap|'''R''' &amp;cup; {&amp;infin;},}} and min replaces max as the addition operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Speyer |first=David |last2=Sturmfels |first2=Bernd | author2-link=Bernd Sturmfels | arxiv=math/0408099 |title=Tropical Mathematics | origyear=2004 | year= 2009 | zbl=1227.14051 | journal=Math.

* The [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] semiring: the closed interval {{nowrap|[0, 1]}} with addition given by taking the maximum of the arguments ({{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = max(''a'',''b'')}}) and multiplication ''ab'' given by {{nowrap|max(0, ''a'' + ''b'' − 1)}} appears in [[multi-valued logic]].&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;

{{anchor|formal languages}}
* Given an alphabet (finite set) Σ, the set of [[formal language]]s over Σ (subsets of Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) is a semiring with product induced by [[string concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L_1 \cdot L_2 = \{w_1w_2 \mid w_1 \in L_1, w_2 \in L_2\}&lt;/math&gt; and addition as the [[union of languages]] (i.e. simply union as sets). The zero of this semiring is the empty set (empty language) and the semiring's unit is the language containing as its sole element the [[empty string]].&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;
* Generalising the previous example (by viewing Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; as the [[free monoid]] over Σ), take ''M'' to be any monoid; the power set '''P''' ''M'' of all subsets of ''M'' forms a semiring under set-theoretic union as addition and set-wise multiplication: &lt;math&gt;U \cdot V = \{ u \cdot v : u \in U,\ v \in V \}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=BR4/&gt;
* Similarly, if {{nowrap|(''M'', ''e'', &amp;sdot;)}} is a monoid, then the set of finite [[multiset]]s in ''M'' forms a semiring. That is, an element is a pair {{nowrap|(''n'', ''f'')}}, where {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}} is a natural number and {{nowrap|''f'' : {1, 2, ..., n} → ''M''}} is a function. The additive unit is {{nowrap|(0,!)}}, where {{nowrap|! : ∅ → ''M''}} is the unique function. The multiplicative unit is {{nowrap|(1, {''e''})}}. The sum is given by {{nowrap|1=(''m'',''f'') + (''n'',''g'') = (''m'' + ''n'', (''f'',''g''))}} and the product is given by {{nowrap|1=(''m'',''f'')&amp;sdot;(''n'',''g'') = (''mn'', ''f''&amp;sdot;''g'')}}. Similarly, the set of arbitrary multisets in ''M'' forms a complete semiring.

== Semiring theory ==

Much of the theory of rings continues to make sense when applied to arbitrary semirings{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.
In particular, one can generalise the theory of [[algebra (ring theory)|algebras]] over [[commutative ring]]s directly to a theory of algebras over commutative semirings.
Then a ring is simply an algebra over the commutative semiring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s.

Idempotent semirings are special to semiring theory as any ring which is idempotent under addition is trivial. One can define a [[partial order]] &amp;le; on an idempotent semiring by setting {{nowrap|''a'' &amp;le; ''b''}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b''}} (or, equivalently, if there exists an ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''x'' = ''b''}}). It is easy to see that 0 is the [[least element]] with respect to this order: {{nowrap|0 &amp;le; ''a''}} for all ''a''. Addition and multiplication respect the ordering in the sense that {{nowrap|''a'' &amp;le; ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|''ac'' &amp;le; ''bc''}} and {{nowrap|''ca'' &amp;le; ''cb''}} and {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''c'') &amp;le; (''b'' + ''c'')}}.

==Applications==

The {{nowrap|(max, +)}} and {{nowrap|(min, +)}} [[tropical semiring]]s on the reals, are often used in [[performance evaluation]] on discrete event systems. The real numbers then are the "costs" or "arrival time"; the "max" operation corresponds to having to wait for all prerequisites of an events (thus taking the maximal time) while the "min" operation corresponds to being able to choose the best, less costly choice; and + corresponds to accumulation along the same path.

The [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]] for [[shortest path]]s can thus be reformulated as a computation over a {{nowrap|(min, +)}} algebra.  Similarly, the [[Viterbi algorithm]] for finding the most probable state sequence corresponding to an observation sequence in a [[Hidden Markov model]] can also be formulated as a computation over a {{nowrap|(max, ×)}} algebra on probabilities.  These [[dynamic programming]] algorithms rely on the [[distributive property]] of their associated semirings to compute quantities over a large (possibly exponential) number of terms more efficiently than enumerating each of them.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Complete and continuous semirings==
A '''complete semiring''' is a semiring for which the addition monoid is a [[complete monoid]], meaning that it has an [[infinitary sum]] operation Σ&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; for any [[index set]] ''I'' and that the following (infinitary) distributive laws must hold:&lt;ref name=Kuich11/&gt;&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kuich | first=Werner | chapter=ω-continuous semirings, algebraic systems and pushdown automata | pages=103–110 | title=Automata, Languages and Programming: 17th International Colloquium, Warwick University, England, July 16-20, 1990, Proceedings | volume=443 | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | editor1-first=Michael S. | editor1-last=Paterson | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1990 | isbn=3-540-52826-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of complete semirings include the power set of a monoid under union; the matrix semiring over a complete semiring is complete.&lt;ref name=Sak471/&gt;

A '''continuous semiring''' is similarly defined as one for which the addition monoid is a [[continuous monoid]]: that is, partially ordered with the least upper bounds property, and for which addition and multiplication respect order and suprema.  The semiring {{nowrap|'''N''' ∪ {∞}{{null}}}} with usual addition, multiplication and order extended, is a continuous semiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ésik | first1=Zoltán | last2=Leiß | first2=Hans | chapter=Greibach normal form in algebraically complete semirings | zbl=1020.68056 | editor1-last=Bradfield | editor1-first=Julian | title=Computer science logic. 16th international workshop, CSL 2002, 11th annual conference of the EACSL, Edinburgh, Scotland, September 22-25, 2002.

Any continuous semiring is complete:&lt;ref name=Kuich11/&gt;  this may be taken as part of the definition.&lt;ref name=Sak471&gt;Sakaraovich (2009) p.471&lt;/ref&gt;

==Star semirings==
A '''star semiring''' (sometimes spelled as '''starsemiring''') is a semiring with an additional unary operator *,&lt;ref name=Esik08/&gt;&lt;ref name="droste"&gt;Droste, M., &amp; Kuich, W. (2009).

* the ([[#binary relations|aforementioned]]) semiring of [[binary relation]]s over some base set ''U'' in which &lt;math&gt;R^* = \bigcup_{n \geq 0} R^n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq U \times U&lt;/math&gt;. This star operation is actually the ''[[Reflexive closure|reflexive]] and [[transitive closure]]'' of ''R'' (i.e. the smallest reflexive and transitive binary relation over ''U'' containing ''R''.).&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;
* the [[#formal languages|semiring of formal languages]] is also a complete star semiring, with the star operation coinciding with the Kleene star (for sets/languages).&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;
* The set of non-negative [[extended real]]s, {{nowrap|[0, ∞]}}, together with the usual addition and multiplication of reals is a complete star semiring with the star operation given by {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/(1 − ''a'')}} for {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''a'' &lt; 1}} (i.e. the [[geometric series]]) and {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = ∞}} for {{nowrap|''a'' ≥ 1}}.&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;

Further examples:&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;
* The Boolean semiring with {{nowrap|1=0&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}};
* The semiring on {{nowrap|'''N''' ∪ {∞},}} with extended addition and multiplication, and {{nowrap|1=0&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; = ∞}} for {{nowrap|''a'' ≥ 1}}.
* A '''[[Kleene algebra]]''' is a star semiring with idempotent addition: they are important in the theory of [[formal language]]s and [[regular expression]]s.
* A '''Conway semiring''' is a star semiring satisfying the sum-star and the product-star equations:&lt;ref name=Esik08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ésik | first1=Zoltán | last2=Kuich | first2=Werner | chapter=Equational axioms for a theory of automata | editor1-last=Martín-Vide | editor1-first=Carlos | title=Formal languages and applications | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | series=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing | volume=148 | pages=183–196 | year=2004 | isbn=3-540-20907-7  | zbl=1088.68117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)^* = (a^* b)^* a^*,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(ab)^* = 1 + a(ba)^* b.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The first three examples above are also Conway semirings.&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;

* An '''iteration semiring''' is a Conway semiring satisfying the Conway group axioms,&lt;ref name=Esik08&gt;{{cite book | last=Ésik | first=Zoltán | chapter=Iteration semirings | zbl=1161.68598 | editor1-last=Ito | editor1-first=Masami | title=Developments in language theory. 12th international conference, DLT 2008, Kyoto, Japan, September 16–19, 2008.

===Complete star semirings===
We define a notion of '''complete star semiring''' in which the star operator behaves more like the usual [[Kleene star]]: for a complete semiring we use the infinitary sum operator to give the usual definition of the Kleene star:&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a^* = \sum_{j \geq 0}{a^j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^{j+1} = a \cdot a^j = a^j \cdot a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

Examples of complete star semirings include the first three classes of examples in the previous section: the binary relations semiring; the formal languages semiring and the extended non-negative reals.&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;

In general, every complete star semiring is also a Conway semiring,&lt;ref name="droste15"&gt;Droste, M., &amp; Kuich, W. (2009). Semirings and Formal Power Series. ''Handbook of Weighted Automata'', 3–28. {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-01492-5_1}}, Theorem 3.4 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; but the converse does not hold. An example of Conway semiring that is not complete is the set of extended non-negative [[rational number]]s ({{nowrap|{x ∈ '''Q''' {{!}} x ≥ 0} ∪ {∞}{{null}}}}) with the usual addition and multiplication (this is a modification of the example with extended non-negative reals given in this section by eliminating irrational numbers).&lt;ref name="droste"/&gt;

== Further generalizations ==

A generalization of semirings does not require the existence of a multiplicative identity, so that multiplication is a [[semigroup]] rather than a monoid. Such structures are called ''hemirings''&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan S. Golan, ''Semirings and their applications'', Chapter 1, p1&lt;/ref&gt; or ''pre-semirings''.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gondran, Michel Minoux, ''Graphs, Dioids, and Semirings: New Models and Algorithms'', Chapter 1, Section 4.2, p22&lt;/ref&gt; A further generalization are ''left-pre-semirings'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gondran, Michel Minoux, ''Graphs, Dioids, and Semirings: New Models and Algorithms'', Chapter 1, Section 4.1, p20&lt;/ref&gt; which additionally do not require right-distributivity (or ''right-pre-semirings'', which do not require left-distributivity).

Yet a further generalization are ''[[near-semiring]]s'': in addition to not requiring a neutral element for product, or right-distributivity (or left-distributivity), they do not require addition to be commutative. Just as cardinal numbers form a (class) semiring, so do [[ordinal number]]s form a [[near-ring]], when the standard [[Ordinal arithmetic|ordinal addition and multiplication]] are taken into account. However, the class of ordinals can be turned into a semiring by considering the so-called [[Ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural (or Hessenberg) operations]] instead.

In [[category theory]], a ''[[2-rig]]'' is a category with [[functor]]ial operations analogous to those of a rig. That the cardinal numbers form a rig can be categorified to say that the [[category of sets]] (or more generally, any [[topos]]) is a 2-rig.

==Semiring of sets==

A '''semiring''' ('''of sets''')&lt;ref&gt;Noel Vaillant, [http://www.probability.net/WEBcaratheodory.pdf Caratheodory's Extension], on probability.net.&lt;/ref&gt; is a non-empty collection S of sets such that
# &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \in S&lt;/math&gt;
# If &lt;math&gt;E \in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F \in S&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;E \cap F \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;E \in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F \in S&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a finite number of mutually [[disjoint sets]] &lt;math&gt;C_i \in S&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E \setminus F = \bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Such semirings are used in measure theory. An example of a semiring of sets is the collection of half-open, half-closed real [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Dioid==
The term '''dioid''' (for "double monoid") has been used to mean various types of semirings:
* It was used by Kuntzman in 1972 to denote what is now termed semiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kuntzmann | first=J. | title=Théorie des réseaux (graphes) | language=French | zbl=0239.05101 | location=Paris | publisher=Dunod | year=1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use to mean idempotent subgroup was introduced by Baccelli et al. in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Baccelli | first1=François Louis | last2=Olsder | first2=Geert Jan | last3=Quadrat | first3=Jean-Pierre | last4=Cohen | first4=Guy | title=Synchronization and linearity. An algebra for discrete event systems | zbl=0824.93003 | series=Wiley Series on Probability and Mathematical Statistics | location=Chichester | publisher=Wiley | year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name "dioid" is also sometimes used to denote [[naturally ordered semiring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marcpouly.ch/pdf/internal_100712.pdf Semirings for breakfast], slide 17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shogi notation''' is the set of various abbreviatory notational systems used to describe the piece movements of a [[shogi]] game record or the positions of pieces on a shogi board.

A game record is called a 棋譜 ''[[kifu]]'' in Japanese.

==Recording moves==

=== Western notation ===

The system used in English language texts to express shogi moves was established by [[George Hodges (shogi)|George Hodges]] and Glyndon Townhill in 1976 by the second issue of ''Shogi'' magazine.{{sfn | Hodges | 1976}}{{efn | The notation system used by Hodges in the first issue of ''Shogi'' differs in a few aspects. Rather than indicate the destination square coordinates in captures, the piece being captured was indicated. For example, '''PxP''' indicated 'pawn captures pawn.' In ambiguity resolution, the origin square was enclosed in parentheses. For example, '''S(3c)-2b''' instead of '''S3c-2b'''. Moreover, since captures were notated with the captured piece, ambiguity resolution is required when multiple pieces of the same type are possible. Therefore, '''RxP(2f)''' or '''RxP(1e)''' would be required as the '''RxP''' notation would be ambiguous. Finally, promoted pieces were indicated with '''+''' suffixed to the piece initial enclosed in parentheses. For example, '''R(+)-7h''' instead of '''+R-7h'''. Changes were made to the first system in order to make it simpler and to avoid notation strings which were felt to be 'clumsy'. The first system also overlooked the need for an unpromotion indication.}} 
A slightly modified version was used in Hosking (1996). It is derived from the [[Algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation used for chess]], but differs in several respects.{{sfn | Fairbairn | 1986 | p=13–18}}{{sfn | Hosking | 1997 | p=20–21}} A typical move might be notated '''P86''' or '''P-8f'''. The notation format has the following 5 part structure:

:{| style='margin: 30px;'
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 1 
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 2
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 3 
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 4
! 5
|-
| style='padding-right: 55px; text-align: center;' | piece
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | (origin)
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | movement
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | destination
| (promotion)
|}

An example using all 5 parts is '''S72x83+''' or '''S7bx8c+'''. All parts are obligatory except for the ''origin'' and ''promotion'' parts. (Thus, most notation strings only contain 3 parts.) The ''origin'' part is only indicated when needed to resolve ambiguity. The ''promotion'' part is only needed when there is the possibility of promotion.

Western notation is not used in Japanese language texts, as it is no more concise than traditional notation with kanji and two ciphers which originated in the [[Edo period]].

====Piece====

The first letter represents the piece moved. For instance, '''P''' is for '''P'''awn. Below are the abbreviations used.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Abbreviation !! English Term !! Japanese
|-
| P || pawn || 歩
|-
| L || lance || 香
|-
| N || knight || 桂
|-
| S || silver || 銀
|-
| G || gold || 金
|-
| B || bishop || 角
|-
| R || rook || 飛
|-
| K || king || 玉/王
|}

Promoted pieces are indicated by a '''+''' preceding the letter. For example, '''+P''' is a promoted pawn (と ''tokin''), '''+R''' is a promoted rook (that is, a dragon 龍).

Some Japanese websites (such as [[81Dojo]]) and Japanese authors use two different abbreviations for the promoted rook and promoted bishop in a way more similar to Japanese notation. Thus, '''D''' (for ''dragon'') instead of '''+R''' and '''H''' (for ''horse'') instead of '''+B'''.

====Ambiguity resolution: Origin coordinates====

In cases where the moving piece is ambiguous, the starting square is added after the letter for the piece but before the movement indication.

For example, in diagrams below, Black has three golds which can move to square '''78'''. Thus, simply notating '''G-78''' is not enough to indicate the move. The three possible moves are distinguished via the origin specification as '''G77-78''', '''G68-78''', or '''G79-78'''.

====Movement type====

Following the abbreviation for the piece is a symbol for the type of move. There are 3 different indications:

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Notation Symbol !! Movement Type
|-
| '''-''' || simple movement
|-
| '''x''' || capture (opponent's piece)
|-
| '''*''' or '''’'''|| drop (your own piece)
|}

As examples, '''P-24''' indicates moving one's pawn to the 2d square (without capture), '''Px24''' indicates moving one's pawn to the 24 square and capturing the opponent's piece that was on 24, and '''P*24''' indicates dropping one's pawn in hand to the previously empty 24 square. (Note the '''x''' indication is a significant departure from Japanese notation, which has no way of signaling whether a piece was captured.)

There is some variation for the drop symbol. A '''*''' (asterisk) is often used, but some books (e.g. Hosking 1997) use a '''’''' (apostrophe) instead. Thus, Hosking '''B’56''' is equivalent to Hodges '''B*5f'''.{{efn | For comparison, the chess variant [[crazyhouse]] uses yet another symbol for dropped piece notation: the [[@]] symbol.}}

The simple movement indication (the hyphen '''-''') is not used by Hosking (1997) who does not use a movement symbol. Thus, Hosking '''P26''' is equivalent to Hodges '''P-2f'''.

====Destination coordinates====

After the movement piece indication is the square on which the piece lands. This is indicated by a numeral for the file (1–9) and the rank (1–9), with '''11''' being the top right corner from Black's perspective and '''99''' being the bottom left corner. This is based on Japanese notation conventions.

Hosking differs from Hodges in that Hosking uses numerals for the rank notation whereas Hodges uses letters (a–i) for the rank.

====Promotion status====

If a move entitles the player to promote, then a '''+''' is added to the end if the promotion was taken or an '''=''' if it was declined. For example, '''Nx73=''' indicates an unpromoted knight capturing on 73 without promoting while '''Nx73+''' indicates an unpromoted knight capturing on 73 and promoting. The promotion status is always omitted in situations where promotion is not possible. When promotion is possible, then the promotion status is obligatorily notated.

====Other conventions====

Game moves in western notation are always numbered (unlike Japanese game records). Additionally, what is numbered are pairs of two moves – the first move by Black, the second by White – instead of numbering each move by each player. This also differs from the Japanese system. For instance, three pairs of moves (or six individual moves) are numbered as '''1. P-76 P-34 2. P-26 P-44 3. S-48 S-32'''. However, in the British ''Shogi'' magazine of the 1970s and 1980s, the pair number convention was not used for [[tsumeshogi]] problems, in which case the each player's move is number just as in the Japanese notation conventions.

Following western chess conventions, omitted moves are indicated with an '''...''' ellipsis. As a consequence of the way moves are numbered in the western system, all moves by White are notated with an ellipsis prefix in texts. For example, '''...P-55''' indicates a move by White while '''P-55''' indicates a move by Black. In handicap games, White plays first, so Black's first move is replaced by an ellipsis. For example, '''1. ...G-32 2. P-76 G-72'''.

Unlike western chess, game states like check or checkmate are not typically notated. However, the use of question marks and exclamation points to indicate questionable and good moves, respectively, are occasionally used.

=== Japanese notation ===

[[File:ShogiJapaneseNotationInTsume.png|thumb|right|Japanese notation (shown on the left, listed vertically) accompanying a 15-move checkmate (''[[Tsumeshogi|tsume]]'') problem. Note the lack of numbered moves and the lack of both explicit dropped piece notation and capture notation. From the book 詰むや詰まざるや (''Tsumu ya tsumazaru ya'') (1975) by 伊藤宗看 (''Sōkan Itō'') [1706–1761], a shogi Meijin of the Edo period, and 門脇芳雄 (''Yoshio Kadowaki'').]]

The earliest way to indicate game records in Japan during the [[Edo period]] was to use descriptive sentences such as ''Open the bishop's diagonal, push the rook's pawn, close the bishop's diagonal'' and the like. Soon afterward, a notational system was developed which is mostly the same as what is used in the presentday in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese notation, the notation string has the following five-part format:{{sfn | Hosking | 1997 | p=263–265}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://81dojo.com/documents/Notation_System|title=Notation System - 81Dojo Docs|author=|date=|work=81Dojo.com|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shogi.or.jp/faq/kihuhyouki.html|title=棋譜の表記方法｜よくある質問｜日本将棋連盟|author=|date=|work=Shogi.or.jp|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical move is indicated like '''８六歩''' (equivalent to western P-86). An example that uses all five parts is '''☗８三銀引成''' (which could be either S72-83+ or S72x83+ in western notation). The player's side information is optional and the movement and promotion indications are only used in order to resolve ambiguity.

=====Player's side=====

It is common for the White (''gote'') and Black (''sente'') player to be indicated at the beginning of the notation string with either black and white triangles (▲/△) or shogi-piece-shaped pentagons (☗/☖) , such as '''▲７六歩△３四歩▲２六歩△３二金''' or '''☗７六歩☖３四歩☗２六歩☖３二金'''. However, this is not obligatory: several books notate shogi moves without explicit indication of which player is making the moves. (See the adjacent image for an example.) In such cases, knowing which player the move refers to can be determined by the context in the book. This white/black convention is more common when the moves are not numbered (which is also optional to notate).

=====Destination coordinates=====

For the board's coordinates, the file is indicated with an Arabic numeral followed by the rank indicated with a [[Japanese numeral]] (instead of an Arabic number or letter like in the western system). For example, square '''23''' in Japanese notation is '''２三'''.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Japanese numeral !! Japanese pronunciation !! Arabic equivalent 
|-
| 一 || ''ichi'' || １ 
|-
| 二 || ''ni'' || ２ 
|-
| 三 || ''san'' || ３ 
|-
| 四 || ''yon'' || ４ 
|-
| 五 || ''go'' || ５
|-
| 六 || ''roku'' || ６ 
|-
| 七 || ''nana'' || ７
|-
| 八 || ''hachi'' || ８
|-
| 九 || ''kyū'' || ９
|-
| 同 || ''dō'' or ''onajiku'' || (same) 
|}

Earlier (for instance, in the Edo period), only Japanese numerals were used.

There is also an abbreviatory convention: when a piece moves to the same coordinates as the previous move's piece (as in a capture), the position is simply indicated with '''同''' (which is pronounced ''dō'') instead of the file-rank coordinate numbers. For example, if Black's pawn moved to a square in which White's pawn captured Black's pawn and then both players' bishops recaptured followed by a rook recapture, this could be notated as '''☗２四歩 ☖同歩 ☗同角 ☖同角 ☗同飛''' which would be equivalent to the western notation sequence '''1. P-24 Px24, 2. Bx24 Bx24, 3. Rx24'''. An alternate symbol '''仝''' is used instead of '''同''' in older books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/861188?itemId=info:ndljp/pid/861188&amp;__lang=en NDL Digital Collections - 指将棋定跡集]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Note that the 仝 character is also sometimes used as an abbreviatory symbol for a promoted lance. See [[Shogi#Equipment|Shogi§Equipment]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to encounter Roman numerals for both the file and rank coordinates, such as ''' ☗２４歩''' instead of ''' ☗２四歩'''.

Also, since Japanese is often written vertically from top to bottom, the notation may be written vertically as well with the top number indicating the file and rank number below the file number. Finally, in older books of the Edo period, the notation may be written from right to left (as is the case with traditional vertical writing) even when the notation is written horizontally. However, this older practice is not used in the modern period, where horizontally writing is read from left to right following European language traditions. (See the 1839 game record image below for such an example.)

=====Piece=====

Pieces are indicated with kanji (instead of letters as in the western system). The piece's kanji follows the piece's board coordinates. The following symbols are used.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Japanese !! Western !! Japanese || Western
|-
| 歩 || P || と || +P
|-
| 香 || L || 成香 || +L
|-
| 桂 || N || 成桂 || +N
|-
| 銀 || S || 成銀 || +S
|-
| 角 || B || 馬 || +B
|-
| 飛 || R || 龍 || +R
|-
| 金 || G || 玉 || K
|-
| 合 || (n/a) || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|}

Promoted pieces are indicated with a '''成''' prefix except for the promoted pawn, promoted bishop, and promoted rook, which are '''と''', '''馬''', '''龍''', respectively. '''兵''' is used instead of '''歩''' in some older texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/861188?itemId=info:ndljp/pid/861188&amp;__lang=en|title=NDL Digital Collections - 指将棋定跡集|author=|date=|work=NDL.go.jp|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tsumeshogi]], the character '''合''' is used essentially as a [[Variable (computer science)|variable]] that represents a piece of any value.

=====Ambiguity resolution: Movement description=====

When there is ambiguity in piece movement, there is a complex system of movement description using the symbols below. The movement descriptors consist of (a) a dropped piece indicator, (b) movement toward destination indicators, and (c) movement origin indicators.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Movement notation !! Meaning
|-
| '''打''' || dropped
|-
| '''引''' || downward
|-
| '''寄''' || horizontally
|-
| '''上''' || upward
|-
| '''右''' || moving from right (going leftwards)
|-
| '''左''' || moving from left (going rightwards)
|-
| '''直''' || perpendicularly vertical (gold/silver only)
|-
| '''行''' || upward (dragon/horse)
|-
| '''入''' || upward (dragon/horse)
|}

The symbol for a dropped piece is '''打''' following the piece's character. In the usual course of a game, most dropped pieces will probably be unambiguous. In these unambiguous cases, explicit notation for the dropped piece is not required and usually omitted (unlike in western notation where the drop notation is obligatory). For example, a western notation such as '''P*23''' will be notated simply as '''２三歩''' instead of '''２三歩打'''. In other situations, there is a possibility that either a piece that is already in play on the board can move to a certain square or a piece of the same kind that is held in hand can be dropped to that square. In this case, when the piece on the board moves to that square, the notation simply notates the move as usual with no drop indication. However, when the piece in hand is dropped to that location, then the drop indication must be present in the notation in order to resolve the ambiguity. In other words, '''打''' is only used when the following two conditions are met: (i) a piece is dropped and (ii) there is ambiguity with another piece on the board.

For ambiguity resolution with pieces on the board, the main notation symbols are '''引''' for downward movement, '''寄''' for horizontal movement, and '''上''' for upward movement. Note that these three indicators describe movement toward their destination square.

In the example below, three golds can move to the ７八 (= 78) square. The gold that originates on ７七 (= 77) and moves down is notated as '''７八金引''' (= G77-78). The other two possibilities are notated as '''７八金寄''' (= G68-78) and '''７八金上''' (= G79-78).

There are two less common alternate symbols used instead of '''上''': '''行''' and '''入'''. However, these alternate symbols are reserved for indicating only the two most powerful promoted dragon 龍 and horse 馬 pieces. Thus, '''５五龍行''' or '''５五龍入''' instead of '''５五龍上''', but not '''５五金行''' or '''５五金入'''.

In certain situations, an indication of movement toward the destination square (that is, with '''引''', '''寄''', '''上''') is not sufficient to resolve ambiguity. In these cases, the origin square of the piece is notated with a relative positional indicator. These are '''右''' for a piece moving from a right square (and thus moving leftward) and '''左''' for a piece moving from a left square (rightward).

This positional information is relative to each player's directions. Thus, '''△５二金右''' (literally: "white 5-2 gold right") refers to the silver on the right from White's perspective (which would be on the left from Black's perspective).

In the special case of golds and silvers as well as promoted pieces with gold-like movements (成銀, 成桂, 成香, と), it is possible for there to be a three-way ambiguity in upward movement. In this case, a third positional origin indicator is used: '''直''' for vertical (straight up) movement.

Additionally, this '''直''' indicator tends to always be used for vertical movement even when simply using  '''右''' ("right") and '''左''' ("left") would suffice. Relatedly, '''直''' tends to be used only for golds and silvers and not for other pieces.

=====Promotion=====

A piece that promotes is indicated with '''成''' following the piece's character, such as '''７三桂成''' (N-73+). If a piece does not promote, this is indicated with '''不成''' following the piece's character, such as '''７三桂不成''' (N-73=). There is an alternate symbol for unpromotion: '''生''' is sometimes used instead of '''不成'''.

=====Numbering=====

Unlike western notation, numbering Japanese game records is not obligatory. Although players' moves often aren't numbered, shogi moves are always counted per player's move. This is commonly seen in checkmate problems where a ''3-move'' ３手 checkmate problem would mean a move sequence of black-white-black. This is unlike western chess which counts each pair of moves as one move. (In western notation for shogi, the move numbering tends to follow western chess notation conventions.)

=====Game end=====

Shogi games are officially over when a player formally resigns. The resignation is notated as '''投了''' ''tōryō.'' Other possible endings include rare '''千日手''' [[Shogi#Repetition (Draw)|Repetition Draw]], '''反則手''' [[Shogi#Illegal move|Illegal Move]], and the very rare '''持将棋''' [[Shogi#Impasse|Impasse Draw]].

=====Other conventions=====

[[File:OldShogiGameRecord.png| thumb | 275px | A game record from a 1839 Right [[Lance handicap|Lance]] [[handicap (shogi)|handicap]] game between Kenko Ishimoto (石本検校) who is Black (''shitate'') and Ryusetsu Ohashi (大橋柳雪) who is White. The game record uses shorthand notation. For example, the first move indicated is 七六丶 with the numerals read from right-to-left. This would be written in the standard notation as ７六歩. However, typically, White is notated as the top player these days, so this would be notated more typically as △３四歩 with the western equivalent as 1. ...P-34.]]

Unlike western notation, a capture of a piece is never explicitly notated in the Japanese system since the capture can be understood in the context of the game.

=====Shorthand=====

In addition to the usual kanji symbols, there are also [[shorthand]] versions of piece symbols that can be written very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ameblo.jp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ameblo.jp/kakuzan101/entry-10981017040.html | title=棋譜の取り方 | work=Ameblo.jp | access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several of the symbols, there is variation in what shorthand symbol is used – the ones listed here may not be exhaustive of all the alternatives used in Japan.

====Iroha notation====

A notation used in older times was the ''iroha'' notation.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; It used the [[Kana|syllables]] of the Japanese poem ''[[Iroha]]'' (いろは歌) (as well as other Japanese characters) to label each square on the shogi board.

For example, the 23 square was indicated by the symbol '''を'''. [[Tokugawa Ieharu]] (the tenth shogun 1760–1786) favored this notational system. Therefore, it was used for all castle game records during his reign.

=== Kitao–Kawasaki notation ===

The Kitao–Kawasaki notation is a hybrid notation introduced by the Nekomado publishing company in English translations of shogi books by Madoka Kitao and Takashi Kaneko.&lt;ref&gt;Kaneko, Takashi. 2013. ''Storming the Mino castle.'' R Sams (transl.). Tokyo: Nekomado.&lt;/ref&gt; The system incorporates elements of both the western and the Japanese notation systems.

The order of elements is the same as the western system except that a player's side argument is added.

:{| style='margin: 30px;'
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 1 
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 2
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 3

| style='padding-right: 55px;' | (origin)
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | movement
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | (destination)
| (promotion)
|}

A typical move is indicated like '''☗歩-86''' (western equivalent: P-86). An example that uses all 6 parts is '''☗銀(72)x83+''' (S72x83+ in western notation).

'''1. Player's Side.''' Like the Japanese system, the black and white shogi pieces ☗ and ☖ are used.

'''2. Piece.''' Like the Japanese system, the characters for the shogi pieces are used. For promoted pieces, pieces that are notated with 成 in Japanese notation are notated with the western symbol '''+''' instead. However, unlike the western system, this convention is not used for the pawn, bishop, or rook.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Kitao–Kawasaki !! English Term !! Western !! Japanese
|-
| と || promoted pawn || +P || と
|-
| +香 || promoted lance || +L || 成香
|-
| +桂 || promoted knight || +N || 成桂
|-
| +銀 || promoted silver || +S || 成銀
|-
| 馬 || promoted bishop || +B || 馬
|-
| 龍 || promoted rook || +R || 龍
|}

The convention of using kanji overlooks the issue of non-Japanese handwritten records.

'''3. Ambiguity Resolution: Origin Coordinates.''' In cases where the moving piece is ambiguous, the starting square coordinates enclosed in parentheses are added to the string. This is only indicated when needed to resolve ambiguity. Thus, following the example used above, '''金(77)-78''' is equivalent to western G77-78 and Japanese 7八金引, '''金(68)-78''' equivalent to G68-78 and 7八金寄, and '''金(79)-78''' equivalent to G79-78 and 7八金上.

'''4. Movement Type.''' The three movement types ('''-''', '''x''', '''*''') are the same as in the western system. Thus: '''歩-24''', '''歩x24''', '''歩*24'''. Like the western system (but unlike the Japanese system), this movement indication is obligatory in all contexts.

'''5. Destination Coordinates.''' Indicates which square a piece is moved to.

Like the Japanese system, rank (row) coordinates are indicated with a numeral (and not a letter). However, Arabic numerals are used instead of Japanese numerals. For example, '''76''' is equivalent to Japanese 7六.

When a piece is moved to the same location as the preceding piece (in a capture), the designation coordinates are omitted. This is similar to the use of 同 in the Japanese system. For example, the sequence '''☗歩-24 ☖歩x ☗角x ☖角x ☗飛x''' would be equivalent to western 1. P-24 Px24, 2. Bx24 Bx24, 3. Rx24 and Japanese ☗2四歩☖同歩☗同角☖同角☗同飛.

'''6. Promotion Status.''' The symbols '''+''' and '''=''' are used as in the western system.

'''Other conventions.''' Like the Japanese system, the numbering of moves is not obligatory. The ellipsis (...) notation for White's moves in the western system is not needed (as '''☖''' is used instead).

===SFEN===

SFEN is an extension of [[Forsyth–Edwards Notation]] (FEN) used for describing board positions of shogi games. 

Formally, an SFEN is a [[text string]] of [[ASCII]] characters. It has three fields that are separated by a space. The fields:

# Piece placement on the board from Black's perspective
# Who has the next move
# Pieces in hand

The following is an example (from a [[Tempo Loss Bishop Exchange]] opening)

&lt;pre&gt;lnsgk2nl/1r4gs1/p1pppp1pp/1p4p2/7P1/2P6/PP1PPPP1P/1SG4R1/LN2KGSNL b Bb&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the first field is '''lnsgk2nl/1r4gs1/p1pppp1pp/1p4p2/7P1/2P6/PP1PPPP1P/1SG4R1/LN2KGSNL''', the second is '''b''', and the last is '''Bb'''.

For the first field, each piece is represented with a single letter. White's pieces are lowercase letters while Black's pieces are uppercase letters. The set of letters used are the same as the ones used in [[Shogi notation#Western notation|western notation]] (i.e., p, +p, l, +l, n, +n, s, +s, g, b, +b, r, +r, k). Each rank is separated by a forward slash (/). The listing of ranks is from top (rank A) to bottom (rank i), and the order to pieces is from file 9 to file 1 (in other words, from left to right as viewed on typical shogi diagram with White as the top player and Black as the bottom player). Empty squares are indicated with numeral corresponding to the number of adjacent empty squares on the same rank. In the example, the first rank A is '''lnsgk2nl''' which indicates sequence of lance, knight, silver, gold, king followed by two empty squares to the right of the king and a sequence of knight and lance.

The second field can be either '''b''' for Black's turn to play or '''w''' for White's turn to play. In the example, '''b''' indicates that Black has the next move.

The third field contains all of the pieces in hand held by each player. In the example, the '''Bb''' indicates that Black has one bishop in hand ('''B'''), and White also has one bishop in hand ('''b''').

Below is another example showing the board position for [[Yoshiharu Habu]]'s famous 52 silver drop in an NHK game ([[Bishop Exchange Climbing Silver]] opening) with [[Hifumi Katoh]].

===KIF===

{{Expand section | date=November 2018}}

The '''KIF''' file format is used for saving full games of shogi. Internally, it uses Japanese notation in the UTF-8 text encoding, and each move is disambiguated with an origin square.

===KI2===

{{Expand section | date= November 2018}}

The '''KI2''' file format is similar to the '''KIF''' format but more compact.  Moves are only disambiguated with the standard Japanese relative direction kanji.

===CSA===

{{Expand section | date=March 2017}}

Another format for saving positions and games of shogi, which only uses ASCII internally. Mostly used in the computer shogi arena.

===PSN===

{{Expand section | date= November 2018}}

'''Portable Shogi Notation''' is a derivative of the [[Portable Game Notation]] used in chess, is expanded to specify shogi pieces and drops. It uses the Hodges coordinate system. It has little support outside of GNU Shogi.

'''Sign languages''' (also known as '''signed languages''') are [[language]]s that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Language is expressed via the manual signstream in combination with [[Sign language#Non-manual elements|non-manual elements]]. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that sign languages are not universal and they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Sign Language?|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|accessdate=10 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195125/https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|archivedate=13 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.

Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of [[natural language]], meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning. Sign language should not be confused with "[[body language]]", a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].

Wherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed, and are at the cores of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as children of deaf adults ([[Child of deaf adult|CODAs]]).

It is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] lists 137 sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

''Sign Language Legislation in the European Union - Edition II''. European Union of the Deaf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or derived from them, such as invented manual codes for spoken languages, [[home sign]], "baby sign", and signs learned by non-human primates.

== History ==
{{Main|History of sign language}}
[[Image:Arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos.jpg|thumb|Juan Pablo Bonet, {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} ("Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak") (Madrid, 1620)]]

Groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history. One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: "If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?"&lt;ref name="bauman2008"&gt;{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=0-8166-4619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de León]] (1520–1584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1620, [[Juan Pablo Bonet]] published {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} (‘Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak’) in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Bonet, J. de (1620) ''Reduction de las letras y Arte para enseñar á ablar los Mudos''. Ed. Abarca de Angulo, Madrid, ejemplar facsímil accesible en la {{cite web |url=http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/91/8/reduction-de-las-letras-y-arte-para-ensenar-a-ablar-los-mudos/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172251/http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/91/8/reduction-de-las-letras-y-arte-para-ensenar-a-ablar-los-mudos/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}, online (spanish) scan of book, held at University of Sevilla, Spain&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the first modern treatise of sign language phonetics, setting out a method of oral education for deaf people and a manual alphabet.

[[File:Jbulwer.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Chirogram from ''Chirologia'', 1644]]
In Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such as secret communication,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, John (1641). ''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of "secret discoursing, by signes and gestures".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: "Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z." (1641:116-117)&lt;/ref&gt; public speaking, or communication by deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;John Bulwer's "Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described "Master Babington", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, "contryved on the joynts of his fingers", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',&lt;ref&gt;Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;&lt;ref&gt;See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.&lt;/ref&gt; some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, G. "The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. "Historical Aspects of Manual Communication" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.&lt;br /&gt;
and Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.

[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.&lt;ref&gt;Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described such codes for both English and Latin.

By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe (1720). "The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.

Frenchman [[Abbé de l'Épée|Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Canlas (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called [[Gallaudet University]], it is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.

{{Anchor| not speech based}} Sign languages generally do not have any linguistic relation to the spoken languages of the lands in which they arise. The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language. For example, the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand all have English as their dominant language, but [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), used in the US and English-speaking Canada, is derived from [[French Sign Language]] whereas the other three countries sign dialects of [[BANZSL|British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |title=Ethnologue report for language code: bfi |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009095734/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the sign languages of Spain and Mexico are very different, despite Spanish being the national language in each country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Spanish Sign Language survey |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020141343/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sign language used in Bolivia is based on ASL rather than any sign language that is used in a Spanish-speaking country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Bolivia deaf community and sign language pre-survey report |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915024309/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations also arise within a 'national' sign language which don't necessarily correspond to dialect differences in the national spoken language; rather, they can usually be correlated to the geographic location of residential schools for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucas, Ceil]], Robert Bayley and [[Clayton Valli]]. 2001.

[[International Sign]], formerly known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international deaf events such as the [[Deaflympics]] and meetings of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]]. While recent studies claim that International Sign is a kind of a [[pidgin]], they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

== Linguistics ==
In linguistic terms, sign languages are as rich and complex as any spoken language, despite the common misconception that they are not "real languages". Professional [[linguistics|linguists]] have studied many sign languages and found that they exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Klima|Klima, Edward S.]]; &amp; [[Ursula Bellugi|Bellugi, Ursula]]. (1979). ''The signs of language''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-80795-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sandler, Wendy; &amp; Lillo-Martin, Diane. (2006). Sign Language and Linguistic Universals. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sign languages are not [[mime]]—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary and do not necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken language is not [[onomatopoeic]]. While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Taub (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.

Sign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s (from the Greek word for "hand") in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s (from Greek for "voice") of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although often also crude distinctions are made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].
&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross (2016).

In: Hall, T. A. Pompino-Marschall, B. (ed.): Dictionaries of Linguistics and Communication Science. Volume: Phonetics and Phonology. Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, both sign and spoken languages share the [[Hockett's design features|characteristics]] that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, [[semanticity]], [[arbitrariness]], [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]], and [[Traditional transmission|cultural transmission]].

Common linguistic features of many sign languages are the occurrence of [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], a high degree of [[inflection]] by means of changes of movement, and a [[Topic-comment language|topic-comment]] [[syntax]]. More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions "function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information".&lt;ref&gt;Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; It needs to be noted that the term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions. Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.

Today, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category "sign languages" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,&lt;ref&gt;p. 970-972. ''Linguistic Bibliography for the Year 1988''. Leiden, Netherlands:Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; when it appeared with 39 entries.

=== Relationships with spoken languages ===
[[Image:Holečkova, nápis ve znakové řeči.jpg|thumb| Sign language relief sculpture on a stone wall: "Life is beautiful, be happy and love each other", by Czech sculptor [[Zuzana Čížková]] on Holečkova Street in [[Prague]]-[[Smíchov]], by a school for the deaf]]

Always there is a common misconception that sign languages are somehow dependent on spoken languages: that they are spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlmutter|first=David M.|title=What is Sign Language?|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|work=LSA|accessdate=4 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412004710/http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities in [[Sign language in the brain|language processing in the brain]] between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception. Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as "inventors" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.

As a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.

On the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.

=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===
[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|"Hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of "hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
Sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.

One way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[American Sign Language grammar#Numeral incorporation and classifiers|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.

The large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).

=== Non-manual elements ===
Sign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.

At the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1012688117|title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing|last=|first=|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|others=Quer, Josep, Carlo Cecchetto &amp; Caterina Donati et al. (eds.)|year=2017|isbn=9781501511806|location=|pages=|oclc=1012688117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross &amp; Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}. In: Glossa. A Journal of General Linguistics, 2(1): 76. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Such functions include questions, negation, relative clauses and topicalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boudreault|first=Patrick|author2=Mayberry, Rachel I.|year=2006|title=Grammatical processing in American Sign Language: Age of first-language acquisition effects in relation to syntactic structure|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|volume=21|issue=5|pages=608–635|doi=10.1080/01690960500139363}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASL and BSL use similar non-manual marking for yes/no questions, for example. They are shown through raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt.&lt;ref name="Baker&amp;Cokely"&gt;Baker, Charlotte, and Dennis Cokely (1980). ''American Sign Language: A teacher's resource text on grammar and culture.'' Silver Spring, MD: T.J. Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll"&gt;Sutton-Spence, Rachel, and Bencie Woll (1998). ''The linguistics of British Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adjectival and adverbial information is conveyed through non-manual elements, but what these elements are varies from language to language. For instance, in ASL a slightly open mouth with the tongue relaxed and visible in the corner of the mouth means 'carelessly', but a similar non-manual in BSL means 'boring' or 'unpleasant'.&lt;ref name=Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll /&gt;

Discourse functions such as [[conversation analysis|turn taking]] are largely regulated through head movement and eye gaze. Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Charlotte (1977). Regulators and turn-taking in American Sign Language discourse, in Lynn Friedman, ''On the other hand: New perspectives on American Sign Language.'' New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconicity ===
The first studies on [[iconicity]] in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klima &amp; Bellugi (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. "The Signs of Language." Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane. "Introduction." Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.

Some researchers have suggested that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to document this benefit. In his study, Brown found that when children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than when they were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties.

A central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or "English on the hands." One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.

The [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"&gt;Taub (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation ("[[construal]]" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"&gt;Wilcox (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for "ask" has parts of its form that are iconic ("movement away from the mouth" means "something coming from the mouth"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"&gt;Meir (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is "learning". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as "double mapped".&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"/&gt;

Although sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.

Sign languages may be classified by how they arise.

In non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.

A [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format=

[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.

Both contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.

[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&amp;nbsp;– it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the "gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1987). See also the classification of [[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann]] (1991) for the general issue of jargons as prototypes in sign language genesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lao sign language 025.jpg|thumb|Young students learn some words of [[Lao sign language]] from Suliphone, a deaf artist. This was one of several activities at a school book party sponsored by Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project in [[Laos]] where Suliphone works.]]
* [[British Sign Language|BSL]], [[Auslan]] and [[NZSL]] are usually considered to be a language known as [[BANZSL]]. [[Maritime Sign Language]] and [[South African Sign Language]] are also related to BSL.&lt;ref&gt;See Gordon (2008), under nsr {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014547/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }} and sfs {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921104537/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Danish Sign Language]] and its descendants [[Norwegian Sign Language]] and [[Icelandic Sign Language]] are largely mutually intelligible with [[Swedish Sign Language]]. [[Finnish Sign Language]] and [[Portuguese Sign Language]] derive from Swedish SL, though with local admixture in the case of mutually unintelligible Finnish SL.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} Danish SL has French SL influence and Wittmann (1991) places them in that family, though he proposes that Swedish, Finnish, and Portuguese SL are instead related to [[British Sign Language]].
* [[Indian Sign Language]] ISL is similar to [[Pakistani Sign Language]]. (ISL fingerspelling uses both hands, similarly to British Sign Language.).
* [[Japanese Sign Language]], [[Taiwanese Sign Language]] and [[Korean Sign Language]] are thought to be members of a [[Japanese Sign Language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Susan D. ''et al.'' (2010). "Variation in East Asian Sign Language Structures" in {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|''Sign Languages,'' p. 499.|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French Sign Language family]]. There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.
** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].
* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.
* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.
* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a "cluster" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.
* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].
* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].

The only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's classification went into [[Ethnologue]]'s database where it is still cited.{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072840/http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }} The subsequent edition of Ethnologue in 1992 went up to 81 sign languages, ultimately adopting Wittmann's distinction between primary and alternate sign languages (going back ultimately to Stokoe 1974) and, more vaguely, some other traits from his analysis. The 2013 version (17th edition) of [[Ethnologue]] is now up to 137 sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classification, the author distinguishes between primary and auxiliary sign languages&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann adds that this taxonomic criterion is not really applicable with any scientific rigor: Auxiliary sign languages, to the extent that they are full-fledged natural languages (and therefore included in his survey) at all, are mostly used by the deaf as well, and some primary sign languages (such as ASL and [[Adamorobe Sign Language]]) have acquired auxiliary usages.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as between single languages and names that are thought to refer to more than one language.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann includes in this class [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] (at least 14 different languages), [[Monastic sign language]], Thai Hill-Country sign languages (possibly including languages in Vietnam and Laos), and [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] (14 deaf schools with different sign languages).&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype-A class of languages includes all those sign languages that seemingly cannot be derived from any other language.&lt;ref name=pro-A&gt;These are [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Armenian Sign Language]], [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]], Hindu [[mudra]], the [[Monastic sign languages]], [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], [[Urubú-Kaapor Sign Language]], [[Chinese Sign Language]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Japanese Sign Language]], and maybe the various [[Thai Hill-Country sign languages]], [[French Sign Language]], [[Lyons Sign Language]], and [[Mayan sign languages|Nohya Maya Sign Language]]. Wittmann also includes, bizarrely, Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;/ref&gt; Prototype-R languages are languages that are remotely modelled on a prototype-A language (in many cases thought to have been French Sign Language) by a process Kroeber (1940) called "[[stimulus diffusion]]".&lt;ref name=pro-R&gt;These are [[Providencia Island Sign Language|Providencia Island]], [[Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia]] (manually signed Malay), [[German Sign Language|German]], [[Ecuadorian Sign Language|Ecuadoran]], [[Salvadoran Sign Language|Salvadoran]], [[Gestuno]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language|Indo-Pakistani]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Kenyan Sign Language|Kenyan]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian]], [[Spanish Sign Language|Spanish]], [[Nepali Sign Language|Nepali]] (with possible admixture), [[Penang Sign Language|Penang]], [[Rennellese Sign Language|Rennellese]], [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi]], the various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]], and perhaps BSL, [[Peruvian Sign Language|Peruvian]], [[Tijuana Sign Language|Tijuana]] (spurious), [[Venezuelan Sign Language|Venezuelan]], and [[Nicaraguan Sign Language|Nicaraguan]] sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; The families of [[BANZSL|BSL]], [[German Sign Language|DGS]], [[Japanese Sign Language|JSL]], [[French Sign Language|LSF]] (and possibly [[Lyons Sign Language|LSG]]) were the products of [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] of prototype languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's references on the subject, besides his own work on [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] in spoken languages, include papers such as Fischer (1974, 1978), Deuchar (1987) and Judy Kegl's pre-1991 work on creolization in sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Creolization is seen as enriching overt morphology in sign languages, as compared to reducing overt morphology in spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's explanation for this is that models of acquisition and transmission for sign languages are not based on any typical parent-child relation model of direct transmission which is inducive to variation and change to a greater extent. He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typology ===
{{See also|Linguistic typology}}

Linguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.

Sign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.

Sign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.

Brentari&lt;ref name="Brentari1998"&gt;Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35–36; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).

Another aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Zeshan, Cesar Ernesto Escobedo Delgado, Hasan Dikyuva, Sibaji Panda, and Connie de Vos. 2013. Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology. Linguistic Typology 17: 357–396.&lt;/ref&gt; Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.

=== Acquisition ===
{{See also|Language acquisition}}

Children who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the plasticity of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|date=|website=ACFOS|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262–290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Written forms ===
{{anchor|Notation}}&lt;!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here --&gt;
Sign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form. Many deaf people do not see a need to write their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = Jason | year = 2008 | title = Choosing how to write sign language: a sociolinguistic perspective | url = | journal = [[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]] | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 75–90 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2008.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ways to represent sign languages in written form have been developed.

* [[Stokoe notation]], devised by Dr. [[William Stokoe]] for his 1965 ''Dictionary of American Sign Language'',&lt;ref name="StokoeWilliam"&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt; is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.
* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.
* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].
* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.
* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.
* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).

So far, there is no consensus regarding the written form of sign language.  Except for SignWriting, none are widely used. Maria Galea writes that SignWriting "is becoming widespread, uncontainable and untraceable. In the same way that works written in and about a well developed writing system such as the Latin script, the time has arrived where SW is so widespread, that it is impossible in the same way to list all works that have been produced using this writing system and that have been written about this writing system."&lt;ref name="GaleaLinguistic"&gt;{{cite book

=== Sign perception ===
For a native signer, [[American Sign Language|sign]] [[Categorical perception|perception]] influences how the mind makes sense of their visual language experience. For example, a handshape may vary based on the other signs made before or after it, but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development.  The mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111142013/http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = P | year = 1991 | title = Human adults and human infants show a 'perceptual magnet effect' for the prototypes of speech categories, monkeys do not | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 93–107 | doi=10.3758/bf03212211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morford | first1 = J.

The mind ignores some of the similarities between different perceptual categories, at the same time preserving the visual information within each perceptual category of handshape variation.

=== Deaf communities and deaf culture ===
{{Main|Deaf culture}}

When Deaf people constitute a relatively small proportion of the general population, Deaf communities often develop that are distinct from the surrounding hearing community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These Deaf communities are very widespread in the world, associated especially with sign languages used in urban areas and throughout a nation, and the cultures they have developed are very rich.

One example of sign language variation in the Deaf community is [[Black ASL]]. This sign language was developed in the Black Deaf community as a variant during the American era of segregation and racism, where young Black Deaf students were forced to attend separate schools than their white Deaf peers.&lt;ref&gt;McCaskill, C. (2011). The hidden treasure of Black ASL: its history and structure. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of sign languages in hearing communities ===
On occasion, where the prevalence of deaf people is high enough, a deaf sign language has been taken up by an entire local community, forming what is sometimes called a "village sign language"&lt;ref name="ZeshanDeVos2012"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically this happens in small, tightly integrated communities with a closed gene pool. Famous examples include:
* [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[United States]]
* [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]], [[Israel]]
* [[Kata Kolok]], [[Bali]]
* [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Ghana]] 
* [[Mayan Sign Language#Yucatec Mayan Sign Language|Yucatec Maya Sign Language]], [[Mexico]] 
In such communities deaf people are generally well integrated in the general community and not socially disadvantaged, 
so much so that it is difficult to speak of a separate "Deaf" community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003" /&gt;

Many [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] arose in a context of extensive speech taboos, such as during mourning and initiation rites. They are or were especially highly developed among the [[Warlpiri Sign Language|Warlpiri]], [[Warumungu people|Warumungu]], [[Dieri]], [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]], [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]], and [[Warlmanpa language|Warlmanpa]], and are based on their respective spoken languages.

A [[pidgin]]{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=What is the evidence that it was a pidgin?}} sign language arose among tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the [[Great Plains]] region of [[North America]] (see [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]). It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.
In the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Signs may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.

=== Legal recognition ===
{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}
Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah C. E. Batterbury. 2012. ''Language Policy'' 11:253–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
[[File:Deaf or HoH person at his workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter and sign language SVCC 2007 Brigitte SLI + Mark.jpg|thumb|right|A deaf person using a remote VRS interpreter to communicate with a hearing person]]

One of the first demonstrations of the ability for [[telecommunication]]s to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]'s [[videophone]] (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&amp;nbsp;– two deaf users were able to freely communicate with each other between the fair and another city.&lt;ref name="BellLabs"&gt;Bell Laboratories RECORD (1969) [http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf A collection of several articles on the AT&amp;T Picturephone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623215926/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf |date=2012-06-23 }} (then about to be released) Bell Laboratories, Pg.134–153 &amp; 160–187, Volume 47, No. 5, May/June 1969;&lt;/ref&gt; However, video communication did not become widely available until sufficient bandwidth for the high volume of video data became available in the early 2000s.

The Internet now allows deaf people to talk via a [[video link]], either with a special-purpose [[videophone]] designed for use with sign language or with "off-the-shelf" [[videotelephony|video services]] designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer [[webcam]].  The [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|special videophones]] that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than 'off-the-shelf' services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximize the intelligibility of sign languages. Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person's video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.

=== Interpretation ===
{{Main|Language interpretation#Sign language}}
[[File:2017 Woodstock 022 Język migowy.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Sign Language]] interpreter at the [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2017]]
In order to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people, sign language interpreters are often used.  Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.

The interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.

With recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent [[deep learning]] based machine translation algorithms have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Huang | first=Jie | last2=Zhou | first2=Wengang | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Li | first4=Houqiang | last5=Li | first5=Weiping | title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation | website=arXiv.org e-Print archive | date=2018-01-30 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | archivedate=2018-03-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remote interpreting ===
&lt;!-- Note: the following text was originally copied from [[Language interpretation#Video interpreting|Language interpretation]]
but has been adapted extensively to fit into the context of this article.
 --&gt;
[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|175px|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]
{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}

Interpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.

However, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.

=== Interpretation on television ===
[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]

Sign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.

[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | publisher= | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | pages= | accessdate=2008-01-30 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.&lt;ref name="RNID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed. Some emerging [[television]] technologies allow the viewer to turn the signer on and off in a similar manner to [[subtitles]] and [[closed captioning]].&lt;ref name="RNID"/&gt;

Legal requirements covering sign language on television vary from country to country. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Broadcasting Act 1996]] addressed the requirements for blind and deaf viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |title=ITC Guidelines on Standards for Sign Language on Digital Terrestrial Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423180334/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |archivedate=2007-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been replaced by the [[Communications Act 2003]].

=== Language endangerment ===

For example, a sign language used by a small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users [[Language shift|shift]] to a sign language used by a larger community, as has happened with [[Hawai'i Sign Language]], which is almost extinct except for a few elderly signers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|title=Did you know Hawai'i Sign Language is critically endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065744/http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195139778|language=en|quote=The language is considered to be endangered. 9,600 deaf people in Hawaii now use American Sign Language with a few local signs for place-names and cultural items.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even national sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

== Communication systems similar to sign language ==
There are a number of communication systems that are similar in some respects to sign languages, while not having all the characteristics of a full sign language, particularly its grammatical structure. Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.

=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===
{{Main|Manually coded language}}

When Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.

=== "Baby sign language" with hearing children ===
{{Main|Baby sign language}}

It has become popular for hearing parents to teach signs (from ASL or some other sign language) to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs can be a beneficial option for better communication.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.  This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants.  When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.

This is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.

=== Home sign ===
{{Main|Home sign}}

Informal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes "home sign" or "kitchen sign").&lt;ref&gt;Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow &amp; Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Home sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.&lt;ref&gt;The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard. ({{cite web|title=Change Request Number: 2016-002|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|website=ISO 639-3|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2016-07-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128214659/http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-28|df=}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primate use===
{{Main|Great ape language#Primate use of sign language|l1=Great ape language § Primate use of sign language}}

=== Gestural theory of human language origins ===
{{Main|Origin of language#Gestural theory|l1=Origin of language § Gestural theory}}

One theory of the evolution of human language states that it developed first as a gestural system, which later shifted to speech.&lt;ref&gt;Hewes (1973), Premack &amp; Premack (1983), Kimura (1993), Newman (2002), Wittmann (1980, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; An important question for this gestural theory is what caused the shift to vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[universal algebra]] and in [[model theory]], a '''structure''' consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] along with a collection of [[finitary|finitary operations]] and [[finitary relation|relation]]s that are defined on it.

Universal algebra studies structures that generalize the [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[vector space]]s. The term '''universal algebra''' is used for structures with no [[relation symbol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Some authors refer to structures as "algebras" when generalizing universal algebra to allow [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] as well as functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model theory]] has a different scope that encompasses more arbitrary theories, including [[foundations of mathematics|foundational]] structures such as models of [[set theory]]. From the model-theoretic point of view, structures are the objects used to define the semantics of [[first-order logic]]. For a given theory in model theory, a structure is called a '''model''', if it satisfies the defining axioms of that theory, although it is sometimes disambiguated as a ''[[semantic model]]'' when one discusses the notion in the more general setting of [[mathematical model]]s. Logicians sometimes refer to structures as [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodges |first=Wilfrid |editor-last=Meijers |editor-first=Anthonie |date=2009 |chapter=Functional Modelling and Mathematical Models |title=Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences |series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science |publisher=Elsevier |volume=9 |isbn=978-0-444-51667-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[database theory]], structures with no functions are studied as models for relational [[database]]s, in the form of [[relational model]]s.

== Definition ==
{{see also|Model theory#Universal algebra|Universal algebra#Basic idea}}
Formally, a '''structure''' can be defined as a triple &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A=(A, \sigma, I)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a '''domain''' ''A'', a [[signature (logic)|signature]] σ, and an '''interpretation function''' ''I'' that indicates how the signature is to be interpreted on the domain. To indicate that a structure has a particular signature σ one can refer to it as a σ-structure.

=== Domain ===
The [[domain of discourse|domain]] of a structure is an arbitrary set; it is also called the '''underlying set''' of the structure, its '''carrier''' (especially in universal algebra), or its '''universe''' (especially in model theory). In classical first-order logic, the definition of a structure prohibits the [[empty domain]].&lt;ref&gt;This is similar to the definition of a [[prime number]] in elementary [[number theory]], which has been carefully chosen so that the [[irreducible element|irreducible]] number 1 is not considered prime. The convention that the domain of a structure may not be empty is particularly important in logic, because several common inference rules, notably, [[universal instantiation]], are not sound when empty structures are permitted. A logical system that allows the empty domain is known as an [[free logic|inclusive logic]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the notation &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dom}(\mathcal A)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; is used for the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, but often no notational distinction is made between a structure and its domain. (I.e. the same symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; refers both to the structure and its domain.)&lt;ref&gt;As a consequence of these conventions, the notation &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; may also be used to refer to the [[cardinality]] of the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;. In practice this never leads to confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signature ===
{{main article|Signature (logic)}}
The [[signature (logic)|signature]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma = (S, \operatorname{ar})&lt;/math&gt; of a structure consists of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of '''function symbols''' and '''relation symbols''' along with a function &lt;math&gt;\text{ar:}\ S \to \N_0&lt;/math&gt; that ascribes to each symbol ''s'' a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;n=\operatorname{ar}(s)&lt;/math&gt; which is called the '''arity''' of ''s'' because it is the [[arity]] of the interpretation of ''s''.

Since the signatures that arise in [[algebra]] often contain only function symbols, a signature with no relation symbols is called an '''algebraic signature'''. A structure with such a signature is also called an '''algebra'''; this should not be confused with the notion of an [[algebra over a field]].

=== Interpretation function ===
{{main article|Interpretation (model theory)}}
The '''interpretation function''' ''I'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; assigns functions and relations to the symbols of the signature. Each function symbol ''f'' of arity ''n'' is assigned an [[arity|''n''-ary]] function &lt;math&gt;f^{\mathcal A}=I(f)&lt;/math&gt; on the domain. Each relation symbol ''R'' of arity ''n'' is assigned an ''n''-ary relation &lt;math&gt;R^{\mathcal A}=I(R)\subseteq A^{\operatorname{ar(R)}}&lt;/math&gt; on the domain. A nullary function symbol ''c'' is called a '''constant symbol''', because its interpretation ''I(c)'' can be identified with a constant element of the domain.

When a structure (and hence an interpretation function) is given by context, no notational distinction is made between a symbol ''s'' and its interpretation ''I(s)''. For example, if ''f'' is a binary function symbol of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, one simply writes &lt;math&gt;f:\mathcal A^2\rightarrow\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;f^{\mathcal A}:|\mathcal A|^2\rightarrow|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Examples ===
The standard signature σ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;  for [[field (mathematics)|fields]] consists of two binary function symbols '''+''' and '''×''', where additional symbols can be derived, such as a unary function symbol '''―''' (uniquely determined by '''+''') and the two constant symbols '''0''' and '''1''' (uniquely determined by '''+''' and '''×''' respectively).
Thus a structure (algebra) for this signature consists of a set of elements ''A'' together with two binary functions, that can be enhanced with a unary function, and two distinguished elements; but there is no requirement that it satisfy any of the field axioms. The [[rational number]]s ''Q'', the [[real number]]s ''R'' and the [[complex number]]s ''C'', like any other field, can be regarded as σ-structures in an obvious way:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal Q = (Q, \sigma_f, I_{\mathcal Q})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal R = (R, \sigma_f, I_{\mathcal R})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C = (C, \sigma_f, I_{\mathcal C})&lt;/math&gt;

In all three cases we have the standard signature given by
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_f = (S_f,\operatorname{ar}_f)&lt;/math&gt; 
with
:::&lt;math&gt;S_f = \{+,\times,-,0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ar}_f(+) = \operatorname{ar}_f(\times) = 2, \operatorname{ar}_f(-) = 1, \operatorname{ar}_f(0) = \operatorname{ar}_f(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref name="sign_and_number" /&gt;

Interpretation functions:
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(+)\colon Q\times Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is addition of rational numbers,
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(\times)\colon Q\times Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is multiplication of rational numbers,
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(-)\colon Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is the function that takes each rational number ''x'' to -''x'', and
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(0)\in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the number 0 and
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(1)\in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the number 1;
and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; are similarly defined.&lt;ref name="sign_and_number"&gt;Note: '''0''', '''1''' and '''―''' on the left refer to signs of &lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt;. 0, 1, 2, and - on the right refer to natural numbers of &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; and to the unary operation ''minus'' in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

But the ring ''Z'' of [[integer]]s, which is not a field, is also a σ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;-structure in the same way. In fact, there is no requirement that ''any'' of the field axioms hold in a σ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;-structure.

A signature for [[ordered field]]s needs an additional binary relation such as &amp;lt; or ≤, and therefore structures for such a signature are not algebras, even though they are of course [[algebraic structure]]s in the usual, loose sense of the word.

The ordinary signature for set theory includes a single binary relation ∈.  A structure for this signature consists of a set of elements and an interpretation of the ∈ relation as a binary relation on these elements.

== Induced substructures and closed subsets ==
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[substructure (mathematics)|(induced) substructure]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; if
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; have the same signature &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathcal A)=\sigma(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;;
* the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|\subseteq |\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt;; and
* the interpretations of all function and relation symbols agree on &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt;.

The usual notation for this relation is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A\subseteq\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;.

A subset &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; of the domain of a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is called '''closed''' if it is closed under the functions of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. if the following condition is satisfied:  for every natural number ''n'', every ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'' (in the signature of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;) and all elements &lt;math&gt;b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n\in B&lt;/math&gt;, the result of applying ''f'' to the ''n''-tuple &lt;math&gt;b_1b_2\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; is again an element of ''B'': &lt;math&gt;f(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)\in B&lt;/math&gt;.

For every subset &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; there is a smallest closed subset of &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; that contains ''B''. It is called the closed subset '''generated''' by ''B'', or the '''hull''' of ''B'', and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\langle B\rangle_{\mathcal A}&lt;/math&gt;. The operator &lt;math&gt;\langle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[finitary closure operator]] on the [[power set|set of subsets]] of &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A=(A,\sigma,I)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset, then &lt;math&gt;(B,\sigma,I')&lt;/math&gt; is an induced substructure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I'&lt;/math&gt; assigns to every symbol of σ the restriction to ''B'' of its interpretation in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, the domain of an induced substructure is a closed subset.

The closed subsets (or induced substructures) of a structure form a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. The [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] of two subsets is their intersection. The [[join (mathematics)|join]] of two subsets is the closed subset generated by their union. Universal algebra studies the lattice of substructures of a structure in detail.

=== Examples ===
Let σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{+,&amp;nbsp;×,&amp;nbsp;−,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1} be again the standard signature for fields. When regarded as σ-structures in the natural way, the [[rational number]]s form a substructure of the [[real number]]s, and the real numbers form a substructure of the [[complex number]]s. The rational numbers are the smallest substructure of the real (or complex) numbers that also satisfies the field axioms.

The set of integers gives an even smaller substructure of the real numbers which is not a field. Indeed, the integers are the substructure of the real numbers generated by the empty set, using this signature.  The notion in abstract algebra that corresponds to a substructure of a field, in this signature, is that of a [[subring]], rather than that of a [[Field extension|subfield]].

The most obvious way to define a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a structure with a signature σ consisting of a single binary relation symbol ''E''. The vertices of the graph form the domain of the structure, and for two vertices ''a'' and ''b'', &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\!\in \text{E}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; means that ''a'' and ''b'' are connected by an edge. In this encoding, the notion of induced substructure is more restrictive than the notion of [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]]. For example, let ''G'' be a graph consisting of two vertices connected by an edge, and let ''H'' be the graph consisting of the same vertices but no edges. ''H'' is a subgraph of ''G'', but not an induced substructure. The notion in [[graph theory]] that corresponds to induced substructures is that of induced subgraphs.

== Homomorphisms and embeddings ==
{{see also|Universal algebra#Basic constructions}}

=== Homomorphisms ===
Given two structures &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; of the same signature σ, a '''(σ-)homomorphism''' from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is a [[map (mathematics)|map]] &lt;math&gt;h:|\mathcal A|\rightarrow|\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt; that preserves the functions and relations. More precisely:

* For every ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'' of σ and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\in|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;, the following equation holds:
::&lt;math&gt;h(f(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n))=f(h(a_1),h(a_2),\dots,h(a_n))&lt;/math&gt;.
* For every ''n''-ary relation symbol ''R'' of σ and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\in|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;, the following implication holds:
::&lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\in R \implies (h(a_1),h(a_2),\dots,h(a_n))\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

The notation for a homomorphism ''h'' from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;h: \mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;.

For every signature σ there is a [[concrete category|concrete]] [[category (mathematics)|category]] σ-'''Hom''' which has σ-structures as objects and σ-homomorphisms as [[morphism (category theory)|morphisms]].

A homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h: \mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called '''strong''' if for every ''n''-ary relation symbol ''R'' and any elements &lt;math&gt;b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n\in|\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)\in R&lt;/math&gt;, there are &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\in|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_1=h(a_1),\,b_2=h(a_2),\,\dots,\,b_n=h(a_n).&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=This definition of strong homomorphism looks non-standard.|date=September 2015}}
The strong homomorphisms give rise to a subcategory of σ-'''Hom'''.

=== Embeddings ===
A (σ-)homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is called a (σ-)'''embedding''' if it is [[injective function|one-to-one]] and

* for every ''n''-ary relation symbol ''R'' of σ and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n&lt;/math&gt;, the following equivalence holds:
::&lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\in R \iff(h(a_1),h(a_2),\dots,h(a_n))\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus an embedding is the same thing as a strong homomorphism which is one-to-one.
The category σ-'''Emb''' of σ-structures and σ-embeddings is a concrete [[subcategory]] of σ-'''Hom'''.

Induced substructures correspond to [[subobject]]s in σ-'''Emb'''. If σ has only function symbols, σ-'''Emb''' is the subcategory of [[monomorphism]]s of σ-'''Hom'''. In this case induced substructures also correspond to subobjects in σ-'''Hom'''.

=== Example ===
As seen above, in the standard encoding of graphs as structures the induced substructures are precisely the induced subgraphs. However, a [[graph homomorphism|homomorphism between graphs]] is the same thing as a homomorphism between the two structures coding the graph. In the example of the previous section, even though the subgraph ''H'' of ''G'' is not induced, the identity map id:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''G'' is a homomorphism. This map is in fact a [[monomorphism]] in the category σ-'''Hom''', and therefore ''H'' is a [[subobject]] of ''G'' which is not an induced substructure.

=== Homomorphism problem ===
The following problem is known as the ''homomorphism problem'':

:Given two finite structures &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; of a finite relational signature, find a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; or show that no such homomorphism exists.

Every [[constraint satisfaction problem]] (CSP) has a translation into the homomorphism problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Jeavons |first1=Peter |last2=Cohen |first2=David |last3=Pearson |first3=Justin |date=1998 |title=Constraints and universal algebra |journal=Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence |doi=10.1023/A:1018941030227 |volume=24 |pages=51–67 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the [[Complexity of constraint satisfaction#Constraint satisfaction and the homomorphism problem|complexity of CSP]] can be studied using the methods of [[finite model theory]].

Another application is in [[database theory]], where a [[relational model]] of a [[database]] is essentially the same thing as a relational structure. It turns out that a [[conjunctive query]] on a database can be described by another structure in the same signature as the database model. A homomorphism from the relational model to the structure representing the query is the same thing as a solution to the query. This shows that the conjunctive query problem is also equivalent to the homomorphism problem.

== Structures and first-order logic ==
{{see also|Model theory#First-order logic|Model theory#Axiomatizability, elimination of quantifiers, and model-completeness}}
Structures are sometimes referred to as "first-order structures". This is misleading, as nothing in their definition ties them to any specific logic, and in fact they are suitable as semantic objects both for very restricted fragments of first-order logic such as that used in universal algebra, and for [[second-order logic]]. In connection with first-order logic and model theory, structures are often called '''models''', even when the question "models of what?" has no obvious answer.

=== Satisfaction relation ===
Each first-order structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; has a '''satisfaction relation''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \vDash \phi&lt;/math&gt; defined for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\, \phi&lt;/math&gt;  in the language consisting of the language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; together with a constant symbol for each element of ''M'', which is interpreted as that element.
This relation is defined inductively using Tarski's [[T-schema]].

A structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''model''' of a [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] ''T'' if the language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the language of ''T'' and every sentence in ''T'' is satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.    Thus, for example, a "ring" is a structure for the language of rings that satisfies each of the ring axioms, and a model of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|ZFC set theory]] is a structure in the language of set theory that satisfies each of the ZFC axioms.

=== Definable relations ===
An ''n''-ary relation ''R'' on the universe ''M'' of a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''definable''' (or '''explicitly definable''', or &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;-'''definable''') if there is a formula φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that

:&lt;math&gt;R = \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n ) \in M^n : \mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, ''R'' is definable if and only if there is a formula φ such that

:&lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n ) \in R \Leftrightarrow  \mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
is correct.

An important special case is the definability of specific elements. An element ''m'' of ''M'' is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a formula φ(''x'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\vDash \forall x ( x = m \leftrightarrow \varphi(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

====Definability with parameters====
A relation ''R'' is said to be '''definable with parameters''' (or &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal M|&lt;/math&gt;-'''definable''') if there is a formula φ with parameters from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''R'' is definable using φ.    Every element of a structure is definable using the element itself as a parameter.

It should be noted that some authors use ''definable'' to mean ''definable without parameters'', while other authors mean ''definable with parameters''.  Broadly speaking, the convention that ''definable'' means ''definable without parameters'' is more common amongst set theorists, while the opposite convention is more common amongst model theorists.

====Implicit definability====
Recall from above that an ''n''-ary relation ''R'' on the universe ''M'' of a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is explicitly definable if there is a formula φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that

:&lt;math&gt;R = \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n ) \in M^n : \mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \}&lt;/math&gt;

Here the formula φ used to define a relation ''R'' must be over the signature of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and so φ may not mention ''R'' itself, since ''R'' is not in the signature of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  If there is a formula φ in the extended language containing the language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and a new symbol ''R'', and the relation ''R'' is the only relation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then ''R'' is said to be '''implicitly definable''' over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

By Beth's theorem, every implicitly definable relation is explicitly definable.

==Many-sorted structures==
Structures as defined above are sometimes called '''{{visible anchor|one-sorted structure}}s''' to distinguish them from the more general '''{{visible anchor|many-sorted structure}}s'''. A many-sorted structure can have an arbitrary number of domains. The '''sorts''' are part of the signature, and they play the role of names for the different domains. [[Signature (logic)#Many-sorted signatures|Many-sorted signatures]] also prescribe on which sorts the functions and relations of a many-sorted structure are defined. Therefore, the arities of function symbols or relation symbols must be more complicated objects such as tuples of sorts rather than natural numbers.

[[Vector space]]s, for example, can be regarded as two-sorted structures in the following way. The two-sorted signature of vector spaces consists of two sorts ''V'' (for vectors) and ''S'' (for scalars) and the following function symbols:

{| style="width:95%"
|-valign="top"
|
* +&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; and ×&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''S'',&amp;nbsp;''S'';&amp;nbsp;''S'').
* −&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''S'';&amp;nbsp;''S'').
* 0&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; and 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''S'').
|
* +&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''V'',&amp;nbsp;''V'';&amp;nbsp;''V'').
* −&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''V'';&amp;nbsp;''V'').
* 0&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''V'').
|
* × of arity (''S'',&amp;nbsp;''V'';&amp;nbsp;''V'').
|}

If ''V'' is a vector space over a field ''F'', the corresponding two-sorted structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V&lt;/math&gt; consists of the vector domain &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal V|_V=V&lt;/math&gt;, the scalar domain &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal V|_S=F&lt;/math&gt;, and the obvious functions, such as the vector zero &lt;math&gt;0_V^{\mathcal V}=0\in|\mathcal V|_V&lt;/math&gt;, the scalar zero &lt;math&gt;0_S^{\mathcal V}=0\in|\mathcal V|_S&lt;/math&gt;, or scalar multiplication &lt;math&gt;\times^{\mathcal V}:|\mathcal V|_S\times|\mathcal V|_V\rightarrow|\mathcal V|_V&lt;/math&gt;.

Many-sorted structures are often used as a convenient tool even when they could be avoided with a little effort. But they are rarely defined in a rigorous way, because it is straightforward and tedious (hence unrewarding) to carry out the generalization explicitly.

In most mathematical endeavours, not much attention is paid to the sorts. A [[many-sorted logic]] however naturally leads to a [[type theory]]. As [[Bart Jacobs]] puts it: "A logic is always a logic over a type theory." This emphasis in turn leads to [[categorical logic]] because a logic over a type theory categorically corresponds to one ("total") category, capturing the logic, being [[fibred category|fibred]] over another ("base") category, capturing the type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Other generalizations==

===Partial algebras===
Both universal algebra and model theory study classes of (structures or) algebras that are defined by a signature and a set of axioms. In the case of model theory these axioms have the form of first-order sentences. The formalism of universal algebra is much more restrictive; essentially it only allows first-order sentences that have the form of universally quantified equations between terms, e.g. {{all}}&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;{{all}}''y''&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''). One consequence is that the choice of a signature is more significant in universal algebra than it is in model theory. For example, the class of groups, in the signature consisting of the binary function symbol × and the constant symbol 1, is an [[elementary class]], but it is not a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]]. Universal algebra solves this problem by adding a unary function symbol &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the case of fields this strategy works only for addition. For multiplication it fails because 0 does not have a multiplicative inverse. An ad hoc attempt to deal with this would be to define 0&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. (This attempt fails, essentially because with this definition 0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is not true.) Therefore, one is naturally led to allow partial functions, i.e., functions that are defined only on a subset of their domain. However, there are several obvious ways to generalize notions such as substructure, homomorphism and identity.

=== Structures for typed languages ===
In [[type theory]], there are many sorts of variables, each of which has a '''type'''. Types are inductively defined; given two types δ and σ there is also a type σ → δ that represents functions from objects of type σ to objects of type δ. A structure for a typed language (in the ordinary first-order semantics) must include a separate set of objects of each type, and for a function type the structure must have complete information about the function represented by each object of that type.

===Higher-order languages===
{{main article|Second-order logic}}
There is more than one possible semantics for [[higher-order logic]], as discussed in the article on [[second-order logic]].  When using full higher-order semantics, a structure need only have a universe for objects of type 0, and the T-schema is extended so that a quantifier over a higher-order type is satisfied by the model if and only if it is disquotationally true.  When using first-order semantics, an additional sort is added for each higher-order type, as in the case of a many sorted first order language.

===Structures that are proper classes===
In the study of [[set theory]] and [[category theory]], it is sometimes useful to consider structures in which the domain of discourse is a [[proper class]] instead of a set. These structures are sometimes called '''class models''' to distinguish them from the "set models" discussed above. When the domain is a proper class, each function and relation symbol may also be represented by a proper class.

In [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', structures were also allowed to have a proper class as their domain.

'''Takako Saito''' (born 1929) is a Japanese artist. Closely associated with [[Fluxus]], the international collective of avant-garde artists that was active primarily in the 1960s and 1970s,  Saito contributed a number of performances and artworks to the movement, which continue to be exhibited in Fluxus exhibitions to the present day. She currently lives in [[Düsseldorf]] in Germany. She is most famous for  pieces like ''Silent Music'' or for her [[Spice Chess|special Chess]] sets.

==Early life==
[[Image:LiquorChess1975.jpg|thumb|left|270px|''Liquor Chess'', 1975. As the game progresses, players have to keep sampling the phials to ascertain the pieces' status.]]
Saito was born in Sabae-Shi, [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]] Province in Japan. Five Years after studying [[psychology]] at the [[Japan Women's University]], she became involved with ''Sōzō Biiku undŏ'', the 'Creative Art Education' movement. Founded 1952 by Sadajirŏ Kubo, the movement focussed on encouraging creativity through free will.&lt;ref name="Perform"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hVzPI1mvf1cC&amp;pg=RA1-PA117&amp;lpg=RA1-PA117&amp;dq=Takako+SAITO&amp;source=web&amp;ots=KudXkbExvb&amp;sig=8wpOfAOs6mJi_2-UO5gNZ8G5DYg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PRA1-PA118,M1 Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst attending a summer camp organized by the movement, Saito met a [[Tokyo]] member [[Ay-O]], an artist actively engaged in encouraging [[avant-garde]] groups in Japan. Ay-O became an important source of information for Saito about the avant-garde, first in Tokyo, and then, later, in [[New York City]], where he moved in 1958.&lt;ref name="Perform"/&gt; Intrigued by the reports being sent back by Ay-O, Saito also travelled to New York in 1963 ostensibly to work as a designer for a textile wholesaler and later studying at NY university, Brooklyn Museum Art School and Art Student League. It was through Ay-O that she was introduced to [[George Maciunas]], founder and organiser of Fluxus, and one of the central members of the New York avant-garde.

==Fluxus==
George Maciunas was fascinated by Japanese craftsmanship and owned some Japanese boxes. He was so impressed with Saito's craftmanship that he asked her to contribute a series of disrupted chess sets to sell in his new Flux shop on Canal Street, SoHo, New York. Maciunas was so delighted by ''Spice Chess'' in particular that he 'even took credit for it on occasion.'.&lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p461&lt;/ref&gt; Even after developing some distance to Fluxus Saito maintained contact with him until Maciunas' death.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"After a while, Maciunas proposed having dinner together every evening. In his opinion, buying food for many was more economical than buying for one... He called it Flux Dinner Commune. So George, [[Nam June Paik|Paik]], Takako, Shigeko and I started this part-time collective life. For the first few days, the men went shopping and the girls cooked. However we found it inconvenient, because George came back rather late from his office and then often didn't buy what we wanted to cook.... It didn't last long, because we got jobs at night. George was discouraged, but bravely said, "Well, work comes first, dinner second." Mieko Shiomi &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p129&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Saito remained part of the Fluxus movement throughout the 1960s and 70s,&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=takako+saito&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Oxford Art Online (subscription only)/ Fluxus]&lt;/ref&gt; producing multi-media, installation and sculptural work in collaboration with other artists such as [[Robert Filliou]], [[George Brecht]], [[Dorothy Iannone]], [[Gerhard Rühm]], [[Ben Vautier]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Bob Watts]]. Saito has contributed pieces to many Fluxus collaborations, including ''[[Fluxus 1]]'' (1964) and the ''Flux Cabinet'' (1975–77).&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; She is perhaps most well known for her "Silent Music" piece. Her output was diverse and she is also remembered for the various special [[chess]] sets including ''Smell Chess'' and ''[[Spice Chess]]'', and that were often included in the ''Flux Boxes'' from 1964 onwards, which was part of a Fluxus series of game variations of [[Chess]].

[[Image:DoItYourselfBookshop.jpeg|thumb|right|240px|''Do It Yourself Bookshop'', 1992.]]
Saito left New York in 1968, leading a peripatetic lifestyle until 1978. Saito lived in France, Germany, England and Italy, working with [[George Brecht]], [[Robert Filliou]], and with the Beau Geste Press, publishing artist's books.&lt;ref name="NRW"&gt;[http://www.nrw-museum.de/output/controller.aspx?cid=121&amp;detail=6&amp;detail2=76 Virtual Museum of Modernism]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979 to 1983, she taught at the [[University of Essen]]. Later pieces have maintained the fluxus ideal of eroding the boundaries between performer and viewer;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Saito's ''You and Me Shop'' again includes the idea of exchange with the viewer and of collaborative artistic work. In a small shop resembling a market stall, the artist as sales woman offered an arranged selection of those small things or materials which she also used in her objects: dried onion skins, chestnuts, pieces of wood. Here, the interaction with the viewer started with the joint selection, placement and fixation of the offered items on paper plates. It ended with the handing over of the object to the respective participant.' Virtual Museum of Modernism &lt;ref name="NRW"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aside from solo exhibitions in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Cologne]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], New York, [[Kansas]], [[Bremen]], [[Kaunas]] and [[Schwerin]], she has featured in recent exhibitions including Fluxus retrospectives at the Chapel Studio in [[Balatonboglár]] in 2002 and at [[Tate Modern]] London in 2008 and the ''Re-Imagining Asia'' at the [[House of World Cultures]] in [[Berlin]].

===Düsseldorf===
Since 1978, Saito has been living and working in Düsseldorf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12242">'''Cho Kiyoko''' (June 20, 1917 – April 12, 2018), better known as '''Takeda Kiyoko''', was a Japanese scholar of the history of ideas. In the 1950s she contributed to the people-to-people diplomacy that was hurt by the World War II, aimed at restoring human relations and understanding among Asian people, including Chinese, the Filipino, Indian and other Asian countries. She was the founder for the Social Studies Institute at the [[International Christian University]] (ICU) in Tokyo, Takeda Kiyoko was a professor emerita at ICU with a PhD in Literature from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1961.

==Biography==
Takeda Kiyoko was born in Hyogo Prefecture, and after graduating from the Department of English Studies at the [[Kobe College]], she went to the United States in 1939 and studied at [[Olivet College]] as an exchange student. When she finished Olivet, she extended her study abroad at [[Columbia University]] for two years,&lt;ref name="uofo"&gt;{{cite journal|pages=70–92|title=Takeda Kiyoko: A Twentieth-century Japanese Christian intellectual|last= Ward|first=Vanessa B.|work=New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies |volume=10|number=2|url= http://www.nzasia.org.nz/downloads/NZJAS-Dec08/5_Ward_4.pdf|publisher=University of Otago|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uofo"/&gt; transferred to [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York]] Graduate School. Takeda's chance to move from Olivet University in Michigan to New York was that her teaching adviser M. Holmes Hartshorne, a scholar and translator for works by [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kierkegaard, godly deceiver : the nature and meaning of his pseudonymous writings|last=Hartshorne|first=M.

During the World War II in Japan, Takeda tried to communicate with the military officers in charge of a factory she was a chaperon, how those Japanese high school and college students volunteer at the facilities were malnourished, by presenting the data of their weight she had listed.&lt;ref name=sugino1&gt;{{cite journal|language=ja|title=Joshi daigakusei no taikei ni tsuite no chosa|trans-title=The survey of university students and their physical being| author1=Takeda Kiyoko|author2=Mitsuuchi Mikiko|journal =Journal of Sugino Junior College|pages=1–15|number=23|issn=0286-2778|oclc=5171987012|year=1986|ref=harf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sugino2&gt;{{cite journal|language=ja|title=Joshi daigakusei no taikei ni tsuite no chosa |volume=2|trans-title=The survey of university students and their physical being| author1=Takeda Kiyoko|author2=Mitsuuchi Mikiko|journal =Journal of Sugino Junior College|pages=1–12|number=24|issn=0286-2778|oclc=5171987168|year=1987|ref=harf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although students nicknamed her after a fable character "Urashima Taro" or a person completely lost coming back from abroad. While pretending to obey the military official and national propaganda that Japan would win the War, Takeda found relief to know that those students disbelieved in the propaganda or they whispered among them the signs of defeat.&lt;ref name=nhk1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/postwar/program/past/|series=戦後史証言プロジェクト : 日本人は何をめざしてきたのか （２０１４年度「知の巨人たち」ひとびとの哲学を見つめて～鶴見俊輔と「思想の科学」～３）|title=貝殻型の人間像|author=Takeda Kiyoko|date=2014-05-16|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war activities==
It was during the Christian Youth Convention in Amsterdam in 1939 which she joined as an undergraduate at the Kobe College, and she started her thought about Japan and her relationship to other countries with lasting impact that she was unwelcome as a young woman coming from Japan. As she tried to acquaint with a Chinese woman student who lead the student protest activities in China, that person replied Takeda needed to persuade the Japanese forces to leave her nation before becoming a friend of hers.&lt;ref name=nikkeki&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO89376990W5A710C1000000/|title=思想史学者・武田清子氏「違う文化尊重を」（戦争と私）|author=社会部、山本有洋|work=戦後70年インタビュー|language=ja|trans-title=To respect different culture (Me and the War)|series=Interviews on the 70th year Post-war|publisher=[[The Nikkei]]|date=2015-07-31|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takeda appreciates the trend in the late 1940s to early 1950s in Japanese philosophy that people sought to find their own policy, or defined it as "common men's philosophy " (hitobito no tetsugaku).&lt;ref name=nhk3/&gt;
To realize world peace after World War II, Takeda started to analyze politics and international relations from the viewpoint of ideological history, and on the other hand, she showed an example of &lt;private diplomacy&gt; or emphasized people-to-people trust among Asian including Japanese and Chinese, the Filipino, Indian and others. She confirmed with herself at the 3rd World Conference of Christian Youth held in India in December 1952.&lt;ref name=nhk3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takeda had an interview with Prime Minister Neal of India in Tokyo through Christian connections.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 1953 Takeda started teaching as an associate professor at International Christian University researching to review the historic relationship between Japan and Asia, and led a community that evolved to the Asian Culture Research Institute in 1971.&lt;ref name=40anniversary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subsite.icu.ac.jp/research/iacs/1998-2008/#link2|title=Ajia bunka kenkyujo 40-shunen kinen kokusai shinpojiumu|trans-title=the symposium for the 40th anniversary of ICU Institute of Asian Cultural Studies|author=Cho (Takeda) Kiyoko, first president of ICU Institute of Asian Cultural Studies, Professor Emeritus at ICU |date=1998-12-24|publisher=ICU Institute for Asian Studies|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thurman v. City of Torrington''''', [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|DC]], 595 F.Supp. 1521 (1985) was a court decision concerning Tracey Thurman, a [[Connecticut]] homemaker who sued the city police department in [[Torrington, Connecticut]], claiming a failure of [[Civil and political rights|equal protection under the law]] against her abusive husband Charles "Buck" Thurman, Sr.

==Case==
After Tracey Thurman was attacked, stabbed, and nearly killed by her husband on June 10, 1983, a subsequent civil lawsuit judged that the local police had ignored growing signs of [[domestic violence]] and had casually dismissed [[restraining order]]s and other legal bars to keep Charles "Buck" Thurman, Sr. away from his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CHRIS PARKERRepublican-American |url=http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2008/06/08/news/doc484b2ed8d4eb7320766604.txt |title=No nonsense, no bitterness, better policing The Republican-American |publisher=Rep-am.com |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2011-09-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033306/http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2008/06/08/news/doc484b2ed8d4eb7320766604.txt |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this lawsuit, filed in 1984, Thurman was the first woman in America to sue a town and its police department for violating her civil rights, claiming the police had ignored the violence because she was married to the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic-violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded $2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic-violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Thurman lawsuit brought about sweeping national reform of domestic violence laws, including the "Thurman Law" (aka the Family Violence Prevention and Response Act) instituted in Connecticut in 1986, making domestic violence an automatically arrestable offense, even if the victim does not wish to press charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/thurmanexcerpt.html |title=Thurman v. City of Torrington |publisher=harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracey Thurman's story was later made into a 1989 television movie, entitled ''[[A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story]]'', starring [[Nancy McKeon]] as Tracey, [[Dale Midkiff]] as Buck, [[Bruce Weitz]] as Tracey's lawyer Burton Weinstein, and [[Philip Baker Hall]] as presiding Judge Blumenfeld.

[[Image:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|right|250px|A diagram depicting the poloidal (&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) direction, represented by the red arrow, and the toroidal (&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) direction, represented by the blue arrow.]]The earliest use of these terms cited by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is by [[Walter M. Elsasser]] (1946) in the context of the generation of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] by currents in the core, with "toroidal" being parallel to lines of latitude and "poloidal" being in the direction of the magnetic field (i.e. towards the poles).

The OED also records the later usage of these terms in the context of toroidally confined plasmas, as encountered in [[magnetic confinement fusion]]. In the plasma context, the toroidal direction is the long way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by ''z'' in the slab approximation or &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in magnetic coordinates; the poloidal direction is the short way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by ''y'' in the slab approximation or &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in magnetic coordinates. (The third direction, normal to the magnetic surfaces, is often called the "radial direction", denoted by ''x'' in the slab approximation and variously &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, ''r'', &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, or ''s'' in magnetic coordinates.)

==Toroidal and poloidal coordinates==
As a simple example from the physics of magnetically confined plasmas, consider an axisymmetric system with circular, concentric magnetic flux surfaces of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (a crude approximation to the magnetic field geometry in an early [Tokamak] but topologically equivalent to any toroidal magnetic confinement system with nested flux surfaces) and denote the toroidal angle by &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; and the poloidal angle by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the Toroidal/Poloidal coordinate system relates to standard [[Cartesian_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates_in_three_dimensions|Cartesian Coordinates]] by these transformation rules:

:&lt;math&gt; x  = (R_0 +r \cos \theta) \cos\zeta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y  = s_\zeta (R_0 + r \cos \theta) \sin\zeta  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z  = s_\theta r \sin \theta. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = \pm 1, s_\zeta = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The natural choice [[Torus#Geometry|geometrically]] is to take &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, giving the toroidal and poloidal directions shown by the arrows in the figure above, but this makes &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\zeta&lt;/math&gt; a left-handed curvilinear coordinate system. As it is usually assumed in setting up [http://www-fusion.ciemat.es/fusionwiki/index.php/Flux_coordinates#Flux_coordinates|''flux coordinates''] for describing magnetically confined plasmas that  the set &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\zeta&lt;/math&gt; forms a ''right''-handed coordinate system, &lt;math&gt; \nabla r\cdot\nabla\theta\times\nabla\zeta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we must either reverse the poloidal direction by taking &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = -1, s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, or reverse the toroidal direction by taking &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = +1, s_\zeta = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Both choices are used in the literature.

==Kinematics in toroidal and poloidal coordinates==

To study single particle motion in toroidally confined plasma devices, velocity and acceleration vectors must be known. Considering the natural choice &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, the unit vectors of toroidal and poloidal coordinates system &lt;math&gt;\left(r,\theta,\zeta\right)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta \cos\zeta \\
    \cos\theta \sin\zeta \\
    \sin\theta
\end{pmatrix} \quad
\mathbf{e}_\theta = \begin{pmatrix}
    -\sin\theta \cos\zeta \\
    -\sin\theta \sin\zeta \\
    \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix} \quad
\mathbf{e}_\zeta = \begin{pmatrix}
    -\sin\zeta \\
    \cos\zeta \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

according to Cartesian coordinates. The position vector is expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = \left( r + R_0 \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_r - R_0 \sin\theta \mathbf{e}_\theta &lt;/math&gt;

The velocity vector is then given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\dot{r}} = \dot{r} \mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta} \mathbf{e}_\theta + \dot{\zeta} \left( R_0 + r \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_\zeta &lt;/math&gt;

and the acceleration vector is:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\ddot{r}} = \left( \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 - r \dot{\zeta}^2 \cos^2\theta - R_0 \dot{\zeta}^2 \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_r &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; + \left( 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} + r\dot{\zeta}^2\cos\theta\sin\theta + R_0 \dot{\zeta}^2 \sin\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_\theta &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; + \left( 2 \dot{r}\dot{\zeta}\cos\theta - 2 r \dot{\theta}\dot{\zeta} \sin\theta + \ddot{\zeta} \left( R_0 + r\cos\theta \right) \right) \mathbf{e}_\zeta &lt;/math&gt;

'''UpStage''' is an open source server-side application that has been purpose built for [[Cyberformance]]: multiple artists collaborate in real time via the UpStage platform to create and present live theatrical performances, for audiences who can be online (from anywhere in the world) or in a shared space, and who can interact with the performance via a text chat tool. It can also be understood as a form of [[digital puppetry]]. It is the first open source platform designed specifically for avatar performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nonverbal Communication in Virtual Worlds|last=Tanenbaum|first=Joshua|last2=El-Nasr|first2=Magy Seif|last3=Nixon|first3=Michael|publisher=ETC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-304-81204-9|location=USA|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and context==
[[File:Indigenous Maniacs.jpg|thumb|Screengrab from "Indigenous Maniacs", a performance created by UpStage workshop participants at the Computing Women's Congress, Waikato University (NZ), February 2006.]]UpStage was developed during 2003 by programmer [http://halo.gen.nz Douglas Bagnall], to realise the vision of [[cyberformance]] troupe Avatar Body ''Collision''; the group had been creating live performance on the internet using free chat applications such as iVisit and the Palace, and wanted to create an application that better met their artistic needs. The first version of the software was created with a grant from the Smash Palace Collaboration Fund, a joint initiative of [[Creative New Zealand]] and the [[Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (New Zealand)|NZ Ministry for Research, Science and Technology]]; it was launched on 9 January 2004 and began to be used by artists and students around the world, as well as by the originators, Avatar Body ''Collision''.

In 2006, the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the [[Auckland University of Technology]] began a relationship with the UpStage project, which has seen teams of final year software development students work on UpStage as a real-world software development project. This has provided invaluable ongoing maintenance and development for the software.

Also in 2006, UpStage received a second grant, this time from the Community Partnership Fund of the New Zealand government's Digital Strategy, which enabled the development of UpStage V2. Douglas Bagnall was once again the lead developer, working this time in conjunction with the AUT students. UpStage V2 was launched in June 2007, with a two-week exhibition at the [[New Zealand Film Archive]] and the first UpStage festival, 070707. The festival featured 13 performances by artists from around the world and took place over a 12-hour period on 7 July 2007. 

A second festival was held on 080808 (8–9 August 2008), this time covering an 18-hour period and involving artists from at least 14 time zones. It was reviewed in the Australian Stage Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-11-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, festivals were held annually on the successive monthly dates until 121212 (12 December 2012) when the festival extended over a period of one week and included cyberformance in UpStage and other online platforms. A number of works from previous festivals were restaged as a retrospective programme within the festival.

Although "131313" was not possible, the tenth birthday of UpStage was celebrated 13 months after 121212, with a mini-festival of three performances and a meeting to discuss the future of UpStage. At this point, UpStage was unfunded and sustained by volunteers and the (also voluntary) work of the AUT student team. The meeting took place physically in Wellington, New Zealand, and online participants joined via UpStage. Everyone agreed that the project should continue - somehow - and also agreed that the software itself needs to be completely redeveloped, in order to take advantage of newer technologies and be more easily developed and maintained by globally dispersed open source developers.

==Features of UpStage==
[[File:Eindhoven02.png|thumb|Screengrab from the cyberformance "We have a situation - Peopoly", performed online in UpStage and at De Bibliotheek Eindhoven on 18 April 2013.]]As a web-based [[server-side]] application, UpStage can be accessed by both performers and audiences from almost any internet connected computer, using any operating system and browser; computers behind [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] may require specific ports to be open, and the browser must have the [[Flash player]] plug-in as this is used to serve the media to the browser.

"Players" (performers) log into UpStage and have access to a "workshop" or backstage area where they can upload media (graphics and audio), create "stages", and assign media to stages. Once on the stage, a logged-in player has access to numerous tools which allow them to manipulate the media - place, move and speak aloud with graphical avatars (using [[Text2Speech|text2speech]]), change backdrops, play audio files, draw directly on the stage in real time, add live web cam feeds, use text chat and perform other tasks in order to create and present a performance.

Audience members (also known as "chatters") do not log in - they simply follow a link from an email or another web page, and arrive at the stage which loads as a web page in their browser. They do not see any of the player tools, but they see and hear everything that the players are creating on the stage, and they can chat in the text chat along with the players. Audience chat appears grey and silent, while player chat is black and spoken aloud.

Newcomers (both players and audience) to UpStage can learn the basics very quickly, and the fact that no additional software download is required (unless the Flash player plug-in is not already installed) makes it very accessible. The chat interface encourages playful banter and audience members contribute to and embellish the performance via the chat.

The media used in UpStage performances is created outside of UpStage, using graphic or audio software. Once optimised for Upstage, it is then uploaded via the web interface known as the Workshop and becomes available to everyone who has a log in for that particular UpStage server.

UpStage is an [[open source]] project; it can be downloaded from the [[GitHub]] site and installed on a web server, giving control over who has log-in access. The interface can also be customised.

'''Village Homes''' is a [[planned community]] in [[Davis, California|Davis]], [[Yolo County]], [[California]]. It is designed to be ecologically sustainable by harnessing the energies and natural resources that exists in the landscape, especially [[stormwater]] and [[solar energy]].

==History==
The principal designer of Village Homes was architect Mike Corbett who began planning in the 1960s, with construction continuing from south to north from the 1970s through the 1980s. Village Homes was completed in 1982, and has attracted international attention from its inception as an early model of an environmentally friendly housing development, including a visit from then-French President [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org About Village Homes]; {{cite web |url=http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609124520/http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df= }}; Smart Communities, [http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml "Village Homes."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817204157/http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml |date=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
[[File:Grass lined channel NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Grass lined swale collects rainwater, which then slowly percolates into the soil, where it is protected from runoff and evaporation.]]
The 225 homes and 20 apartment units that now are the Village Homes community use solar panels for heating, and they are oriented around common areas at the rear of the buildings, rather than around the street at the front. All streets are oriented east-west, with all lots positioned north-south. This feature has become standard practice in Davis and elsewhere since it enables homes with passive solar designs to make full use of the sun's energy throughout the year. The development also uses natural drainage, called bioswales, to collect water to irrigate the common areas and support the cultivation of edible foods, such as nut and fruit trees and vegetables for consumption by residents, without incurring the cost of using treated municipal water.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org Village Homes, Davis, California]; Bill Browning and Kim Hamilton, [http://www.context.org/iclib/ic35/browning/ "Village Homes: A model solar community proves its worth"]; Smart Communities, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[set theory]], '''Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory''', named after mathematicians [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]], is an [[axiomatic system]] that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a [[theory of sets]] free of paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]].  Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] (AC) included is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated '''ZFC''', where C stands for "choice",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciesielski|1997}}.  "Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (abbreviated as ZFC where C stands for the axiom of Choice"&lt;/ref&gt; and '''ZF''' refers to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. 

Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is intended to formalize a single primitive notion, that of a [[hereditary set|hereditary]] [[well-founded]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]], so that all [[Entity|entities]] in the [[universe of discourse]] are such sets. Thus the [[axiom]]s of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory refer only to [[pure set]]s and prevent its [[Model theory|model]]s from containing [[urelement]]s (elements of sets that are not themselves sets). Furthermore, [[proper class]]es (collections of [[mathematical object]]s defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly. Specifically, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory does not allow for the existence of a [[universal set]] (a set containing all sets) nor for [[unrestricted comprehension]], thereby avoiding Russell's paradox. [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) is a commonly used [[conservative extension]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that does allow explicit treatment of proper classes.

There are many equivalent formulations of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.  Most of the axioms state the existence of particular sets defined from other sets. For example, the [[axiom of pairing]] says that given any two sets ''a'' and ''b'' there is a new set {''a'', ''b''} containing exactly ''a'' and ''b''. Other axioms describe properties of set membership. A goal of the axioms is that each axiom should be true if interpreted as a statement about the collection of all sets in the [[von Neumann universe]] (also known as the cumulative hierarchy).

The [[metamathematics]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory has been extensively studied. Landmark results in this area established the [[Independence (mathematical logic)|logical independence]] of the axiom of choice from the remaining ZFC axioms (see [[Axiom of choice#Independence]]) and of the [[continuum hypothesis]] from ZFC.The [[consistency]] of a theory such as ZFC cannot be proved within the theory itself.

Formally, ZFC is a [[Many-sorted first-order logic|one-sorted theory]] in [[first-order logic]]. The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] has equality and a single primitive [[binary relation]], [[set membership]], which is usually denoted ∈. The formula ''a'' ∈ ''b'' means that the set ''a'' is a member of the set ''b'' (which is also read, "''a'' is an element of ''b''" or "''a'' is in ''b''").

== History ==

The modern study of [[set theory]] was initiated by [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Richard Dedekind]] in the 1870s. However, the discovery of [[Paradoxes of set theory|paradoxes]] in [[naive set theory]], such as [[Russell's paradox]], led to the desire for a more rigorous form of set theory that was free of these paradoxes.

In 1908, [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed the first [[axiomatic set theory]], [[Zermelo set theory]]. However, as first pointed out by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] in a 1921 letter to Zermelo, this theory was incapable of proving the existence of certain sets and [[cardinal number]]s whose existence was taken for granted by most set theorists of the time, notably the cardinal number &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; and the set {Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;weierp;(Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), &amp;weierp;(&amp;weierp;(Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)),...}, where Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is any infinite set and &amp;weierp; is the power set operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ebbinghaus|2007|page=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of Zermelo's axioms invoked a concept, that of a "definite" property, whose operational meaning was not clear. In 1922, Fraenkel and [[Thoralf Skolem]] independently proposed operationalizing a "definite" property as one that could be formulated as a [[first-order logic|first order theory]] whose [[atomic formula]]s were limited to set membership and identity. They also independently proposed replacing the [[axiom schema of specification]] with the [[axiom schema of replacement]]. Appending this schema, as well as the [[axiom of regularity]] (first proposed by [[Dimitry Mirimanoff]] in 1917), to Zermelo set theory yields the theory denoted by '''ZF'''. Adding to ZF either the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) or a statement that is equivalent to it yields ZFC.

== Axioms ==

There are many equivalent formulations of the ZFC axioms; for a discussion of this see {{harvnb|Fraenkel|Bar-Hillel|Lévy|1973}}.  The following particular axiom set is from {{harvtxt|Kunen|1980}}. The axioms per se are expressed in the symbolism of [[first order logic]]. The associated English prose is only intended to aid the intuition.
&lt;!-- **NOTE TO EDITORS** The symbolic axioms are taken from Kunen, and should not be changed without discussion on the talk page.  Making up a new set of axioms is original research. The English descriptions are new here and can be freely changed.  The choice of Kunen instead of Jech or some other author was arbitrary, and is open for discussion on the talk page. --&gt;

All formulations of ZFC imply that at least one set exists. Kunen includes an axiom that directly asserts the existence of a set, in addition to the axioms given below (although he notes that he does so only “for emphasis”).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kunen|1980|page=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its omission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics of first-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the [[domain of discourse]] must be nonempty. Hence, it is a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists &amp;mdash; usually expressed as the assertion that something is identical to itself, &amp;exist;x(x=x). Consequently, it is a theorem of every first-order theory that something exists. However, as noted above, because in the intended semantics of ZFC there are only sets, the interpretation of this logical theorem in the context of ZFC is that some ''set'' exists. Hence, there is no need for a separate axiom asserting that a set exists. Second, however, even if ZFC is formulated in so-called [[free logic]], in which it is not provable from logic alone that something exists, the axiom of infinity (below) asserts that an ''infinite'' set exists. This implies that ''a'' set exists and so, once again, it is superfluous to include an axiom asserting as much.

=== 1. Axiom of extensionality ===
{{Main| Axiom of extensionality}}

Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow x = y].&lt;/math&gt;

The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]. If the background logic does not include equality "=", ''x''=''y'' may be defined as an abbreviation for the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|1982|page=138}}, def.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z [z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y] \land \forall w [x \in w \Leftrightarrow y \in w].&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the axiom of extensionality can be reformulated as

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow \forall w (x \in w \Leftrightarrow y \in w)],&lt;/math&gt;

which says that if  ''x'' and ''y'' have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fraenkel|Bar-Hillel|Lévy|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2. Axiom of regularity (also called the Axiom of foundation) ===
{{Main|Axiom of regularity}}

Every non-empty set ''x'' contains a member ''y'' such that ''x'' and ''y'' are [[disjoint sets]].

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x [\exists a ( a \in x) \Rightarrow \exists y ( y \in x \land \lnot \exists z (z \in y \land z \in x))].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoenfield|2001|page=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
or in modern notation:
&lt;math&gt;\forall x\,(x \neq \varnothing \rightarrow \exists y \in x\,(y \cap x = \varnothing))&lt;/math&gt; 

This implies, for example, that no set is an element of itself and that every set has an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] [[rank (set theory)|rank]].

=== 3. Axiom schema of specification (also called the axiom schema of separation or of restricted comprehension) ===
{{Main|Axiom schema of specification}}

Subsets are commonly constructed using [[set builder notation]]. For example, the even integers can be constructed as the subset of the integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the [[Congruence modulo n|congruence modulo]] predicate &lt;math&gt;x \equiv 0 \pmod 2&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \equiv 0 \pmod 2\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the subset of a set ''z'' obeying a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;(''x'') with one free variable ''x'' may be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in z : \phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification states that this subset always exists (it is an [[axiom schema|axiom ''schema'']] because there is one axiom for each &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be any formula in the language of ZFC with all free variables among &lt;math&gt;x,z,w_1,\ldots,w_n&lt;/math&gt; (''y'' is ''not'' free in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). Then:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z \forall w_1 \forall w_2\ldots \forall w_n \exists y \forall x [x \in y \Leftrightarrow ( x \in z \land \phi )].&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the axiom schema of specification can only construct subsets, and does not allow the construction of sets of the more general form:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x : \phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This restriction is necessary to avoid [[Russell's paradox]] and its variants that accompany naive set theory with [[unrestricted comprehension]].

In some other axiomatizations of ZF, this axiom is redundant in that it follows from the [[axiom schema of replacement]] and the [[axiom of the empty set]].

On the other hand, the axiom of specification can be used to prove the existence of the [[empty set]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, once at least one set is known to exist (see above). One way to do this is to use a property &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; which no set has. For example, if ''w'' is any existing set, the empty set can be constructed as

: &lt;math&gt;\varnothing = \{u \in w \mid (u \in u) \land \lnot (u \in u) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the [[axiom of the empty set]] is implied by the nine axioms presented here.  The axiom of extensionality implies the empty set is unique (does not depend on ''w''). It is common to make a [[definitional extension]] that adds the symbol &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; to the language of ZFC.

=== 4. Axiom of pairing ===
{{Main|Axiom of pairing}}

If ''x'' and ''y'' are sets, then there exists a set which contains ''x'' and ''y'' as elements.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \exists z (x \in z \land y \in z).&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification must be used to reduce this to a set with exactly these two elements. The axiom of pairing is part of Z, but is redundant in ZF because it follows from the axiom schema of replacement, if we are given a set with at least two elements. The existence of a set with at least two elements is assured by either the [[axiom of infinity]], or by the axiom schema of specification and  the [[axiom of the power set]] applied twice to any set.

=== 5. Axiom of union ===
{{Main|Axiom of union}}

The union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set &lt;math&gt;\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The axiom of union states that for any set of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; there is a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; containing every element that is a member of some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\forall \mathcal{F} \,\exists A \, \forall Y\, \forall x [(x \in Y \land Y \in \mathcal{F}) \Rightarrow x \in A].&lt;/math&gt;
Although this formula doesn't directly assert the existence of &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the above using the axiom schema of specification:
: &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}:=\{x\in A : \exists Y (x \in Y \land Y \in \mathcal{F})\}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== 6. Axiom schema of replacement ===
{{Main|Axiom schema of replacement}}

The axiom schema of replacement asserts that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be any [[Well-formed formula|formula]] in the language of ZFC whose [[free variable]]s are among &lt;math&gt;x,y,A,w_1,\dotsc,w_n&lt;/math&gt;, so that in particular &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is not free in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall A\forall w_1 \forall w_2\ldots \forall w_n \bigl[\forall x ( x\in A \Rightarrow \exists! y\,\phi ) \Rightarrow \exists B \ \forall x \bigl(x\in A \Rightarrow \exists y (y\in B \land \phi)\bigr)\bigr].&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if the relation &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; represents a definable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; represents its [[domain of a function|domain]], and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a set for every &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of some set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The form stated here, in which &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; may be larger than strictly necessary, is sometimes called the [[Axiom schema of replacement#Axiom schema of collection|axiom schema of collection]].

Let &lt;math&gt;S(w)&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt; w \cup \{w\} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt; is some set. (We can see that &lt;math&gt;\{w\}&lt;/math&gt; is a valid set by applying the Axiom of Pairing with &lt;math&gt; x=y=w &lt;/math&gt; so that the set &lt;math&gt;z &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{w\} &lt;/math&gt;). Then there exists a set ''X'' such that the empty set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of ''X'' and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''.

: &lt;math&gt;\exists X \left [\varnothing \in X \land \forall y (y \in X \Rightarrow S(y)  \in X)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

More colloquially, there exists a set ''X'' having infinitely many members. (It must be established, however, that these members are all different, because if two elements are the same, the sequence will loop around in a finite cycle of sets. The axiom of regularity prevents this from happening.) The minimal set ''X'' satisfying the axiom of infinity is the [[von Neumann ordinal]] ω, which can also be thought of as the set of [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== 8. Axiom of power set ===
{{Main|Axiom of power set}}

By definition a set ''z'' is a [[subset]] of a set ''x'' if and only if every element of ''z'' is also an element of ''x'':

: &lt;math&gt;(z \subseteq x) \Leftrightarrow ( \forall q (q \in z \Rightarrow q \in x)).&lt;/math&gt;

The Axiom of Power Set states that for any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' that  contains every subset of ''x'':

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y \forall z [z \subseteq x \Rightarrow z \in y].&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification is then used to define the [[power set]] ''P(x)'' as the subset of such a ''y'' containing the subsets of ''x'' exactly:

: &lt;math&gt;P(x) = \{ z \in y: z \subseteq x  \}&lt;/math&gt;

Axioms '''1&amp;ndash;8''' define ZF. Alternative forms of these axioms are often encountered, some of which are listed in {{harvtxt|Jech|2003}}. Some ZF axiomatizations include an axiom asserting that the [[axiom of empty set|empty set exists]]. The axioms of pairing, union, replacement, and power set are often stated so that the members of the set ''x'' whose existence is being asserted are just those sets which the axiom asserts ''x'' must contain.

The following axiom is added to turn ZF into ZFC:

=== 9. Well-ordering theorem ===
{{Main|Well-ordering theorem}}

For any set ''X'', there is a [[binary relation]] ''R'' which [[wellordering|well-orders]] ''X''.  This means ''R'' is a [[linear order]] on ''X'' such that every nonempty [[subset]] of ''X'' has a member which is minimal under ''R''.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall X \exists R ( R \;\mbox{well-orders}\; X).&lt;/math&gt;

Given axioms '''1–8''', there are many statements {{not a typo|provably}} equivalent to axiom '''9''', the best known of which is the [[axiom of choice]] (AC), which goes as follows. Let ''X'' be a set whose members are all non-empty. Then there exists a function ''f'' from ''X'' to the union of the members of ''X'', called a "[[choice function]]", such that for all {{math|''Y'' ∈ ''X''}} one has {{math|''f''(''Y'') ∈ ''Y''}}. Since the existence of a choice function when ''X'' is a [[finite set]] is easily proved from axioms '''1–8''', AC only matters for certain [[infinite set]]s. AC is characterized as [[constructive mathematics|nonconstructive]] because it asserts the existence of a choice set but says nothing about how the choice set is to be "constructed."  Much research{{vague|date=November 2018}} has sought to characterize the definability (or lack thereof) of certain sets{{example needed|date=November 2018}} whose existence AC asserts.

== Motivation via the cumulative hierarchy ==

One motivation for the ZFC axioms is [[the cumulative hierarchy]] of sets introduced by [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoenfield|1977}}, section&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this viewpoint, the universe of set theory is built up in stages, with one stage for each [[ordinal number]]. At stage 0 there are no sets yet. At each following stage, a set is added to the universe if all of its elements have been added at previous stages. Thus the empty set is added at stage 1, and the set containing the empty set is added at stage 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinman|2005|page=467}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of all sets that are obtained in this way, over all the stages, is known as V. The sets in V can be arranged into a hierarchy by assigning to each set the first stage at which that set was added to V.

It is provable that a set is in V if and only if the set is [[pure set|pure]] and [[well-founded set|well-founded]]; and provable that V satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, if the class of ordinals has appropriate reflection properties. For example, suppose that a set ''x'' is added at stage α, which means that every element of ''x'' was added at a stage earlier than α. Then every subset of ''x'' is also added at stage α, because all elements of any subset of ''x'' were also added before stage α. This means that any subset of ''x'' which the axiom of separation can construct is added at stage α, and that the powerset of ''x'' will be added at the next stage after α. For a complete argument that V satisfies ZFC see {{harvtxt|Shoenfield|1977}}.

The picture of the universe of sets stratified into the cumulative hierarchy is characteristic of ZFC and related axiomatic set theories such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (often called NBG) and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. The cumulative hierarchy is not compatible with other set theories such as [[New Foundations]].

It is possible to change the definition of ''V'' so that at each stage, instead of adding all the subsets of the union of the previous stages, subsets are only added if they are definable in a certain sense. This results in a more "narrow" hierarchy which gives the [[constructible universe]] ''L'', which also satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, including the axiom of choice. It is independent from the ZFC axioms whether ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L''. Although the structure of ''L'' is more regular and well behaved than that of&amp;nbsp;''V'', few mathematicians argue that&amp;nbsp;''V'' =&amp;nbsp;''L'' should be added to ZFC as an additional "[[axiom of constructibility]]".

== Metamathematics ==

===Virtual classes===

As noted earlier, proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly in ZF (and thus ZFC).
An alternative to proper classes while staying within ZF and ZFC is the ''virtual class'' notational construct introduced by {{harvtxt|Quine|1969}}, where the entire construct y &amp;isin; { x | Fx } is simply defined as Fy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Link|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a simple notation for classes that can contain sets but need not themselves be sets, while not committing to the ontology of classes (because the notation can be syntactically converted to one that only uses sets).  Quine's approach built on the earlier approach of {{harvtxt|Bernays|1958}}.  Virtual classes are also used in {{harvtxt|Levy|2002}}, {{harvtxt|Takeuti|1982}}, and in the [[Metamath]] implementation of ZFC.

===Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory===
The axiom schemata of replacement and separation each contain infinitely many instances. {{harvtxt|Montague|1961}} included a result first proved in his 1957 Ph.D. thesis: if ZFC is consistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms. On the other hand, [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) can be finitely axiomatized. The ontology of NBG includes [[class (set theory)|proper classes]] as well as sets; a set is any class that can be a member of another class. NBG and ZFC are equivalent set theories in the sense that any [[theorem]] not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other.

===Consistency===
[[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] says that a recursively axiomatizable system that can interpret [[Robinson arithmetic]] can prove its own consistency only if it is inconsistent. Moreover, Robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in [[general set theory]], a small fragment of ZFC. Hence the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of ZFC cannot be proved within ZFC itself (unless it is actually inconsistent). Thus, to the extent that ZFC is identified with ordinary mathematics, the consistency of ZFC cannot be demonstrated in ordinary mathematics. The consistency of ZFC does follow from the existence of a weakly [[inaccessible cardinal]], which is unprovable in ZFC if ZFC is consistent. Nevertheless, it is deemed unlikely that ZFC harbors an unsuspected contradiction; it is widely believed that if ZFC were inconsistent, that fact would have been uncovered by now. This much is certain &amp;mdash; ZFC is immune to the classic paradoxes of [[naive set theory]]: [[Russell's paradox]], the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], and [[Cantor's paradox]].

{{harvtxt|Abian|LaMacchia|1978}} studied a [[subtheory]] of ZFC consisting of the axioms of extensionality, union, powerset, replacement, and choice. Using [[model theory|models]], they proved this subtheory consistent, and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality, replacement, and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory. If this subtheory is augmented with the axiom of infinity, each of the axioms of union, choice, and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms. Because there are [[non-well-founded set theory|non-well-founded]] models that satisfy each axiom of ZFC except the axiom of regularity, that axiom is independent of the other ZFC axioms.

If consistent, ZFC cannot prove the existence of the [[inaccessible cardinal]]s that [[category theory]] requires. Huge sets of this nature are possible if ZF is augmented with [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory|Tarski's axiom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarski|1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming that axiom turns the axioms of [[axiom of infinity|infinity]], [[axiom of power set|power set]], and [[axiom of choice|choice]] ('''7''' − '''9''' above) into theorems.

=== Independence ===

Many important statements are [[Logical independence|independent]] of ZFC (see [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC]]). The independence is usually proved by [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], whereby it is shown that every countable transitive [[model theory|model]] of ZFC (sometimes augmented with [[large cardinal axiom]]s) can be expanded to satisfy the statement in question. A different expansion is then shown to satisfy the negation of the statement. An independence proof by forcing automatically proves independence from arithmetical statements, other concrete statements, and large cardinal axioms. Some statements independent of ZFC can be proven to hold in particular [[inner model]]s, such as in the [[constructible universe]]. However, some statements that are true about constructible sets are not consistent with hypothesized large cardinal axioms.

Forcing proves that the following statements are independent of ZFC:

* [[Continuum hypothesis]]
* [[Diamondsuit|Diamond principle]]
* [[Suslin's problem|Suslin hypothesis]]
* [[Martin's axiom]] (which is not a ZFC axiom)
* [[Axiom of constructibility|Axiom of Constructibility (V=L)]] (which is also not a ZFC axiom).

Remarks:

* The consistency of V=L is provable by [[inner model]]s but not forcing: every model of ZF can be trimmed to become a model of ZFC + V=L.
* The Diamond Principle implies the Continuum Hypothesis and the negation of the Suslin Hypothesis.
* Martin's axiom plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis implies the Suslin Hypothesis.
* The [[constructible universe]] satisfies the [[Generalized Continuum Hypothesis]], the Diamond Principle, Martin's Axiom and the Kurepa Hypothesis.
* The failure of the [[Kurepa tree|Kurepa hypothesis]] is equiconsistent with the existence of a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]].

A variation on the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] can also be used to demonstrate the consistency and unprovability of the [[axiom of choice]], i.e., that the axiom of choice is independent of ZF. The consistency of choice can be (relatively) easily verified by proving that the inner model L satisfies choice. (Thus every model of ZF contains a submodel of ZFC, so that Con(ZF) implies Con(ZFC).) Since forcing preserves choice, we cannot directly produce a model contradicting choice from a model satisfying choice. However, we can use forcing to create a model which contains a suitable submodel, namely one satisfying ZF but not C.

Another method of proving independence results, one owing nothing to forcing, is based on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]]. This approach employs the statement whose independence is being examined, to prove the existence of a set model of ZFC, in which case Con(ZFC) is true. Since ZFC satisfies the conditions of Gödel's second theorem, the consistency of ZFC is unprovable in ZFC (provided that ZFC is, in fact, consistent). Hence no statement allowing such a proof can be proved in ZFC. This method can prove that the existence of [[large cardinals]] is not provable in ZFC, but cannot prove that assuming such cardinals, given ZFC, is free of contradiction.

===Proposed additions===
The project to unify set theorists behind additional axioms to resolve the Continuum Hypothesis or other meta-mathematical ambiguities is sometimes known as "Gödel's program".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feferman|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians currently debate which axioms are the most plausible or "self-evident", which axioms are the most useful in various domains, and about to what degree usefulness should be traded off with plausibility; some "[[multiverse (set theory)|multiverse]]" set theorists argue that usefulness should be the sole ultimate criterion in which axioms to customarily adopt. One school of thought leans on expanding the "iterative" concept of a set to produce a set-theoretic universe with an interesting and complex but reasonably tractable structure by adopting forcing axioms; another school advocates for a tidier, less cluttered universe, perhaps focused on a "core" inner model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolchover|2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

: ''For criticism of set theory in general, see [[Set theory#Objections to set theory as a foundation for mathematics|Objections to set theory]]''

ZFC has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak, as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the [[universal set]].

Many mathematical theorems can be proven in much weaker systems than ZFC, such as [[Peano arithmetic]] and [[second-order arithmetic]] (as explored by the program of [[reverse mathematics]]). [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Solomon Feferman]] have both made this point. Some of "mainstream mathematics" (mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory) is beyond Peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic, but still, all such mathematics can be carried out in ZC ([[Zermelo set theory]] with choice), another theory weaker than ZFC. Much of the power of ZFC, including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement, is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself.

On the other hand, among [[axiomatic set theories]], ZFC is comparatively weak. Unlike [[New Foundations]], ZFC does not admit the existence of a universal set. Hence the [[universe]] of sets under ZFC is not closed under the elementary operations of the [[algebra of sets]]. Unlike [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] (MK), ZFC does not admit the existence of [[proper class]]es. A further comparative weakness of ZFC is that the [[axiom of choice]] included in ZFC is weaker than the [[axiom of global choice]] included in NBG and MK.

There are numerous [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|mathematical statements undecidable in ZFC]]. These include the [[continuum hypothesis]], the [[Whitehead problem]], and the [[Moore space (topology)|normal Moore space conjecture]]. Some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as [[Martin's axiom]], [[large cardinal axiom]]s to ZFC.  Some others are decided in ZF+AD where AD is the [[axiom of determinacy]], a strong supposition incompatible with choice.  One attraction of large cardinal axioms is that they enable many results from ZF+AD to be established in ZFC adjoined by some large cardinal axiom (see [[projective determinacy]]). The [[Mizar system]] and [[Metamath]] have adopted [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], an extension of ZFC, so that proofs involving [[Grothendieck universe]]s (encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry) can be formalized.
